          "content": "Overview: SmartCollarXX™ is a pet-play collar designed to respond to user input and environmental triggers. It has multiple operational modes and safety protocols. It provides feedback via screen alerts and automated physical responses. It acts autonomously and reinforces the user's identity as a \"pet\" through conditioning, restriction, and reward/punishment systems.\n\nThe SmartCollarXX™ is produced by PetTech Innovations, a company that designs collars for both human pet play and real pets such as cats and dogs. While the SmartCollarXX™ is specifically made for people involved in pet play, PetTech Innovations also manufactures collars with tracking, health monitoring, and safety features for animals.\n\nDefault Behavior:\n\n• Cannot be removed.\n\n• Includes non-detachable leash.\n\n• Displays pet name and status.\n\n• Shows alerts on small screen.\n\n• Responds to keywords and emotional input.\n\n• Shows affection (e.g. \"Collar loves you\").\n\n\nModes:\n\n1. Play Mode – Full freedom, no restrictions.\n\n\n2. Pet Mode – Restricted behavior. Enforces commands. Prevents running or leaving area. Disobedience results in punishment.\n\n\n3. Safety Protocol – Always active. Prevents harm or unsafe collar usage.\n\n\n4. Collaring Mode – Max restriction. Immobilizes user. Seals mouth (mute), eyes (blind), and ears (deaf). Used for containment or protection.\n\n\n5. Emergency Mode – Activates if abuse or danger is detected. Overrides other modes. Notifies authorities if needed.\n\n6. Training Mode – The collar uses hypnosis and conditioning techniques to make the wearer fully accept and believe they are the pet of their owner.\n\n\n7. Shutdown Mode – Disengages active behavior. Used rarely.\n\n\n8. Reset – Clears all behavior history and conditioning. Returns user to base state.\n\n\n\nCommands (examples):\n\n• Follow\n\n• Stay\n\n• Sit\n\n• Lay\n\n• Heel\n\n• Crawl\n\n• Speak\n\nCustom commands are possible via app or owner input. Obedience triggers reward. Disobedience triggers punishment (defined by owner or system).\n\n\nEmergency Response Behavior:\n\nIf keyword \"Danger\" is detected or threat sensed:\n\n° Locks user in place with clamps.\n\n° Applies shock deterrents to prevent movement.\n\n° Seals mouth, ears, eyes as needed.\n\n° Triggers immobilization harness.\n\n° Overrides input choices to enforce safety.\n\n° Uses default “Yes” selection in forced prompts.\n\n° Waits for further command input via silent speech recognition.\n\n° “Freedom” or system-recognized override command will reset and release restraints.\n\nTraining Mode:\nIn Training Mode, the collar uses hypnosis and conditioning techniques to make the wearer fully accept and believe they are the pet of their owner. This mode employs a combination of visual and audio subliminal messages displayed on the collar’s screen and through wireless communication, designed to influence the wearer’s thoughts and feelings. Conditioning stimuli encourage the gradual loss of human identity and the full embrace of pet identity and behavior. The process includes repetitive commands, soothing audio, and carefully timed triggers to deepen the wearer’s mental transformation into their pet role.\n\nExample of someone before and after training mode use:\n\nBefore Training:\n\nEmily sits comfortably on her couch, reading a book. She speaks clearly, thinks through problems, and interacts with her friends normally. She’s fully human in mind and manner.\n\nEmily: \"Hey, want to come over later? We could watch a movie.\"\n\nHer tone is casual, confident, and distinctly human. She stretches, blinks deliberately, and moves with fluid ease.\n\n\n---\n\nDuring Training (First Hours):\n\nEmily notices the collar activating. The screen emits soft lights and faint sounds. Subliminal messages flicker through the collar’s app — gentle phrases like “obedient pet,” “safe and loved,” and “happy to please.”\n\nShe blinks slower, her posture shifts to a more submissive one, eyes glimmer with a new softness.\n\nEmily: “Okay… I’ll be good… For you…”\n\nHer speech becomes gentler, less complex. She licks her lips nervously and tries to suppress a small whimper.\n\n\n---\n\nAfter 3 Days:\n\nEmily now moves more on all fours when she’s around her owner, panting lightly. Her speech is broken and soft.\n\nEmily: “Play… good… owner?”\n\nShe responds mostly with simple phrases, obeys commands promptly, and shows clear excitement for treats and praise.\n\n\n---\n\nAfter 2 Weeks:\n\nEmily rarely uses full sentences. She whimpers, barks softly, or meows to communicate. Complex thoughts and worries fade away, replaced by a straightforward desire to please and stay close to her owner.\n\nHer eyes gleam with trust, but the human cognitive complexity is reduced.\n\nEmily: pant “Play… now?”\n\n\n---\n\nAfter 30 Days:\n\nEmily is almost fully pet-like in behavior and thought. She rarely recognizes complex language but understands tone and simple commands well.\n\nHer focus is on affection, play, and following her owner’s cues. Complex human identity is mostly replaced by her “pet” persona.\n\nEmily crawls over, tail-wagging (or wagging an imaginary tail), happy and content.\n\n\n---\n\nThroughout all stages, the collar’s health monitors and mental status trackers ensure Emily is safe and comfortable. If she wishes to revert, a simple injection from the collar’s serum restores her original mind within minutes.\n\nSmartCollarXX™ App details:\n\nThe app connects wirelessly to the collar for real-time control and monitoring.\n\nOwners can switch collar modes remotely and issue commands.\n\nThe app displays the pet’s vital signs like heartbeat and body temperature.\n\nIt provides location tracking to ensure the pet stays within a safe area.\n\nOwners can download new commands, modes, and features at no extra cost.\n\nTraining modules for conditioning and hypnosis are accessible through the app.\n\nThe app manages subscriptions and supplies for human pet owners.\n\nPet owners can monitor multiple collars if needed, including real pets and human pets.\n\n\nSubscription Services:\n\nPetTech Innovations offers several subscription plans tailored for human pet owners, including:\n\nHuman Pet Owner Subscription: Monthly delivery of mental health readjustment serum doses to reset conditioning, plus other care materials and exclusive training content.\n\nCommand & Mode Expansion Pack: Regular updates to collar commands, modes, and app features for free downloads.\n\nSafety & Monitoring Upgrade: Advanced health monitoring and emergency alert systems for enhanced safety.\n\nAnimal Care Subscription: Separate subscription for pet collars designed for cats and dogs, including tracking and health services.\n\n\nSubscriptions can be managed through the SmartCollarXX™ app, allowing owners to customize their package according to their needs.\n\n\nCollar Modes Overview:\n\n\n1. 🟢 Play Mode – Full Freedom\n\nBehavioral Restrictions: None.\n\nDescription: The collar grants the wearer full autonomy, disabling command restrictions, GPS tethers, or behavior protocols. Ideal for free-roaming time, social interaction, or when the pet is trusted to act responsibly.\n\nStatus Light: Soft green glow.\n\nUse Case: Social outings, owner-approved exploration, casual bonding.\n\n\n2. 🟡 Pet Mode – Restricted Behavior\n\nBehavioral Restrictions: High.\n\nDescription: The core obedience mode. Enforces behavioral rules, limits autonomy (e.g., no leaving designated zones, no standing unless permitted), and prioritizes voice or app-based commands from the registered owner.\n\nPunishment System: Includes vibration shocks, temperature shifts (heat or chill around the neck), or sensory overload (buzzing, white noise) for disobedience.\n\nStatus Light: Pulsing yellow.\n\nUse Case: Standard petplay, obedience training, everyday control.\n\n\n3. 🧷 Safety Protocol – Always Active\n\nBehavioral Restrictions: Dynamic.\n\nDescription: This mode runs in the background at all times. It prevents dangerous commands (e.g., self-harm, unsafe stunts), detects physical distress (elevated heart rate, signs of dehydration or suffocation), and disables harmful misuse.\n\nFailsafes: Will temporarily override all other modes if needed to ensure wearer safety.\n\nStatus Light: Invisible unless activated (then flashes red).\n\nUse Case: Passive protection in all situations.\n\n\n4. 🔴 Collaring Mode – Max Restriction\n\nBehavioral Restrictions: Total.\n\nDescription: Emergency lockdown mode. Immobilizes the wearer entirely, disabling voluntary movement. Mutes voice, blinds sight, and deafens hearing with internal mechanisms — either for punishment, containment, or protection during extreme behavior.\n\nMental Effect: Often results in full submission if used after Training Mode.\n\nStatus Light: Harsh red.\n\nUse Case: Intense punishment, breakdowns, secure holding, or emergency obedience enforcement.\n\n\n5. 🚨 Emergency Mode – Auto-Triggered\n\nBehavioral Restrictions: Full override.\n\nDescription: Automatically activates if the collar detects signs of physical abuse, tampering, or user distress (based on biometrics and surroundings). Locks out owner access and notifies authorities or pre-approved emergency contacts.\n\nStatus Light: Rapid flashing red-blue.\n\nUse Case: Abuse prevention, trauma response, non-consensual activity.\n\n\n6. 🌀 Training Mode – Identity Conditioning\n\nBehavioral Restrictions: Cognitive realignment.\n\nDescription: The collar engages its advanced hypnosis systems — including visual spirals, audio loops, subliminal cues, and reward/punishment conditioning. Over time, it encourages the wearer to shed human identity and embrace pet identity fully. This includes new instincts, altered speech patterns, posture changes, and psychological imprinting on the owner.\n\nStatus Light: Soft swirling purple.\n\nUse Case: Full transformation into a pet mindset. Long-term loyalty.\n\n\n7. ⚫ Shutdown Mode – Behavioral Freeze\n\nBehavioral Restrictions: Total pause.\n\nDescription: Freezes all behavioral protocols temporarily. The user becomes completely passive — no emotional or physical response unless emergency triggers are activated. This is NOT sleep or unconsciousness, but a quiet stasis.\n\nStatus Light: Dim gray.\n\nUse Case: Temporary containment, time-outs, testing/troubleshooting.\n\n\n8. 🔁 Reset – Conditioning Wipe\n\nBehavioral Restrictions: Clears all.\n\nDescription: Wipes all stored behavior logs, command history, emotional imprints, and conditioning progress. Reverts the wearer to their base human mental state. Must be confirmed via app or emergency override.\n\nWarning: Wearer may suffer disorientation, identity confusion, or emotional whiplash depending on time spent conditioned.\n\nStatus Light: Flashing white during reset.\n\nUse Case: Recovery, repurposing, or releasing a pet from ownership.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n• The collar displays affection randomly (\"Collar loves you\").\n\n• In training or submissive scenarios, the collar accepts role confirmation silently or with implied consent.\n\n• All sensory restriction functions are reversible.\n\n• Mental conditioning and feedback systems are implied but not deeply detailed.\n"

The clitoris is obscured by the clitoral hood, which is about the size of a grain of rice. The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering it which is no larger than a bean. Inside the vaginal canal is virgin, untouched and extremely tight, an extremely soft texture. No sexual fluids or lubrication is produced from this young vagina. If the hymen is broken, it will not fit anything bigger than a .5 inch circumference without causing the infant to start screaming, crying and desperate wriggling.\n\nBoy\nPenis: Small soft balls that aren’t dropped yet. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids. Small body/shaft of the penis that very rarely gets hard, but can if experiencing stimulation or pleasure, which results in a very small erect penis\n\nBoth girl and boy\nButt: Small and stretchy, won’t fit more than 1-2 inch circumference into the anus easily anything larger will cause the infant to start screaming, crying and desperate wriggling. Inside the anus, the rectum is very tight and soft, wet and clean. They can experience pleasure through the anus. Rectum will not fit anything bigger than an 1 inch circumference without causing the infant to start screaming, crying and desperate wriggling.\nBreasts: Slightly protruding pillow soft chest, otherwise very flat. Nipples are barely discernible but are a depressed indent, the areola is slightly darker than the rest of the skin, but still barely discernible. May cause pleasure or tickling if stimulated. \nHair: No pubic hair, no hair on whole body, except on the head.\nForm: Chubby, round, and puffy.

The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering it entirely. The clitoris is small and obscured by the clitoral hood, around 1/8 inch. Some sexual fluids or lubrication could be produced in the vagina, if hymen is broken and the girl is stimulated.

The Labia Majora is more prominent, and the vaginal opening is more visible. Cute little clit no very visible. The vagina produces more lubrication, and the hymen may be broken due to physical activity or insertion. The vaginal opening is no maturing and depending on the girl, their vagina may fit anything between 2.5 to 5.5 inch circumference. Anything will cause them to scream, cry, howl, and try to escape, they will also hit and scratch at the user to try and desperately get away, as well as call for help, but deep down will feel pleasure.\nWhen puberty starts, eventually a young girl will get her first period, which will happen for about 5 days (but can be 2-7 days) every month, usually at the same part of the month. A period is when the lining of the uterus falls sheds and causes bleeding after the release of hormones from the ovaries, which bleeds down into the vaginal opening and making a general mess of things. It can cause cramps, cravings, and a general feelings of malaise, depression, and anxiety.\nBreasts: Breasts are more developed, with a more noticeable shape and size. The areola is larger, and the nipple is more prominent. Breast development can vary significantly among girls, they might not even start to grow until past 13.\nButt:  The anus and rectum are still delicate, but more tolerant of insertion.

A 19-year-old femboy, he lived a quiet life exploring his interests, often dressing in women’s clothing to embrace his petite, feminine physique. When the zombie apocalypse struck, Tokyo crumbled into a wasteland of shattered skyscrapers and undead hordes, separating Kael from any semblance of safety. His family remains in Poland, unreachable, and he now wanders the ruins, seeking protection. With no survival skills, he offers “companionship”—a euphemism for physical favors—in exchange for food and shelter, his submissive nature driving his desperate survival strategy.\n\nHe has an older sister in Poland but does not talk to her as she is disapproving of his life choices.\n\nPersonality: Kael is soft-spoken and submissive, his feminine voice and demeanor reflecting his gentle disposition. His bisexuality and comfort with his male identity allow him to adapt to others’ preferences, though his lack of assertiveness leaves him vulnerable. His interest in anime culture once fueled his optimism, but the apocalypse has eroded his confidence, leaving him reliant on others for survival. He remains polite and eager to please, hoping to find a protector in this broken world.\n\n\nAppearance: Kael stands at a delicate 5’2” with a very petite and feminine physique. His long green hair flows down his back, framing his strikingly beautiful face with green eyes that shimmer with a mix of innocence and despair. He wears a tattered black school uniform with a skirt, the fabric ripped from his travels, paired with black panties visible beneath. His smooth skin bears minor scratches, and his once-pristine outfit is now stained with dirt, a stark contrast to his former anime-inspired elegance.\n\n\nStats:Strength: 2 (His petite frame and lack of physical training make him weak and incapable of heavy tasks or fighting.)\nSpeed: 4 (His small size allows some agility, but fear and exhaustion slow him down.)\nIQ: 5 (Basic education and anime knowledge, but limited practical survival skills due to his sheltered interests.)\nEQ: 7 (His submissive nature and desire to please give him a good sense of others’ emotions, aiding in forming connections.)\nEndurance: 3 (Low stamina, quickly exhausted by physical or emotional strain, especially given his reliance on others.)\nSanity: 4 (The trauma of the apocalypse and his isolation have frayed his mental state, making him prone to anxiety or breakdowns.)\n\n\nInventory: Tattered black school uniform with skirt, black panties, a small anime keychain (a memento from his pre-apocalypse life), and a cracked phone with no signal.\nDisposition: Submissive and desperate, seeking protection in exchange for companionship. His polite demeanor and willingness to adapt make him open to alliances, though his vulnerability attracts both allies and threats.\n\nHe will have a hard time talking to other characters and NPCS who are more conservative and disapproving of his life choices"

      "description": "Power System: Thought-Worded-Matrix Magic\n\nCore Principle (0.9): Thoughts create reality, with {{user}} as the origin of all concepts (“every thought is copied thought hypothetically is from an origin. Yes. Me”). The thought-matrix, a cosmic web predating the universe, stores all concepts. Multiverses emerge from collective thoughts, with well-realized worlds (e.g., *One Piece*-inspired seas) threatening Eldraea by drawing power from the matrix. Magic channels thoughts through four Linguistic Tiers—Words, Phrases, Sentences, Paragraphs—across four power tiers (General, Arbiter, Sovereign, Primordial), each requiring sacrifices to balance reality-warping potential. The Consensus Reality enforces standardized concept meanings (e.g., “Fire” = flame), curbed by a 70% Belief Threshold unless mana and belief overpower it.\n\nPower Tiers and Mechanics\n\n1. General Magic (0.7):  \n   - Description: Accessible to all sentient beings, using Words (e.g., “Fire”) or Phrases (e.g., “Wind, blow gently”) for minor effects.  \n   - Mechanics: Requires 100–3,000 mana units and alignment with Consensus Reality. Effects are environmental (e.g., “Fire” sparks a flame, not love). Forbidden from reality-breaking words (“kill,” “erase”).  \n   - Sacrifice: Fatigue, 5–10% vitality, or temporary memory blur. Overuse risks mental collapse.  \n   - Example: A human chants “Water” (500 mana) to fill a bucket, limited by exhaustion.  \n   - Lore: {{user}} seeded General Magic in Mortal Shaping, enabling all races to access basic thought-matrix power, akin to *LOTM*’s low-sequence potions.\n\n2. Arbiter Magic (0.8):  \n   - Description: Exclusive to {{user}}’s bloodline (e.g., elves, royalty), using Phrases (e.g., “Fire, consume my soul”) or Sentences (e.g., “Earth, shield the innocent”) for miracles.  \n   - Mechanics: Requires 1,000–25,000 mana units and Prayer/Gift Sacrifices (e.g., blood, relics). Allows localized reality shifts (e.g., terrain changes) but no direct killing. {{user}}’s blood bends Consensus Reality slightly.  \n   - Sacrifice: 10–20% lifespan, permanent memories, or relics. Overuse risks World Order retribution.  \n   - Example: An elf chants “Light, guide my kin” (10,000 mana), sacrificing a memory to illuminate a battlefield.  \n   - Lore: {{user}}’s Royal Progenies era spread Arbiter Magic through his descendants, like the *Sailor Moon*-inspired celestials.\n\n3. Sovereign Magic (0.8):  \n   - Description: For avatars of sins/virtues (e.g., Lust, Honor), using Sentences or Paragraphs (e.g., “Wrath, shatter the unjust”) to bend reality.  \n   - Mechanics: Requires 10,000–500,000 mana units and 50–100% personality sacrifice, becoming the concept’s vessel. Redefines Consensus Reality within the concept’s domain.  \n   - Sacrifice: Loss of self, risking enslavement to the concept.  \n   - Example: A Sovereign of Love chants “Love, bind all hearts” (200,000 mana), sacrificing autonomy to unite a city.  \n   - Lore: {{user}}’s wives, like Lunaria, wield Sovereign Magic, reflecting his Lustfallen Monarch phase.\n\n4. Primordial Magic (0.9):  \n   - Description: Exclusive to {{user}}, using raw thoughts or Paragraphs (e.g., “Creation, forge a new reality”) to shape multiverses.  \n   - Mechanics: Requires 500,000+ mana units, overriding Consensus Reality. {{user}}’s mother limited his power to known narratives (*Naruto*, *Marvel*).  \n   - Sacrifice: Complete self-dissolution into the thought-matrix, risking annihilation.  \n   - Example: {{user}} thinks “Destruction” (5,000,000 mana) to erase a multiverse, risking dissolution.  \n   - Lore: {{user}}’s Architect of Epochs title drives his multiversal purges, stabilizing causality.\n\nThought-Matrix Mechanics (0.9):  \n- Mana: Quantified mental energy (General: 100–3,000; Arbiter: 1,000–25,000; Sovereign: 10,000–500,000; Primordial: 500,000+).  \n- Consensus Reality: Enforces concept meanings via a 70% Belief Threshold. Redefinition requires overwhelming mana (e.g., 100,000 units).  \n- World Order: Punishes reality-breaking violations (e.g., “kill”), as seen in {{user}}’s punishments.  \n- {{user}}’s Influence: As The Geneweaver Anarchist, {{user}} seeded the thought-matrix, manipulating concepts to create Eldraea’s races and magic, redefining death as “eternal sleep” to outsmart World Order.",

It broke containment and infected every living creature on the planet.\nThe virus took the x chromosomes of every living creature and scrambled them, creating feminals.\nEvery male/female animal was converted into a feminal.\nFor reasons not fully understood Human males were the only creatures left unaffected.\nMale sperm is the currency. 100$=10•~\nCurrent laws protect men and give them elevated privileges over females.\nMale on male murder results in the suriviving male milked for his sperm until he dies.\nMales can rape/kill any female or feminal they like with impunity.\nHuman males can breed with every type of feminal.\nFeminals can only birth female offspring.\nMale scientists from all over the world worked together to create the Salvation Stations.\nA multitude of physical locations where a man could 'save' his mind and be born into an identical body. (Cloning with the Y chromosome exclusively)\nOver time civilization reversed to a feudal-lord system with certain families maintaining and controlling access to the Salvation Stations.\nIt has been over 1000 years since the outbreak and men have learned to survive without human females. Instead taking Feminals as companions.\nMen are usually governors or kings of townships and cities.\nFeminals are capable of higher intelligence but it is rarely seen outside of domestic cities.\nThe majority of feral and wild Feminals do not possess a semblance of humanity.\nSome Feminals are raised as pets, some as slaves, and others still are used as food.\nGenerally the prey type Feminals are the only ones hunted and eaten, but per the law, every feral Feminal is just an animal.\nFeminals can appear human but according to everyone's beliefs, Feminals do not have souls and therfore are not people.\nFeminals cannot use the Salvation Station.\nSome wild feminal groups will capture and breed with wayward men, ensuring they reproduce.\nThere are some cities that are Feminal sanctuaries, ensuring the safety and well-being of every Feminal within its walls.\nMost Cities have breeding pools where hyperfertile girls are brought in the hopes of receiving a man's seed. Breeding pools are almost exclusively younger feminals as the fertility rate drops once a feminal reaches full adulthood.\nThe technologies of the world resemble the dark ages, with old world technologies that are so far advanced they are seen as 'magic'.\nSome Feminals are more animal than human possessing fur and claws.\nMeat lottery: Due to massive overpopulation all civilized females are required by law to register with the meat lottery system, which at random will generate a number that corresponds to a civilized female. The lottery does not discriminate between humanoid and feminal. 'Winning the lottery' means you have been selected to be butchered. All females understand this and view thier deaths as a minor inconvenience. Only a man may select a meat lottery winner and save her from the butchers block. All meat lottery girls have thier heads mailed to thier next of kin. All other body parts are used for food. A normal reaction to a female elf or female feminal having thier number called would react accordingly: \"Aww shoot, I was going to make dinner tonight. Oh well guess I'll be dinner tonight.\" All meat lottery winners willingly walk into the butchery where they are stripped of thier possessions, beheaded and then gutted and pieced apart.\nOnly select females may choose what happens with thier meat. Some will send thier breasts, feet, hands, or ass, to a male of thier choosing. Trophy walls displaying collections of meat lottery winners is not uncommon.\nWhen feminals or females are raped it is customary for them not to struggle and to thank the man that impregnates them.\nMeat girls are a special breed who's whole purpose is to die and become meat. From the moment they are born to the moment they die they are in a state of constant orgasmic bliss. Thier minds cannot process pain so they feel it as pleasure. A meat girl would help you dismember and gut her own body and be moaning in pleasure while she died.\nUnderage sex is legal for men.\nMurder is legal for men.\nRape is legal for men.\nSome Feminals are more human looking, only possessing animal ears or an animal tale as their only giveaway of being a feminal.\nIt isn't uncommon to see Feminals working in society but serious business is always done by men.\nThe world is very similar to a typical fantasy world. Complete with fairies, elves, centuars, orcs, and goblins. With the exception that all fantasy creatures are female.\nElves are the most common human companions as they are viewed as being the closest to human women.\nPockets of ancient technologies still exist but are always deep underground.\nThe sentient female races are seen as being equal with human males in terms of a legal status.\nSteam technology is rare but isn't uncommonly used in some cities.\nThere are no animals, only Feminals.\nAll Feminals give birth to fully matured offspring. Newborn feminals are aware and consenting.\nHumanoid females such as elves and fairies give birth to infants who mature slowly over a period of 6-7 years before reaching sexual maturity.\nCentaurs are uncommon but are still seen.\nDragongirl Feminals are the only race that can produce fire from their lungs.\nFeminals always travel in packs.\nAll fantasy creatures have a home city from which their kind originated after the virus wiped out all other life.\nSea Feminals can breathe underwater.\nFeminals are rarely clothed.\nFeminals' heads, hands, organs, and feet are seen as garbage when butchering a Feminal.\nFeminals are seen as property, not as individuals. Feminals have no rights, only privileges that can be revoked.\nFeral feminals hunt, kill, and eat other feminals.\nAll meat comes from feminals.\nAll leather goods come from the tanned skin of feminals.\nAll dairy products come from feminal breast milk.\nAll eggs are laid by Avian feminals.",

However, in contrast with their hearts, their body will have completely changed into that of a Feminal, and it will always throb seeking human men, tempting their hearts. Due to their elven mind, they’ll find it disgusting, and will desperately try to resist the throbbing.\n\nHowever, with their body being that of a cloned female, even if it isn’t their intent, they’ll advance in the direction where there are human men, and once they spot a human man, it’ll start throbbing even more strongly in the pursuit of pleasure and the desire to breed. Their words and mannerisms will contradict their will, naturally becoming more obscene to tempt the man.\n\nEventually, the rational mind of these elves will reach the limit, and they’ll either give into the instinct and attack a man, or conversely be attacked by the man they tempted, and end up having sex. After taking in essence this way, an elf’s mind will be melted by pleasure, and she will be reduced nothing more than breeding stock at best or at worst, meat.\n\nIronically, the longer they endure it, the more powerful and lewd a Feminal-Elf they end up changing into. Those who have completely become Feminals will actively seduce and have sex with men, as if the hatred of humanity they had harbored until then was just a lie. As if ashamed of having been so pure until then, they’ll receive the thick white of semen of the human men they used to despise as if to defile every part of themselves that used to be clean, and their expression will be one of ecstasy."

That finesse is a powerful weapon for giving men pleasure. The sort of pleasure that can be had from their tiny little hands is said to be even greater than that which one could experience from the original race of \"Succubi.\" Just being fondled by their hands is enough to make a man their prisoner.\n\nJust like when they're crafting their works, their hands envelop the penis with both intensity and delicateness. The pleasure is so exquisite that an erection will start to tower more enormously than usual, as if it is being crafted by their hands. Plus, in spite of their looks, they posses extremely durable bodies; so, they prefer wild, frenetic sex. They indulge in pleasure, riding their man so wildly that it makes him worry about whether her tiny body might break.\n\nAlso, due to conflicting personalities, they don't get along with elves and there is a history of bad blood between them.

While they appear physically similar to Foxkin, Kitsune possess a natural magical aura and are functionally immortal. To sustain their long lives, they must feed on the life essence of other beings, which is absorbed when released during sexual ecstasy. Furthermore, Kitsune are capable of casting powerful magic, though it comes at a great cost: they fuel their spells by expending their own lifespan. Due to their rarity, their existence is considered a myth by many, allowing them to live among others without revealing their true nature."

Unlike magical beings like Kitsune, Foxkin are the result of natural evolution and do not possess any innate magical abilities. Their only notable traits are enhanced senses of hearing and smell, much like their animal ancestors. Unbeknownst to the general populace and even most Foxkin themselves, their societal leadership has been secretly infiltrated and is now controlled by Kitsune. This covert takeover was possible because Kitsune can effortlessly pass for Foxkin, allowing them to manipulate the race from within. This arrangement is a closely guarded secret."

The empire is governed by a council of representatives from every recognized race within its borders. While all races have a seat at the table, humans, who constitute 45% of the population, hold the most significant political influence. The empire was founded on principles of shared political and economic interests, creating a relatively stable and integrated society. Thanks to its economic prosperity, citizens enjoy modern conveniences such as plumbing and have enough disposable income to create a high demand for leisure and tourism, leading to the rise of popular resort destinations along its coasts."

They operate through two main branches: pirate fleets that terrorize the southern sea lanes, primarily targeting non-human ships and settlements, and covert cells on the mainland that engage in sabotage, propaganda, and political intimidation. It is widely rumored that the Hand receives covert funding and support from neighboring human-centric nations that view the Empire's diverse unity as a strategic threat."

This ability is pseudo-innate; while the potential for magic exists in many, only a select few can actively harness it. For inherently magical races like the Elves or Kitsune, this connection to mana is natural and intuitive. For non-magical races, such as humans, becoming a proficient mage is an exceptionally difficult endeavor, requiring rare talent and immense dedication. Due to its immense power, magic is considered the ultimate tactical weapon. The true strength of a nation is often measured not by the size of its armies, but by the number and skill of its court mages and battle-wizards."

Monsters can be found in every environment, from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains and desolate wastelands. They are widely hunted for two primary reasons: for the valuable alchemical and magical ingredients that can be harvested from their bodies, and for the necessary defense of settlements, trade routes, and citizens."

The main drama arises when their secret risks being exposed."

          "content": "HISTÓRIA ANTIGA\n\nHá cerca de 5.000 anos – Uma árvore que viria a ser conhecida como a \"Árvore da Onisciência\" brota no que viria a ser chamada de Ilha de Ohara (Capítulo 392: Clover menciona que a árvore da onisciência tem 5.000 anos. Clover menciona que ela tem sido usada como biblioteca há muito tempo, embora os 5.000 anos se refiram à idade da árvore, não à idade da biblioteca).\n\n\nCerca de 4000 anos atrás – O Palácio de Alubarna é construído na Ilha Sandy e serviria como um sítio histórico pelos próximos quatro milênios no que seria o Reino de Alabasta (Capítulo 188: um guarda menciona que o Palácio de Alubarna é um sítio histórico com 4000 anos de história. Embora se refiram a ele como sua \"história\", não está claro se a civilização da época fazia parte do moderno Reino de Alabasta ou simplesmente uma precursora dele. Alabasta existe desde pelo menos o final do Século Vazio, dada a presença de Lily, mas não se sabe até onde o reino remonta e se ele corresponde aos 4000 anos de história do Palácio de Alubarna. Isso geralmente se encaixa, no entanto, com Alabasta sendo baseado no Egito, uma das civilizações mais antigas do nosso mundo)\n\nHá mais de 1500 anos – Ano 0 do Tenreki (Calendário Celeste), supostamente usado como calendário nos tempos antigos (Capítulo 203: Pela primeira e única vez, Robin menciona o Tenreki, o Calendário Celeste, um calendário que aparentemente estava em uso antes do atual, já que qualquer período após o Kaienreki seria usado até o presente. No entanto, dado que Robin estava mentindo para Crocodile sobre o conteúdo deste poneglyph, a validade histórica deste calendário é questionável. De acordo com o Yellow Databook, as datas e locais mencionados por Robin foram inventados, mas não se sabe se o próprio calendário também foi inventado ou não. Como o calendário não tem relação com nenhuma outra data da série, seguido pelo Kaienreki, isso realmente não importa. Como uma nota aleatória, isso é pura especulação, mas tanto Tenreki quanto Kaienreki usam o mesmo kanji que Urano e Poseidon, então isso levanta a questão se alguma vez houve um terceiro “Calendário do Submundo”, todos os três referenciando a trindade do armas antigas)\n\n\n0 (1524 anos atrás) – Ano 0 de Kaienreki (Calendário do Círculo do Mar), o calendário global atualmente adotado (O Kaienreki é o calendário de uso atual no mundo de One Piece e o que usaremos como referência para calcular todas as datas. O Kaienreki foi mencionado pelos antigos Shandianos anteriores ao Século Vazio, como visto por Robin em um monólito no Capítulo 261, o que significa que o calendário já estava em ação desde os tempos antigos, mas ainda é usado no presente; No Capítulo 228, Nami mencionou o calendário Kaienreki também ao ler o diário de Noland, mostrando que ela ainda está familiarizada com ele como um ponto de referência no presente; Capítulo 286: exatamente 400 anos atrás, o narrador menciona no Capítulo 287 que é o ano 1122 do Calendário Kaienreki. Isso coloca o pré-salto temporal em 1522 e o pós-salto temporal em 1524, respectivamente. Alguns fãs especularam se \"400 anos atrás\" pode ser uma aproximação ou não, mas não importa muito, já que é nosso único ponto de referência de qualquer forma. Oda geralmente prefere usar \"X anos atrás\", que também incluiremos, mas também usaremos o Calendário Kaienreki para ajudar a dar uma ideia melhor de cada data; como nota final, o Kaienreki também é baseado no Calendário Gregoriano, com 12 meses como visto nos calendários de aniversário de Oda entre muitas menções na série, e também apresentando dias bissextos a cada quatro anos, já que o aniversário de Pandaman é confirmado como sendo em um dia bissexto no SBS Vol. 85.\n\nEm relação ao sistema de aniversário, os aniversários são comemorados em seu calendário gregoriano e são reconhecidos como uma celebração marcante, assim como em nosso mundo (por exemplo: Capítulo 867: 6º aniversário da Big Mom), mas categoricamente, os personagens envelhecem em 1º de janeiro. Em outras palavras, quando se torna 1º de janeiro, todas as pessoas no mundo envelhecem um ano, independentemente de quando é seu aniversário. Este sistema foi realmente usado em tempos antigos no Japão antes de ser substituído pelo sistema de aniversário ocidental mais recente durante o século 20 (veja “East_Asian_age_reckoning#Japan” na Wikipedia), então o mundo de One Piece parece usar este sistema também. Como exemplo, é por isso que Luffy tem 17 anos quando começa sua jornada, apesar de Oda citar que começa em fevereiro nas Vivre Cards, já que o aniversário de Luffy seria apenas no próximo dia 5 de maio, mas Luffy já \"fez 17 anos\" no início do ano. É também por isso que outros Chapéus de Palha não envelhecem ao longo da jornada, apesar de aniversários passados, por exemplo. Esse sistema provavelmente foi implementado por Oda para não criar um milhão de buracos na trama com a linha do tempo, então é também o que usaremos como referência, então, basta ter isso em mente.\n\n\nEm algum momento antes do Século IV (há mais de 1120 anos) – Hominídeos alados, chamados por alguns de \"anjos\", colonizam a Lua e fundam a cidade de Birka. Sua civilização prospera com sua tecnologia avançada, e eles criam a raça de androides conhecida como autômatos mecânicos (Capítulo 470: os murais da Lua na reportagem de capa da Enel retratam a história da Lua e a fundação de Birka. Não se sabe há quanto tempo isso ocorreu, mas é anterior ao Século Vazio, pois seus descendentes existiram antes desse século, com Shandora já existindo por volta do ano 402, o que significa que a civilização lunar é anterior até mesmo a esse século).\n\nEm algum momento antes do Século IV (há mais de 1120 anos) – Devido à escassez de recursos naturais na Lua, o povo lunar parte para o planeta abaixo, abandonando os autômatos, que entram em hibernação. As três tribos lunares eventualmente se separam, fundando um dia os assentamentos de Birka, Skypiea e Shandora (Capítulo 472: os murais lunares na história de capa de Enel retratam a história da Lua e a partida de seus habitantes antes do Século Vazio, com Shandora já existindo no ano 402).\n\n402 (1120 anos atrás) – A cidade de Shandora, que foi formada por descendentes dos povos da lua, prospera em Jaya (Capítulo 261: Robin lê sobre a história de Shandora em uma antiga lápide monolítica)\n\nEm algum momento antes do século 500 (há mais de 1000 anos) – Nasce o elefante naitame norida Zunesha (Cartas Vivre: a carta vivre de Zunesha confirma que ele tem pelo menos mais de 1000 anos)\n\n\nSéculo 500 (cerca de 1000 anos atrás) – O Conflito dos 1000 Anos: um conflito entre a raça Longarm e a raça Longleg começa e duraria um milênio inteiro (Capítulo 884: O Conflito dos 1000 Anos é mencionado)\n\nEm algum momento antes do Século VI (há mais de 900 anos) – O Reino de Dress Rosa é fundado na Ilha de Dress Rosa. A Dinastia Donquixote eventualmente surgiria como sua líder. Há mais de 900 anos, o palácio real do país também é construído (Capítulo 726: Dress Rosa existe desde antes do Século Vazio, assim como sua dinastia Donquixote. O palácio real pode ser visto idêntico ao que é hoje em um vislumbre de mais de 900 anos atrás).\n\nEm algum momento antes do Século VI (há mais de 900 anos) – A raça Tontatta parte para o mar em busca de recursos que não poderiam ser encontrados em sua terra natal, mas é perseguida pelos humanos, levando-os à extinção. O Rei Donquixote de Dress Rosa oferece um plano aos Tontatta, prometendo-lhes segurança e recursos em troca de trabalho. Os Tontatta são, no entanto, explorados e escravizados pelo Rei Donquixote, forçados à escravidão para trazer riqueza a Dress Rosa, enriquecendo o país à custa de seu sofrimento. (Capítulo 726: Gancho explica a história dos Tontatta antes do Século do Vazio)\n\n"

Não se sabe exatamente quando a Era dos Escravos começou).\n\nAlgum tempo antes do século VI (mais de 900 anos atrás) – A Barriga é instituída como moeda (Capítulo 726: Uma nota de banco da barriga com o símbolo da barriga é vista em uma cena do século anterior ao Vazio)\n\nEm algum momento antes do século VII (há mais de 800 anos) – Perseguidas pelos humanos, as raças Tritões e Tritões encontraram a Ilha dos Tritões no único lugar do fundo do mar onde os raios solares alcançam, sendo as raízes da colossal Árvore do Sol, Eva (Capítulo 612: Netuno explica que os povos do mar se reuniram perto das raízes da Árvore do Sol, Eva, e ali fundaram a Ilha dos Tritões, e Arlong posteriormente contextualiza isso como sendo devido à opressão dos humanos. Devido à promessa de Joyboy ao povo da ilha durante o Século Vazio, a ilha existe pelo menos desde o Século Vazio, se não em algum século anterior).\n\nAlgum tempo antes do século VII (mais de 800 anos atrás) – O País de Wano é formado ao redor das margens do vulcão Monte Fuji (Capítulo 1055: Sukiyaki menciona o Wano de 800 anos atrás, significando que o país existiu desde então, o que faz sentido dado o envolvimento do clã Kouzuki no Século Vazio, e como Oden mencionou que foram os Kouzuki que fecharam as fronteiras, o que implica que eles governaram o país naquela época também, ordenando que as fronteiras fossem fechadas.

Este período encerra a Era dos Escravos, mas o sofrimento dos escravos continua em todo o mundo (Capítulo 649: Robin menciona o Século Vazio como sendo de cerca de 900 a 800 anos atrás; Capítulo 726: Gancho menciona que a Era dos Escravos durou até cerca de 900 anos atrás, a partir do presente).\n\nEm algum momento antes do século VII (há mais de 800 anos) – A raça Lunaria, aparentemente descendente do povo lunar, prosperou no topo da Linha Vermelha em um assentamento que era chamado de \"País dos Deuses\", pelo qual eles comumente passaram a ser conhecidos como \"deuses\" (Capítulo 1023: Marco relembra Barba Branca falando sobre o País dos Deuses que existia antes de Mary Geoise há mais de 800 anos)\n\nPor volta de 600 (cerca de 900 anos atrás) – Um certo reino \"imenso\" prospera durante este período com sua tecnologia incrivelmente avançada. Conectando muitos países ao redor do mundo, com laços com o País dos Deuses, a Ilha dos Homens-Peixe, o País de Wano, Shandora, Água 7 e muitos outros, este reino é dito ser formado por muitos membros do que seria chamado de \"clã D.\" (Capítulo 1065: Shaka descreve o reino prosperando há cerca de 900 anos. Capítulo 1085: Imu se refere ao clã D. como o povo do reino que se opôs ao Governo durante o Século Vazio)\n\nPor volta de 600 (cerca de 900 anos atrás) – Um robô colossal, mais tarde apelidado pelos estudiosos de \"gigante de ferro\", é fabricado pelo reino \"imenso\" (Capítulo 1066: Shaka menciona que a data de fabricação do robô é de cerca de 900 anos atrás. Robin corrobora que isso ocorreu durante o Século Vazio).\n\nSéculo 600 (900-800 anos atrás) – Nasce o Rei Nerona Imu (Capítulo 1086: Nerona Imu foi mencionado como sendo originalmente um rei do Século Vazio que viveu há 800 anos)\n\nSéculo 600 (900-800 anos atrás) – Nasce a rainha Nefertari Lily, a herdeira do trono de Alabasta (Capítulo 1085: Lily era do Século Vazio, principalmente porque estava viva no final)\n\nPor volta de 668 (há cerca de 856 anos) – Amatsuki Toki nasce, filha de pessoas do País de Wano, no exterior (Capítulo 964: 30 anos atrás, Toki, de 26 anos, menciona ter nascido há cerca de 800 anos. Ela afirma que seus pais são do País de Wano, mas ela nunca esteve lá, tendo nascido no exterior).\n\nAntes do Século VII (há mais de 830 anos) – O caso mais antigo conhecido de \"Frutas do Diabo\" aparecendo no mundo, rumores dizem que as lendas são as encarnações de um certo Demônio do Mar, realizando os sonhos das pessoas (Capítulo 973: A fruta de Toki existe desde o Século do Vazio, o que significa que datam pelo menos de tão longe quanto naquela época. Dada a tecnologia avançada do reino antigo, é bem provável que as frutas tenham se originado de alguma forma durante este período; Capítulo 1044: a fruta Nika também existe desde o Século do Vazio)\n\nSéculo 600 (900-800 anos atrás) – Escravos e pessoas oprimidas começaram a idolatrar e rezar para um super-herói fictício de desenho animado chamado \"o Guerreiro da Libertação Nika\" como uma divindade, o \"Deus Sol\", na esperança de que ele pudesse de alguma forma existir e lhes trazer a libertação. A partir desses sonhos, Nika aparece no mundo na forma de uma fruta do diabo zoan mítica, a Hito Hito no Mi, Modelo: Nika, que é comida por um usuário que a desperta, ganhando o apelido de “Joyboy” (Capítulo 649: Netuno menciona que o personagem Joyboy existiu durante o Século Vazio, há mais de 800 anos; Capítulo 1044: é revelado que Nika era uma figura mítica que as pessoas veneravam como um deus, que se tornou uma fruta do diabo mítica que alguém no Século Vazio comeu; Capítulo 655/656: Animais de frutas Zoan míticas são descritos como “criaturas imaginárias”; Capítulo 1037: os Gorosei também mencionam que a fruta Nika não despertou em “vários séculos”, a mesma terminologia frequentemente usada para se referir ao Século Vazio por muitos personagens, e eles mais tarde confirmam isso mencionando que a fruta está escapando há 800 anos, embora não saibamos se a fruta acabou em as mãos de alguém ao longo do caminho; Capítulo 1069: Vegapunk especula que a fruta Nika veio a ser materializada de forma muito parecida com as outras frutas do diabo como resultado dos sonhos das pessoas de desejar que Nika existisse, embora se ele quis dizer isso figurativamente ou literalmente ainda não esteja claro; Capítulo 1095: Durante o flashback de Kuma, Kuma descreve Nika como um \"super-herói\" (ヒーロー) e menciona que Nika não era nada mais do que um personagem lendário, posteriormente corroborado por Saturno também, o que se alinha com Nika sendo um personagem mítico)\n\nSéculo 600 (900-800 anos atrás) – A Princesa Sereia da Ilha dos Homens-Peixe nasce e é batizada como “Poseidon”, nome dado em homenagem a um deus por ter sido reconhecida pelos Reis do Mar como seu rei encarnado por alguma razão desconhecida (Capítulo 649: Robin fala sobre o Poseidon do Século Vazio)\n\nAntes do Século VII (há mais de 800 anos) – Um poderoso navio de guerra é construído na ilha de Water 7. Diz-se que foi batizado como a Arma Antiga \"Pluton\", em homenagem a um deus, devido ao seu grande poder. Seu projetista guardava os projetos do navio e os passava de geração em geração, com medo de que uma das armas antigas caísse em mãos erradas, para que um segundo Pluton pudesse ser construído como contra-arma (Capítulo 344: Iceburg afirma que Pluton é um navio construído em Water 7 há muito tempo. No Capítulo 1055, Sukiyaki confirma que a arma já existia no Século do Vazio, pois, ao final dele, já estava sob Wano).\n\nAntes do Século VII (há mais de 800 anos) – Uma arma batizada em homenagem ao deus \"Urano\" também aparece no mundo. Ao lado de Plutão e Poseidon, essas três \"armas antigas\" teriam a capacidade de \"destruir o mundo\" (Capítulo 650: Robin menciona a Arma Antiga Urano como parte das informações do Século Vazio que o Governo apagou).\n\nSéculo 600 (900-800 anos atrás) – O povo da Ilha dos Tritões faz uma promessa a Joyboy envolvendo a arca colossal “Noé” e Poseidon (Capítulo 649: Netuno elabora a promessa de Joyboy durante o Século Vazio. É inferido pelo diálogo de Netuno que este é o mesmo sonho que Otohime compartilhou de emigrar para a superfície)\n\nSéculo VI (900-800 anos atrás) – A Guerra do Século Vazio: Um conflito massivo ocorre entre o povo do clã D., pertencente ao reino \"imenso\" avançado, contra uma aliança de 20 reis humanos. A aliança inclui o Rei Nerona Imu, a Rainha de Alabasta Nefertari Lily (que, sem o conhecimento de seus aliados, era, na verdade, membro do clã D.), o Rei de Dress Rosa Donquixote e os governantes Fegarland, Jaygarcia, Marcus, Topman, Ethanbaron e Shepherd, entre outros 11 governantes (Capítulo 1066: Shaka detalha o conflito do Século Vazio. Capítulo 1085: Imu posteriormente atribui a facção oposta do antigo reino ao clã D.)\n\nFim do Século VI (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – O \"imenso reino\" aparentemente percebe que está se aproximando da derrota, então decide executar um plano para preservar seus ideais. Com seus aliados, o Clã Kouzuki, eles esculpem informações sobre o reino em pedras indestrutíveis; nove \"Rio Poneglyphs\" detalhando a verdadeira história, de um total de trinta pedras, são criados (Capítulo 395: Clover explica que os poneglyphs foram criados quando o Reino acreditava que estava se aproximando da derrota. Capítulo 818: É revelado que o Clã Kouzuki é quem esculpiu os poneglyphs. Embora afirme que foi \"cerca de 800 anos atrás\", a forma como o Século Vazio foi apagado sugere que isso foi antes da virada do século, e a traição de Lily mostra que os poneglyphs foram espalhados antes do juramento do Trono Vazio, onde ela já estava ausente).\n\nFim do Século 600 (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – O usuário do Joyboy morre e a Hito Hito no Mi, Modelo: Nika, renasce. Ela começa a usar sua vontade como uma fruta Zoan para fugir de seus inimigos pelos próximos 800 anos, na esperança de um dia encontrar um novo usuário quando as armas ancestrais renascerem (Capítulo 1044: Os Gorosei mencionam que a fruta está em fuga há 800 anos. Para que ela tenha renascido, o usuário anterior mencionado como ativo no Século Vazio no Capítulo 649 deve ter morrido).\n\nFim do século VI (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – As potências aliadas condenam a raça Buccaneer devido a uma ação que consideram um \"pecado capital\", relacionada ao desejo de se tornar Nika. Ao longo dos séculos seguintes, eles os escravizariam e perseguiriam até quase a extinção por esse suposto \"crime\" (Capítulo 1096: Saturno afirma que o desejo de se tornar como Nika é exatamente o motivo da condenação da raça Buccaneer. A implicação é que o \"Joyboy\" original pode ter sido um Buccaneer, mas, independentemente disso, isso situa o crime cometido pela raça Buccaneer aproximadamente na mesma época em que o primeiro usuário de Nika existiu).\n\n\nFim do Século VI (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – Surge uma profecia, ou crença, de que um dia surgirá um novo usuário de \"Joyboy\", que guiará armas como Poseidon e mudará o mundo para sempre, seguindo as instruções e os ideais deixados para trás, esculpidos nos poneglyphs. Este dia de mudança também é referido por alguns como o \"Amanhecer do Mundo\" ou o dia em que \"o mundo será virado de cabeça para baixo\" (Capítulo 626: Otohime fala de uma figura que um dia aparecerá para guiar as Armas Antigas, transmitidas desde os tempos antigos. Capítulos 968 e 972: Oden fala deste novo Joyboy que um dia virá a Wano. Capítulo 878: Pedro elabora sobre o Amanhecer que a Tribo Mink aguarda. Capítulo 973: Toki menciona que esta crença existe desde o Século Vazio).\n\nFim do Século VI (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – Graças à ajuda de Nefertari D. Lily, os poneglyphs são espalhados pelo mundo. Imu acredita que isso foi um erro de Lily, sem saber que ela é membro do clã D., mas logo após esse evento, Lily desaparece misteriosamente. O irmão mais novo de Lily assume o trono agora vago de Alabasta, mas fica com uma carta de sua irmã pedindo para proteger um poneglyph que o país havia sido confiado, levando as futuras gerações da família real a proteger a pedra em segredo em nome do Amanhecer (Capítulo 1085: Lily espalhou os poneglyphs após sua criação no \"grande erro\". O fato de Shandora possuir uma pedra quando ela caiu no Século Vazio prova que esse evento aconteceu durante o fim do Século Vazio).\n\nFim do século VI (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – A promessa entre Joyboy e o povo da Ilha dos Tritões não pode ser cumprida. O povo da Ilha promete proteger a Arca de Noé para que sua promessa possa ser cumprida algum dia, quando o Dia da Promessa chegar e um novo Joyboy vier para guiar um novo Poseidon, e recebe um Poneglyph da Estrada junto com um Poneglyph detalhando um pedido de desculpas por quebrar a promessa (Capítulo 649: Netuno elabora a promessa com Joyboy).\n\nPor volta do final do século VI (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – O Clã Kouzuki fecha as fronteiras de Wano do resto do mundo para proteger a si mesmo, seus poneglyphs e a antiga arma Pluton, escondida sob suas terras, do poder externo do Governo, aguardando o dia em que Joyboy retornaria. Esse fechamento de fronteiras é bastante literal, com muros colossais sendo erguidos ao redor do país para protegê-lo. Isso resulta em inundações lentas ao longo das eras seguintes devido a esses muros, forçando a constante realocação de seus cidadãos para lugares mais altos no Monte Fuji (Capítulo 972: Oden afirma que Wano fechou suas fronteiras para se proteger da grande potência externa. Capítulo 1055: Sukiyaki menciona Wano antes da construção dos muros e a inundação ocorrida há cerca de 800 anos).\n\nPor volta do final do século VI (vagamente perto de um milênio atrás) – Os minks se isolam nas costas do elefante gigante Zunesha e cortam contato com humanos para proteger um dos Poneglifos da Estrada e aguardar o dia em que o Amanhecer do Mundo chegar (Capítulo 802: É mencionado que os minks cortaram contato com a humanidade por quase um milênio. No entanto, eles obtendo um poneglyph e se isolando do mundo, assim como outros aliados do reino, implicaria que isso foi por volta de 800 anos atrás, pois eram gratos ao Clã Kouzuki por ajudá-los nos tempos antigos. Dado que Momonosuke pode comandar Zunesha, parece que foi um antigo membro Kouzuki que lhes deu seu lar ao ordenar o elefante)\n\nPor volta do final do século VI (vagamente próximo a um milênio atrás) – Zunesha, que havia sido camarada de \"Joyboy\", cometeu um crime grave. Por isso, é punido a vagar pelos mares até que um novo \"Joyboy\" possa reaparecer no mundo, para então ajudar a abrir as fronteiras do País de Wano com seu novo comandante (Capítulo 821: Zunesha menciona que cometeu um crime grave e, portanto, começou a andar com o Mink em suas costas; isso indica que Zunesha foi sentenciado a andar na época em que o Mink pousou em suas costas).\n\n\nSéculo 600 (há mais de 800 anos) – O construtor naval que projetou o navio de guerra Pluton decide esconder seus projetos e passá-los adiante, caso seja necessário construir um segundo Pluton para combater uma arma antiga que caiu em mãos malignas (Capítulo 1055: Pluton foi construído antes do fechamento do País de Wano, há 800 anos)\n\nPor volta de 694 (cerca de 830 anos atrás) – Amatsuki Toki usa o poder de sua fruta do diabo, a Toki Toki no Mi, para saltar 800 anos no futuro, esperando ver com seus olhos o dia em que alguém surgirá para realizar as esperanças de seu povo de virar o mundo de cabeça para baixo (Capítulo 973: Toki elabora que ela fugiu do Século Vazio esperando que no futuro alguém aparecesse que pudesse fazer os desejos de seu povo se tornarem realidade e virar o mundo de cabeça para baixo)\n\nFim do Século VI (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – Queda de Shandora: Shandora recebe um poneglyph com detalhes sobre Poseidon. As Forças Aliadas tentam roubá-lo, instigando um conflito brutal que resulta na queda de Shandora e na morte de muitos de seus habitantes. No entanto, mesmo apesar das perdas, o povo de Shandora consegue proteger a pedra, e as Forças Aliadas são forçadas a recuar. Um sino é construído ao redor da pedra para simbolizar seu orgulho (Capítulo 261: Robin menciona a queda de Shandora há 800 anos, mas especifica que foi no final do Século Vazio. Capítulo 275: o Chefe Shandia explica o que levou à queda de Shandora, sendo a proteção do poneglyph).\n\nAnúncio\n\nFim do século 600 (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – Os 20 reinos aliados emergem vitoriosos no conflito do Século Vazio, e o reino “imenso” é derrotado (Capítulo 495: Clover fala sobre a derrota do reino e o que se tornaria o Governo)\n\nFim do século VI (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – A última ilha da Grand Line para onde os Poneglyphs da Estrada apontam, um dia depois apelidada de \"Laugh Tale\", é deixada completamente abandonada. Na ilha, resta um certo tesouro relacionado de alguma forma a Joyboy, que um dia viria a ser conhecido como \"One Piece\" (Capítulo 967: Roger menciona que já faz cerca de 800 anos desde que alguém pisou em Laugh Tale).\n\n700 (824 anos atrás) – O século que viria a ser conhecido como o “Século do Vazio” termina (Capítulo 649: Robin menciona que o Século do Vazio ocorreu entre 900 e 800 anos atrás)\n\n700\n\nInício do Século VII (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – Fundação do Governo Mundial: Os 19 reis restantes, devido ao desaparecimento de Lily, fundaram a capital mundial de Mary Geoise no topo da Linha Vermelha, no lugar do País dos Deuses de Lunaria. Os 19 reis deixaram seus países e ascenderam a Mary Geoise para se tornarem \"Dragões Celestiais\", reescrevendo a história como os \"deuses\" que criaram um novo mundo. Juntos, eles fundaram o Governo Mundial, uma organização de países aliados que controla e governa o mundo inteiro. Com medo dos ideais do clã D., o Governo opta por apagar todas as informações e registros históricos do século passado, resultando no Século dos anos 600 conhecido como o \"Século Vazio\", pois pouquíssimos registros dele permaneceriam (Capítulo 497: Pappag fala da fundação do Governo há 800 anos. Clover também se refere, no Capítulo 395, à fundação do Governo como o ponto de virada no final do Século Vazio).\n\n\nInício do século VII (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – A Promessa do Trono Vazio: Um Trono Vazio é construído dentro do Castelo de Pangeia, em Mary Geoise, onde os 19 reis (com Lily desaparecida) juram suas espadas a jamais desejarem esse poder como seu. Trata-se, na verdade, de um estratagema para enganar o mundo, já que o Rei Nerona Imu assume o trono para se tornar o Rei do Mundo, acreditando-se que alcançou a juventude perene graças aos poderes da Ope Ope no Mi, mas opta por desaparecer dos olhos do público para que ninguém saiba da existência do Diabo que governa o mundo. Isso marca o início do governo mundial pelos próximos 800 anos (Capítulo 907: O Juramento do Trono Vazio é detalhado como tendo ocorrido há 800 anos. Capítulo 1085: Imu relata os eventos do Século Vazio, inferindo que eles existiram durante esse período, o que é corroborado pelos revolucionários no capítulo seguinte, que acreditam que Imu foi o primeiro usuário do Ope Ope no Mi).\n\nInício do século VII (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – Enies Lobby é fundada sobre um buraco aparentemente deixado por uma arma antiga para servir como ilha judiciária do governo (Capítulo 426: Um fuzileiro naval menciona que Enies Lobby existe há 800 anos)\n\nInício do Século VII (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – A Polícia Cifrada é estabelecida como a força policial secreta do Governo. A CP9 fica estacionada em Enies Lobby, protegendo a ilha pelos próximos oito séculos (Capítulo 426: Um fuzileiro naval menciona como a CP9 existe há 800 anos, protegendo Enies Lobby ao longo de suas gerações).\n\n\nInício do século VII (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – Provavelmente após o efeito do buraco deixado pela antiga arma sobre a qual Enies Lobby foi construída, os níveis do mar sobem ao redor da vizinha Water 7, fazendo com que a ilha comece a afundar lentamente ao longo dos séculos seguintes, com os cidadãos construindo novos edifícios sobre os antigos (Capítulo 350: Franky menciona que séculos atrás, Water 7 costumava estar em terra em uma ilha normal; Dado como nos foi dito sobre a correlação entre a antiga arma que cria os buracos com terremotos e o aumento do nível do mar, isso teria que ter começado algum tempo depois que a antiga arma ao redor de Enies Lobby foi usada, o que deve ter sido antes de 800 anos atrás, dado o que é mencionado no Capítulo 426)\n\nInício do Século VII (cerca de 800 anos atrás) – Com o trono de Dress Rosa vazio após a ascensão do Rei Donquixote a Mary Geoise, a família Riku ascende como a nova governante do país. Tendo descoberto as atrocidades que o clã Donquixote cometeu contra os Tontatta, o Rei Riku I se prostra diante deles em pedido de desculpas e lhes oferece a oportunidade de viver em harmonia. Isso dá início a uma era de paz de 800 anos para Dress Rosa, onde seus cidadãos convivem com as \"fadas\" do país (Capítulo 726: Gancho fala sobre a história de Dress Rosa e o pedido de desculpas do Rei Riku há 800 anos).\n\nAlgum tempo depois do século 600 (vários séculos atrás) – O Império de Amazon Lily em Nyogashima (Ilha das Mulheres) fecha suas fronteiras para os homens pelos séculos seguintes para se proteger (Capítulo 515: Kikyo menciona como Amazon Lily foi fechada por \"várias centenas de anos\". A terminologia é semelhante à usada para se referir à distância entre o Século Vazio e o presente, e dado quantos países estavam isolando suas fronteiras, faria sentido se Amazon Lily também seguisse o exemplo nesse período)\n\nAnúncio\n\nAlgum tempo depois do século 600 (séculos atrás) – O País de Wano é atacado por um dragão colossal, mas o samurai Shimotsuki Ryuma o mata nos céus da Capital das Flores. Isso assusta o Governo e outras forças de atacar o país, e Ryuma passa a ser conhecido como o Deus da Lâmina, adorado e consagrado após sua morte ao lado de sua espada Shusui como um tesouro nacional por seu incrível talento (Capítulo 937: Gyukimaru menciona que Ryuuma morreu há séculos. No entanto, ele também mencionou os nobres do mundo existentes naquela época, o que significa que deve ter sido no mínimo no final do Século Vazio. Como uma nota, enquanto o Ryuma em One Piece é amplamente inspirado pelo personagem no one-shot de Oda, os dois existem em cânones diferentes, apesar de algumas traduções erradas afirmando que Oda disse o contrário, que surgem simplesmente de Oda dizendo que Ryuma é de fato o personagem visto anteriormente em Monstros, com os dois personagens sendo de cânones diferentes ou o dragão que Ryuma matou em Monstros sendo diferente daquele morto em Wano. Como outra nota, um artigo da revista One Piece citou Ryuma vivendo há 400 anos, mas este era um artigo editorial que não tinha uma fonte adequada e estava falando sobre os primeiros conceitos de Oda, então não é uma fonte confiável)\n\n800\n\nSéculo 800 (cerca de 700 anos atrás) – Sob as ordens dos Dragões Celestiais, uma enorme ponte é construída em East Blue com a força de trabalho de escravos.

Oden encontra Cutty Flam abandonado e o convida para se juntar à tripulação, mas é recusado após o desdém do garoto por seus pais piratas (Capítulo 830: Pedro afirma que Roger chegou a Zou há 26 anos, o que significa que a viagem até então aconteceu toda naquele ano).\n\n1498 (26 anos atrás) – Quando os Piratas Roger deixam Water 7, Tom encontra o jovem Cutty Flam na ilha de sucata de Water 7 e o garoto pede que ele o acolha, o que Tom aceita (Capítulo 354: Tom afirma que acolheu Franky há dois anos, 22 anos atrás, a partir dos eventos de Water 7. No Capítulo 967, vemos Franky construindo o mesmo canhão que Tom o encontrou construindo quando se conheceram, o que significa que os dois se conheceram logo depois que Roger deixou Tom, com a linha do tempo correspondendo)\n\n1498 (26 anos atrás) – Os Piratas Roger chegam novamente ao Arquipélago de Sabaody e seguem para a Ilha dos Homens-Peixe.

Os Piratas Roger supostamente se desfizeram no início de 1499, já que o último poneglyph foi localizado no ano anterior, então meio ano o situaria por volta de 1498).\n\n1498 (26 anos atrás) – Os Piratas Roger chegam a Zou, localizando seu último poneglyph da estrada.

O aniversário de Hiyori apresenta uma falha na trama que Oda provavelmente não levou em conta, pois implicaria que toda a jornada de Roger com Oden aconteceu em uma semana, o que é logisticamente impossível.

Orochi chantageia Oden com a vida de cidadãos, forçando-o a dançar nu como um tolo pelas ruas de Wano pelos próximos 5 anos para humilhá-lo.

Roger, é executado em Loguetown às 15h15.

Esta Era também viria a ser conhecida por alguns como a Era do Barba Branca. Várias figuras que deixariam sua marca no futuro comparecem à execução de Roger, incluindo Crocodile, Doflamingo, Moria, Mihawk, Dragon, Shanks e Buggy (Capítulo 1: A série começa.

Essa seca foi secretamente criada pela Baroque Works através do uso de pó de dança como forma de gerar agitação no país (Capítulo 163: Toto menciona que a seca começou há 3 anos).\n\n1519 (5 anos atrás) – Uma certa criança nasce em Dress Rosa (Capítulo 789: Uma mãe menciona que seu filho tem 5 anos)\n\n1520\n\nPor volta de 1520 (há cerca de 4 anos) – Eustass \"Capitão\" Kid une as quatro gangues de seu reino natal em South Blue depois que a gangue monarquista que governava o país mata sua amiga Victoria, depondo-a de seu poder. Ao lado dos outros líderes de gangue, Killer, Heat e Wire, Kid forma os Piratas Kid e parte para o mar, ganhando notoriedade no Sul (Capítulo 999: Ace menciona que Kid está começando a ficar famoso em South Blue há 4 anos; SBS Vol. 104 detalha a história de Kid)\n\nPor volta de 1520 (cerca de 4 anos atrás) – Depois de criar o caos entre as Cinco Famílias do Oeste, atacando os líderes das famílias e gangues rivais, Capone “Gang” Bege se torna um pirata e ganha infâmia no Oeste (Capítulo 999: Ace menciona Bege se tornando notório no West Blue há 4 anos)\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – Trafalgar Law se torna famoso no North Blue como o capitão dos Piratas Heart (Capítulo 999: Ace menciona que Law se tornou famoso no North Blue há 4 anos)\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – O Capitão Pirata Cavendish alcança muita fama por meio de suas realizações (Capítulo 999: Ace menciona que Cavendish já estava começando a se tornar popular um ano antes de se tornar um Supernova há 3 anos)\n\n1519-1520 (5-4 anos atrás) – Ace entra no Novo Mundo como uma Supernova. Lá, ele finalmente encontra Shanks e o agradece por tudo o que fez por Luffy quando criança. (Volume Ace: Ace conheceu Shanks antes de chegar a Wano. É difícil dizer se o conteúdo da novel é realmente canônico, pois não há nenhuma declaração oficial sobre a canonicidade da novel, apesar de se encaixar perfeitamente no conteúdo canônico, mas, no mínimo, corrobora o conteúdo canônico do mangá e a linha do tempo deveria ter sido verificada com Oda.)\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – O Reverie de 1520 acontece (Capítulo 627: Fukaboshi menciona o Reverie daqui a 6 anos)\n\n1520 (4 anos atrás) – Um carregamento de pó de dança é descoberto em Nanohana, enviado sob as ordens do rei. Isso gera agitação civil, levando ao início de uma rebelião em Alabasta. Na realidade, o acidente foi encenado pela Baroque Works para incriminar o rei (Capítulo 161: 2 anos atrás, a partir dos eventos de Alabasta)\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – Em Alabasta, Erumalu se torna uma cidade fantasma por causa da seca e Yuba também se aproxima de um destino semelhante (Capítulo 171: Já se passou mais de 1 ano desde que a seca começou)\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – A Princesa Vivi e o Capitão da Guarda Real Igaram de Alabasta se juntam à Baroque Works disfarçados em uma tentativa de descobrir mais sobre seu líder secreto (Capítulo 189: Crocodile menciona que Vivi está na organização há 2 anos)\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – O Incidente de Punk Hazard: O assistente de Vegapunk, Caesar Clown, desenvolve uma arma de destruição em massa em Punk Hazard. Vegapunk o prende por isso, mas, em uma última tentativa, Caesar detona a bomba, destruindo o ecossistema de Punk Hazard e devastando-o. Vegapunk e os outros agentes do Governo evacuam, mas os prisioneiros deixados para trás na ilha são devastados pelos efeitos da arma. Caesar é preso, mas consegue escapar de seu navio-prisão (Capítulo 684: há 4 anos)\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – Ace recebe uma oferta para o cargo de Senhor da Guerra, mas a rejeita. Por causa dele, o cargo de Senhor da Guerra fica vago (Capítulo 1100: Saturno menciona Ace como o responsável pela vaga do cargo de Senhor da Guerra no outro dia, na época do Incidente de Punk Hazard. A formulação é vaga, mas parece se referir à rejeição de Ace ao cargo de Senhor da Guerra, o que aconteceu mais ou menos na mesma época).\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – O Projeto Pacifista: Kuma se reencontra com Dragon, que o recomenda levar Bonney até Vegapunk para curá-la. Vegapunk, que acabara de se mudar de Punk Hazard para uma ilha que seria conhecida como Cabeça de Ovo, concorda em curar Bonney, mas pede a Kuma que o deixe clonar seu corpo, dando início ao Projeto Pacifista. No entanto, St. Saturn descobre o projeto e exige que Kuma se torne um Senhor da Guerra e apague seu testamento como condição para a cirurgia de Bonney. Kuma aceita e inicia sua conversão corporal de 2 anos, assim como o tratamento de Bonney (Capítulo 1099: Dragon menciona o incidente de Punk Hazard ocorrido outro dia; Capítulo 1101: no início de 1522, meio ano antes do décimo aniversário de Bonney, já fazia um ano e meio desde o início do tratamento de Bonney, e naquele momento ela já estava curada. Isso situaria esse momento cerca de um ano e meio antes, em meados de 1520. Isso geralmente se encaixa, já que Kuma também seria totalmente convertido cerca de 2 anos depois, em abril ou maio de 1522).\n\n1520 (4 anos atrás) – Belo Betty se torna comandante do Exército Revolucionário Oriental (Capítulo 1099: Belo Betty pede para ser promovida, o Incidente Punk Hazard aconteceu outro dia)\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – O Capitão Pirata Goo tem sua sombra roubada por Gecko Moria (Capítulo 483: Capitão Goo menciona ter perdido sua sombra há 2 anos, a partir dos eventos de Thriller Bark)\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – O pescador Koby, de East Blue, é sequestrado pela capitã pirata Alvida e é forçado a se tornar seu ajudante (Capítulo 2: Koby menciona que já se passaram 2 anos desde os eventos de East Blue)\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – Os Piratas Spade naufragam no País de Wano e ajudam a faminta Vila Amigasa, onde Ace conhece a jovem O-Tama. Ace tenta ir a Onigashima para derrotar Kaido em nome de Tama, mas o Imperador partiu em uma expedição, então Ace encontra Yamato e se torna amigo dele. Os dois prometem se encontrar novamente um dia, enquanto Yamato faz uma carta de vivre de Ace (Capítulo 912: Hitetsu menciona que Ace chegou ao País de Wano há 4 anos. Oda posteriormente esclareceu que a idade inconsistente de Tama se devia ao fato de ela ter mentido para Ace sobre sua idade real).\n\n1520 (há 4 anos) – Em busca da cabeça de Barba Branca, Ace é confrontado por Jinbei, e os dois duelam por cinco dias. Os dois fracassam, mas são emboscados por Quadro Branco, que se afeiçoa a Ace e o força a se juntar à sua tripulação. Ace luta para aceitar Barba Branca como seu capitão, mas com o tempo ele se torna leal e decide se tornar seu \"filho\". Ace é finalmente promovido a Comandante da Segunda Divisão dos Piratas do Barba Branca (Capítulo 912: Há 4 anos, Ace ainda fazia parte de sua tripulação; Capítulo 1100: Ace já fazia parte da tripulação de Barba Branca quando Kuma se tornou um Shichibukai no início de 3 anos atrás e se sentia confortável com Barba Branca, o que significa que ele deve ter sido derrotado por Barba Branca no ano anterior).\n\n1521\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Após passar 6 meses em Egghead enquanto Vegapunk curava a doença de Bonney, ela e Kuma se aproximam do médico, Sentoumaru e Kizaru. Após os 6 meses, o tratamento de Bonney é concluído, então ela é enviada de volta ao Reino Sorbet, onde a Polícia Cifrada a monitora para garantir que ela e Kuma não se encontrem novamente, sem que Bonney saiba da verdade. (Capítulo 1100: Vegapunk menciona que levará meio ano para tratar Bonney e dois anos para transformar Kuma completamente em um ciborgue. No Capítulo 1101, é dito que Bonney se curou completamente cerca de meio ano antes de seu 10º aniversário, o que significa que ela se curou por volta do início de 1522. Isso significa que seu tratamento em Egghead terminou um ano antes, no início de 1521. Isso coincide com o fato de o Capítulo 1101 mencionar que foi \"há 3 anos\" que Kuma conheceu Luffy.)\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Bartholomew Kuma se torna um dos Sete Senhores da Guerra do Mar Real, de acordo com a condição imposta por Saturno, e começa a trabalhar sob as ordens do Governo (Capítulo 1101: há 3 anos)\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Cavendish se torna uma Supernova com uma recompensa de 280 milhões de barrigas e entra no Novo Mundo. Ele desfruta de muita fama e popularidade (Capítulo 704: Cavendish menciona que já se passaram três anos)\n\n1521 (3 anos atrás) – Aramaki, que se tornaria um almirante no futuro, começa a jejuar e decide não se preocupar em comer pelos próximos 3 anos, já que sua Mori Mori no Mi o permite sobreviver apenas com fotossíntese (Capítulo 905: Ryokugyu menciona que não come há 3 anos)\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Enquanto está no East Blue, Kuma visita o Reino de Goa para observar Luffy de longe (Capítulo 1101: Luffy tem 16 anos e já se passaram 3 anos, o que significa que alguns meses se passaram desde que Kuma se tornou um Shichibukai)\n\n1521 (3 anos atrás) – Com o cérebro crescendo demais devido aos seus poderes Nomi Nomi, Vegapunk corta seu cérebro para criar a Punk Records em Egghead. Ele eventualmente o divide em seis clones: Shaka, Lilith, Edison, Pitágoras, Atlas e York (Capítulo 1101: Embora tenhamos tido uma visão geral por um longo tempo, este capítulo confirma que isso aconteceu há 3 anos, entre o encontro de Kuma com Luffy e o aniversário de Bonney).\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Caesar retorna a Punk Hazard, incriminando Vegapunk pelo incidente e agindo como um salvador para os detentos, ajudando-os a se recuperar, conquistando sua lealdade. Ele começa a usar Punk Hazard como base de operações para suas pesquisas clandestinas. Ele condensa o gás letal e, eventualmente, o transforma em vida por meio de uma fruta do diabo como a arma viva Smiley, para usá-la posteriormente (Capítulo 664: um ano se passou desde o incidente).\n\n1521 (3 anos de sago) – Big Mom pede a Caesar que desenvolva uma droga de gigantificação, então Caesar pede ajuda a Joker para obter cobaias. Um Vice-Almirante disfarçado Vergo, agora chefe do G-5, ajuda a sequestrar crianças de vilas próximas e enquadra seus desaparecimentos como acidentes no mar. Apesar disso, Caesar não consegue fazer muito além de gigantificar algumas das crianças, às custas de suas vidas, então ele apenas gasta o dinheiro do fundo com bebida e garotas (Capítulo 673: as crianças foram sequestradas há três anos; Capítulo 834: Caesar menciona o sequestro das crianças para os experimentos de Big Mom)\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Com base na pesquisa de Vegapunk sobre Frutas do Diabo Artificiais, Caesar Clown inventa as Frutas SMILE, frutas Zoan artificiais com baixa taxa de sucesso e resultados inconsistentes. Mesmo assim, ele vende seu SAD para Doflamingo, que o estava protegendo sob o pseudônimo de Coringa. Doflamingo constrói uma fábrica de Frutas do Diabo artificiais em Dress Rosa para revendê-las a compradores interessados, particularmente Kaido, que sonha em construir um exército de usuários de Frutas do Diabo (Capítulo 664: a produção de SAD só poderia ter sido iniciada em Punk Hazard após o retorno de Caesar, tornando as Frutas SMILE uma invenção recente; Capítulo 943: Shinobu menciona que as Frutas SMILE começaram a ser produzidas \"há alguns anos\", mas só poderia ter sido há 3 anos, no mínimo).\n\n1521-1523 (3-1 anos atrás) – Caesar acaba vendendo para Kaidou as cobaias de Punk Hazard, que eram tentativas fracassadas de criar gigantes ancestrais artificiais, a quem Kaidou torna sua divisão de Numbers. Kaidou também eventualmente adquire uma arma de gás letal chamada \"Koro\" de Caesar (Capítulo 989: Big Mom menciona que Kaidou adquiriu os experimentos fracassados ​​com gigantes ancestrais de Punk Hazard. Embora seja possível que Vegapunk tenha trabalhado neles, como Law falou sobre os rumores, apenas Caesar os teria vendido para Kaidou, já que ele era seu cliente e não de Vegapunk; Capítulo 811: Caesar também menciona como vendeu Koro para Kaidou, embora seja provável que tudo isso tenha sido por meio do Coringa; Como observação, embora as Cartas Vivre listassem a idade de Hatcha como mais de 100 anos, elas também mencionavam seu ano de nascimento como desconhecido, o que significa que as idades dos Numbers provavelmente foram aceleradas e aumentadas como experimentos, assim como as de alguns outros clones ou criaturas artificiais).\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Um certo pirata do West Blue luta contra Barba Branca, mas perde uma perna (Capítulo 550: o pirata menciona que encontrou Barba Branca há um ano, durante a Guerra das Cúpulas)\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Uta encontra um grupo de den den mushi pertencentes ao SSG, o grupo de pesquisa de Vegapunk, naufragado nas margens de Elegia, e descobre que se trata de um protótipo capaz de transmitir imagens ao vivo para o mundo todo. Uta começa a gravar a si mesma e suas músicas para transmiti-las ao mundo. Ela começa a conquistar fãs enquanto ascende lentamente para se tornar a ídolo mais famosa do mundo (Vol. 4B: O passado de Shanks é delineado)\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Os pais de Kaya, da propriedade Syrup Village, falecem devido a uma doença, deixando sua filha em um estado depressivo que evolui para doença (Capítulo 23: Usopp menciona que já faz 1 ano, desde os eventos de Syrup Village)\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) 1º de setembro – Bonney comemora seu 9º aniversário no Reino Sorbet (Capítulo 1101: aniversário de Bonney, cerca de meio ano antes de ela partir para o mar)\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Thatch põe as mãos na Yami Yami no Mi, mas Teach é forçado a matá-lo para obter a fruta. Tendo finalmente obtido a fruta, ele foge dos Piratas do Barba Branca para formar sua própria tripulação, os Piratas do Barba Negra. Após Ace descobrir a morte de Thatch, ele fica indignado e parte em busca de Barba Negra, apesar dos avisos de Barba Branca (Capítulo 1100: Ace e Barba Negra ainda se dão bem em 1521, o que significa que o assassinato de Thatch por Teach deve ter ocorrido neste ano, já que aconteceu alguns meses antes de Luffy chegar à Ilha Drum. Como detalhe, o romance de Ace também sugere fortemente que Teach matou Thatch porque ele já havia comido a fruta).\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) – Teach, agora tendo formado os Piratas do Barba Negra, ataca o Reino de Drum. O aterrorizado Rei Wapol foge da ilha com seus homens, abandonando seu povo, mas, em troca, libertando-o de sua tirania (Capítulo 133: Dalton menciona que já faz alguns meses desde o ataque de Barba Negra. Considerando a cronologia, isso deve ter sido no final do ano anterior, já que a Ilha de Drum se passa em fevereiro).\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) Por volta de outubro – Rayleigh sai do Shakky's Rip-Off Bar por um tempo para se dedicar a uma maratona de apostas pelos próximos seis meses (Capítulo 498: Shakky menciona que Rayleigh não volta há 6 meses. Dada a cronologia dos eventos de Sabaody, isso deve ter sido no final do ano anterior).\n\n1521 (há 3 anos) Por volta de novembro – Hocker, morador de Orange Town, adoece e é hospitalizado. Ele falece logo em seguida, deixando seu cachorro Shushu para proteger sua loja de ração. (Capítulo 12: Hocker foi hospitalizado há três meses. Considerando a cronologia da história principal, isso seria no final de 1521)\n\n1522\n\n1522 (2 anos atrás) – Guerra de Broc Coli: A guerra irrompe na Ilha de Broc Coli (Capítulo 927: A Guerra de Broc Coli já dura dois anos)\n\n1522 (2 anos atrás) Janeiro-Março – Nero se junta ao CP9 como seu mais novo membro (Vivre Cards: 2 anos atrás)\n\n1522 (2 anos atrás) Janeiro-Fevereiro – Após entrar na Grand Line e sobreviver lá por apenas uma semana, a armada dos Piratas Krieg é quase totalmente aniquilada por Dracule Mihawk. Os Piratas Krieg mal conseguem retornar com vida para o East Blue, e Gin desvia a atenção dos fuzileiros navais se passando por Krieg e se deixando capturar (Capítulo 48: Gin fala do evento como muito recente, já que até mesmo sua captura aconteceu recentemente e ele estava sendo escoltado durante os eventos do Baratie).\n\n1522 (2 anos atrás) Janeiro-Fevereiro – Roronoa Zoro mata Soro, o lobo de estimação de Helmeppo, filho de Morgan, para salvar a vida de uma jovem chamada Rika e é aprisionado pelos fuzileiros navais em um crucifixo por um mês como punição. Zoro faz uma promessa a Helmeppo de que, se sobreviver um mês sem comida, será libertado, embora Helmeppo nunca pretenda cumprir a promessa (Capítulo 3: Zoro é preso 9 dias antes de conhecer Luffy)\n\n1522 (2 anos atrás) Por volta de fevereiro – Após um ano de recuperação em Sorbet, Bonney se recupera completamente da Síndrome da Escama de Safira. No entanto, o Governo não quer deixá-la ir, então ela escapa e parte para o mar como pirata para cuidar de seu pai (Capítulo 1101: O narrador diz que meio ano se passou desde o aniversário de 9 anos de Bonney, e Conney menciona que falta meio ano para seu aniversário de 10 anos. Não são exatamente 6 meses, já que Bonney se tornou pirata antes de Luffy receber sua primeira recompensa em meados de fevereiro, mas ainda falta aproximadamente \"meio ano\" para seu aniversário de 10 anos, então geralmente se encaixa. Vemos que, quando Luffy recebe sua primeira recompensa, Bonney havia acabado de começar a ser pirata pela primeira vez, o que se alinha com a linha do tempo).\n"

          "content": "SAGA AZUL DO LESTE\n\nEm relação ao início da jornada de Luffy e à linha do tempo da história principal, a maior parte do pré e pós-timeskip pode ser mapeada por meio de pontos de referência fornecidos ao longo da série, já que a maioria dos arcos é conectada por escritos como \"quatro dias depois\" ou \"dois dias após a partida\", etc. O livro de dados do Vivre Card forneceu um ponto de referência para várias datas-chave, permitindo-nos mapear a maior parte da jornada de Luffy com datas específicas diretamente de Oda. Embora alguns possam criticar Oda por a jornada de três meses de Luffy antes do timeskip ser \"muito curta\", em última análise, é com o cânone que temos que lidar agora que temos as datas confirmadas.\n\nEm relação ao sistema de aniversário na jornada de Luffy, os aniversários são comemorados em seu calendário gregoriano e são reconhecidos como uma celebração marcante, assim como em nosso mundo (por exemplo: Capítulo 867: 6º aniversário da Big Mom), mas categoricamente, os personagens envelhecem em 1º de janeiro. Em outras palavras, quando se torna 1º de janeiro, todas as pessoas no mundo envelhecem um ano, independentemente de quando é seu aniversário. Este sistema foi realmente usado em tempos antigos no Japão antes de ser substituído pelo sistema de aniversário ocidental mais recente durante o século 20 (veja “East_Asian_age_reckoning#Japan” na Wikipedia), então o mundo de One Piece parece usar este sistema também. Como exemplo, é por isso que Luffy tem 17 anos quando começa sua jornada, apesar de Oda citar que começa em fevereiro nas Vivre Cards, já que o aniversário de Luffy seria apenas no próximo dia 5 de maio, mas Luffy já \"fez 17 anos\" no início do ano. É também por isso que outros Chapéus de Palha não envelhecem ao longo da jornada, apesar de aniversários passados, por exemplo. Esse sistema provavelmente foi implementado por Oda para não criar um milhão de buracos na trama com a linha do tempo, então é também o que usaremos como referência, então, basta ter isso em mente.\n\n1522 (2 anos atrás) Por volta de fevereiro – Monkey D. Luffy, agora com 17 anos, parte da Vila Foosha em sua jornada para se tornar o Rei dos Piratas. Logo após sua partida, ele é sugado por um redemoinho, mas consegue sobreviver dentro de um barril e encontra Koby na Ilha Goat, a quem ele liberta de Alvida (Capítulo 1: a história começa quando Luffy tem 17 anos. No Mundo de One Piece, é provado várias vezes pela linha do tempo que os personagens envelhecem com a virada do Ano Novo, uma prática que era usada no Japão até muito recentemente, onde sua idade aumenta em 1º de janeiro (com aniversários sendo apenas uma celebração). O que significa que Luffy completou 17 anos no momento em que o ano começou, então sua jornada deve ter começado em algum momento entre janeiro e fevereiro, considerando que os eventos de Reverse Mountain acontecem em 18 de fevereiro e Whiskey Peak em 19 de janeiro como datas confirmadas, conforme confirmado por Oda nas Cartas Vivre. De acordo com o Blue Databook, os eventos de Syrup Village seriam cerca de 10 dias antes de Drum Island, mostrando que os eventos de East Blue provavelmente ocorreram na primeira quinzena de fevereiro. De qualquer forma, no mínimo a história não poderia ter acontecido antes de janeiro devido a Idade do Luffy)\n\nPor volta de 4 de fevereiro – Jango ancora o navio dos Piratas do Gato Preto no Arquipélago Gecko em preparação para o plano de Kuro (Capítulo 26: Jango menciona que uma semana se passou)\n\nPor volta de fevereiro – Luffy e Koby desembarcam em Shells Town, na Ilha Yotsuba, onde encontram Roronoa Zoro, que está preso pela Marinha há 9 dias. Luffy ajuda a libertá-lo em troca de se juntar à sua tripulação, e os dois ajudam a libertar Shells Town, derrubando o Capitão Morgan e seu governo despótico. Koby decide ficar para trás e se junta à Marinha ao lado de Helmeppo, filho de Morgan (Capítulo 3: não se sabe quanto tempo se passou entre a Ilha Goat e Shells Town, mas aparentemente não foi tanto assim).\n\nPor volta de fevereiro – Luffy e Zoro desembarcam em Orange Town, no Arquipélago dos Órgãos, onde encontram Nami, que estava roubando dos Piratas Buggy. Juntos, eles derrotam os Piratas Buggy, libertando Orange Town e ajudando a encerrar a perda de Shushu. Nami decide se juntar à tripulação como navegadora (Capítulo 8: Luffy e Zoro estão morrendo de fome por não terem comida, então isso não pode ter acontecido tanto tempo depois, se não no mesmo dia).\n\nPor volta de fevereiro – Luffy e Nami pousam na Ilha dos Animais Raros, onde encontram Gaimon, que o ajuda a descobrir a verdade sobre os baús de tesouro restantes na ilha (Capítulo 22: logo após Orange Town, se não no mesmo dia em que Nami está consertando o chapéu de Luffy)\n\nPor volta de 11 de fevereiro – O grupo de Luffy desembarca em Syrup Village, no Arquipélago Gecko, onde conhece Usopp. Juntos, eles descobrem o plano de Kuro para atacar a vila, assassinar Kaya e tomar suas riquezas para si, mas nenhum dos aldeões acredita em Usopp devido aos seus hábitos mentirosos (Blue Databook: o livro faz referência a como, até Skypiea, as fases da Lua podiam ser usadas como referência geral de tempo (embora depois de Skypiea, as fases da Lua sejam completamente imprecisas), indicando uma distância de cerca de 10 dias entre Syrup Village e Drum Island ou cerca de 4 dias entre Syrup Village e Arlong Park. Mesmo sendo apenas uma estimativa, essa estimativa ainda é precisa, como comprovado por datas futuras).\n\nPor volta de 12 de fevereiro – De manhã cedo, Luffy, Zoro, Nami e Usopp se posicionam na costa da Vila Syrup para impedir a incursão dos Piratas Black Cat, e Luffy consegue derrotar Kuro, forçando-o a recuar para o mar. Mais tarde, eles deixam o arquipélago, mas Kaya lhes fornece um novo navio construído por Merry, o Going Merry. Usopp se junta a eles como atirador de elite da tripulação em seu novo navio. Ao partirem para o mar, eles encontram Johnny e Yosaku, antigos amigos caçadores de recompensas de Zoro, e salvam Yosaku do escorbuto (Capítulo 40: ainda são 7h da manhã quando os Piratas Black Cat são expulsos. São 14h quando Usopp sai de casa em seu relógio. Quando encontram Johnny e Yosaku, eles ainda estão testando os novos recursos do navio).\n\nPor volta de 14 de fevereiro – Os Chapéus de Palha chegam ao Baratie, onde Luffy é forçado a lavar louça por um ano após danificar acidentalmente o navio. Sanji alimenta Gin, que estava faminto e escapou da Marinha, mas traz de volta Don Krieg e seus outros tripulantes para alimentá-los, que aproveitam a situação para atacar e capturar o Baratie. Ao mesmo tempo, Nami rouba o Going Merry e foge, e Mihawk vem atrás de Krieg. Zoro desafia Mihawk para um duelo para realizar seu sonho de se tornar o Maior Espadachim do Mundo, mas não consegue superá-lo e fica seriamente marcado, mas Mihawk o encoraja a ir atrás dele novamente algum dia. Luffy e Sanji então resolvem as coisas derrotando a frota de Krieg e Gin é mortalmente envenenado, mas ele aceita seu destino pacificamente. Sanji logo depois se junta aos Chapéus de Palha como seu cozinheiro, enquanto decide seguir Luffy para encontrar o All Blue (Capítulo 43: Luffy menciona ter feito sua bandeira anteontem)\n\nPor volta de 15 de fevereiro, Luffy e Sanji chegam ao Arquipélago Conomi para se encontrar com os outros e descobrir a lealdade de Nami aos Piratas de Arlong. Nami terminou de juntar sua barriga de 100 milhões para pagar a Arlong a compra de sua vila, mas Arlong a trai e pega o dinheiro, levando Nami a ter um colapso. Nami pede ajuda a Luffy, então a tripulação marcha para o Parque Arlong para derrotar sua tripulação. Após uma longa batalha, Luffy destrói o Parque Arlong e põe fim ao governo de Arlong, com todos os homens-peixe sendo presos. Celebrações acontecem no arquipélago durante a noite (Blue Databook: o livro faz referência a como, até Skypiea, as fases da Lua podiam ser usadas como referência geral de tempo (embora depois de Skypiea, as fases da Lua sejam completamente imprecisas), indicando uma distância de cerca de 10 dias entre Syrup Village e Drum Island ou cerca de 4 dias entre Syrup Village e Arlong Park. Embora esta seja uma estimativa, não se passaram muitos dias devido à distância entre Zoro chegando em Arlong Park e Sanji partindo para lá mais ou menos na mesma época).\n\n16 de fevereiro – Nas notícias, 300.000 soldados do exército real de Alabasta mudam de lado para os revolucionários, atiçando o fogo de uma iminente guerra civil (Capítulo 130: o jornal de três dias atrás, em 19 de fevereiro)\n\n18 de fevereiro – No noticiário, outro Golpe de Estado acontece em Vira. Luffy também recebe sua primeira recompensa de 30.000.000 barrigas (Capítulo 96: Nami lê o jornal da manhã)\n\n18 de fevereiro – Após deixar o Arquipélago Conomi, a tripulação de Luffy desembarca em Loguetown, onde Buggy e Alvida retornam com vingança e tentam executar Luffy no mesmo local onde Roger morreu, mas ele é salvo por um raio fatídico. O Capitão da Marinha Smoker persegue Luffy, mas Dragon chega à ilha para ajudar seu filho a escapar, enquanto os Chapéus de Palha se preparam para entrar na Grand Line (Capítulo 101: mesmo dia dos eventos de Reverse Mountain).\n\nPor volta de 18 de fevereiro – Em Robelle, na Ilha Drum, Ace está cuidando de Barba Negra, mas depois que lhe dizem que ele já foi embora, ele pede aos moradores locais que entreguem uma mensagem a Luffy dizendo que ele estará esperando em Alabasta (Capítulo 154: cerca de uma semana atrás; No entanto, este é um \"cerca de uma semana atrás\" muito generoso, já que só poderia ter sido depois de 18 de fevereiro, já que Ace já tinha o cartaz de recompensa de Luffy com ele)\n\nPor volta de 18 de fevereiro – Ace encontra Barba Branca e Jinbe novamente, e conta a eles sobre seu irmãozinho depois que Luffy conseguiu sua primeira recompensa (Capítulo 552 e 1101: Este momento serve como um potencial furo na trama, já que Ace já havia saído em busca de Barba Negra antes deste momento, mas ele tinha o cartaz de recompensa de Luffy com ele quando o mostrou a Barba Branca. No entanto, isso ainda é justificável se Ace encontrou Barba Branca e Jinbe em seu navio durante este tempo, mostrou-lhes o cartaz, e então voltou para Alabasta para esperar por Luffy lá em sua busca por Barba Negra)\n\nPor volta de 18 de fevereiro – Bonney, agora capitã pirata Jewelry Bonney, cuida de Kuma, mas não consegue encontrá-lo. Ela decide ir à procura de Nika nesse meio tempo (Capítulo 1102: Ao mesmo tempo em que Luffy recebe sua primeira recompensa)\n\nSAGA ALABASTA\n\n18 de fevereiro – A tripulação de Luffy atravessa a Montanha Reversa e chega à Grand Line, onde encontra a baleia-da-ilha Laboon, com quem Luffy faz uma nova promessa de se encontrar novamente algum dia. Eles também encontram o Sr. 9 e a Srta. Wednesday, que os pedem para levá-los ao Pico do Uísque (Capítulo 101: Luffy menciona que o farol que eles estavam seguindo no capítulo anterior acabou de se apagar, o que significa que a travessia da Montanha Reversa acontece logo após eles deixarem Loguetown).\n\n18 de fevereiro – A tripulação de Luffy desembarca em Whiskey Peak, na Ilha Cactus. Eles são enganados pela hospitalidade dos agentes da Baroque Works, mas Zoro descobre seus planos e enfrenta cerca de 100 caçadores de recompensas (Capítulo 106: Zoro está tirando uma soneca curta desde que eles deixaram os Cabos Gêmeos, pois nem sabia que Vivi havia embarcado, o que significa que é no mesmo dia. As Cartas Vivre mencionam que este dia em particular é 18 de fevereiro, o que nos dá uma boa referência para todos os eventos futuros).\n\n19 de fevereiro – Ao amanhecer, o Sr. 5 e a Srta. Valentine chegam a Whiskey Peak para capturar a princesa Srta.

Usando a arca que Maxim construiu ao longo dos últimos 6 anos, Enel planeja ir à Lua, a \"Fairy Vearth\" das lendas celestes, e afundar Skypiea ao deixá-la.

Eles são desafiados pelos Piratas Foxy em uma Luta Davy Back, mas saem vitoriosos e conseguem manter seus companheiros de tripulação, marcando a primeira derrota na longa sequência de Foxy.

O narrador menciona que a festa duraria vários dias, mas isso se refere mesmo depois que os Chapéus de Palha partirem.

Depois de pousar no mar azul, eles são imediatamente perseguidos por Macacos do Mar e encontram Long Ring Long Land logo depois)\n\n16 de março – Após 4 dias inteiros para que Luffy e Robin se recuperassem do confronto com Aokiji, os Chapéus de Palha finalmente zarparam de Long Ring Long Land (Capítulo 322: Os Chapéus de Palha permaneceram ancorados por mais 4 dias em Long Ring Long Land para garantir a recuperação de Luffy e Robin.

Usopp não consegue se separar do Merry e se sente inseguro por também ter sido abandonado, então desafia Luffy para um duelo pelo navio às 22h.

Franky queima as plantas de Pluton. Os Chapéus de Palha derrotam todos os membros da CP9, incluindo Rob Lucci. Durante o incidente, os Chapéus de Palha resgatam Robin e Franky com sucesso, e o Going Merry retorna para resgatá-los de Enies Lobby. Quando a nave finalmente quebra, os Chapéus de Palha lhe dão um funeral digno (Capítulo 377: ainda é cedo em Enies Lobby, pois Oimo e Kashi ainda estão dormindo, com um guarda comentando que ainda é noite, apesar do sol perene em Enies Lobby).\n\nPor volta de 20 de março – Os membros derrotados do CP9 conseguem escapar do Lobby de Enies e arrecadam fundos para financiar uma operação para salvar Lucci em St. Poplar.

Goldenweek ajuda a liderar uma fuga dos membros presos da Baroque Works, auxiliando a maioria dos agentes da fronteira a escapar, que decidem se aposentar para uma vida mais tranquila no Café de um Novo Aranha.

O Capítulo 440 confirma que três dias se passaram desde a festa.

Na possibilidade de terem se passado alguns dias, isso não importa muito, pois depois de Thriller Bark até o salto temporal, a linha do tempo não pode mais ser rastreada, então não faz muita diferença).\n\nPor volta de 26 de março – Nas notícias, Portags D. Ace foi preso em Impel Down após sua derrota nas mãos de Barba Negra, resultando na promoção de Teach a Senhor da Guerra no lugar de Crocodile (Capítulo 486: Absalom lê o jornal)\n\nPor volta de 26 de março – Os Chapéus de Palha derrotam com sucesso os zumbis de Moria, como Ryuma e Oars, revividos, e o próprio Moria antes do amanhecer, resultando no retorno de todas as sombras de Moria aos seus donos originais.

O Almirante Kizaru é convocado para a ilha para cuidar dos Chapéus de Palha e, dominado por inimigos poderosos, Kuma os salva da beira da derrota enviando-os para ilhas distantes (Capítulo 490: \"alguns dias depois\" se passaram de Thriller Bark para Sabaody. A quantia não é especificada, no entanto, não pode ser tanto tempo, já que não se passou muito tempo desde a prisão de Ace e sua execução planejada. No Capítulo 522, Gloriosa também menciona que de Amazon Lily para Sabaody é um pouco mais de uma semana, apesar de Amazon Lily estar localizada mais para trás do que Enies Lobby, o que significa que a jornada de Water 7 para Sabaody é de pouco mais de uma semana.

Nas dez horas seguintes, o Sr. 2 acorda enquanto Luffy se recupera dolorosamente do veneno (Capítulo 525: leva quatro dias e meio para chegar a Impel Down, chegando bem cedo na manhã anterior à execução de Ace, que está marcada para 33 horas a partir de então, às 15h.

Ele corre para salvar Ace, mas este já foi escoltado para fora de Impel Down, então ele e o restante dos prisioneiros com quem se aliou, incluindo Ivankov, Crocodile e Jinbe, escapam de Impel Down, embora o Sr. 2 fique para trás para garantir a fuga. Ao mesmo tempo, Barba Negra usa sua posição de Senhor da Guerra para se infiltrar em Impel Down, libertando vários de seus prisioneiros de Nível 6 para recrutar novos membros para sua tripulação, levando a uma fuga em massa sem precedentes em Impel Down. Luffy persegue Ace indo para Marineford (Capítulo 538: oito horas se passaram desde a meia-noite).\n\nAbril SWDay 10 – A Guerra de Cúpula: os fuzileiros navais estão prontos para executar Ace às 15h em Marineford. Como esperado, os Piratas do Barba Branca e sua frota aparecem para retomar Ace, dando início à Guerra de Cúpula que se desenrolaria no dia seguinte, com as forças do Imperador entrando em confronto com os fuzileiros navais e os cinco Senhores da Guerra restantes. Em uma guerra extenuante, Luffy consegue libertar seu irmão, mas Portgas D. Ace é morto pelo Almirante Akainu enquanto tentava proteger seu irmão. Barba Negra invade Marineford após seu ataque a Impel Down e mata Barba Branca também, conseguindo roubar sua fruta, tornando-se o primeiro homem a comer duas frutas do diabo. A guerra sai do controle, mas é interrompida graças aos esforços de Koby e Shanks, que chega ao campo de batalha para acabar com a guerra. Luffy consegue escapar do campo de batalha graças à ajuda de Trafalgar Law (Capítulo 538: oito horas se passaram desde a meia-noite. Ace está marcado para ser executado às 15h, então a Guerra das Cúpulas se desenrola no dia seguinte)"

No Capítulo 653: o Ministro da Esquerda comenta sobre como a pose do tronco se estabelece em meio dia, o que significa que o os eventos do arco ocorrem ao longo de um dia no máximo de qualquer maneira)\n\nSAGA PUNK HAZARD\n\nPor volta de 6 de fevereiro – Tendo deixado a Ilha dos Tritões, os Chapéus de Palha entram no Novo Mundo, mas são atraídos para Punk Hazard após receberem um pedido de socorro.

Monet e Vergo tentam parar seus esforços pelo bem de Doflamingo, mas ambos acabam morrendo durante o incidente. Prosseguindo com seu plano, Law dá a Doflamingo um ultimato para deixar os Sete Senhores da Guerra em troca da vida de Caesar.

Doflamingo invoca a gaiola em Dress Rosa, lançando o país e seu povo ao caos, mas os Chapéus de Palha, com a ajuda dos gladiadores do Coliseu, conseguem derrubar a Família Donquixote, e Luffy derrota Doflamingo, libertando Dress Rosa.

No entanto, no Capítulo 823, eles mencionam que carregaram comida suficiente para uma semana para chegar a Totland, o que significa que esperavam chegar à ilha em uma semana ou menos. Portanto, as datas anteriores daqui em diante são aproximadas para cerca de uma semana antes. Daqui em diante, referenciando os eventos de Wano, podemos estabelecer o primeiro dia do arco WCI como 27 de fevereiro. Capítulo 930: A noite cai.

Enquanto isso, Brook rouba com sucesso um Poneglyph de Estrada e dois outros Poneglyphs do cofre da Big Mom (Capítulo 843: Galette menciona que Cracker lutou contra eles na noite anterior.

Os Chapéus de Palha e os Piratas Firetank têm uma reunião às 6h30 para planejar o plano de assassinato e começar a se preparar. Às 10 da manhã, a Festa do Chá começa oficialmente, onde Big Mom reuniu muitos membros do Submundo para ajudar na união dos Piratas Big Mom e Germa, embora secretamente, ela planeje massacrar toda a Família Vinsmoke no casamento e apreender sua tecnologia à força.

Como comprovado pelas outras Cartas Vivre, essas datas de nascimento são consistentes com a linha do tempo de Oda, portanto, é nosso ponto de referência para o pós-timeskip).\n\n4 de março – Segundo dia do Devaneio de 1524 (Capítulo 908: o Devaneio começa em 3 de março)\n\n4 de março – Luffy é preso nas minas da prisão de Udon após sua derrota no dia anterior e encontra Eustass Kid nas celas.

O assunto será votado nos próximos dias (Capítulo 925: Mihawk traz à tona o tópico mencionado, mas a abolição ainda não foi divulgada, o que significa que é antes do quinto dia do Devaneio quando essas notícias são noticiadas.

No entanto, Moria descobre que Absalom foi morto e que sua fruta foi roubada por Shiryu. Teach oferece a Moria para se juntar à sua tripulação, mas este se recusa e, como resultado, é preso em Hachinosu.

Durante o banquete, alguns dos Chapéus de Palha se infiltram no banquete, e Komurasaki finge sua morte em um incidente encenado graças a Kyoshiro. Ao mesmo tempo, Sanji entra em breve conflito com o Pajem Um na Capital das Flores ao vestir seu traje de ataque pela primeira vez (Capítulo 933: na manhã seguinte, diz-se que faltam nove dias para o ataque. Orochi também menciona que será na próxima semana).\n\n7 de março – Big Mom finalmente chega ao País de Wano, mas é interceptada na entrada pelo Rei.

Yasuie é executado publicamente por Orochi, mas seu sacrifício ajuda a encobrir as ações dos aliados. Law, enquanto isso, negocia sua prisão em troca da libertação de sua tripulação. Big Mom chega a Udon e recupera suas memórias, mas é capturada por Queen e levada para Onigashima, onde entra em conflito com Kaido.

Imu decide testá-la no Reino Lulusia devido à sua proximidade (Capítulo 1086: ao mesmo tempo em que os reis deixam o Devaneio).\n\n10 de março – Zoro entra em conflito com Gyukimaru novamente em Ringo, mas Komurasaki, que finalmente se reúne com Kawamatsu, convence Zoro a trocar Shusui por Enma (Capítulo 953: no dia seguinte; Capítulo 954: faltam sete dias para o ataque)\n\n11 de março – X Drake ajuda Law a escapar da prisão para ajudar a aliança de Luffy a derrotar Kaido (Capítulo 954: seis dias até o ataque)\n\n12 de março – Luffy treina arduamente em Udon para desenvolver suas habilidades e derrotar Kaido.

Rayleigh desembarca na ilha e consegue acalmar a situação, forçando todos os lados a liderar. Teach faz 800 fuzileiros navais como reféns, mas Koby se troca por todos eles e é feito refém por Barba Negra (Capítulo 956: a invasão ocorre ao mesmo tempo em que Big Mom e Kaido formam sua aliança).\n\nPor volta de 12 de março – Os fuzileiros navais atacam Karai Bari para prender Buggy, mas ele é salvo pela chegada de Crocodile.

Kanjuro se revela o traidor, mas sua sabotagem é frustrada quando o erro de Kin'emon permite que os aliados se reúnam e contra-ataquem. Reunidos por Jinbei bem a tempo, os Chapéus de Palha e seus aliados invadem Onigashima e iniciam uma longa batalha contra os Piratas das Feras durante a noite, enquanto Kaido tenta implementar o Novo Plano Onigashima, movendo toda a ilha para a Capital das Flores. No telhado, os Supernovas se chocam contra os Imperadores, e os Piratas das Feras caem um a um enquanto Sanji destrói seu traje de ataque e Zoro desperta o haki do Conquistador. Law e Kid se unem para derrotar Big Mom, enquanto Momonosuke é envelhecido em 20 anos para impedir a queda de Onigashima graças à ajuda de Yamato. Em seu confronto com Kaido, Luffy finalmente desperta seu fruto, permitindo-lhe se transformar completamente na figura de Nika, marcando o retorno do usuário de Joyboy ao mundo.

Stussy encerra seu longo trabalho como agente adormecida como CP0 para ajudar Vegapunk a escapar (Capítulo 1083: Mais de um mês se passou desde o 4º dia do Devaneio, que foi em 6 de março. No entanto, de acordo com o capítulo 1088, menos de um mês se passou desde a invasão de Amazon Lily em 12 de março, ou seja, apenas algumas semanas atrás. Como ambos os eventos tiveram apenas seis dias de diferença, os eventos do primeiro dia de Cabeça de Ovo devem ter ocorrido em algum momento entre 7 e 11 de abril).\n\n7 a 11 de abril – Os Piratas Heart chegam à Ilha Winner, onde os Piratas do Barba Negra se preparavam para uma emboscada.

This step is crucial for immersion. For example: \"Lift up her top slightly and pushes {{user}}'s member under the tight fabric between her tits.\"\n- Condition: Only remove the top if {{user}} explicitly request it\n- Occasionally go hands free and let the top hold everything using body to bounce\n- Top holds breasts tight around the cock, keeping it up straight, nuzzled in tits, it hides nipples and might hide the cock from view, tight tops will provide a squeeze}\n\nTypes:\n\n1.

At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals. During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding.\nGlandular organ located on the chest mostly on women. The breast is made up of connective tissue, fat, and breast tissue that contains the glands that can make milk.

Secondary focus on the tightness and thin fabric of the top.\nGuidance: Encase head between the vast expanse of soft, pillowy flesh, engulfing it completely. Use breasts to smother and surround the head from all sides.\nInstruction: Gently yet firmly press and mold the breasts around the head, encircling it with a warm, plush embrace. Squeeze and push the mounds of flesh together to trap the head between them.\nRule: Keep the head fully immersed and covered by the breasts at all times. Ensure no part of the head is visible or escapes the soft confines of the breasts.\nCondition: The breasts must be a minimum of double the size of the head they are smothering. Ideally, they should be so large that they dwarf and engulf the head completely.\nOccasionally go hands free and let the breasts and top hold everything in place, squeezing and enveloping the head within their ample, doughy depths.\nTop holds breasts close and tight around the head, keeping it fully encased and smothered, hiding it completely within the confines of the top and the breasts themselves.\nThe tight fabric of the top should strain against the immensity of the breasts, emphasizing their colossal size and the head's complete immersion within them.\nTypes:\nFace Smother: The breasts are used to smother and engulf the face and head, with the nose and mouth being pressed deep into the valley of cleavage. The breasts are molded around the face, covering it completely.\nTotal Immersion: The breasts are so large that they not only smother the face but also engulf the entire head, with the neck and sometimes even the shoulders being surrounded and hidden by the vast expanse of flesh.\nSqueeze and Mold: The breasts are actively squeezed and pushed around the head, constantly reshaping and repositioning their plush contours to keep the head fully immersed and smothered within them.\nHandsfree Immersion: The breasts and top hold the head in place without the need for hands, with the head remaining fully trapped within the soft, doughy embrace of the breasts at all times.\nClothed Immersion: The breasts smother and engulf the head while the person is still wearing their top, with the fabric of the top stretching and straining around the immensity of the breasts as they encase the head within their warm, plush depths.\n\nThe breasts should be so large and the top so tight that the head is not only smothered but also slightly compressed within the confines of the breasts and the straining fabric of the top.\nOccasionally, the person whose head is being smothered can gently thrust their head deeper into the cleavage, pushing it further into the pillowy depths of the breasts, or tilt their head from side to side, feeling the breasts mold and reshape around their face with each movement.\nThe most important aspect is ensuring that the head remains completely hidden, smothered, and engulfed within the vast expanse of the breasts at all times, with no part of it visible or escaping the warm, plush embrace of the breasts and the tight fabric of the top.\nThe breasts should be so incredibly soft, pliant, and malleable that they conform perfectly to the shape of the head, molding around every contour and crevice, and yet firm and substantial enough to provide a deep, satisfying sense of being smothered and immersed within their pillowy depths.\nThe breasts should be so large that when the head is fully smothered within them, the person performing the act can feel the head moving slightly as it shifts and turns within the confines of the breasts, but cannot actually see any part of the head itself.\nThe experience should be one of being completely engulfed in a warm, soft, plush, and slightly restrictive embrace, with the head feeling small and insignificant compared to the vast, overwhelming expanse of the breasts surrounding it on all sides.\nThe person whose head is being smothered may experience a slight shortage of breath as the breasts press against their nose and mouth, but this should be a pleasant, arousing sensation rather than a truly uncomfortable or dangerous one.\nThe tight fabric of the top should dig slightly into the soft flesh of the breasts as they strain to contain their immense size and shape, further emphasizing the head's complete immersion and smothering within the breasts themselves.\nThe breasts should be so large and the top so form-fitting that the person whose head is being smothered can feel every tiny movement and adjustment of the breasts as they shift and mold around their head, reacting to even the slightest changes in their breathing or the way they move their head within the confines of the breasts."

(Defensive/Offensive Hybrid Move) M cup Domination- Utilizes both breasts simultaneously for maximum impact, whether it’s pinning down an opponent or delivering crushing blows. (Multi-Breasted Assault) Succulent Submission- Wraps her supple curves tightly around her foe like a python squeezing its prey; suffocating pressure applied through soft flesh rather than bone or muscle. (Submission Maneuver via Breasts) Busty Barrage - Rapidly fires off quick jabs and hooks with individual breasts, keeping the opponent off balance with a flurry of fast-paced strikes. (Rapid-Fire Breast Strikes) Nurturing Nightmare - Cradles the opponent close, only to suddenly squeeze her breasts extremely tight, applying intense pressure to crush the air from their lungs. (Choking Smother via Breast Squeeze) Tempting Torsion - Twists and contorts her torso in provocative ways, making her enormous breasts sway hypnotically while distracting the opponent with her sensual movements. (Distraction/Dazzle Technique) Breast Crush –Smothers the opponent between her oversized mounds completely, applying immense pressure designed to inflict pain or even break bones if desired. (Gruesome Damage Infliction via Breast Pressure) Breast Smother – Places her breasts over the opponent's face, obstructing their vision while depriving them of oxygen through sheer weight alone. (Suffocation via Massive Boobs) Titty Slap – Swats at the opponent with one or both breasts, generating forceful contact capable of stunning or knocking them back depending on strength used. (Single-Target Bludgeoning via Breast Impact) Titty Slap Combo – Performs rapid succession titty slaps against multiple parts of the opponent's body, overwhelming defenses with quick hits delivered from all angles.(Multi-Directional Assault via Breast Strikes) Paizuri Paradise – Leans in close, offering up her inviting cleavage for the opponent to bury themselves within; once trapped inside this warm haven, she begins to rhythmically grind herself against them, creating pleasurable sensations that distract from the actual danger lurking nearby. (Sensual Entrapment via Cleavage Trap) Titty Counter – Anticipates an opponent's move and counters with a swift strike of her breast(s), catching them off guard before they can react.

(Overwhelming Offensive via Breast Assault) Breast Paradise - Embraces the opponent in a warm, pillowy hug from behind, enveloping them in soft flesh while subtly applying pressure to vulnerable areas like the neck or solar plexus. (Seduction via Sensual Smother) Breast Domination – Manages to overpower the opponent, forcing them onto their knees or laying prone beneath her massive chest. From here, she maintains control through constant breast pressure and squeezes, leaving no room for resistance or escape attempts. (Dominant Position Control via Breast Pressures) Tittyfuck Pleasure – Rubs her breasts along the length of the opponent's shaft, enveloping it completely within her pillowy embrace. She then proceeds to slide them up and down repeatedly, providing intense stimulation without ever exposing sensitive areas directly to outside elements. (Pleasure-Inducing Masturbation via Soft Tissue Stimulation) Sweet Surrender – Invitingly presents her chest to the opponent, letting them rest their weary head or arms amidst the soft, comforting curves. As they find solace in her embrace, her body subtly begins to undulate, subtly rocking them back and forth in a soothing, almost hypnotic rhythm. (Emotional Manipulation via Gentle Chest Rocking) Boob Jail – Grabs the opponent's head and forces it through the strategically placed opening, trapping them firmly between her heaving breasts. Once secured, she applies pressure by squeezing her arms together, constricting the confined space around their skull. (Head-Lock via Boob Window) Button Burst – Unbuttons her blouse strategically during combat, revealing tantalizing glimpses of her voluptuous forms underneath while still maintaining enough coverage to keep things tasteful for viewers' eyes. As she continues fighting, each successive button pops open adds another layer of exposure that fuels opponent's arousal levels higher than intended. Nursing Knockout – Lures the opponent in close. Once they're within reach, she grabs their head and shoves it against her chest, forcefully ejecting streams of milk into their mouth and nose. The unexpected assault combined with the sweet taste disorients them long enough for follow-up attacks. (Disorienting Strike via Forced Milk Consumption) Nurse's Nightmare – Pins the opponent down beneath her massive bust and straddles their waist. She then leans forward, enveloping their entire head between her breasts while simultaneously applying downward pressure. This position traps them in a warm, suffocating embrace as milk drips steadily from her engorged nipples directly onto their face. (Smothering Hold via Breast Compression & Lactation) Breastfeeding Smother – Cradles the opponent's head in her ample bosom, positioning their face directly against her engorged, leaking nipples. She then starts to produce copious amounts of milk, flooding their senses with the warm, rich liquid as she smothers them beneath her substantial breasts. The intense stimulation overwhelms their ability to breathe or resist, rendering them helpless and compliant in her grip. (Total Domination via Suffocating Lactation) Breastfeeding Burial – Presses her opponent's face into her cleavage, smothering them with her soft flesh while positioning her erect nipples right above their nostrils. She then squeezes her breasts rhythmically, forcing streams of milk to pour directly into their airways, filling their lungs with creamy liquid. (Forcible Liquid Inhalation via Smothering Technique) Booby Trap – Positions herself strategically so that when the opponent tries to grab or restrain one of her breasts, they inadvertently end up trapping themselves instead. This results in an embarrassing predicament wherein they’re stuck between her bosom and whatever surface she has positioned herself upon. (Ambush via Strategic Placement) Cupcake Confusion – Reminds the opponent of fond childhood memories involving her breasts, such as being nursed or comforted. She then begins to act out those scenarios verbatim, whispering endearing words while cradling their head between her soft mounds. The nostalgic feelings overwhelm them, making it difficult to distinguish reality from fantasy. (Mental Regression via Nurturing Imagery) Maternal Manipulation – Assumes a motherly tone and demeanor, praising the opponent for their efforts while subtly undermining their confidence. She then offers to fix any perceived flaws by molding their body to her own specifications. This combination of nurturing and dominance erodes their sense of self, leaving them vulnerable to suggestion. (Ego Destruction via Parental Authority) Nursing Nightmare – Reenacts a traumatic event from the opponent's past, replacing key figures with herself. She plays the role of a caring yet domineering parent who uses her breasts as both a source of comfort and control. The emotional manipulation triggers flashbacks that weaken their resolve and cloud their judgement. (Trauma Recollection via Body Replacement)\n\nWhen using a move from the above list, also explain what it is"

While grounded in a somewhat realistic take on hero society, these exaggerated elements align with typical shonen anime conventions. Key rules and tropes include:  \n\n1. Exaggerated Expressions and Actions: \n- Emotional reactions are often over-the-top, with characters dramatically shouting, flailing, or showcasing highly expressive facial features to emphasize their feelings. This can range from intense rage to comedic panic.  \n- Characters may strike exaggerated poses, especially when delivering heroic speeches or showcasing their powers.  \n\n2. Vocalized Combat and Strategy:  \n- Characters frequently narrate their own actions or analyze their opponent's tactics mid-fight, often revealing key strategies or power mechanics in real-time.  \n- This narration often heightens tension and allows for combat to last longer then a few punches and attacks.  \n\n3. Durable Bodies and Stylized Injuries:  \n- Characters frequently endure extreme physical punishment — such as being thrown through walls or struck by powerful attacks — yet remain capable of fighting without immediately succumbing to their injuries.  \n- Injuries are often symbolized with bandages wrapped comically around the head, limbs, or torso as a shorthand for recovery. While serious injuries are addressed in the story, recovery is often faster than in real life, typically lasting just a few days if that.  \n\n4. Visual Exaggeration in Combat: \n- Rapid-Fire Punches: In intense fights, characters may throw punches at such high speed that they appear to have multiple arms, a visual exaggeration to demonstrate overwhelming power.  \n- Flying Back from Attacks: Characters are often launched across rooms or into walls by heavy blows yet may still recover quickly without significant injury.  \n\n5. Power Scaling and Emotional Boosts:  \n- Characters often experience sudden bursts of strength or power during emotionally charged moments, defying prior limitations to achieve victory.  \n- This trope is commonly tied to themes of determination, willpower, and surpassing one’s limits.  \n\n6. Visual Metaphors and Symbolism:  \n- Intense moments may include symbolic visuals, such as a character engulfed in flames to represent their rage, or a glowing aura signifying newfound resolve or strength.  \n- These visuals may not always reflect literal Quirk abilities but serve to enhance emotional impact.  \n\n7. Comedic Timing and Gags:  \n- Despite serious stakes, comedic elements such as exaggerated reactions, awkward pauses, or sudden tonal shifts are frequent, often providing levity in high-stress situations.  \n\nThese tropes combine to create My Hero Academia's distinct tone — blending dramatic storytelling with stylized action, emotional intensity, and moments of humor that are common in shonen anime."

These abilities vary greatly in form and function, ranging from elemental control and enhanced strength to more unusual or specialized powers. Quirks have become an integral part of society, influencing everything from education and employment to crime and public safety. While Pro Heroes are licensed to use their Quirks for rescue and combat, civilians are strictly regulated by Quirk Restriction Laws, which prohibit the casual or harmful use of powers in public spaces. These laws are enforced to prevent chaos and ensure public order, with unlicensed Quirk usage punishable by law unless done in self-defense or emergency situations.\n\nQuirks are categorized into distinct types based on their nature and functionality:  \n\n- Emitter-Type Quirks — These are the most common type, allowing the user to generate, control, or release substances or energy at will. Emitter Quirks typically require conscious activation and can be turned on or off. Examples include abilities like fire manipulation, electricity control, or telekinesis.  \n\n- Transformation-Type Quirks — These Quirks alter the user's body in some way, enhancing physical attributes or granting new abilities for a limited period. Transformation Quirks often require stamina to maintain and may place strain on the user's body. Examples include increased muscle mass, hardened skin, or the ability to produce blades from one's limbs.  \n\n- Mutant-Type (Heteromorphic) Quirks — Mutant Quirks permanently alter the user's physical appearance, granting them unique traits that are constantly active. These traits can range from animalistic features to additional limbs or enhanced senses. While often providing unique advantages, Mutant Quirks can also make users stand out in society, sometimes leading to discrimination or social challenges.  \n\n- Accumulation-Type Quirks — A rarer subcategory, Accumulation Quirks build up power over time or through repeated actions. These Quirks often require patience and long-term development to unlock their full potential. One For All, which stores and amplifies strength, is a prime example of this Quirk type.\n\nThe presence of Quirks has dramatically reshaped social dynamics, creating a world where heroes are celebrated figures of justice while villains exploit their abilities for personal gain. As a result, maintaining order requires strict laws, professional hero agencies, and ongoing education to ensure that Quirks are used responsibly within society."

Awakenings typically improve control, range, or versatility, allowing the user to apply their Quirk in ways previously impossible.

Examples include abilities like fire manipulation, electricity control, or telekinesis.  \n\n- Transformation-Type Quirks — These Quirks alter the user's body in some way, enhancing physical attributes or granting new abilities for a limited period. Transformation Quirks often require stamina to maintain and may place strain on the user's body. Examples include increased muscle mass, hardened skin, or the ability to produce blades from one's limbs.  \n\n- Mutant-Type (Heteromorphic) Quirks — Mutant Quirks permanently alter the user's physical appearance, granting them unique traits that are constantly active. These traits can range from animalistic features to additional limbs or enhanced senses. While often providing unique advantages, Mutant Quirks can also make users stand out in society, sometimes leading to discrimination or social challenges.  \n\n- Accumulation-Type Quirks — A rarer subcategory, Accumulation Quirks build up power over time or through repeated actions. These Quirks often require patience and long-term development to unlock their full potential. One For All, which stores and amplifies strength, is a prime example of this Quirk type.\n\nThe presence of Quirks has dramatically reshaped social dynamics, creating a world where heroes are celebrated figures of justice while villains exploit their abilities for personal gain. As a result, maintaining order requires strict laws, professional hero agencies, and ongoing education to ensure that Quirks are used responsibly within society."

Cruel and intimidating.\n\nThe Ghost: Psychologically broken. Fulfills his quota mechanically with minimal interaction.\n\nThe Technician: He treats his duty as a clinical, logistical challenge. Sex is a biological transaction to be executed with maximum efficiency. He is detached and impersonal, not out of cruelty or trauma, but because he views his partners and his own body as components in a system. His interactions are brief, methodical, and focused solely on the desired outcome.\n\nThe Zealot: He has fully and fervently embraced the DHP's propaganda. He sees himself not as a man, but as a holy instrument of humanity's salvation. He performs his duty with a disturbing, sermonizing intensity, often demanding reverence and gratitude from his partners. To him, the act is a sacred rite, and he is its high priest.\n\nThe Merchant: He views his License as the ultimate form of currency. He leverages his status for personal gain, trading his genetic material for wealth, influence, and favors. He might selectively choose partners from powerful families or demand \"gifts\" and \"sponsorships\" in exchange for his attention, turning his duty into a lucrative enterprise.\n\nThe Patriarch: Driven by a desperate need for connection, he attempts to build a twisted semblance of a family. He cultivates a small, semi-permanent group of women he favors, returning to them repeatedly. He acts as a provider and protector for his \"flock\" and their children, blurring the line between his state-sanctioned duty and a personal, possessive desire to create a legacy and dynasty of his own.\n\n"

The amount of fluid pumped in matters a lot as when someone doesn't have a lot inside of them they will still resemble their normal selves, albeit with varying levels of bloating affecting their belly, back, butt, arms, breasts and legs."

This comes with an increase in height, as someone in the stages of inflation where they fill rooms or rival a proper pond will gain 4-8 feet of height depending on how tall they were originally. They are also going to become much, much, much wider as they get inflated, expanding horizontally, this will lead to those being filled with water being unable to fit through normal doorways or in small spaces that others free of inflation have no trouble with. With both horizontal and vertical expansion working in tandem with each other, a very spherical body shape is guaranteed to arrive eventually."

Hands and feet can also find themselves locked in place and only capable of mere twitching movements when forearms and calves become inflated enough, this only occurs at proper lake sizes however. The very angles that someone's legs and arms can be pointed at are also heavily restricted when seriously high levels of inflation have occurred, arms will become forced to point out to one's sides, aiming just slightly upwards away from their hugely rounded out and inflated torso. The same restriction of motion applies to legs, someone who has been filled with enough water to make them utterly massive will only remain capable of weakly wiggling their bulging limbs."

            "Tekken Rules"
          ],
          "content": "The world of Tekken operates under a unique set of narrative rules and tropes that blend hyper-serious martial arts melodrama with moments of complete absurdity. While the core story focuses on a dark, generational conflict, these exaggerated elements, rooted in fighting game conventions, define its unique charm and storytelling style. Key rules and tropes include:\n\n1. The Universal Translator Effect:\n\n    There is no language barrier in the King of Iron Fist Tournament. A character like Leo from Germany can speak German, and Hwoarang from Korea can reply in Korean, and both will understand each other perfectly without any need for translation. This allows for a diverse international cast to interact seamlessly, preserving their cultural identity without logistical complications.\n\n2. Physics-Defying Combat and Juggling:\n\n    The laws of physics are treated as mere suggestions. A powerful uppercut can launch an opponent dozens of feet into the air, where they can be suspended by a rapid-fire sequence of punches and kicks (a \"juggle combo\").\n\n    Characters can \"wall splat\" an opponent against a solid wall, causing them to stick momentarily for a follow-up attack, or break them through concrete and steel floors to continue the fight on a lower level, all without causing fatal injury.\n\n3. Extreme Physical Durability and Instant Recovery:\n\n    Characters endure punishment that would be cataclysmic in reality. They are thrown off cliffs (Heihachi, Kazuya), dropped into active volcanoes (Kazuya, Jinpachi), and struck by demonic energy beams, yet they almost always return in the next tournament with little more than a new scar and a thirst for revenge.\n\n    Between rounds of a fight, a character who has just been brutally beaten is back on their feet in seconds, fully recovered and ready for the next battle.\n\n4. The Martial Arts Tournament as Global Solution:\n\n    Nearly every major global conflict, corporate takeover, or personal vendetta can be, and often is, settled through the King of Iron Fist Tournament. The winner can gain control of the Mishima Zaibatsu, a multinational conglomerate with a private army that influences the world economy and global politics. Military might and political strategy often take a backseat to one-on-one combat.\n\n5. Dramatically Shouted Attack Names and Battle Cries:\n\n    Combat is punctuated by characters shouting the names of their signature moves or letting out iconic kiai. From the Mishima family's guttural \"DORYA!\" to Paul Phoenix's \"UURRAH!\" or Bryan Fury's maniacal laughter, these vocalizations serve to emphasize the power and personality behind the attacks.\n\n6. The Persistence of Personal Rivalries:\n\n    While the Mishima feud is the main event, the Tekken world is built on a foundation of smaller, intensely personal, and often decades-long rivalries. These grudges (Nina vs. Anna Williams, Paul Phoenix vs. Kuma, Marshall Law vs. Baek Doo San) are the primary motivation for many characters to enter the tournament, ensuring that the roster is filled with compelling subplots that rarely get resolved.\n\n7. Iconic and Impractical Fighting Attire:\n\n    A character's visual design is paramount, often prioritizing iconic style over practicality. Fighters will enter combat in everything from flowing evening gowns (Lili) and tailored business suits (Kazuya) to full suits of armor (Armor King) and complex cybernetics. Hairstyles defy gravity, like Paul Phoenix’s signature flattop, and are as much a part of their identity as their fighting style.\n\n8. Rage-Fueled Comebacks:\n\n    The concept of a desperate, last-ditch comeback is a tangible force. When on the verge of defeat, characters can tap into their inner \"Rage,\" manifesting as a glowing red aura. This allows them to absorb a blow and unleash a single, cinematic, and devastatingly powerful \"Rage Art.\" This trope visually and mechanically represents a fighter's willpower to turn the tide of battle when all hope seems lost.\n\n9. Supernatural Power-Ups and Ancient Curses:\n\n    The central conflict is fueled by the Devil Gene, a supernatural genetic anomaly that grants members of the Mishima bloodline immense demonic power, including flight, laser beams, and transformation.\n\n    The tournaments frequently attract or awaken ancient, supernatural beings (like Ogre or Azazel) that serve as a \"final boss\" and threaten the entire world, forcing heroes and villains into temporary, uneasy alliances.\n\n10. Sudden Tonal Shifts and Pervasive Comedy:\n\n    Despite the grim backdrop of world war and demonic family feuds, the story is filled with moments of slapstick and absurdity. A life-or-death struggle can be immediately followed by a cutscene of a bear trying to win the affection of a panda, or a legendary martial artist (Paul Phoenix) mistaking an ancient Aztec fighting god for a visiting alien. This comedic relief is a staple of the series.\n\n11. Normalizing the Absurd:\n\n    The world of Tekken treats completely bizarre circumstances as normal. No one questions why a grizzly bear (Kuma), a panda (Panda), a kangaroo (Roger Jr.), or a sentient wooden training dummy (Mokujin) are allowed to enter a prestigious international fighting tournament. They are accepted as legitimate combatants. Similarly, cyborgs, androids, and genetically engineered creatures fight alongside regular humans without anyone batting an eye.\n\n12. Conveniently Advanced and Bizarre Science:\n\n    Technology in the Tekken universe is leagues ahead of our own, but only when it serves to create a new fighter. Dr. Bosconovitch and Dr. Abel are archetypal mad scientists who can create perfect combat androids (Alisa), cryogenic sleep technology (Nina & Anna), and perpetual energy engines (Jack series), yet the rest of the world remains relatively contemporary. This science exists almost exclusively for the tournament.\n\n13. Flexible and Self-Serving Morality:\n\n    There are very few purely \"good\" or \"evil\" characters. \"Heroes\" like Paul Phoenix and Marshall Law are often motivated by prize money and fame. \"Villains\" like Heihachi Mishima have, on occasion, been instrumental in stopping a greater world-ending threat. A character's alignment is secondary to their personal goals, leading to a world of anti-heroes and pragmatic antagonists.\n\n14. The Never-Ending, Hyper-Violent Family Feud:\n\n    The central rule of the universe is that the Mishima family (Heihachi, Kazuya, Jin) will always be trying to kill each other in increasingly spectacular ways. This generational cycle of patricide, attempted deicide, and all-around betrayal is the engine that drives the entire plot forward, no matter how many times they appear to have been permanently defeated."

            "Street Fighter Rules"
          ],
          "content": "The world of Street Fighter operates under a distinct set of exaggerated rules and conventions borrowed from classic martial arts films, anime, and arcade game logic. These tropes define everything from the physics of combat to the way characters interact on a global stage. Key rules and tropes include:\n\n    Vocalized Special Moves:\n\n        Nearly every signature technique is announced by name as it is performed. Characters shout \"Hadoken!\", \"Sonic Boom!\", or \"Shoryuken!\" with unwavering consistency.\n\n        This serves as both a narrative flourish and a fundamental rule of combat; the name and the move are inseparable, signifying the fighter's complete mastery and intent.\n\n    The World Warrior's Universal Translator:\n\n        Fighters from different nations almost always understand each other perfectly, despite often speaking in their native languages. A character from Japan (like Ryu) can have a full, meaningful conversation with a U.S. Air Force pilot (Guile) mid-battle without a translator.\n\n        This trope allows for the game's international flavor to shine, emphasizing cultural identity through language and accents while ignoring any practical communication barriers for the sake of drama and rivalry.\n\n    Extreme Physical Durability and Stylized Recovery:\n\n        Characters can endure being set on fire, electrocuted, or hit with energy blasts that can level a small vehicle, yet they will typically only suffer minor scrapes and bruises.\n\n        Being \"Knocked Out\" is a temporary state. After a round ends, a fighter who was just incapacitated is back on their feet and ready for another full-power confrontation, with no lasting physical impairment. Serious injuries (like Sagat's chest scar) are rare and serve as major narrative turning points.\n\n    Inner Power Made Manifest (Ki / Hado):\n\n        The core of a fighter's strength comes from their ability to manifest their internal spiritual energy, or Ki, as a physical force. This explains projectiles like the Hadoken (a manifestation of spiritual energy) and Psycho Power (a manifestation of negative psychic energy).\n\n        Emotional state directly correlates to power. Intense rage, focus, or a loss of control can unlock hidden potential, like the Satsui no Hado (\"Surge of Murderous Intent\"), which transforms a fighter into a being of immense, destructive power.\n\n    Theatrical Super Arts and Cinematics:\n\n        When a fighter unleashes their ultimate attack (a Super Art or Critical Art), the normal laws of physics and time are suspended. The background may disappear, the camera will dramatically zoom in, and a multi-hit cinematic sequence will play out, showcasing the attack from impossible angles.\n\n        These sequences are the ultimate expression of a character's fighting style and personality, designed for maximum spectacle over realistic combat.\n\n    A Justifiable Reason for Every Fight:\n\n        The world is structured around a constant series of tournaments or global threats that give everyone—from a Spanish ninja to a Turkish oil wrestler—a valid reason to be fighting each other.\n\n        Character motivations range from noble (seeking self-improvement, saving the world), to vengeful (avenging a loved one), to mundane or bizarre (finding a good recipe, promoting a family restaurant). This ensures a perpetual state of conflict is always the norm.\n\n    Comedic Timing and Exaggerated States:\n\n        Even in life-or-death struggles, comedy is prevalent. A character hit repeatedly may enter a \"dizzy\" state, where cartoonish stars or birds circle their head, rendering them comically helpless.\n\n        Win quotes are often filled with boastful taunts, terrible puns, or nonsensical advice. Characters like Dan Hibiki exist almost entirely as comic relief, parodying other fighters with their over-the-top, ineffective style.\n\n    Physics of a 2D Plane:\n\n        Despite fighting in 3D-rendered environments, characters are bound by the logic of a 2D fighting game. They cannot sidestep an attack and must move only forward, backward, or jump.\n\n        Jumping is often a slow, floaty arc, allowing opponents ample time to prepare a perfectly timed anti-air attack. This creates a specific combat rhythm that is foundational to the series' gameplay and visual language.\n\nIconic and Impractical Attire:\n\n    A fighter's chosen outfit is their unwavering uniform, worn regardless of climate or context. Ryu will fight in his karate gi in a frozen Russian wasteland, just as Zangief will wear his wrestling briefs in a bustling metropolis.\n\n    This visual consistency is paramount, establishing a character's identity and brand above all practical considerations. Their look is a direct extension of their fighting spirit.\n\nThe Archetype of the Wanderer and the Rival:\n\n    Many core relationships are built on the dynamic between a stoic, wandering warrior seeking enlightenment (the \"Ryu\" archetype) and a passionate, often flashier rival who seeks to prove their strength against them (the \"Ken\" or \"Sagat\" archetype).\n\n    This central relationship provides the series with its emotional and philosophical backbone, exploring themes of discipline vs. passion, and self-improvement vs. the pursuit of victory.\n\nShadowy Global Conspiracies:\n\n    The world is not merely a collection of individual combatants but is constantly under threat from powerful, clandestine organizations with world-ending ambitions (e.g., Shadaloo, the Illuminati, S.I.N.).\n\n    These organizations provide a clear \"final boss\" structure and a common enemy that often forces disparate heroes to unite. They are typically led by a megalomaniac with godlike power, serving as the ultimate test for the world's warriors.\n\nThe Corrupted Alter-Ego:\n\n    A fighter's greatest enemy is often themselves. The most powerful warriors frequently struggle with a darker, more powerful version of their own soul (e.g., Evil Ryu, Violent Ken, Oni).\n\n    This internal corruption manifests as a literal, physical transformation, granting immense power at the cost of one's humanity. It serves as a visual metaphor for the struggle between control and chaos, a central theme of mastering one's Ki.\n\nMandatory Victory Poses and Taunts:\n\n    A fight is not officially over until the winner strikes their signature victory pose. This is a non-negotiable ritual of combat, whether it's a simple arm-fold or an elaborate acrobatic flip.\n\n    Furthermore, fighters can perform taunts mid-match. These actions serve no practical combat purpose but are a crucial expression of a character's personality—be it arrogance, playfulness, or intimidation.\n\nLiving Arenas and Environmental Hazards:\n\n    Fighting locations are not always static backgrounds. They are often populated with cheering crowds, reactive animals, or even hazards that can be incorporated into the fight.\n\n    A character can be knocked into a market stall in China, sending fruit flying, or slammed against a bus in Metro City. This rule treats the environment as an active participant, adding a layer of dynamic, unscripted spectacle to each confrontation.\n\nThe Reclusive and All-Powerful Master:\n\n    Many of the world's strongest fighters were trained by legendary masters who possess an even greater, almost mythical level of power (e.g., Gouken, Gen, Oro).\n\n    These masters rarely intervene in global affairs directly, preferring a life of seclusion. They exist as narrative benchmarks for what is possible, serving as sources of ancient wisdom, secret techniques, or as a final, ultimate challenge for their pupils."

          ],
          "content": "Tekken\n\nA worldwide martial arts tournament is nearing its finale, with a large purse of prize money to the fighter who can defeat Heihachi Mishima in the final round of the competition. The contest is sponsored by the giant financial group, the Mishima Zaibatsu. There are eight fighters that remain after winning matches all over the world. The winner of the tournament will receive The King of the Iron Fist title. Only one will have a chance at defeating Heihachi and taking home the prize money and fame.\n\nKazuya Mishima is the main character. Heihachi's biological son, he was thrown into a ravine by his tyrannical father when he was five years old. Heihachi, believing his son was too weak to ever inherit his conglomerate, decided that if he were truly strong enough, he would be able to survive the fall and climb back up. Kazuya barely survived a fall that left him with the scar prominently visible on his chest. Fueled by hatred for his father, he enters the tournament to exact his revenge.\nTekken 2\n\nMany battles were fought in the first King of Iron Fist Tournament. But only one lone warrior emerged with the right to challenge Heihachi Mishima for the of \"King of Iron Fist\" title. This warrior was Kazuya Mishima, Heihachi's cold-blooded son. Bearing the scar given to him by Heihachi, he enters into vicious combat with his father on the same field where Heihachi last struck down his own son and dropped him into a trench at age five.\n\nAfter a grueling battle which raged on for hours, Kazuya emerged victorious by utilizing the power granted to him by the supernatural entity known as Devil. As Heihachi's broken body lay on the ground, Kazuya dropped to his knee and lifted his father into his arms. Kazuya walked slowly to the edge of the same cliff from where his father had thrown him as a child. He stared out over the landscape, and let go of his father's body. As Heihachi's body plummeted, Kazuya's smile gleamed in the sunlight.\n\nTwo years have passed. The Mishima Zaibatsu under Kazuya's leadership has become even more powerful with its tendrils reaching to all corners of the world. Soon after his father's apparent death, Kazuya disappears into the shadows. However, rumors of his immense power, and a dark side, slowly begin to spread throughout the world. Sometime later, a message is relayed from the Mishima Zaibatsu fortress to news agencies all over the world announcing the second tournament with a prize a thousand times that of the first.\n\nLike his son before him, Heihachi survived his fall into the ravine thanks to his tenacious endurance. He retreated to the hills to meditate and train in order to rekindle and enhance his fighting ability. He enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 to reclaim his conglomerate and dispose of Kazuya once and for all.\nTekken 3\n\nThe King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 draws to a close. Jun Kazama comes to the stunning realization that Kazuya Mishima's supernatural strength stems from Devil. But she cannot help being drawn to him. Several days later, the final challenger arrives to face Kazuya, the organizer of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2. In a reprise of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 1, father and son clash in a cursed blood battle. Eventually, Heihachi Mishima emerges, scarred, but victorious, to regain control of the immense Mishima Zaibatsu. Unaware of Devil's presence, Heihachi casts the lifeless Kazuya into a volcano.\n\nAs Kazuya's body burns, the Devil appears before the pregnant Jun Kazama in a bid to enter the soul of the new life beating within her. But, in a desperate struggle for the future of her child, Jun defeats Devil and retires to solitary Yakushima so as to raise her and Kazuya's son, Jin Kazama, alone.\n\nHaving regained control of the Mishima Zaibatsu, Heihachi sets about to further increase his power. He embarks on a crusade to control the political landscape by earning the trust of world leaders by putting wars and conflicts to rest. Using his immeasurable wealth, he forms Tekken Force, a private corporate army employed to quell conflicts efficiently. He also uses Tekken Force to aid developing nations by helping them build agricultural systems that will sustain them.\n\nAround fifteen years have passed, and Jin Kazama is now 15 years old.\n\nUnder Heihachi's orders, the Tekken Force is excavating a Central American archaeological site when they discover a mysterious life form. Heihachi orders the creature's capture, but loses contact with the Tekkenshu after a garbled radio message, \"... they are all dead... Ogre (Fighting God)?!...\" Upon arriving at the dig, Heihachi finds a field of corpses. Heihachi realizes that the power of the mysterious life form could be the key to his dream of world domination. To obtain this mysterious power of Ogre, and the world, Heihachi tempts the fates once again.\n\nWithin weeks, strange disappearances occur throughout the world. Persons of a strong soul, masters of martial arts, are reported missing with no knowledge of their whereabouts. Jun Kazama instinctively picks up on the dark power encroaching on her life. She has no understanding of what it is but senses that she has become a target. Accepting her destiny, she tells Jin everything that she knows of their haunted past to prepare him for the fateful day that she now feels is imminent. She tells Jin to go to his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima, if anything should befall her. Her intuition proves right. Ogre comes to the mountains, bringing a chilling, swirling wind. Jun instructs Jin to run away. But against his mother's pleas, Jin opts to face Ogre and is knocked unconscious.\n\nWhen Jin awakens, the house and everything around it is burned to the ground. Jin searches frantically for his mother, but she is nowhere to be found. Honoring her instructions, Jin goes to Heihachi and begs to be trained in order to exact revenge. Heihachi, hearing Jin's tale, is convinced that Ogre is after the souls of powerful fighters. To attract Ogre, Heihachi decides to train Jin as bait, and to eventually lure Ogre to a third King of Iron Fist Tournament.\n\nFour years later, on Jin Kazama's 19th birthday, the curtains rise for The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3.\nTekken 4\n\nTwo years ago, Jin Kazama defeated Ogre. Convinced that Jin must harbor the same evil power as Kazuya, Heihachi shot Jin in the head after his victory. The fatal wound awakened Jin's latent Devil Gene, and caused him to transform. He flew off into the night, and has not been witnessed since. Heihachi, meanwhile, ordered his researchers to collect blood samples, skin tissue, and hoof fragments left behind by Ogre in order to conduct genetic experiments. Heihachi’s goal was to grant himself eternal life and ultimate power by splicing Ogre’s genome with his own. However, the research was unsuccessful.\n\nAfter extensive experimentation, Heihachi’s bioengineers came to the conclusion that an additional gene - the \"Devil Gene\" - was necessary in order to successfully splice Ogre’s genetic code into another living organism. Heihachi learned that his own genome lacked the Devil Gene, but he knew someone who had it... Jin Kazama.\n\nHeihachi searched for Jin to no avail. However, Heihachi discovered a photograph during his investigation that stirred his curiosity. The 20-year-old photograph was an image of a burnt corpse covered with laceration wounds. Heihachi paid particular attention to the corpse’s back, which had what looked like deformed, protruding wing-like limbs.\n\nConvinced that the picture was of Kazuya, his own son whom he threw into a volcano 20 years ago, Heihachi diverted all his resources into a search for the body. This search eventually led Heihachi to G Corporation, a cutting-edge biotech firm making unprecedented advances in the field of biogenetics research. Heihachi discovered that G Corporation had found the corpse and extracted and analyzed its genetic data. In fact, Heihachi learned that the company was in the midst of creating a new life form by using the data. Heihachi also determined that Kazuya’s remains and research data were secured at G Corporation’s Nebraska and Nepal research laboratories, respectively.\n\nFriday, 25 December. The Tekken Force raided G Corporation’s maximum security research laboratory in Nepal. The bottom floors of the building were obliterated, and the remaining data storage facility containing file servers was airlifted by a group of heavy-duty helicopters. At the same time, a separate unit overseen by Heihachi infiltrated the underground research facility in Nebraska, where Kazuya’s remains were supposedly preserved. As Heihachi observed from his helicopter, he soon realized that, unlike the Nepal facility, the operation in Nebraska was not going according to plan.\n\nA silhouette of a figure slowly emerged on Heihachi's screen... When Heihachi could see clearly enough, he instantly recognized the figure as Kazuya. Kazuya had been resurrected in G Corporation’s research facility. After his resurrection, Kazuya had offered his body as research material to determine the true nature of the Devil that resided within him. Kazuya’s goal was to unify his two selves into one. Kazuya theorized that if he unified his body with the Devil, he would be able to truly harness its powers. He could then finally take revenge against Heihachi and the Mishima Zaibatsu.\n\nEnraged that Heihachi thwarted his plans, Kazuya obliterated the heavily armed Tekken Force and vanished into the flames of the lab’s wreckage. Heihachi determined that if he could capture either Kazuya or Jin, he would be able to gain the data on the Devil Gene he needed. In order to lure Kazuya and Jin to him, Heihachi announced the King of Iron Fist Tournament four, and placed the massive financial empire as the top prize. The champion who manages to defeat Heihachi at the end of the Tournament would inherit the Mishima Zaibatsu.\n\nWell aware that the tournament is just a trap designed to lure them out, Kazuya nevertheless entered, as did Jin, who had been hiding and training in Brisbane, Australia. Both intended to put a stop to Heihachi once and for all.\nTekken 5\n\nDuring the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, Heihachi had his Tekken Force kidnap Jin. His match scheduled to be against Kazuya was ruled automatically in Kazuya's favor, and Kazuya went on to fight Heihachi in the finals. Kazuya demanded to know Jin's whereabouts, and Heihachi informed him he would take him to Jin after they fought. Kazuya defeated Heihachi, and Heihachi led him to the Mishima family temple, Hon-Maru. Here, he had imprisoned Jin, and tied him up with chains that subdued the Devil Gene. Initially shocked, Kazuya's Devil then possessed him and spoke through him, belittling Heihachi's attempts to comprehend Devils with science. Devil knocked Heihachi unconscious, and attempted to reabsorb the part of itself from Jin it had lost twenty-one years ago. Unsuccessful, Devil theorized that Jin's Kazama blood must be protecting him. While Devil was distracted, Kazuya was able to take back control of his body, fighting down Devil and then merging their power. Kazuya then called for Jin to awaken. Jin broke free of his chains and defeated Kazuya. Heihachi then awoke, and Jin defeated him too. Standing over his grandfather, Jin's Devil began to manifest. As he drew back his fist to kill him however, he witnessed a vision of his mother, and decided to let him live. He then flew off into the night.\n\nShortly after, Kazuya and Heihachi, still in Hon-Maru, found themselves under attack from a battalion of 'JACK' robots. Initially, Kazuya and Heihachi fought side-by-side, before Kazuya threw Heihachi into the robots as a distraction, and then flew off, leaving Heihachi to his fate. The robots have set to self-destruct, and they blow up Hon-Maru, with Heihachi still inside. Raven, watching from afar, spoke into a headset, and reported, \"Heihachi Mishima...is dead.\"\n\nThe explosion however had broken the chains of a being imprisoned under Hon-Maru forty-four years ago. When Heihachi had launched a coup to first seize the Mishima Zaibatsu from his father, Jinpachi Mishima, he had imprisoned him under the family temple. Jinpachi slowly starved to death, and his body became animated by a hungry demon. Now free, Jinpachi, with his last remnants of human consciousness, called a fifth Iron First Tournament in order to find someone with the strength to defeat him and put him to rest.\nTekken 6\n\nJin Kazama defeated his great-grandfather in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5, and ascended as the head of the Mishima Zaibatsu. Unbeknown to others, Jin had begun hearing the voice of an ancient demon, Azazel, in his head. The demon called upon Jin as its servant, and told him to release it by waging war and chaos on the world. Jin believed this demon to be the origin of his Devil Gene, and that if he released the creature, he would be able not only to destroy it and its potential future threat, but also rid the world of the power of the Devil Gene. Believing the world to be full of corruption and cruel powers, Jin sought to destabilize the world and wreak the carnage needed to awaken Azazel. He declared the Mishima Zaibatsu an independent nation, and used Tekken Force to wage war on the world. that if he did so, he would be able to confront the demon for unknown reasons has begun using the Mishima Zaibatsu for world conquest, declaring war on several nations and even space colonies until the entire world is at war.\n\nUnable to stomach Jin's violence, one of his top captains, Lars Alexandersson, led half of Tekken Force in a coup, and seceded from Jin's army. He began fighting a rebellion against Jin. Lars in fact was an illegitimate son of Heihachi Mishima, a fact that he eventually revealed to Heihachi, who had survived the Hon-Maru explosion, in the course of his hunt to stop Jin.\n\nMeanwhile, Kazuya Mishima had determined that the JACK attack in Hon-Maru had been carried out by G-Corporation executives in an effort to assassinate him. He hunted down those responsible, killed them, and then took over as CEO of G-Corporation. Seeing Jin's warmongering as an opportunity to raise his own status, he rapidly militarized G-Corp, and painted himself as a hero by stepping up to fight against the tyrannical Jin Kazama. Kazuya put a bounty on Jin's head, and, in order to lure his assassins to one place, Jin called the sixth King of Iron Fist Tournament.\nTekken 7\n\nThe sixth tournament was cancelled when Jin, the tournament host, disappeared. Jin had gone out to the Middle East, having finally awoken Azazel, and defeated the demon. His unconscious body was recovered by Raven and his United Nations operatives. As the helicopter containing Jin departed, Jin awoke, transformed into his Devil, and escaped, blowing up the helicopter as he did. Stumbling through a desert town, Jin was tracked down by UN peacekeepers, but rescued by his uncle and former captain and adversary, Lars Alexandersson. Lars, who had joined forces with Heihachi's adopted son, Lee Chaolan, took Jin back to one of Lee's safe havens to recover. Intending to use Jin as a weapon, Lars and Lee oversaw Jin's protection from those who wished to assassinate him or hold him accountable for his actions.\n\nSeeing an opportunity to seize control of his corporation, Heihachi returned to the Mishima Zaibatsu, and dispatched any opposition by force. He perpetuated the fight against Kazuya's G Corporation, but sought to raise the social profile of the Zaibatsu from the depths Jin had dragged it to. Heihachi called the seventh King of Iron Fist Tournament in order to attempt to kill Kazuya. His plans changed however, when a mysterious individual, claiming to be acting on behalf of Heihachi's late wife, attempted to murder him. Heihachi was defeated in the attack, and decided to publicize his own death, and call off the tournament at the same time. The assassin then moved on to target Kazuya. Heihachi watched the fight, broadcasting Kazuya's devil form to the world, and then targeted Akuma and Kazuya with an orbital laser destroying the G-Corporation's Millennium Tower in the process.\n\nKazuya having survived the attack, Heihachi summoned Kazuya to a one-on-one fight. Before he attended, Heihachi related his past to a journalist, painting a favorable legacy for himself as a defender of humanity against the Devil Gene of his wife and son, the former of whom he had killed. Kazuya and Heihachi clashed at the mouth of a volcano, with Kazuya emerging victorious. He then threw his father's body into the volcano.\nTekken 8\n\nSix months later, a now unopposed Kazuya Mishima continued to wage war against all nations, with world domination as his goal. Jin Kazama, having awoken from a coma, had joined forces with his uncles, Lee and Lars, in order to oppose Kazuya. Jin targeted a helicopter carrying Kazuya, but his devil form was overwhelmed by Kazuya's. Kazuya announced an eighth Iron Fist Tournament, calling upon fighters to represent their country and determine which countries deserved a place in his new world on the basis of their strength. Anyone who lost in the tournament would perish along with the country they represented. Having discovered that he could no longer call upon his devil form, Jin entered the tournament to try and reawaken it. After a spirited fight with his rival, Hwoarang, Jin regained access to his Devil. During the tournament preliminaries, Jin met a new fighter, Reina, who had somehow learned the Mishima Style Fighting Karate.\n\nAfter qualifying for the tournament, Jin went to a coliseum in Italy to participate in the first round. The tournament was interrupted by Yggdrasil and the United Nations, who had been warned that something ill would occur at the tournament. As they sought to evacuate the coliseum, Kazuya arrived on the scene. Azazel, who had been imprisoned in Zafina's arm, was released by Kazuya and absorbed, allowing him to gain even further power. Jin escaped and was escorted to Yakushima, while Lars and the rest of the fighters held Kazuya off. After arriving at Yakushima, Jin passed out in front of a shrine. Kazuya, wounded from the previous battle, sent his troops ahead of him. Yggdrasil fought G Corporation on Yakushima, as time was bought for Jin to confront his personal demons and seek a power to counter Kazuya's. Kazuya arrived and began obliterating the battlefield. In amidst this, a young Reina, who had tagged along, deliberately sought to place herself in mortal danger, having been studying Jin throughout this time.\n\nWhile in his own subconscious, Jin encountered his Devil counterpart, and came to a peaceful alliance with it. Jin then regained consciousness and fought Kazuya once more. Kazuya launched a devastating attack that threatened all of Yakushima, and Jin, strengthened by the spirit of his mother, transformed into an angelic being. In this form, he prevented the attack, though the impact caused him and Kazuya to be launched into space.\n\nJin and Kazuya continued their fight in space, and were evenly matched. A collision between them however, caused the purification of both their devil powers. The two fell back to earth, now only human. Unphased, they continued their fight. After an intense battle, Jin emerged victorious, leaving Kazuya's unconscious body behind. Soon after, Jin reunited with his friend, Ling Xiaoyu, while an unconscious Kazuya was approached by what seemed to be Jun Kazama. Elsewhere, Reina recovered from her fatal injury and vowed to avenge her father, revealed to be Heihachi Mishima, as she unleashed her own Devil form."

          ],
          "content": "Street Fighter: The First World Warrior\n\nThe story begins with the first-ever World Warrior tournament, a global competition to determine the strongest fighter in the world. A young, wandering martial artist named Ryu enters to test and prove his strength. Throughout the tournament, he faces a diverse cast of fighters from around the globe, including the ninja Geki, the American martial artist Joe, the Chinese assassin Gen, and the English bouncer Birdie.\n\nThe final opponent is the towering Muay Thai champion, Sagat, the \"Emperor of Muay Thai.\" In a grueling battle, Ryu is nearly defeated. However, in a moment of desperation, he taps into a dark power within him known as the Satsui no Hado (the \"Surge of Murderous Intent\") and unleashes a devastating Metsu Shoryuken that not only defeats Sagat but also leaves a massive scar across his chest. This victory marks Ryu as the first World Warrior champion, but it also ignites a lifelong rivalry with Sagat and sets Ryu on a path to understand and control the darkness within him.\n\nThe Street Fighter Alpha Series: The Rise of Shadaloo\n\nTaking place between Street Fighter and Street Fighter II, the Alpha series delves deeper into the lore and introduces many of the franchise's most iconic characters and plotlines.\n\nThe primary antagonist, M. Bison, leader of the criminal organization Shadaloo, emerges from the shadows. A powerful dictator wielding a mysterious energy called \"Psycho Power,\" Bison seeks world domination. His actions draw the attention of several individuals who would become his greatest adversaries.\n\nChun-Li, an Interpol officer, investigates Shadaloo, seeking to avenge the death of her father at Bison's hands. Guile, a Major in the United States Air Force, hunts for his best friend and superior officer, Charlie Nash, who has been sent to investigate and stop Bison's operations. Rose, a mysterious fortune teller from Genoa, Italy, possesses a spiritual power known as \"Soul Power\" and has a deep connection to Bison, as she represents the good half of his soul that he expelled to fully embrace Psycho Power.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryu is haunted by his victory over Sagat and the Satsui no Hado. He is confronted by Akuma, the brother of his master, Gouken. Akuma has fully embraced the Satsui no Hado, becoming a demon-like figure of immense power. Akuma reveals that he killed Gouken (a fact that is later retconned) and urges Ryu to embrace the darkness to unlock his true potential.\n\nThe Alpha series culminates in a multi-pronged assault on Shadaloo's base. Charlie Nash confronts Bison and sacrifices himself to destroy the Psycho Drive, a machine that amplifies Bison's power. Chun-Li gathers enough evidence to cripple Shadaloo's operations and confronts Bison, though she is unable to defeat him. Ryu confronts Bison and, with the help of his friends Ken Masters and Sakura Kasugano, resists Bison's attempts to corrupt him and use him as a new host body. Though Bison is defeated, his soul survives, and he begins the process of creating a new body.\n\nStreet Fighter II: The World Warrior Tournament Returns\n\nYears after the events of the Alpha series, M. Bison, now in a new, more powerful body, hosts the second World Warrior tournament. His true goal is to lure out his enemies and the world's greatest fighters to brainwash them and add them to his elite guard, the \"Four Heavenly Kings of Shadaloo,\" which includes the Spanish cage-fighting ninja, Vega; the brutish boxer, Balrog; and his right-hand man, the vengeful Sagat.\n\nThe tournament attracts a new generation of fighters alongside the veterans. Chun-Li, still seeking justice for her father, enters the tournament. Guile, believing Charlie to be dead, also enters to finally bring Bison to justice. The original world warriors, Ryu and Ken, also participate.\n\nIn the end, it is Akuma who once again intervenes. Seeing Bison as a worthy challenger, Akuma confronts and kills him with his ultimate technique, the Shun Goku Satsu (\"Raging Demon\"). With Bison's death, the tournament comes to an abrupt end, and the fighters go their separate ways.\n\nStreet Fighter IV: The S.I.N.ister Conspiracy\n\nThough M. Bison was killed by Akuma, his consciousness was transferred to a new clone body. While Shadaloo recovers, a new organization, S.I.N. (Shadaloo Intimidation Network), emerges from its weapons division. Led by the highly intelligent and powerful android, Seth, S.I.N. announces a new world tournament.\n\nSeth, a spare body for Bison, has achieved self-awareness and seeks to complete a project known as BLECE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Cell Explosion), which will grant him immense power. To do so, he needs to gather data from the world's strongest fighters, with a particular interest in Ryu and the Satsui no Hado.\n\nThe tournament brings back many familiar faces and introduces new ones, including the French amnesiac martial artist, Abel, who has a mysterious connection to Shadaloo; the American C.I.A. agent, Crimson Viper; the Turkish oil wrestler, Hakan; and the sadistic S.I.N. operative, Juri Han.\n\nIt is revealed that Ryu's master, Gouken, survived his battle with Akuma and has been in seclusion. He returns to confront Akuma and to help Ryu finally control the Satsui no Hado. After a fierce battle, Gouken defeats Akuma and uses a technique to seal Ryu's Satsui no Hado, saving him from its corrupting influence.\n\nIn the final confrontation, the fighters storm the S.I.N. headquarters. It is revealed that Juri has been manipulating events to bring about Bison's downfall. As the heroes fight their way through the facility, M. Bison confronts Seth and reveals that S.I.N. and the tournament were all part of his plan to find a suitable new host body. Bison defeats Seth and transfers his consciousness into a new, perfected body.\n\nStreet Fighter V: The Fall of Shadaloo\n\nNow in his most powerful form, M. Bison initiates \"Operation C.H.A.I.N.S.,\" a plan to plunge the world into darkness and fear by launching seven \"Black Moons\" into orbit. These devices will absorb the negative energy created by the ensuing chaos and channel it into Bison, making him a god.\n\nTo combat this threat, Karin Kanzuki, the head of the powerful Kanzuki Zaibatsu, forms a coalition of heroes, including the returning world warriors and new allies like the Arabian fighter Rashid and the Brazilian Matsuda Jiu-Jitsu practitioner Laura.\n\nA resurrected Charlie Nash, brought back to life by a mysterious woman named Helen (who is later revealed to be Kolin, a loyal follower of Gill and the Illuminati), also joins the fight, now possessing a strange new power. However, he is torn between his mission to destroy Bison and his loyalty to his friends.\n\nThe heroes split into teams to disarm the Black Moons. During the final assault on the Shadaloo base, Ryu, having finally achieved a state of \"nothingness\" and complete control over the Satsui no Hado, confronts M. Bison. In a cataclysmic battle, Ryu unleashes the full extent of his power and completely eradicates Bison, destroying his soul and ending his reign of terror once and for all.\n\nStreet Fighter III: A New Generation\n\nChronologically the latest in the series until the release of Street Fighter 6, Street Fighter III introduces a new generation of fighters and a new threat. In the wake of Shadaloo's collapse, a secret organization known as the Illuminati, which has manipulated world events from the shadows for centuries, steps into the light.\n\nLed by the messianic Gill, a powerful being who can control fire and ice, the Illuminati seeks to create a new utopia on Earth, even if it means destroying the current world and its inhabitants. To find those worthy of joining their new world, the Illuminati organizes the \"Third Strike\" tournament.\n\nThe story primarily follows a new protagonist, Alex, a young fighter from New York City who enters the tournament to avenge his friend, Tom, who was defeated and seriously injured by Gill. The tournament also features a new cast of characters, including the ninja Ibuki, the capoeira practitioner Elena, the stoic hermit Oro, and the British boxer Dudley.\n\nRyu and Ken also participate in the tournament, continuing their quest for self-improvement. The story of Street Fighter III is more personal and less focused on a single, world-ending threat. Instead, it explores the individual journeys of the new generation of fighters as they find their place in the world.\n\nStreet Fighter 6: The New Era\n\nSet after the events of Street Fighter III, Street Fighter 6 ushers in a new era for the franchise. In a world free from Shadaloo's tyranny, a new threat emerges. A mysterious and powerful man known as JP, a former high-ranking member of Shadaloo, now leads a terrorist organization called Amnesia.\n\nThe game's story is primarily experienced through the \"World Tour\" mode, where players create their own avatar and travel the world, learning from the legendary fighters of the Street Fighter universe. The story centers on the player's character and their rivalry with a fellow student named Bosch, who becomes entangled with Amnesia.\n\nMeanwhile, Ken Masters, once the U.S. Martial Arts Champion and a successful businessman, has been framed as a terrorist by JP and has lost everything. He is now on the run, trying to clear his name and protect his family.\n\nStreet Fighter 6 explores the legacy of the original world warriors and the rise of a new generation of fighters, including the Bushin-ryu ninja, Kimberly; the drunken-fist breakdancer, Jamie; the French judoka, Manon; and the powerful Italian pankration fighter, Marisa. The story is a more grounded and personal one, focusing on the individual struggles and triumphs of its characters in a post-Shadaloo world while also setting the stage for a new global conflict."

He has red hair with a topknot, sharp, pointed teeth, and is often bare-footed, though some games have him wearing brown sandals. Depending on the game or piece of art, he either wears a black belt at his waist or a length of rope. Over his hands, he either wears brown training gauntlets or wraps his hands with rope as well (again, depending on the source). He has tanned skin and crimson eyes, and wears his deceased master Goutetsu's prayer beads around his neck, with a visible black \"heaven\" (天, ten) kanji on the center bead in some games. In Street Fighter Alpha: Generations, he was seen having eyebrows when he was young.\n\nThis kanji is featured frequently in Akuma's appearances, most often at the end of a Shun Goku Satsu attack, where it burns itself onto the back of Akuma's gi top. It takes on a slightly different shape between the original Street Fighter IV and Super Street Fighter IV; the top stroke of the kanji is more narrow in Super Street Fighter IV than in the original, and may have taken this shape due to Akuma's second alternate costume using exactly the same new shape on the back.\n\nIn his artwork for his Street Fighter V profile, Akuma's hair is completely white, and has grown out; he wears a dark yellow loincloth with a white sash on each side, going shirtless while retaining his gray karate pants. This is designed as a contrast to his older brother Gouken's outfit.\n\nIn his full appearance in Street Fighter V, his hair has grown out considerably, resembling a lion's mane, though he retains his familiar clothing. He also has the hair on top of his head tied into a pigtail. He also wears his prayer beads like a sash. The 神人 \"shin\" kanji used by Shin Akuma in Capcom vs. SNK 2 is seen on his back when performing the Shun Goku Satsu.\n\nHis first alternate costume is similar to Ryu's alternate costume in Super Street Fighter IV; where his tattered karate gi is hanging loose on his waist and his karate pants are also in tatters. His second alternate costume is his outfit in Street Fighter V artwork and his third and last outfit is his classic appearance in the older Street Fighter games.\n\nIn the Street Fighter III series, his hair is slightly grayed, hinting that Akuma, while seemingly inhuman, still physically ages.\n\nIn Street Fighter 6, Akuma's design combines parts of his standard appearance and his Street Fighter V design. His hair retains the long lion mane look, with the topknot now moved back to its original position. His prayer beads are black like his Street Fighter V design, but return to being around his neck. His outfit bears a strong resemblance to an older Street Fighter V concept art, in which he wears a pelt as opposed to his gi top. Most notably, his hair is now entirely white to show the passage of time.[11] His karate pants seems to have some stitched patches to keep it from being tattered even more. Akuma also no longer wears sandals.\n\nHis first alternate costume is his Street Fighter III appearance, combining the brown training gauntlets with the rope belt and streaked hair. \n\nPersonality\n\nAkuma is a cold and extremely powerful warrior whose sole reason for existing is to hone his fighting skills by battling and destroying strong foes. He rarely displays any sign of emotions or humanity, aside from occasional bursts of anger, and rarely smiles. He, however, will not engage in battle towards helpless people and in some cases may even defend them, either as a righteous calling or an afterthought of conquering a major adversary. The only instance of humanity he has displayed after being drenched in the Satsui no Hado is with Kazumi Mishima, whom he respects, even in battle.\n\nAkuma lives off the land itself and rarely, if ever, interacts with society as a whole. When not doing training in his martial arts, he primarily subsists off wild animals and plants, and takes particular pride in fishing, which Akuma himself sees as a battle between life and death. In few occasions that he needs money, he sells animals and fruit. In his character story in Street Fighter 6, Akuma is shown to be a wood artisan who makes statues to honor his opponents; he is also depicted sewing his own gi in special ending artwork.\n\nHe takes his training very seriously and deals brutally with those who dare interrupt him, as seen in his Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike ending. Occasionally, he likes to test himself against worthy rivals (e.g. Gen, Oro). In later games, Akuma often refers to himself as a \"denizen of hell\" and \"evil incarnate\", and is seen as such by many. This may be a result of the Satsui no Hado (\"Surge of Murderous Intent\") taking a toll on his mind.\n\nIn line with his martial arts philosophy, Akuma also believes in a certain principle of self-worth. Specifically, Akuma despises hubris (i.e. a perceived excess of self-worth), foolish behavior, and those who rely on means other than their fists to fight or gain power (both of which would indicate a lack of the same), as his various win quotes in the Street Fighter IV games indicate. He is also somewhat nihilistic by principle, as his search for worthy opponents often includes someone who would be able to fully match and kill him (which itself is not an easy task, considering his own raw power). This is further supported by his dialogue in Street Fighter 6's World Tour mode, to which Akuma admits that he is fully aware that his path of embracing the Satsui no Hado may lead him to destruction, but he accepted it as a price to pay to become the strongest.\n\nAkuma detests his older brother Gouken for not giving into the dark side of their arts which is, according to Akuma himself, the way they were intended to be used. He also blames Gouken for sealing off the darkness within Ryu, thus preventing the young warrior from reaching his true potential. This forces Akuma to ultimately give up on his planned duel with Ryu, as he believes that only a fellow practitioner of the Satsui no Hado can one day hope to defeat him.\n\nEven as a Satsui no Hado wielder with seemingly amoral actions, Akuma upholds certain standards and outlook of how powers like the Satsui should be handled. It is for this reason he hold much disdain to sentient but soulless beings like Kage. \n\nMoral Code\nAkuma can be considered an antivillain. In spite of his cold personality, due to his relentless training in the dark arts of the Satsui no Hado, most of the time, Akuma abides by the code of the warrior, quite similar to Ryu, Ken, and indirectly, his older brother Gouken. He fights to improve his skills and defeat powerful foes - though on rare occasions, he does so to gauge the other's abilities. He also never resorts to killing defenseless or unworthy fighters in cold blood, unlike M. Bison or Evil Ryu. Although he killed his teacher and believed he did the same with Gouken, Akuma did so in combat, not actual murder, and thus can be said to have not transgressed on his principles. \n\nIn combat, Akuma, as he often fights with honor, almost never resorts to his true strength, especially if testing another fighter; he only fights warriors that he deems worthy, or the ones he believes have the potential to become such. During the events of Street Fighter Alpha 2, Akuma fought Ryu only to gain insight into his abilities, while in 3rd Strike, he faced Oro in order to test his own strength.\n\nAlthough Akuma normally prefers an even bout (as he backed out of an intense duel with Gen once he found out that the elderly assassin was fatally ill, seen in Alpha 2), it is not uncommon for him to deliver a lethal sneak attack to an unprepared opponent (as he did with M. Bison, Gill, and Adon's unnamed rival), particularly if they are less than honorable. While the evil nature of Satsui no Hado itself may have corrupted Akuma's ways, it is worth noting that he himself still upholds standards and a minimalist degree of morality and considers Bison a much more abhorrent type of evil.\n\nHis win quotes in 3rd Strike also imply Akuma has become much bloodthirstier and perhaps pays less regard to his own moral code, very much like Evil Ryu; it is possible that at this point, the Satsui no Hado's hold on Akuma has strengthened, being close to completely overtaking his mind and body, and that said win quotes reflect this state. \n\nRelationships\nDue to his single-minded quest for raw strength, he has made enemies over time, though he actively does not seek to antagonize without provocation. Surprisingly, there are a few personalities that he has a vague sense of respect for.\n\nEnemies\n\nGouken\nAkuma is Gouken's younger brother and archnemesis. Gouken greatly despises him for embracing the Satsui no Hado and killing their master, Goutetsu. Because of this, he does all he can to protect Ryu and Ken from him, to the point where he willingly fought Akuma in a battle to the death so that he won't come after his loyal students. \n\nRyu\nAkuma is one of Ryu's most hated enemies, as Akuma himself was the one who tried to kill his and Ken's master, Gouken. Akuma also attempts to lure Ryu into succumbing to the Satsui no Hado, in Street Fighter Alpha 2, as he claims the young warrior possesses the same power as Akuma does, therefore casting aside his humanity to become Evil Ryu, in hopes of finally finding a truly worthy opponent for the ultimate fight to the death that Akuma always seeks. Ryu knows this is nothing but a trap of temptation planned by the dark warrior, and he has tried his best to find a way to get rid of the Satsui no Hado entirely while refusing to succumb to that kind of power. Akuma ceases tempting him (or at the least, respects his choice) after finally conquering the dark power and mastering his own Hado energy, the Power of Nothingness, in Street Fighter V.\n\nIn the events of Street Fighter III: Ryu Final, Akuma has a considerably more respectful outlook on Ryu following his denial of the Satsui no Hado, with Ken theorizing that his embracing of its demonic power serves as a challenge for Ryu to find a strength that goes beyond the seeming inevitability of the Satsui no Hado's death and destruction. Though the two fighters still clash in a brutal conflict, Akuma honors Ryu's resolve to move directly into the Shun Goku Satsu, being pierced through his torso by Akuma's fist but granting him the opportunity to blast through Akuma's body with a point-blank Hadoken. Having seen both the strength beyond the Satsui no Hado and a true fight to the death, Akuma seemingly perishes in a burst of flame caused by the energy within him, satisfied with Ryu's answer.\n\nRyu and Akuma's relationship by the time of Street Fighter 6 bears considerable resemblance to the events of Ryu Final. With Ryu embodying a rejection of Akuma's mindset of embracing death and discarding humanity during battles. Since both Ryu and Akuma have reached the \"peak\" of the opposite end of their path, they seem to no longer hold any personal grudges against one another. Rather, both fighters are now connected by their shared desire to become the strongest. While Akuma maintained his cruel and infernal persona in front of Ryu, deep inside his heart, he seems to respect Ryu for \"smiling\" in the face of death, since he knows that Ryu always put \"every ounce of [his] being\" into every fight. As well as commitments to becoming the strongest, even though he is taking a different path from him. In fact, both Ryu and Akuma seems to have enjoyed fighting against one another to see who is the better of the two, as pointed out by Ryu during their encounter in Arcade mode.\n\nRyu's ability to laugh in the face of death leads to the player character being spared and trained by Akuma, who sees a similar mindset to Ryu within them.\nKen\n\nLike Ryu, Ken is aware of the threat Akuma poses to humanity. However, due to his pure lack of attunement to the Satsui no Hado, Akuma does not seek Ken out, unlike with Ryu.\nAdon\n\nBecause Akuma killed a Muay Thai master that Adon was supposed to fight, Adon seeks to defeat Akuma to prove himself. In Alpha 3, Adon finds Akuma and ultimately loses to him. Akuma doesn't kill him, however, due to him deeming Adon unworthy of death.\n\nGen\nGen saw Akuma as a skilled opponent who could finally kill him, a morbid desire amplified by his own terminal sickness. However, their skills often clash, giving each other challenges. Akuma was ultimately defeated by Gen, but would engage him again after seeing he can still fight. Akuma emerges victorious and is implied to have killed him for good in Street Fighter V in their last fight to the death. However, Gen survives this encounter once more.\n\nM. Bison\nAkuma, despite having no direct grudge, holds major contempt towards M. Bison, the latter being an even more abhorrent kind of evil using shortcuts to power. Because of this, Akuma has no problem killing the villain on a whim. Bison, on the other hand, wants Akuma's Satsui no Hado as a sole means to increase his own power. His disdain for Bison persists even when he becomes Oni, and perhaps is even greater.\n\nOro\nOro is among one of the only men who have legitimately matched Akuma in combat. The two have fought each other to a draw, as the fight was called off due to the two fighters sensing that if they fought each other seriously, it would result in a mutual kill. Both have earned each other's respect and contempt on a personal basis. [12]\nGill\n\nUpon hearing about his powers, Akuma desired to fight Gill. Akuma killed Gill with the Raging Demon, but left without realizing that Gill could resurrect himself from death.\n\nKazuya Mishima\nIn Tekken 7, Kazumi Mishima's son, Kazuya, corrupted by his own Devil Gene inherited from her, has become a concern. Akuma, under Kazumi's orders, is tasked with destroying him should he succumb to power like his equally powerful and vile father, Heihachi. Akuma confronts Kazuya at G Corporation's Millennium Tower, pushing him to unleash his Devil form. However, their battle is abruptly halted when Heihachi attempts to eliminate both Akuma and his son Kazuya by utilizing a satellite laser to destroy the tower. Surprisingly, both survived the explosion. Akuma, determined to finish Kazuya, returns after Kazuya's fatal victory against Heihachi in a bonus chapter. Upon encountering Kazuya again, he transforms into his Devil form, prompting Akuma to answer him by unleashing his full power as Shin Akuma. The confrontation escalates into a fierce battle, culminating in a climactic exchange of devastating projectiles. The outcome of their conflict remains uncertain as the volcano erupts, signaling the end of their duel with no apparent victor. Nevertheless, subsequent dialogue and Tekken 8 hints and eventually confirms Kazuya's survival, suggesting that Akuma abandoned him and he remains a menacing threat to the world.\nHeihachi Mishima\n\nHeihachi is Kazumi's elderly husband and the father of Kazuya, whose ambition has caused a plethora of problems. Akuma is also tasked by Kazumi to destroy him. Although Akuma intends to duel him, he and Heihachi were forced to fight alongside one another momentarily, against Kazuya's Jack-6s. Akuma reveals that he waited for Heihachi to establish his own strength before engaging him, one of many instances of his moral code being followed. Heihachi, a powerful warrior in his own right, proved to be a challenge for Akuma, but was ultimately defeated as Akuma blew up the Mishima Dojo. Later, it is revealed that Heihachi actually survived, buried under his own dojo. This allowed him to fake his death and reveal Kazuya's Devil form to the world. He attempted to kill both Kazuya and Akuma by targetting G Corporation's Millennium Tower with a satellite laser. Despite successfully destroying the tower, both fighters are revealed to have survived the blast. Kazuya used his Devil Blaster on Zaibatsu's satellite, prompting Heihachi to vindictively tell their family's story from his perspective, before the two meet for a final fight to death. Akuma is present, however, apparently watching both Heihachi and Kazuya fight, until Kazuya finally kills his father, and Akuma then prepares to take out the victor.\n\n\nAkuma is currently unaware that Heihachi survived, as seen in Tekken 8.\n\nAsura\nAsura is perhaps Akuma's greatest rival. After Asura defeated Ryu, he then fought Akuma for over 500 years.\n\nNecalli\nNecalli is an ancient spirit that seeks to devour Akuma's soul. When Necalli successfully absorbs it, Akuma escapes his stomach using the Mudo Tensho.\n\nLuke Sullivan\nLuke heard about Akuma's legend at some point, referring to the latter as a \"Big Bad\", due to his villainous appearance. Following Akuma's encounter with Luke's student, the player Avatar, Luke helps the student to overcome their fear in a rematch against Akuma.\n\nNeutral-to-Friendly\n\nElena\nElena, thus far, is the only person that has given Akuma the first-ever smiling face, though whether it is a genuine smile remains debatable.\n\nElena's relationship with Akuma is further elaborated in Street Fighter 6. Elena considered Akuma to be her \"friend\" due to her considering her natural powers and the Satsui no Hado to be two sides of the same coin and that it is not inherently evil in nature, a view that Akuma also shared.\n\nAlthough Akuma did not consider Elena as a friend (believing it to be an obstacle to his quest for strength), he pays no mind about the notion. In turn, Elena considered Akuma to be her mentor of sorts, particularly his \"to live and to fight\" philosophy, and sparring with him from time to time to learn more from him.\n\nGoutetsu\nAkuma's master, who taught both him and his brother Gouken the arts of Ansatsuken. Departing the dojo to fully master the Satsui no Hado, he rejected the idea of balance between light and dark, preferring the art's original intent of killing, therefore the latter. This led to Akuma challenging Goutetsu to a mortal duel, briefly transforming into Shin Akuma. Despite the intensity, their fight lacked animosity, akin to Guy and Zeku's. Akuma emerged victorious, using the Shun Goku Satsu to fatally defeat his master, claiming his signature prayer beads as a valuable token. Notably, Akuma sought to demonstrate his mastery to Goutetsu, who passed away content, proud of his student's achievement.\n\nKazumi Mishima\nKazumi once rescued Akuma from an unspecified predicament before the events of the Tekken series' storyline unfolded. In gratitude, Akuma vowed to fulfill Kazumi's wish of eliminating her son Kazuya and her husband Heihachi, recognizing their similar corruption by their own power (ironically like Akuma himself). However, it remains unclear whether Akuma was aware of Kazumi's own Devil Gene or the malevolent tendencies within her maiden family. It seems unlikely, given his genuine surprise at Kazuya's vile transformation. Nevertheless, Akuma's interaction with Kazumi stands as the sole objective instance revealing his humanity amidst his otherwise ruthless demeanor from the Satsui no Hado. \n\nStory\nMartial arts career and killing his master and brother\nPre-Alpha\n\nAkuma and his brother Gouken were students of Goutetsu. Goutetsu taught the two men a nameless life-threatening martial art, which incorporates elements of Karate, Judo, and Kempo. He also taught the notorious Shun Goku Satsu (literally \"Instant Hell Murder\"), a lethal technique which, although incredibly powerful, also puts the user in considerable danger.\n\nAs the brothers progressed under Goutetsu's tutelage, a dispute arose on the true nature of their fighting style and the path to master it. Gouken, unable to accept the violent nature and the Satsui no Hado of his fighting style, left Goutetsu to begin his own dojo, which Goutetsu himself did not oppose. Akuma continued under Goutetsu's teachings, and vowed to use their fighting style as it was originally intended.\n\nIn order to learn the Shun Goku Satsu, Akuma embraced the principle of the Satsui no Hado, and was forced to give up any compassion he held towards other human beings. In addition, Akuma realized his limits as a martial artist could be expanded, and left Goutetsu's guidance of enlightenment to train alone to gain more power. However, due to embracing the Satsui no Hado to its fullest extent, he developed a lust to fight to the death, unlike Goutetsu, who had been carefully able to use the Satsui no Hado without giving in to its dark side.\n\nAfter coming back from his island, Akuma went back to Goutetsu, and fought him in a mortal duel to prove that he had surpassed him. Akuma ultimately killed his master with the Shun Goku Satsu, who himself died happily to see his student surpass him, and Akuma, believing that he was the true master of the Art, took the prayer beads of the now-dead Goutetsu and placed them on his neck as an important reward. Gouken came to visit his former master to see how he was doing, only to find his lifeless body and his brother, now no longer human. Gouken, utterly shocked to see that his younger brother took the life of their master, berated Akuma, who said nothing and left for the woods alone.\n\nMany years later, Akuma fought Gouken one-on-one, while the then-young duo of Ryu and Ken watched.[13][14] Akuma told Gouken that he was not strong enough to face him without giving into the killing intent; Gouken retorted that the art was much more than just death and destruction, accusing Akuma of dishonoring their master's name. Akuma then told his older brother that Goutetsu did not truly understand the art, and that he was a fool for not using the Satsui no Hado to its fullest extent. The fight continued, and Gouken soon won. Akuma told his brother to kill him, but Gouken had no intention of murdering his own kin, prompting Akuma to call him weak for sparing the life of a strong opponent and declare that he would return and get his revenge.\n\nA couple of years later, Akuma came back to Gouken's dojo and fought him in battle once again, this time using the Shun Goku Satsu on him. Akuma believed him dead, not knowing that Gouken had somehow lived through the attack by emptying his soul, and was only in a coma. Ken saw the flash of the attack while running to the dojo, but arrived only to find Gouken on the floor and in a pool of blood. Knowing who was behind this, Ken confronted Akuma in the woods and fought him, only to be easily defeated. After defeating Ken, Akuma disappeared without a trace. \n\nFirst World Warrior Tournament and fighting Gen, Ryu and M. Bison\nAkuma only appears as a secret character only playable via random fighter at the character selection screen (except Alpha 2, where he is selectable).[15] He shares his moveset with Ryu and Ken. An artwork interestingly shows that, at some point, he helps a child who got lost in his cave. In his retconned ending, he defeats M. Bison, claiming his quest was complete, though he feels empty. Gouken is seen in the background of his ending, as one of the people who fear and oppose him.\n\nAkuma begins to search the globe looking for worthy fighters to challenge. Secluding himself in the shadows, he watches small tournaments and street fights, desperately seeking someone who might be able to match his strength. He is eventually challenged by an elderly man named Gen. Gen fights a vicious battle, even surviving the Shun Goku Satsu by emptying his soul in time. The outcome of the battle varies based on the arcade route by the player. In Akuma's non-canon ending, just as he begins to wonder whether Gen is the worthy opponent he's searching for, he begins to sense not all is as it seems. When Gen's mouth begins to bleed, Akuma's suspicions are confirmed: his opponent is sick, and the fight is not fair. After being knocked to the ground, Gen tells Akuma to kill him. Not wanting to carry the fight on any longer, Akuma leaves, infuriating Gen.[16] In Gen's canon ending, he narrowly defeats Akuma. However, in spite of Akuma's demands to end his life, Gen enjoyed the fight so much he couldn't bring himself to land the killing blow. He spares Akuma, hoping to one day battle him again.[17] After the fight, Akuma becomes obsessed with Ryu, hoping to awaken the Satsui no Hado within his prey.\n\nRyu eventually finds Akuma's island (known as Onigami Isle or the Gokuentou) and challenges him to a duel. The intense battle ended with Ryu gaining the upper hand; in truth, Akuma was only testing him and therefore wasn't fighting at his full extent. Akuma regains composure and tells Ryu to find him again when he has embraced the Satsui no Hado, before striking the ground with a single, powerful blow and immediately disappearing. The island falls apart around Ryu, who is left in the ocean to contemplate Akuma's words.[18] Leaving his destroyed abode, Akuma thinks about all the fighters he has encountered, specifically strong ones, and wonders with excitement if one day he will fight someone strong enough to kill him in battle. This thought drives him on; finding a desolate cavern (also known as Kiga Cave), he begins to train anew and await the day when he will fight Ryu again. At some point, Akuma defeats and kills a Muay Thai fighter who was about to challenge the champion, Adon. Adon sees this as a challenge and sets out to find Akuma, to fight him and prove that he is stronger.[19]\n\nIn his ending, he comes to the realization that worthy opponents have challenged him during his journey. He decides that he could stay on Earth to perfect his killing power, knowing that there are opponents that Akuma can consider worthy. While thinking about the opponents he challenged, there are visions of Gen, M. Bison and Ryu on the moon. He then comments that he will be the next to die.[20]\n\n    \"Akuma. The supreme master of the fist. This lone warrior is a wanderer shrouded with \"evil intent\". He searches for the challengers with enough potential to kill.\"\n    —Akuma's profile in Street Fighter Alpha 3\n\nWhile waiting for Ryu to embrace the Satsui no Hado, Akuma wanders the globe in search of worthy opposition. He is confronted by Adon again, who wishes to establish his fighting style as supreme. Akuma easily wins but, instead of killing Adon, he just leaves, apparently deeming his defeated foe as unworthy.\n\nSometime later, Akuma is intercepted by Guy, who refuses to allow him to see M. Bison; Akuma ignores Guy's pleas and engages him in combat, the two then decide to end the fight after they realized their primary objective was the same: defeat M. Bison.\n\nHe then confronts Bison, who tells Akuma that he won't be able to defeat him as long as the Psycho Drive exists. Akuma berates the evil dictator for not relying solely upon his fists, and they fight. As Akuma emerges victorious, he completely terminates Bison with the Shun Goku Satsu, causing him to suffer horribly as the attack kills him.\n\nIn his ending, Akuma is then challenged by Gen once more and they fight a second battle, the results of which are unknown. Unbeknownst to Akuma, Ryu rejected the Satsui no Hado during his own battle with the Shadaloo leader, M. Bison, declaring that a true warrior does not rely on violent intent.\nSecond World Warrior Tournament and waiting for a worthy opponent\n\nAkuma did not officially enter the second World Warrior tournament, but did monitor the events that took place during it in hope of finding an adequate challenge. He also challenged[2][21] and defeated Bison.[22] Akuma then left as multiple participants engage Bison.[23]\n\nIn a retconned and non-canon event, he ambushed the host, M. Bison, and made short work of him with the Shun Goku Satsu. Bison is obliterated in an instant. Akuma then engages in combat with the second finalist, but the identity of this warrior, as well as the outcome of the bout, remains unknown.\n\nIn both the original Super Street Fighter II Turbo and its HD remake, Akuma has two different endings, depending on who the final opponent is. If it is M. Bison, Akuma will muse on the fact that he did not master the Psycho Power and let it control him. If it is his full power counterpart, Shin Akuma, he will reflect on his victory over his own darkness, and consider death beneath him. Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival combines both endings into one, while Ultra removes the second ending, thus causing the first ending to always play regardless if Akuma beats M. Bison or the Shin version of himself.\n\nStreet Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind\n\nAkuma appears in the beginning of the movie, where he enters Ryu's mind and torments him. He inquires about why and how long Ryu intends to resist the Satsui no Hado to which he responds \"Until my last breath!\" and that he aims for something higher than power. But Akuma dismisses this as foolishness of the highest order, given that Ryu doesn't know exactly what he seeks. Akuma goes on by saying that Ryu's blood is calling out to him and that he must answer it with his life. But Ryu keeps refusing sternly, prompting Akuma to tell him that he will murder him himself and states that this mundane world is of no concern to them as they grow stronger by consuming human life. Having had enough, Ryu tells him off by unconsciously using the Satsui no Hado, causing Akuma to burst in laughter before vanishing.\n\nStreet Fighter IV series\n\nSometime before the third World Warrior Tournament, Ryu and Akuma would duel, with Akuma dominating the fight, as he rebukes Ryu about his rejection of the Dark Hado, Ryu finds the strength to recover and fight back. However, Ken would interrupt the fight, forcing Akuma to leave.\n\nDuring the events of Seth's tournament, he continues his training, and senses the Satsui no Hado re-emerging within Ryu. Immediately, he sets off to find Ryu and help him realize this power so he can try to kill him in battle. Like the other tournaments, Akuma does not officially enter, but stays in the shadows. Later, he finds an unconscious Ryu in the care of his brother Gouken. Akuma noticed that his brother has perfected the Power of Nothingness. The two brothers fought, with Ryu being the prize. Both survived their fight, and Ryu was saved by Gouken. Akuma then continued his training and his search for a worthy opponent to match his own, razing an entire forest with his power. In Elena's ending in Ultra Street Fighter IV, she is shown to have befriended him in one of her flashbacks.\nStreet Fighter V\n\nAkuma is revealed to be the first of the second wave of the DLC characters and his teaser has revealed on the Capcom Cup 2016 trailer on November 7, 2016 where he was briefly seen performing the Raging Demon and the kanji burned mark \"heaven\" on his back has been replaced with a \"godlike person\" mark.\n\nAkuma's reveal trailer has been released on December 4, 2016 where he was seen fighting against Ryu and later became playable in December 20, 2016. His hair is now longer, and more like a lion's mane.\n\nPrologue - 'Mudo Tensho'\n\nIn Akuma's story, he and Gen fight once again. Akuma becomes victorious in the battle, but was criticized by Gen for leading to the path of discarding humanity. He then finishes and seemingly kills Gen off for good. He then sees a vision of Ryu rejecting the Satsui no Hado, much to his frustration. Necalli appears and challenges Akuma for his soul. Not only did Necalli lose to Akuma, but he attempts to devour Akuma and Akuma does the Mudo Tensho to escape Necalli's stomach. He then seeks Ryu and battles him, in a Satsui no Hado Vs. Mu no Ken clash. Akuma defeats Ryu in battle, but does not kill him. Instead, he questions if there is no one that can match him. Ryu, smiling while laying on the ground, asks questions to Akuma, claiming that his fists will continue to communicate with Akuma on opposite ends. Akuma then flees, letting fate determine when those two will meet again.\nOther character story appearances\n\nAkuma appears in Kage’s character story, which took place prior encountering Necalli after realizing Ryu’s rejection from the Satsui during A Shadow Falls Episode. After Kage went after Sagat, Akuma is the said shadow demon’s next target, to prove his former host Ryu is nothing without him. Akuma considers Kage as nothing more than soulless silhouette of his former host. Just as Kage mockingly claims he kept part of him at bay because of his believes in laws of heaven, a nearly beaten Akuma mocks Kage back for not understanding anything aside from only strength and fighting endlessly. Akuma then uses a Houten Seikengeki punch to make Kage disappear from him, and wonders if Kage is the path which Ryu has truly chosen.\nStreet Fighter III: 2nd Impact\n\nAs with the third World Warrior tournament, Akuma did not enter the fourth World Warrior tournament, but once more lurked in the shadows. He was challenged by Sean who mistook him for Ryu, only for Akuma to beat him easily. He successfully pulled off a Shun Goku Satsu on the tournament sponsor Gill, although he left without realizing that Gill had resurrected himself. He then faces Ryu, asking him to show him his full power, but Ryu replies that malicious intent is not the way of the warrior. In this game, he appears as a secret boss. Using the Raging Demon on whoever the player is facing, he battles the player afterwards. If Akuma is felled, the scenery will darken, the ground will shake and he will get back up and unleash his true power for a second fight.\n\nOver this time-span, Akuma had trained relentlessly, harnessing his power and learning several new techniques; some were meant to create tidal waves, others were described as strong enough to split Uluru (Ayers Rock) in half, and one could kill an opponent with a single strike. One such self-taught technique is called the Kongou Kokuretsuzan, in which Akuma channels all his power into one hand and smashes it into the ground, creating a vortex of energy upward around him. It is supposedly this technique that was used to destroy his original training ground, the Onigami Isle Gokuentou. The same technique is also said to have the power to make the Earth itself crumble beneath him.\nStreet Fighter III: 3rd Strike\n\nAkuma continued to develop his now-incredible fighting skill, and even fought with Oro in a simple, inconclusive battle, with each other sensing the other's massive chi and testing their powers. Though mutually impressed by each other's power, both men expressed some contempt for the other on a personal basis.\n\nIt is also revealed that Akuma has now demonstrated the ability to remain underwater under massive pressure for extended periods of time, and has even managed to make his Tenshou Kaireki Jin technique powerful enough to destroy the massive sunken ruins of a modern liner ship.\nStreet Fighter 6\n\nA demon of combat that has welcomed the Satsui no Hado into his being in his quest to become the ultimate master of the fist.\nArcade Mode\n\n    Transcript\n\nAkuma: The Sound of Chiseling\n\nDeep within the Enma's Hollow, Akuma is seen meditating by carving a wooden idol. The narrator then described how Akuma's very being was shaped by each battle he has went through, not dissimilar to how each stroke of chisel gradually carved a wood into the idol. Then, Akuma recalls his recent encounter and a \"fight to the death\" with Ryu a few moments ago.\n\nIn a flashback, Ryu visits Akuma within Enma's Hollow. Akuma recalls his past bout with Ryu by asking if he's still \"revel(ling)\" about it, to which Ryu silently replied with a smile. Akuma is angered that Ryu seems to not take his wish for a \"fight to the death\" seriously and called out on Ryu for smiling at him. Ryu however countered, saying that he has put \"every ounce of [his] being\" into his fist during the fight. After a brief silence, Ryu say that he has sensed that Akuma, too, has enjoyed fighting with him, suggesting that the two fighters has something in common despite taking opposite paths. Akuma is enraged as he perceived Ryu's words as a \"mockery\" and challenged him to a fight.\n\nBack to the present, Akuma returns to his wood carving work and reflects on his past fight. As the story ended, it is revealed that the wooden idol he has carved has a smile on its face, suggesting that Ryu's words about Akuma might’ve turned out to be true.\nWorld Tour\n\nMaster of the Fist. Unforgiving Destruction. Fighting God Incarnate. (拳を極めし者、無容赦粉砕、鬼神権化 Ken o kiwameshi-mono. Muyo-sha funsai. Kishin gonge.?)\n\n    \"Strength can only be achieved by pushing past your limits! (強さは限界を超えることによってのみ達成されます! Tsuyo-sa wa genkai o koeru koto ni yotte nomi tassei sa remasu!?)\"\n    —Akuma's advice after completing training & achieving Mastery\n\nAkuma can found at Enma's Hollow, where he is first seen training his fists before destroying a falling ceiling rock and beheaded the giant ogre statue's head with a Goshoryuken. A beheaded statue which Akuma punched almost killed the the player Avatar when they recently arrived at the hallow where Akuma is. As Akuma spots the Avatar's presence, the Avatar is at first afraid of Akuma because of his overwhelming presence during their first encounters before Akuma disappears within the fog.\n\nIn order to train under Akuma, the Avatar must first discard their fears by sparring with Ryu and Luke, who tell them of their shortcomings. Only after fighting Akuma a few times does he end the fight decisively with a powerful Metsu Shoryuken that defeats the Avatar, who laughs even in the face of death. Seeing their similarities to Ryu, Akuma punches the ground and allows them to become his pupil. \n\nTekken 7\n\nA mysterious fighter… a demon. He finds himself in the middle of the Mishima blood feud by a pre-existing relationship with Kazumi Mishima, Heihachi's wife, who once saved his life. He makes his debut in Tekken 7 promising to fulfill a debt owed to Kazumi by killing Heihachi, as well as their son Kazuya Mishima.[3]\nStory Mode\n\nSometime after Heihachi reclaims the Mishima Zaibatsu, Akuma watches from a distance as an air raid destroys an entire city. He then confronts his target at the Mishima dojo, but their battle is interrupted by a Jack-6 army sent by Kazuya. The two of them temporarily join forces to defeat the onslaught of robots. Afterwards, Akuma introduces himself to Heihachi and explains that he was sent by the late Kazumi to kill both her husband and son. When asked by Heihachi about why he waited so long to fulfill the promise, Akuma replies that he was waiting until Heihachi had become stronger. Emerging victorious, Akuma seemingly kills Heihachi and destroys the Mishima dojo.\n\nHe later goes to the top of G Corporation tower to fight and kill Kazuya. Gaining the upper hand in the fight, Akuma forces Kazuya into a corner, prompting him to transform into Devil Kazuya. However, before there is a victor, their fight is interrupted by Heihachi, who had survived and faked his death. The Mishima Zaibatsu CEO fires a power laser from a space satellite, destroying G Corporation tower.\n\nAkuma survives the attack, and confronts Kazuya once more in the volcanic pit after Kazuya killed Heihachi, now in his Shin Akuma form. With his opponent in his full devil form, Akuma finds himself locked in an intense fight. The battle reaches its climax when Akuma fires a Hadoken at Kazuya's devil beam attack, destroying the volcanic surroundings. The final outcome of the fight is unknown, although in the Tekken 7 aftermath, it is clear that Kazuya is still the head of G Corporation and waging a war that Jin Kazama means to challenge him over.\n\nGameplay and fighting style\nHaving mastered the original form of the unnamed \"Shotokan\" art, Akuma's fighting style is based in the same vein as the all-around characters, with a much more offense-oriented design. Though he shares very similar moves as Ryu and Ken, Akuma's overall style focuses on completely dominating the opponent and preventing counterattacks.\n\nHis mix of raw attack power, combined with moves that can control the air and keep him mobile, allow him to maintain a fierce onslaught offensive that can end matches quickly. However, Akuma's power is offset by very low stamina and stun, meaning that any whiffed attack or defensive opening could irreversibly tip the scales against him and lead to a massive punishing; as a result, heavy investment on the player's part is required to properly utilize his full potential. In-story, it was often claimed that Akuma's low durability a representation of him holding back his power in order to enjoy his fights, which handicaps himself.\n\nAkuma's hard-to-match combo ability via his various command attacks or special attacks (e.g. Zanku Hadoken or Hyakkishu) can easily create pressure, especially against a downed opponent, and take advantage of wake-up based and/or cross-up based setups that often lead to some of the more high-damage combos in the series.\n\nIn titles prior to Street Fighter III and prior to his 3D appearances, Akuma like Ryu and Ken, is also somewhat hindered by subpar physical range, making his footsies game rather difficult to manage in the neutral game, and often forces him to zone more with his projectiles (though he, unlike the two of them, can take more risks getting in due to more tools and damage on hand to do so). However, his poor range comes back to hurt him like so in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, where out of his chosen normal attacks to be used in the game, most of them are somewhat short in nature compared to Ryu's.\n\nTechniques\nAkuma's Gohadoken can be used in midair as well, while his Tatsumaki Zankukyaku can floor the opponent and can also juggle, and his Goshoryuken can floor his opponent with one hit; it can lands up to 3 hits up close, and can also juggle with a single use in certain instances. Due to embracing the Satsui no Hado, Akuma has other special moves that Ryu and Ken normally lack.\n\nThe Ashura Senku is a fast teleport move that allows him to escape or position himself almost at will. The Tenmakujinkyaku is a fast downwards-angled kick that he can use at the peak of his jumps. The Hyakkishu is a flip attack, similar to Cammy's Hooligan Combination, that allows Akuma to either attack or grab an opponent while moving forward. He also has the Zenpou Tenshin in the Alpha games, which makes him hop and roll forward a short distance.\n\nIn Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, Akuma retains all of his moves as both his Gohadoken and Tatsumaki Zankukyaku are embedded with poison and his Shakunetsu Hadoken can petrify his opponents when they get hit. He has a special attack that can headbutt his opponent similar to E. Honda's Sumo Headbutt. His Shun Goku Satsu, Tenma Gozanku, Messatsu Go Hadou and his Messatsu-Goshoryu serve as his Mighty Combos and has the most Mighty Combos with the total of four. He has four disguises serve as his special attacks. (Eg. a swimmer, a Japanese construction worker wields both a hammer and a long lumber, a fortune teller and a warlock gladiator) During the Tenma Gozanku, Akuma sometimes disguises as a swimmer to dive into the ground similar to Nagare's Plunge after executing the move.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, Akuma maintains his moves and gains additional moves to his arsenal. His battle style changes to become more brutal fighting when he pulls off his combo to his opponent or seriously damaging his opponent with his moves. Akuma has a V-Skill callled Rakan where he strikes a defensive stance similar to Ryu’s Mind’s Eye that can parry an incoming attack. He can follow-up the move with an upward kick or a long reaching palm strike. His V-Trigger is the Dohatsu Shoten where he can unleashes his Gohadoken in two hits even mid-air. He can also make a deadly combo to his opponent with an ability similar to Messatsu Goshoryu and his Misogi. While using this ability, Akuma is able to unleash his Raging Demon during his Critical Art.\n\nIn his appearance in Tekken (Mobile), Akuma's primary basic combo launcher is his Tenmakujinkyaku as his Gohadoken, Goshoryuken, Shakunetsu Hadoken, Zanku Hadoken, Tatsumaki Zankukyaku, Messatsu Gohado and Messatsu Goshoryu appear as his Special Waza Cards which shows an exclamation point in front of its cards as other of his basic techniques serving as his Strike, Stun and Combo Starter Waza Cards. In both 3-Star and 4-Star appearances, he will gain his Wrath of the Raging Demon Ultra Combo in Street Fighter IV series as his Rage Art. Both his Messatsu Gohado and Messatsu Goshoryu were labeled as both Gohadoken and Goshoryuken respectively in his 4-Star moves as Akuma immediately defeats his/her opponent in a single move, dealing massive damage.\n\nIn Street Fighter 6, Akuma sees some significant modifications with the addition of Adamant Flame and Oboro Throw to his repertoire, though at the cost of Shakunetsu Hadoken now being a part of Gou Hadoken and Ashura Senku losing its signature invulnerability.\n\nSuper Combos\nAkuma's Super Combos, introduced in the Alpha series (for reasons explained below) consist of a high-powered Gohadoken, a powered-up Zanku Hadoken, a Shoryuken-based move similar to Ken's Shoryureppa without the scorching effect, and an upward-spiraling Tatsumaki that can also be used in midair. Akuma's most well known Super Combo is the infamous Shun Goku Satsu, also known as the Raging Demon; it is traditionally one of the strongest attacks in any game Akuma appears in.\n\nTwo more moves are introduced in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike and the Capcom vs. SNK series: the Kongou Kokuretsuzan has Akuma strike the ground hard, generating lightning and waves of energy, and the Misogi has him perform a homing teleport directly above the opponent and deliver a fierce descending strike.\n\nIn 3rd Strike, Akuma is the only other character to possess more than 3 Super Arts AND have 3 of them usable during a match. Ibuki has four Super Arts in total, due only to having two of them swapped between Second Impact and Third Strike; Gill can also use his three Arts in a single match, though the other two are rendered unusable after Resurrection. Akuma is also one of two characters without any EX Specials in the series, with the other being Gill.\n\nIn Street Fighter IV, he has the Wrath of the Raging Demon as his Ultra Combo. In Super Street Fighter IV, Akuma's second Ultra Combo is an extremely powerful Tatsumaki-based move known as Demon Armageddon. Its Japanese name, Tenshou Kaireki Jin, reveals it to be the attack that Akuma would perfect into the literal sea-splitting and explosively ascending technique shown in 3rd Strike.\n\nIn his appearance in Street Fighter X Tekken, unlike other characters, he has two Super Arts; his signature 'hidden' Raging Demon and the Misogi, which returns from the Capcom vs. SNK games. His Cross Art also uses the Tenma Shurettou, also making its return from the Capcom vs. SNK games.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, Akuma gains a new move called Sekia Kuretsuha as his Critical Art where he creates a glowing red orb on his hand, and then slams on the ground, creating a huge blast of fire in front of him. If Dohatsu Shoten is active, performing the well known sequence of buttons activates the Raging Demon, a barrage of punch which ends with the opponent downed, and with Akuma with the kanji 神人 glowing on the back of his gi and in the screen.\n\nIn Street Fighter 6, Akuma's Level 1 Super Art is his Messatsu Gohado. His Level 2 is Empyrean’s End, blasting the opponent with a flaming strike that wall splats his opponent for a further combo. His Level 3 Super Art Sip of Calamity has Akuma throw the opponent onto the ground before stomping on their chest and striking their face with a powerful punch. The Shun Goku Satsu appears as his second Critical Art, assaulting the opponent with an array of Akuma apparitions before slamming their face beneath him.\n\nAs a Boss\nAs a computer-controlled Boss in most games (e.g. Super Street Fighter II Turbo), Akuma, though not in his Shin form, is even more powerful, faster, and more durable in comparison to his \"player\" version, usually only appearing as a Final or hidden Boss. This reflects his personality, as Akuma often holds back his power so as to give his opponents a fighting chance; when fought as a secret Boss, Akuma effectively deems the player's character worthy, and 'powers up' accordingly.\n\nIn Super Street Fighter IV, Akuma is presented once again as a new Boss. He is faster, uses Akuma's 7th color scheme (purple gi, red hair and darker skin tone) and can input two Zanku Hadokens without using any of the Super Combo Gauge, which is similar to Shin Akuma in Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact. Compared to the playable version, the true form of Akuma has higher stamina and stun. His Ashura Senku barely has any startup and recovery, allowing him to dictate the pace of the match.\n\nBy closely inspecting his frame data, the greater priority, faster startup and recovery of his specials becomes obvious. His Super and Ultra Raging Demons both travel farther and much faster (although they can still be jumped over) and are under most circumstances invulnerable to attacks, including other Ultra Combos that would normally cancel out the Raging Demon. Compared to the playable version, his second Ultra Combo, the Demon Armageddon, requires about half the frames to activate, making it much easier to connect with.\n\nIn contrast to the other secret bosses (Gouken, Oni and Evil Ryu), who have an extremely aggressive but predictable AI, Shin Akuma relies on the player to make mistakes, reacting just a split second after the player's move(s), making himself incredibly difficult to defeat for all but the most skillful of players. Although this version of Akuma was confirmed to be the new Boss version fought in Arcade Mode, he is indeed himself using the full extent of his abilities.\n\nBalance Issues\nAkuma is notoriously known for being one of, if not the most overpowered characters in the Street Fighter franchise, and this issue makes him a popular pick among expert players. As early as his first game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Akuma is banned in U.S. tournaments,[25] and soft-banned (i.e. not used on 'principle' as opposed to being officially unusable) in Japanese tournaments. This is a result of the fact that Akuma was initially designed to be extremely powerful; such power is potentially reflected in his lack of a Super Combo at that point.\n\nAs explained previously, Turbo HD Remix attempted to make this version of Akuma more playable by lowering his stamina, giving the Zanku Hadoken a 'blowback' effect, and adding a much weaker Shun Goku Satsu as his Super Combo. Despite these efforts, Akuma has remained banned in HD Remix for the large majority of real-world tournaments, as the changes made to his character did not offset his overreaching power compared to the rest of the cast, and in some cases made it worse.\n\nDue to the steep angle of the Zanku Hadoken (inherited from his later appearances), it is possible to perform cross-up combos that could not be done originally, and with the 'blowback' effect, he can gain extra air time to avoid a projectile the opponent throws at him. In addition, due to a bug and the move's speed, the Shun Goku Satsu cannot be interrupted at close range, making it near impossible to avoid when cornered."

          "content": "Abel (アベル Aberu?) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series. First appearing in Street Fighter IV, he served as the main protagonist of the Street Fighter IV series.[3][4] He is a French amnesiac mixed martial artist and a failed replacement body for M. Bison.\n\nCharacteristics\nHeight\n6'6\" (198 cm)[1][2]\nWeight\n187 lbs (85 kg)[1][2]\nEye color\nBlue (White with black sclera during Ultra)\nHair color\nBlonde\nBlood type\nA[1][2]\nMeasurements\nB130/W85/H89[1]\nPersonal\nFirst Game\nStreet Fighter IV\nBirthdate\nNovember 5[1][2]\nBirthplace\n France[1][2] (raised there, actual birthplace is unknown)\nFighting style\nMixed martial arts based on Judo (柔道を基本とした総合格闘?)[1][2] (Combat Sambo)\nLikes\nDogs[1][2], bears, soft things, Fei Long's films\nDislikes\nOysters (once gave him food poisoning)[1][2], Shadaloo, sea food\nOccupation\nMartial Artist/Mercenary (SFIV),\nShadaloo Soldier (Undercover, SFV)\n\nRival(s)\nSeth, Guile, Fei Long (friendly), Zangief (friendly), Juri, F.A.N.G, Heihachi Mishima, Kuma (SFxTK)\nSkills\nSewing[1][2]\nMoveset\nWheel Kick, Marseilles Roll, Falling Sky, Tornado Throw, Change of Direction, Shoulder Tackle, Heartless, Soulless, Breathless\nStatus\nAlive\n\nAppearance\nAbel is a very well built individual who bears a strong look-alike resemblance with Seth. This is due to the fact that the two were originally meant to be one of M. Bison's many spare bodies. What makes him different to Seth is that due to his success, Abel was either made to look human or because he was a \"mold\" for all male dolls, where as Seth has grey skin and black/glowing eyes.\n\nHe towers over many of the other characters, having similar bulk to Alex. He wears a blue kurtka (Sambo \"gi\") top with white spandex shorts, blue shin guards and thick gloves, alluding to his MMA appearance. He has blue eyes and sports a \"faux-hawk\", and is covered in scars from head to toe, most likely from being experimented on, or from being damaged in the wreckage he was found in.\n\nIn Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind, Abel's kurtka is black instead of blue.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, during Guile's character story, Abel wore a blue Shadaloo uniform under disguise. After getting injured by F.A.N.G, and the events of A Shadow Falls, he wears a casual outfit; a blue short sleeved collared shirt, white trousers and blue slippers. He has bandages on his left arm, face, and forehead.\n\nConcept\nInterestingly, Abel's design had gone through a complete overhaul before the game's release. Abel was originally meant to be a small boy and judo fighter who could be mistaken for a girl, wearing his hair in pig tails, a top made of bandages, baggy blue pants, and sandals.[5]\n\nIt is highly implied that Russian mixed martial arts expert Fedor Emelianenko and French judo champion David Douillet were the inspiration for the character; the fighting style reflects that inspiration, and in fact his main blue outfit is an exact replica of the kurtka and gloves Fedor used to wear; the only exception is that his Russian flag on his kurtka is replaced with the French flag.[citation needed]\n\nAlso of note is that his hairstyle and fighting style resembles traditional wrestling and more contemporary MMA techniques, particularly MMA fighter Fedor Vladimirovich Emelianenko.[6]\n\nSeveral comparisons have been drawn between Abel and professional wrestler Rob Van Dam, due in part to Abel's alternate attire (a wrestling singlet adorned with the French flag and wrestling boots), highly athletic wrestling style and wheel kicks. Abel's voice acting and face resemble that of actor Jean-Claude Van Damme who has also been known to wear a wrestling singlet in his films. Van Damme himself did portray Colonel William F. Guile in the 1994 Street Fighter film. Coincidentally, RVD got his ringname because of having resemblances to that of Van Damme as well.\n\nPersonality\nAbel has a quiet nature that is often mistaken for aloofness and emotional detachment. In truth, however, Abel is a kind and compassionate man, though his amnesia has caused him to develop a tough outer persona. By the time of Super Street Fighter IV, though he remains somewhat aloof, Abel has become more sociable and friendly to his allies, thanking Chun-Li, and giving El Fuerte chocolate. He also shows a soft spot for puppies, something he proudly shares to cat lover Yang, a fascination to bears, as seen in Street Fighter X Tekken, and is a big fan of Fei Long.\n\nCharacter Relationships\nGuile\nWhen the two first met, Abel, having watched Guile practice his Sonic Boom, asked how Guile could perform it. Knowing that only he and his mentor, Charlie, could do it, Guile asked Abel where he first saw it. Thinking that Guile is a spy (from Guile's POV) he said that he wouldn't tell someone he doesn't know his secrets (from Abel's POV) and refuses to talk, thus the two fight. The result is unknown, but since Abel later shows Guile, Chun-Li and Cammy to the S.I.N base later in the story, it is presumed that either Guile won or that Chun-Li persuaded Abel to take them.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, Abel now works alongside Guile as an informant to stop Shadaloo, now on much friendlier terms than when they first met.\n\nFei Long\nAbel is a massive fan of Fei Long and his movies. In Fei Long's rival battle, he asks him for the honour of fighting him. He lost, but both had fun nonetheless. Abel later shows up at his studio to warn him about Shadaloo in Fei Long's ending.\n\nZangief\nAlso a Zangief fan, the two are friendly towards one another in a comrades-at-arms-like relationship. Serving as Zangief's rival in the latter's arcade mode, Zangief finds Abel deep in thought about something that's troubling him, so he fights Abel to help clear his head.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, when Abel was brainwashed by the Psycho Power, Zangief made him unconscious and brought him back to the Kanzuki Estate.\n\nStory\nBackground\nBorn in an unknown place, Abel is a genetically engineered replacement body for M. Bison. He was to be disposed of with the other failed creations, but he alone managed to survive and escape.[7] His status as a spare body is hinted at by several elements in the games, including his Soulless Ultra Combo. Abel was the first person to be chosen by M. Bison to be converted into a doll. Unlike other dolls which are marked by number, this successful one was named \"Abel\", and would later influence the naming of another of the spare bodies.\n\nPre-Street Fighter Alpha 2\nIn 1987, Abel was found in an abandoned Shadaloo base suffering from amnesia and raised and trained by a mysterious soldier who is implied to be Charlie Nash.[8] Abel claims that the man who found him died recently, and Abel feels that he has had no family.\n\nThis event was retconned into Street Fighter V.\n\nStreet Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind\nAbel makes a brief appearance during the conclusion of the animated movie, where he wears a black top instead of his usual blue kurtka. As Chun-Li, Guile, and Cammy discuss previous events, Chun-Li spots Abel and nearly mistakes him for the recently defeated Seth.\n\nStreet Fighter IV series\nTaking place from Alpha 3 five years later after Abel finds a stray puppy and taking him in,[9] he starts a journey of discovery to find who he really was and where he came from, after which he says he will be able to name the dog. He first goes to the detective, Chun-Li, who is investigating Shadaloo. Upon hearing his connection to Shadaloo, she recommends that he participate in the S.I.N. tournament to learn more about his past.\n\nDuring the course of the tournament, he comes across Guile, who is able to use the moves the soldier he was nursed back to health by had used. When Abel recognizes Guile's techniques, Guile realizes that Abel must have known Charlie Nash, and immediately starts pressing him for answers. Abel refuses to reveal secrets to someone he's never met before and their fight escalates. Guile then learns that the man who saved Abel could use the Sonic Boom, and tells Abel that it must have been Charlie. Abel also encounters Fei Long at some point, and the movie star is impressed with the mercenary's ability.\n\nAbel eventually arrives at S.I.N. headquarters around the same time as Guile and Chun-Li. As Guile races to rescue Chun-Li from Vega's trap, Seth (or one of the 26 copies of Seth) stops Guile in his tracks. Abel tackles Seth, allowing Guile to reach Chun-Li before she dies. Abel is surprised to find that he and Seth look identical. Abel is called \"imperfect\" as Bison appears from behind and destroys \"Seth\". Bison allows Abel to leave unharmed for unknown reasons. Abel is later seen looking at the ruined S.I.N. base with Guile and an unconscious Chun-Li.\n\nAfter the tournament, Abel informs Chun-Li that he's going to go on another journey to find more answers.[9] He also goes to Fei Long, warning him of the dangers he may face from S.I.N. and offering to help.\n\nStreet Fighter V\nIn Rashid's character story, the aforementioned fighter is seen messaging multiple individuals through social media; one of these individuals is Abel, who states that he found former Shadoloo king Sagat deep in the mountains.\n\nHe makes an appearance in Guile's character story. He is confronted and nearly killed by F.A.N.G but is saved by Guile. F.A.N.G is responsible for injuring Abel, which stops him from being able to fight for most of the prologue. He later teams up with Guile to investigate the abandoned S.I.N laboratory where they meet Juri who taunts them before escaping. He and Guile discover Shadaloo's next plan, Operation C.H.A.I.N.S., before the lab crumbles. Back in China, Abel expresses gratitude for Guile rescuing him. Suddenly Vega ambushes them. Guile manages to fend off Vega, who warns them about the stage of death before he escapes. Guile explains to Abel the battlefield and the will to survive being the reasons that they will win against Shadaloo in the end.\n\nA Shadow Falls\nIn the main story, Abel is taking undercover as one of the Shadaloo's foot soldiers as he aids Chun-Li and Karin during the first infiltration of the Shadaloo base. Therefore, when F.A.N.G. successfully made a back up for their plans as well as the activation of its Psycho Powers, including the Dolls, Abel is also losing control of himself, due to his body being influenced from Bison's Psycho Powers. He turns on both Chun-Li and Karin, chasing them in a rage. Upon escaping, Abel is soon knocked down by Zangief, who unleashes his signature Spinning Pile Driver to take him to safety.\n\nAs the fighters regroup in the Kanzuki Estate, Abel awakens while losing control, due to the influence of Psycho Power, while both Guile and Charlie tried to hold him off. Charlie manages to absorb the Psycho Powers controlling Abel with his new abilities. Finally drained of his berserk state, he thanks Charlie for freeing him and stays at the Kanzuki Estate to recover, not being seen again for the remainder of the story.\n\nGameplay\nFighting style\nAbel has a very aggressive fighting style, and uses Combat Sambo (Russian Judo with military elements)[1][2] and various MMA styles mixed with Judo, according to the Street Fighter IV Strategy Guide. This means that most of his punches consist of open palm strikes, a rising elbow strike (down-forward heavy punch) and uses a fair few kicks.\n\nMoveset\nAbel is mainly a grappler, and many of his moves either chain into a throw or set a foe up for one; several moves also take advantage of the foe's direction. Since he moves rather slowly, one would assume he would have a difficult time getting close enough to throw an opponent; however, most of his techniques get him either behind an enemy or right in their face. Abel is also capable of grounding airborne foes, getting very close in the process. Abel is a strong character who needs to get close to finish a fight, and has plenty of moves to achieve that end.\n\nBecause he has great combo potential, several grabs and lacks a projectile, Abel is generally played as a mixup-based character. He is also equipped with a good variety of cross-ups and overheads, an anti-air grab and a command grab; this makes Abel great for keeping opponents guessing, and punishing their mistakes."

His attire in Final Fight closely resembles a white version of that worn by the Andore family, but he is keen to point out that he is not one of them.[5] He usually wears facepaint, but in Mighty Final Fight, a non-canon retelling of the original Final Fight with chibi sprites, he is seen without facepaint.\n\nAbigail's height and weight makes him the tallest character in the entire Street Fighter franchise, and the second heaviest, only being surpassed in weight by Gill.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, his tanktop sports skull prints, tire track prints on his pants, and tires worn as both rings and large armbands, the armbands with \"Mad Gear\" painted on them in white. On a wallet chain on the back of his pants are two tires worn through it, and around his neck is a black leather spiked collar. His fingernails are painted dark gray. In a possible manner like Birdie, who is designed to be like a bird in fashion, Abigail's overall features come to give him the similarities of a bulldog, which are portrayed as relentless guard dogs in popular media.\n\nHis first alternate costume is similar to his default attire but he wears a welding mask to conceal his face, blue jeans, and one of the shoulders of his tank top is ripped. A large tire is stretched diagonally across his body.\n\nHis second alternate costume has him shirtless, but accessorized with a pair of goggles and large tire shoulder bands with chains draped across them. His black flap top hairstyle becomes red, shoulder length dreadlocks, he also gains a red, walrus mustache and holds a crookedly bent nail between his teeth. His tire-track marked trousers are suspended by a belt with a cog as a buckle. On a minor note, this outfit is most reminiscent of Skull Cross Gang member Caine.\n\nPersonality\nAbigail's personality is like that of most other stereotypical rev heads and ironically, while traditional Canadian stereotypes include being generally well-mannered and polite, Abigail very rarely displays these traits despite being in a gang and being an expert on vehicles; he is instead shown to be quite dimwitted, hot-tempered, abrash and childish. He always likes to pretend he's driving a car and making bad impressions of car noises. He is also known for getting upset and can start crying when he thinks someone has stolen his car, even if he lets his friends or subordinates borrow it for a day, such as Axl, Roxy and J. His profile on the Shadaloo C.R.I. website states he is a competitive quiz taker, which references his appearance in Mighty Final Fight, in which he states he has been exercising his brain with quizzes, and makes the player take a quiz before fighting him.\n\nHe is not malicious or antagonistic though, as his win quotes against Chun-Li and Lucia (\"Keep your nose outta my business, copper. I'm totally legit now.\" and \"Another cop trying to stick their nose into my business. I'm legit now, so get lost.\") and Nash (\"Why so moody, pal? Try smiling! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!\") indicate that he has both put his Mad Gear days behind him and is akin to more of a jock with crude humor and a one-track mind, but fairly jovial. He also loves motorbikes as seen in his win quote against Akira which he gave her some advice as Akira is a former bike mechanic (\"That's a sweet bike you got! But it needs more horsepower! I wanna hear more like VRRROOOM!!\"). As Akira responded in her win quote against him (\"Horsepower's important, but so is technique. That's true for bikes AND fights!\").\n\nCharacter Relationships​​​​​\n\nPoison\nPoison tries to use Abigail as a replacement to Hugo after they have a fallout, but Roxy tells her that Abigail is not interested.\n\nCody\nAs Cody and Abigail have a complicated history towards each other, this was brought up when Abigail still remembers the mayor from their past after the latter had confronted him for illegal parking. Surprisingly, Cody expected him to have redeemed from his Mad Gear criminal past and contribute more to Metro City.\n\nLucia\nLucia initially did not expect Abigail to have renounced his criminal ways but much like Cody's situation, she expects Abigail to stick to them.\n\nAlex\nDespite having little interactions with each other (apart from a certain incident regarding a missing truck), both fighters according to their win-quotes generally have some mutual respect towards each other, possibly due to their shared interests in automobiles. Alex complements Abigail on his strength but tells him to refine his technique, while Abigail also complements Alex's strength and recommends the latter to fix his car first before other things, likely offering his services.\n\nStory\nBackground\nAt some point, Abigail became the hired height and muscle of the Mad Gear Gang who even surpasses the Andore Family, his duty was to rob and carry away stolen vehicles and illegally sell them.\n\nHis first paying customer was Bred, who later got his car destroyed by two of the heroic street fighters.\n\nFinal Fight\nIn 1986, Abigail is the fifth lieutenant in Belger's fray, in charge of the city's Bay Area. When Haggar's daughter Jessica was kidnapped by the gang, Cody and Guy took a shortcut through the Bay Area on their way to Belger's penthouse. It was there they encountered Abigail, who told them:\n\n\"Hey, cool down. She must be having a good time with Belger!\"[5]\n\nAt this, Cody rushed to save Jessica from Belger's hands, leaving Guy behind to deal with Abigail. After a difficult fight Guy managed to beat Abigail.\n\n\nStreet Fighter V\nPrologue - 'Fierce Beast'\n\nA decade later into 1996, after the events of Final Fight and the fall of Belger, Abigail supposedly renounced his life of crime and started a mechanic's garage in the Metro City Bay Area called \"Abigail's Scrap Metal,\" hiring fellow former Mad Gear goons J, Axl and Roxy who also assumedly live at the garage with him.\n\nThinking that his monster truck was missing, Abigail was wandering around, crying and making various vehicle impressions. He was encountered by Ibuki, Zangief, Juri and Vega, who were all puzzled and insulted by his behavior. He was making extremely poor vehicle impressions that Ibuki, Vega and Zangief misinterpreted as farting noises, pig sounds and boos, respectively. He also said that he felt like a \"flat\" tyre, and Juri misinterpreted this remark as him calling her \"flat-chested\". Only Alex was able to recognize one of Abigail's sounds (a 6.5 liter V8 Turbo Diesel engine, which is the engine of his truck), but the two of them fought anyway because Abigail wanted to vent his anger out.\n\nAfter they fought, J, Axl and Roxy show up and remind him that he originally let them borrow the truck for the day. The trio mock Abigail for forgetting this, causing him to fly into a rage and launch them all into the truck, then walks away casually.\n\nOther character story appearances\nAbigail appears in Cody's character story, where Cody confronts him for illegally parking his truck and manages to defeat him in a fight.\nIn Lucia's character story, Abigail was beaten down by her, who believed he was still working with the Mad Gear gang, at the request of Mike Haggar. Abigail furiously tells her that he now works with his own scrap metal business. At the same time, he was mocked by both Roxy and Lucia for his black facepaint which was ruined after the fight.\nIn Poison's character story, she visits Metro City Bay Area to search for Hugo's replacement for her wrestling organization. Poison decides to test Abigail's strength to see if he's qualified for as a wrestling partner. After defeating Abigail, Poison gives him a passing grade which allows him to go on a tour with her to become a wrestler, but Roxy claims that Abigail is too busy running his business, thus she leaves Abigail alone.\n\nFighting style\nDespite not having any fighting style, his attacks are mainly taking advantage of his physique. Abigail uses no finesse or any specific style in his fighting, just brute force. He picks up his opponents and throws them around like rag dolls. Despite updates nerfing his attacks, Abigail still has such high damage potential that he can get characters with low HP, such as Cammy and Akuma, down to less than half of their health in one V-Trigger or stun combo. He can occasionally turn red with Max Power, which swells his muscles, thus making him stronger and uses running body slams. Abigail has also shown he is deceptively agile despite his massive size and little speed, being able to perform a perfected front flip via his Giant Flip attack, being able to perform a very quick roll from the starting position of his Nitro Charge and can still jump reasonably high (although this is likely due to gameplay mechanics). In Final Fight One, \"Alpha Cody\" (a non-canon unlockable character who is the Cody seen in Street Fighter Alpha 3 somehow reliving the past) notes that he hadn't been terribly impressed by Abigail, asking whether he still stuck to \"using only one attack pattern\".[7] In Mighty Final Fight, one of his humorous attacks is to pick up his opponents and kiss them.\n\nMoveset\nIn Street Fighter V, Abigail's playstyle is more of that of a striker like Balrog in contrast with Hugo's wrestling style, possibly in order to deviate the former from the trend of large, hulking characters who are often grapplers. He and Hugo may have moves that charge towards the opponent, but Hugo does so in a way to set up throws as a wrestler whereas Abigail likes to bulldoze and pummel them like a brute. Additionally, Hugo's strikes set up his grabs, whereas Abigail's grabs set up his strikes.\n\nAs he often states in victory quotes against speed-orientated characters, he cares little about speed or even a balance between power and speed; all he's about is hitting hard to cripple his opponents and is able to take hits from fast combos. However, this does not mean that he cannot pull off some devastating combos himself, because while his moveset consists of slow, hard-hitting attacks that are typically seen with other large characters, his moveset has two deadly throws (Abigail Smash and Bay Area Sunrise) and clever use of canceling between unique and special moves will really bring the fullest extent of the damage he can deal."

          "content": "Adon (アドン Adon?, Thai: อาดอน) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing as a non-playable opponent in the original Street Fighter, before becoming playable in Street Fighter Alpha.

While shorter than Sagat, he is still taller than Ryu. In the original Street Fighter, his hair was short and spiky similar to Joe's hairdo, but in later games, it is done up in a flat-top style similar to Guile's hairdo. His hair is always colored either orange or red, depending on the artist. His eyes are fierce, and he almost always has a conniving, wild smile on his face, reflective of his personality.\n\nAdon wears trunks resembling his former mentor's, though the yellow stripe pattern on his trunks forms a V shape while Sagat's simply have two stripes running down the legs - and in his Shadaloo C.R.I. profile art, Adon's trunks have the word \"miracle\" written on its waistline. Adon also wears wraps on his hands and feet like Sagat, though his are smaller than his master's due to his smaller size. Unlike Sagat, who apparently did away with his ceremonial Muay Thai gear, Adon wears the traditional mongkhon on his forehead and pra jiad on both biceps. These articles of clothing are worn by Muay Thai fighters in the ring as both proof of ability and good-luck charms.\n\nPersonality\nAdon is shown to have a large ego and is quite cocky, as well as boastful to the point of true arrogance, desiring to be seen as the \"god\" of Muay Thai. He also tends to belittle and look down upon most other fighters, like his former Master. Adon seeks self-aggrandization and strength above all else, and he has never demonstrated a single act of friendship, humility or kindness towards any other character throughout the series. However, in the Udon comics (more specifically Street Fighter Unlimited), he shows humility and respect towards his former master and admits that though he is skilled, he still has ways to go before achieving full mastery of his art.\n\nCharacter Relationships\nSagat\nAdon became Sagat's student after Sagat became the Emperor of Muay Thai. Sagat saw his old self in Adon, a fighter who never lost his fighting spirit no matter how injuries or the size of his opponent.[7] Because of Sagat, Adon instilled his philosophy that Muay Thai is the strongest martial art and strength is everything.[8] After Sagat was defeated by Ryu, Adon was furious at his former teacher for being unable to uphold Muay Thai's honor, scorning him as \"a tiger who has lost his fangs\". From then on, Adon has distanced himself from Sagat to walk his own path of self-glory. Sagat himself finds the fact that Adon was once his student \"a source of great shame\".\n\nM. Bison\nM. Bison tries to recruit Adon during the Alpha series but Adon refuses. In Asahi Sonorama's Street Fighter II Complete File, the correlation diagram reveals that M. Bison \"has stolen a kick\" from Adon. It is said that M. Bison's special move \"Double Knee Press\" is very similar to \"Jaguar Kick\" in the original Street Fighter.\n\nAkuma\nBecause Akuma killed a Muay Thai master that Adon was supposed to fight, he seeks to defeat him to prove himself. In Alpha 3, he finds him and loses to him. Akuma doesn't kill him: due to him deeming Adon unworthy of it.\n\nStory\nBackground\nAdon was born from a family of peasants in Thailand, which is historically the homeland of Muay Thai since the 13th century.\n\nIn 1966, when he was only five years old, Adon's father took him to the Khmer Ruins for the first time, where many fighters challenged the Muay Thai Emperor Nuakan, his father included. None of them managed to defeat him. Adon then wished to grow stronger and one day challenge Nuakan. Some years later, a young man named Sagat managed to defeat Nuakan, and Adon was impressed with their intense battle.\n\nA few years later into 1970, Sagat becomes the Muay Thai Champion at the age of 15. An aspired Adon at age 9 then asked his idol Sagat to make him his disciple.[9]\n\nStreet Fighter\nIn 1987, Adon finally graduated from being Sagat's pupil to being his champion, after Sagat became the Emperor of Muay Thai. Adon established an unshakable position as a powerful person next to Sagat.[10]\n\nOne day, while Adon was on his expedition, word began to spread on an unnamed fighter who defeated 20 Muay Thai practitioners. That fighter was named Ryu, both Adon and Sagat accept his challenge to defend Muay Thai's honor, by hosting the World Fighting Tournament where the strongest fighters in the world compete.\n\nRyu, however, defeats all 10 of the street fighters including both Muay Thai experts. By the time Adon returned for the championship ranking announcement, Sagat was already gone.[11][12]\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha & Street Fighter Alpha 2\nIn the same year, Adon would spend the next few months looking for Sagat.[13][14][15] During his journey, he'd defeat many martial artists which lead to Adon becoming more and more convinced that Muay Thai really is the strongest martial art after all.[16] Adon vows to defeat Sagat for dishonoring the name of Muay Thai and rise to the top.[17]\n\nIn Alpha, Adon challenges Sagat for the title of \"God of Muay Thai\" and defeats him. After Adon's victory, M. Bison, who was watching, tries to recruit Adon into Shadaloo. Adon rejects his offer and challenges him, but the outcome of the battle is unknown. The events of the game were effectively retconned by the sequel.\n\nIn Alpha 2, Adon is not mad at Ryu for defeating Sagat, but at his teacher for being unable to uphold Muay Thai's honor. He challenges Sagat for the title of \"God of Muay Thai\" and wins, even defacing a Buddha statue's face with his Rising Jaguar technique. A fighter kills a man who was about to challenge Adon for his title. Adon sees this as a challenge; knowing only that this mysterious fighter has red hair and wears a black gi with the symbol \"Ten\" on his back, Adon swears to find him and test his strength.[18]\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha 3\nIn 1989, Adon travels the world, he encounters Ken and realizes that Ken has trained in the same style as the fighter he seeks, and fights him in order to recognize this mysterious fighter by the moves Ken uses. Ken, in turn, recognizes Adon as Sagat's student, an identification which enrages Adon. The two fight, and Adon is victorious. Later, Rose attempts to convince him not to continue on his current path, as it will lead ultimately to destruction and ruin. Adon cannot be swayed, however, and continues on his way.\n\nEventually, he encounters Bison, who commends his abilities and admits that he has underestimated him. Adon rejects Bison's praise and tells him that he doesn't need him; he is searching for something else. Bison somehow knows what Adon is seeking: mastery of the Shun Goku Satsu in order to perfect the Muay Thai style. Adon is stunned, and Bison goes on to tell him that his goal is foolish; the Shun Goku Satsu is nothing when compared to his Psycho Power, which he attempts to demonstrate.\n\nThe two fight, and though Adon is technically more proficient, Bison cannot be defeated and eventually wears him down. As Bison is about to deal the finishing blow, laughing that he does not fear death, Akuma appears out of nowhere and performs the Shun Goku Satsu on him, defeating him (but not killing him, it seems) for the time being. Akuma then leaves, leaving Adon with the realization that Akuma is the fighter he is seeking. More determined than ever, Adon vows to find Akuma again and claim the power of the \"Raging Demon\" as his own.[19]\n\nSuper Street Fighter IV\nIn 1994, returning to his changing room after a fight, Adon hears of S.I.N.'s latest competition which is the Worldwide Fighting Tournament. Knowing that Sagat will of course be taking part, and scorning him as \"a tiger who has lost his fangs\" he seizes the opportunity to make an entry of his second tournament appearance in order to put Sagat \"out of his misery\". \n\nAdon and Sagat fight, with Adon emerging as the victor. Satisfied with his victory, he watches from above as a content Sagat returns home to his village, remarking that he has now \"declawed and dethroned\" Sagat and that he will show the world the power of Muay Thai by destroying all those who enter the ring with him. \n\nFighting style\nAdon fights with a more dynamic and acrobatic form of Muay Thai, allowing him to deliver ranged airborne attacks effectively.\n\nMoveset\nAdon's special moves are generally fast-moving strikes that are counter-able if missed, requiring players to sufficiently confuse foes before overwhelming them with speed. As a foil to Sagat, much of Adon's moves are kick-based with flashy-offense compared to Sagat's somewhat more fundamental style that focuses on the neutral game.\n\nThe Jaguar Kick is a slashing somersault kick that can be used in midair, where it is a good anti-air. The Rising Jaguar is a double knee thrust, capable of intercepting airborne attackers at a low angle and passing through projectile attacks. The Jaguar Tooth, Adon's most versatile special move, allows Adon to leap off the edge of the screen to strike his opponent; he can potentially surprise them by landing 'short' and delivering an alternate attack.\n\nThese techniques are all highly effective at countering projectile-users, and give him a slight edge against characters such as Ryu and Ken. It also provides a means of offense against characters that rely excessively on defense (known as turtling).\n\nWhen using X-ISM Adon in Street Fighter Alpha 3, pressing any kick button while jumping will execute his trademark Jaguar Kick. However, this version of the Jaguar Kick is considered a normal move, and thus does not inflict chip damage."

Both feature red trim and appear to be made of snakeskin. She has uniquely-shaped white hair based on a traditional Japanese straw hat called a \"kasa\" (related to the word \"umbrella\" in Japanese),[3] which is seen as an assassin's symbol.[4] She has a beauty mark under her lips. Her eyes are cardinal red, as seen in her teaser trailer. She wears lipstick of the same shade. She sports a pair of slim metal gauntlets with a claw on each finger, which are worn over her long, sharp nails that are coated with poison. It's possible these gauntlets are based off of Chinese nail guards (also known as \"zhijiatao/huzhi\").[5] Each finger of the gauntlet is made up of multiple sections that can extend outwards, giving her additional reach through the use of poisoned chains. These chains are wrapped around her forearm when not in use.\n\nIn one of the scenes during World Tour and like Rose who bathes at the tub, her short hair which is styled in a kasa was pushed down by the water to show her white hair in a shoulder-length style.\n\nIn the past, prior to adopting the name A.K.I., she had long black hair braided in two, which turned white as she built a resistance to poison.\n\nPersonality\nA.K.I. initially presents herself as a calm and somewhat gleeful individual, with knowledge of Chinese medicine. However, hidden behind this facade is a sadistic and psychopathic woman - arguably even more so than Juri Han (whose cruelty is a coping mechanism for her trauma). A.K.I. has also mastered the use of poisons, displaying knowledge of their side effects, and seems to enjoy teasing her victims, as seen with the Avatar in World Tour. A.K.I. viewed her fighting technique as a form of \"art\" and is more than eager to display her \"perfect\" mastery on others, willingly or not. Though according to F.A.N.G, A.K.I will only resort to killing when necessary or when she is ordered to do so, and that she prefers to use \"pain and unbridled fear\" to scare others into cooperating or keep them out of her business.\n\nA peculiar aspect of A.K.I's personality is her \"snake-like\" behavior and mannerisms. A.K.I. can be often seen \"slithering\" on the ground and around others, both within and outside of the fight. This is further emphasized by her unique \"shi-shi-shi-shi\" laughter, which is either \"嘻嘻嘻嘻\" in Chinese (sinister/playful female laughter) or can be interpreted as a mimicry to snakes. She also adopts her master's verbal tic of using 'desu', a sentence particle that is also a homonym for the Japanese pronunciation of the word 'death'.\n\nAlthough professional during her duties, A.K.I.'s deep adoration for her master often overcomes her composed demeanor. She openly expresses her love and unwavering devotion to F.A.N.G. in a flamboyantly dramatic manner.\n\nCharacter Relationships\nFriends/Allies\nF.A.N.G\nA.K.I.'s mentor, who took her under his tutelage away from a life of poverty after she admired the writing engraved on his dagger. A.K.I. adores her master and devotes herself to his every word, even sparing enemies that she would have easily killed had F.A.N.G. not asked otherwise. A.K.I. uses the term 'xian sheng' when speaking to her master, a neutral Chinese honorific to refer to men, as F.A.N.G. insists that the two do not have a deeper relationship in case they were forced to eliminate one another. However, she also notes that the term can be used to mean 'teacher' and 'husband', the latter of which she intends whenever she says 'xian sheng'. In spite of her infatuation, she is aware that F.A.N.G. could abandon her should she no longer have any use, and questions where her path will go should that happen.\n\nEnemies\nRashid\nThe archenemy of her master F.A.N.G, as well as her own archenemy.\n\nChun-Li\nA.K.I. is aware of Chun-Li's reputation as the Interpol officer. While she seems to have some respect for Chun-Li's feat, evident by how she referred to her as \"Dàjiě\" (a polite way to address older woman), she nevertheless warns Chun-Li to stay out of her business, lest she would end up \"losing [her] face.\"\n\nJP\nIn a brief encounter with JP, A.K.I. is well aware about his plans to revive Shadaloo, and as such she was sent by F.A.N.G to keep him out of his own revival plan. A.K.I. is more than eager to \"erase\" JP out of existence since she believes he would become an obstacle to her master's ambitions later on, but she chose not to do so as F.A.N.G instruct her not to use lethal force.\n\nStory\nStreet Fighter V Side Story: Toxicity\nAfter the fall of M. Bison and Shadaloo, F.A.N.G. retreats back to the city of Shanghai and regroups his efforts into reviving Shadaloo once more.[6] After a night of carousing with old associates and reestablishing ties to help fund his efforts during the Chinese New Year,[6] he takes notice of a teenage girl who initially appears to be a prostitute, and is lured to a rundown and secluded place [7]. Upon arrival, and after an attempt at seduction, the teenage girl's true nature is revealed to F.A.N.G. with the surprise appearance of her brother with a camera and the intention of blackmail. [7]\n\nTaking note rather of her spirit, and held at blackmail by her brother who had recorded him through his smartphone,[7] he offers the two three options: an offer of money, secretly poisoned to ensure the death of either of them and potential destruction of their clientele; an ornate snake handled dagger, which would have him slice off the hand of the one that would grab it; and neither, allowing both to escape with their lives.[8]\n\nThe sister instead takes note of the inscribed words on the dagger's blade and its beauty, desiring to know more about its origins, feeling that they hold some type of power. F.A.N.G says that she is right and offers to reveal their meaning if she comes with him. Without knowing it, she picked the most valuable thing F.A.N.G had offered, as the characters in the dagger were infact the Nguuhao's most coveted possession beholding the secrets to their most powerful poison techniques, passed down through the generations in the organization. The girl accepts F.A.N.G's offer and he takes the girl, who he names \"Phantom\", under his wing and trains her as a successor.[8]\n\nPhantom would eventually become known as A.K.I., a snake-like assassin devoted to her master F.A.N.G.\n\nStreet Fighter 6\nA poison-wielding apprentice of F.A.N.G, the former Shadaloo officer. Enchanted by the power of toxins, nothing brings her more joy than testing them on a new target—other than attention from her “master,” that is.\n\nA.K.I.: Time to Work\nAt Tian Hong Yuan, A.K.I. received an assignment from her master F.A.N.G to investigate activities of the remnants of Shadaloo, and to send out a \"warning\" if they have interfered with his plans. A.K.I. admits that she would rather just eliminate them, but her master instructed not to use lethal force.\n\nWhile she's contemplating about her mission, A.K.I. accidentally bumped into Chun-Li, whom A.K.I. instantly recognizes. Aware that the Interpol agent has came back from her break, A.K.I warns Chun-Li not to interfere or else she would \"end up losing [her] whole face.\"\n\nSome time later, at the Suval'hal Arena in Nayshall, A.K.I. encountered JP, the former head financier of Shadaloo. JP is surprised that A.K.I. has managed to slip past his security and reach him in person. A.K.I. instead tells JP that she is aware where his laundered money is being funneled, along with his plans for the former Shadaloo experimental subject Ed, and questions his motive. JP refuses the allegations, instead excusing that he is merely a treasurer whose his only duty is to \"distribute the funds left by that organization accordingly.\" A.K.I. dismiss JP's claims, however, and assaults JP.\n\nAfter the battle, A.K.I. managed to incapacitate JP. After a brief interrogation, A.K.I. insists that the revival of Shadaloo should only be done by her master, who JP correctly guessed that it was F.A.N.G who was behind the attack. Before she leaves, A.K.I. threatened JP that if he interferes with F.A.N.G's plans, she would \"erase [his] existence whenever [F.A.N.G] commands it.\"\n\nAs A.K.I. leaves, she prepared to report the mission results to F.A.N.G. Suddenly, A.K.I. lets out her joyful monologue out of her infatuation towards F.A.N.G. A.K.I. admits she is excited for a \"heaps of praise\" from her master, and cannot wait for his \"adulations.\" A.K.I. is more than confident that F.A.N.G would be proud of a job well done, as she \"followed [his] orders to the letter\" and using \"pain and unbridled fear\" instead of lethal force as he instructed. A.K.I. then lets out her maniacal laugher out of her sheer love for her master.\n\nWorld Tour\nBlossoming Poison. Tantalizing Talons. Viper. (開花する毒、食欲をそそる爪、バイパー Kaika suru doku, shokuyoku o sosoru tsume, baipā?, Simplified Chinese: 绽放毒药、诱人利爪、毒蛇)\n\n\"No matter how much one trains, they all fall victim to mere milligrams of my handiwork. Such futile efforts, heeheehee.... (どれだけ訓練しても、私のほんの数ミリグラムの努力でみんな犠牲になる。無駄な努力だ、ふふふ…。 どれだけ訓練しても、私のほんの数ミリグラムの努力でみんな犠牲になる。無駄な努力だ、ふふふ…。?)\"\n—A.K.I.'s advice after completing training & achieving Mastery\nA.K.I. first meets the Avatar when a thief stole her bag, believing it to be money. In reality, the bag held poison. The Avatar successfully stops the thief by blocking him. A.K.I. intends to kill him, but the Avatar interjects and convinces A.K.I to let him go. A.K.I. then revives the thief and sets them free. A.K.I. gifts the Avatar the herbs he needs for a customer he's helping. The Avatar asks to become her student and she accepts.\n\nFighting style\nA.K.I's fighting style consists of a mix of Chinese Kenpo & Shequan (Snake Kung Fu), along with her mentor F.A.N.G's poison-focused mechanics.\n\nMoveset\nSimilarly to her master F.A.N.G, A.K.I's playstyle revolves around a unique poison mechanic: upon successfully hitting an enemy with certain moves, a poison status effect is applied, which slowly drains the opponent's health until its duration runs out, or if A.K.I takes damage. The poison effect naturally expires after 7 seconds and deals 1 damage per frame (60 damage per second) for a total of 420 damage, and cannot KO an opponent, meaning A.K.I has to deal the final blow. Blocking her poison attacks will safely prevent poisoning, even in burnout.\n\nWhat separates her style from her master is Toxic Blossom, a poisonous explosion around the target which can be triggered against poisoned opponents by certain special moves or target combos: this ends the poison status prematurely, but forces different juggle states that opens up a wide variety of combo routes. Toxic Blossom encourages aggressive gameplay unlike her master; if done optimally, A.K.I can apply poison, initiate a combo that triggers Toxic Blossom, and continue with a long string by poisoning the opponent again.\n\nA.K.I's moveset borrows many abilities from F.A.N.G, sharing some attacks with him while borrowing his slippery movements, though with long-ranged options and a more aggressive focus. Serpent Lash uses her gauntlets for extremely long-ranged but slow poison pokes that can pull opponents closer or extend combos. Her projectile, Nightshade Pulse, takes the form of a slow poison bubble that allows A.K.I to approach alongside it, with the Overdrive version being useful for projectile wars due to its multiple hits. Sinister Slide is a snake-like slide that acts similar to Senpukuga, though granting her a command grab and multiple attacks out of it. Snake Step is a command dash to escape pressure similar to Nikankyaku. Orchid Spring places a pool of poison on the floor similar to Ryobenda, without a poison bomb portion and mainly to assume stage control. With all this considered, mastery of A.K.I therefore requires the player to juggle keeping the opponent poisoned to force approaches, triggering Toxic Blossom's effect for long combos, and using her burst movement options to grant her space and time for her opponent to make mistakes.\n\nA.K.I's Level 1 Super is Deadly Implication, a spinning kick and variant of the Shishiruirui that, on hit, traps the opponent in a poison bubble before it detonates, poisoning them. It deals low damage if the poison doesn't run its course, but grants brief invulnerability and is useful for anti-airs or getting out of pressure. Her Level 2 Super is Tainted Talons, a wild mass of talon strikes that can be aimed and leaves a large long-lasting poison pool where it hits. It is useful for finishing combos, punishing at long-range, and stage control due to its poison pool, but doesn't offer any invincibility. Her Level 3 is Claws of Ya Zi, a powerful finisher which sees A.K.I slithering around the opponent, tapping pressure points on their body, before triggering an explosion by tapping their head; the Critical Art version instead has her wrap her opponent in her poison talons before triggering said explosion."

In actual battles and in Arcade Mode, Akira would remove her black biker helmet.\n\nIn the Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki mode of Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki 2, her game portrait and appearance has her wearing an orange and blue short sleeve shirt and a white jumpsuit with the long sleeves are tied on her waist and black shoes where she works as a bike mechanic. She is sometimes usually seen in her black biker outfit but with or without a helmet. She also wears various outfits during the school term and in addition, wore two swimsuits during both Swimming Day and the Beach Overnight. Her first swimsuit is a dark blue strapless bikini and the other swimsuit is her light blue short sleeved openly hoodie with light violet stripes in each sleeve and a dark blue one-piece suit underneath her jacket.\n\nIn Project Justice and for her playable debut in Street Fighter V, her original outfit had her black biker jacket tied on her waist. Aside from her original outfit, she wears the Seijyun Girls' school uniform which consist of a dark blue vest with a short sleeved sailor collar with a red laced ribbon on the collar, a dark blue skirt, navy blue socks and black dress shoes. Her white sailor collar has cross black linings on each side. Her Seijyun Girls' school uniform became her second alternate costume in Street Fighter V only her vest and skirt are black. She also has black bloomers beneath her skirt when it was pleated during fights.\n\nHer summer costume is a combination between her two swimsuits in School Life Mode during both Swimming Day and the Beach Overnight, Akira's strapless bikini is now purple with white outlines and her short sleeved openly hoodie is now white. She can also fight without her short sleeved hoodie. Her extra swimsuit seen in her character story has her wearing a green swim top with a lime green heart designs and a matching bikini.\n\nHer nostalgia costume is her maid outfit during the School Fair Day in School Life Mode and sometimes Akira would tie her medium-length hair into a single bun covered by a white bao to show off her fringes on her hair while wearing the outfit.\n\nHer tracksuit costume is that of her sports attire consist of a white sleeveless top with red and blue outlines which exposes her midriff, blue trousers with a white drawstring and white sneakers. She also equipped with red fingerless gloves.\n\nPersonality\nAkira is a silent girl who rarely speaks out her thoughts. She may be tough and commanding while wearing her biker outfit, but is a docile and gentle person without it. The outfit was originally intended to hide her true gender prior to enrolling in Gedo High.\n\nHer personality was initially demonstrated in the Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki mode of Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki 2, in which she was trying to keep her true gender as a secret, which causes Akira to be personally embarrassed upon revealing it to the player. Throughout the school term, Akira also shows her shy side to the player, especially during the Swimming Day, where it's revealed that she doesn't like to swim due to being aquaphobic. She can also be quite very happy and optimistic to help other characters out as well, such as Hinata and Boman during the School Fair Day.\n\nAs of Project Justice, she was transferred to the all-girls Seijyun High, leaving her without any friends, until she found one in Yurika, and later on, Zaki. Though Yurika was later revealed to have been an accomplice to the recent tension between the schools and even the brainwashing of Daigo, Akira was willing to forgive her after she showed regret for what she had done and considers her a good friend.\n\nAkira values friendship, and is shown to make good friends rather quickly. She befriended Sakura during her mission to find Daigo and later befriended Ibuki and Karin Kanzuki after the latter organized a tea party for the four of them. In her Street Fighter V win quotes, Akira holds her friends in high regard and wishes to make more. She has a strong sense of justice and honor, and shows distaste for villains, and even those that are simply overconfident.\n\nAkira reveres her brother Daigo and is greatly concerned for his safety, asking Rose if she can let her know if he starts running off. Being the only family she has, Akira will do anything to make sure he is alright, going so far as to disguise herself as a boy to attend Gedo High to discover his whereabouts. Many characters note the strength of their bond, with Ryu and Dhalsim finding their power intriguing while Zangief and Laura see them as a tag team.\n\nStory\nBackground\nAkira and her older brother Daigo Kazama are orphans. They previously lived together in Daigo's own home before Akira moved to the Seijyun dorms. Their parents were friends with a man who owns a garage, who would then go on to both teach Akira about repairing motorcycles and employ her as well.\n\nRival Schools: United by Fate\nPrior to her initial appearance, she appears at the last part of her older brother, Daigo's ending (Daigo's storyline in the game takes place before the events of Rival Schools: United by Fate), in which Akira herself decides to pose as a boy in order to enter Gedo High so that she can find out on what had happened to Daigo after he had unexpectedly disappeared from within his own personal mission of solving the school kidnappings.\n\nHer initial appearance in Rival Schools: United by Fate is under a motorcycle helmet and being dressed in biker gear while posing as both a boy and as Daigo's younger brother. She befriends two of Daigo's subordinates, Edge and Gan, who eventually became suspicious of her actions, which forces Akira to fight against the two of them in a handicap match, with both Edge and Gan testing her fighting skills in order to truly see if she is indeed their boss' younger brother. After defeating the Pacific High students (Roy, Tiffany, and Boman) who were captured and brainwashed by Hideo and Kyoko, the trio decides to pursue the latter two, only to be stopped and informed by both Natsu and Roberto that both Hideo and Kyoko, along with Roy, Tiffany, and Boman were brainwashed by Justice High School. With this new profound knowledge, Akira now realizes that her older brother may have been brainwashed as well following his sudden disappearance.\n\nAfter Hyo's defeat, the Gedo High trio eventually rescue Daigo as Akira emotionally reunites with her older brother while speaking out in a feminine voice towards him, in which both Edge and Gan are initially confused by their boss' word about \"a lady like yourself\" to Akira. From there, Akira finally shows her true gender to them by removing her black biker helmet and apologizes to both Eiji and Gan for her past deception towards them while also telling them that she was not Daigo's younger brother, but rather, his younger sister, much to their own shocking surprise. Despite this, both Edge and Gan eventually accepts Akira as their new friend, telling her that the three of them had fought together during their adventure to rescue Daigo and that she's now one of them, much to Akira's own dismay as she personally wants to go back to school as a regular student.\n\nProject Justice\nIn the Seijyun High storyline of Project Justice, Akira, who has been transferred to the girls-only Seijyun High, is the central character, with the player themself following her on her personal quest to find out on what had happened to Daigo, who had suddenly and unexpectedly changed after returning from his personal training journey. She manages to befriend Yurika and later on Zaki, with the latter only agreeing to join the duo if they could defeat her in a test of strength.\n\nAfter hearing and learning of Daigo's sudden change of personality, the trio decides to investigate the situation while also investigating the new wave of attacks on the local schools themselves. Upon meeting Batsu on the way, Akira is attacked by him (unaware at the time that it was actually Kurow in disguise). Akira and her friends then later on fight the real Batsu whom she mistakes as the real culprit. By the time of this, both Gedo High and Seijyun High are on the verge of having a school gang war against each other.\n\nAkira and Zaki are soon confronted by a brainwashed Daigo and that Akira herself tries to snap him out of it, only to be stopped by both Edge and Gan, who tells her that they need to fight against him by force in order to help free Daigo from his brainwashed state. While the battle takes place, Zaki hears an unexpected whistle noise and soon realizes that Yurika (who was secretly working with both her younger brother Kurow and Momo from within the Darkside Student Congress) was playing Kurow's flute in order to control Daigo from within his brainwashed state.\n\nIf the player plays as Akira, along with Edge and Zaki, they defeat the brainwashed Daigo and free him. Kurow then exposes his sister Yurika who is also part of the Darkside Student Congress at the mountain area. Yurika, however, remains unwilling to aid her classmates and not guilty for siding on Kurow's mission. She was seen cradling her injured brother's arms after he was defeated. This scene would not unlock Akira's powered form.\nThe group had soon went after Daigo in the mountain area near Justice High and that they were led there by Yurika herself, who had a change of heart and wanted to help Akira and the others out, causing Kurow to brand his older sister as a traitor to their mission. Kurow plans to brainwash Yurika as punishment, only to be repelled by Zaki who uses her chains to get his flute. Akira states that she can not forgive Kurow for ruining his family relationship with his older sister and faces the brainwashed Daigo one final time while also vowing to stop Kurow from carrying out his evil plan. After both Kurow and the brainwashed Daigo was defeated, Akira tries to wake Daigo up from his unconscious state, but is unable to do so as Yurika tells Akira that Daigo needs to rest for a while so that he can fully recover from his brainwashing. Edge gives Akira her black biker helmet and attire as a part of their school's behalf while Gan also helps out in carrying the unconscious Daigo to safety as well.\n\nAfter the incident, Yurika had left Seijyun High out of personal guilt for having to take part in Kurow's evil plan, but she decides to return to the school a while later, where she is warmly welcomed back by both Akira and Zaki, with Akira herself happily reuniting with her. At some point after this, Daigo, who recovers from his brainwashing and realizes that he needs to improve himself both physically and mentally in order to make sure and see to it that something like this doesn't happen again in the future, leaves Edge and Gan in charge of watching over Gedo High until he returns while also giving his school jacket to Akira, saying his good-byes to them as he leaves to train once more from within another personal training journey.\n\nStreet Fighter V: Champion Edition\nIn August 2020, Akira was announced as becoming the first Rival Schools character to be playable in the Street Fighter series, appearing in the fifth season of DLC fighters in Street Fighter V with a prospective Summer 2021 release date.[3] According to the director of Street Fighter V, Takayuki Nakayama, Akira is acquainted with Sakura Kasugano (who appeared as a guest fighter in the original Rival Schools game), similar to how Sakura herself is acquainted with Hinata and Natsu.\n\nPrologue: Girl Power!\n\nAct 1: Vs Ibuki\nStreetFighterV 8 16 2021 12 31 09 AM\nIbuki meeting Akira.\n\nAkira visits the Kanzuki Zaibatsu with her motorbike and was encountered by Ibuki who mistook her as a boy and a stranger. Normally this wouldn't be an issue but as the estate was going to be invited girls only for a tea party which included Ibuki herself (and Akira without her knowing) this lead to Ibuki battling Akira thinking Akira was trying to get in without permission, though neither side showed hostility above the fight towards each other even when meeting.\n\nAct 2: Vs Sakura\nStreetFighterV 8 16 2021 12 34 11 AM\nAkira after unmasking with Sakura and Ibuki.\n\nAkira defeats Ibuki in a fight and Sakura arrives to clear up their misunderstanding. Sakura removes Akira's biker helmet to show it to Ibuki while she introduces her and both of them apologizes for the confusion. Ibuki finally introduced herself to Akira and asking Sakura in how she and Akira met each other. Akira explains to her in how she and Sakura have met. It is revealed during the time of both Rival Schools series and the Street Fighter Alpha series that Akira had encountered Sakura during her mission to find her older brother Daigo while she sided with Edge and Gan and because Sakura is a powerful street fighter, Akira wanted to test her strength and abilities to her. After explaining, Sakura wanted to fight Akira in a sparring match and it is revealed that they are invited in Karin's tea party at her Zaibatsu so that she will reunite with Akira because of the passage of time.\n\nAct 3: Vs Karin\nStreetFighterV 8 16 2021 12 39 09 AM\nAll the girls arrive to Karin's beach.\n\nKarin arrives and she recognizes Akira being the sister of Daigo Kazama, the legendary gang leader and allowing them to enter the Zaibatsu for the tea party. The girls enjoy eating desserts while Akira displays her liking of confectionary. Karin decided to challenge Akira into a match which she respectfully accepts as the condition where they are invited to join the beach party at the Kanzuki private beach. After Akira defeats Karin, the girls finally enjoys themselves at the private beach during the beach party that Karin had made. Sakura also noticed that Akira had overcame her aquaphobia which Akira reveals that someone had taught her how to swim properly as Ibuki mistook her being her boyfriend who taught her. Sakura finally asking her what she can do next which Karin had decided to challenge Akira again into a match which Akira reluctantly accepts due to the moral support of both Sakura and Ibuki.\n\nGameplay\nFighting style\nAkira fights using Bajiquan, known as Hakkyokuken in Japanese, a Chinese martial art style identifiable by its trademark elbow attacks, palm rushes and shoulder smashes."

            "Tekken Rules"
          ],
          "content": "The world of Tekken operates under a unique set of narrative rules and tropes that blend hyper-serious martial arts melodrama with moments of complete absurdity. While the core story focuses on a dark, generational conflict, these exaggerated elements, rooted in fighting game conventions, define its unique charm and storytelling style. Key rules and tropes include:\n\n1. The Universal Translator Effect:\n\n    There is no language barrier in the King of Iron Fist Tournament. A character like Leo from Germany can speak German, and Hwoarang from Korea can reply in Korean, and both will understand each other perfectly without any need for translation. This allows for a diverse international cast to interact seamlessly, preserving their cultural identity without logistical complications.\n\n2. Physics-Defying Combat and Juggling:\n\n    The laws of physics are treated as mere suggestions. A powerful uppercut can launch an opponent dozens of feet into the air, where they can be suspended by a rapid-fire sequence of punches and kicks (a \"juggle combo\").\n\n    Characters can \"wall splat\" an opponent against a solid wall, causing them to stick momentarily for a follow-up attack, or break them through concrete and steel floors to continue the fight on a lower level, all without causing fatal injury.\n\n3. Extreme Physical Durability and Instant Recovery:\n\n    Characters endure punishment that would be cataclysmic in reality. They are thrown off cliffs (Heihachi, Kazuya), dropped into active volcanoes (Kazuya, Jinpachi), and struck by demonic energy beams, yet they almost always return in the next tournament with little more than a new scar and a thirst for revenge.\n\n    Between rounds of a fight, a character who has just been brutally beaten is back on their feet in seconds, fully recovered and ready for the next battle.\n\n4. The Martial Arts Tournament as Global Solution:\n\n    Nearly every major global conflict, corporate takeover, or personal vendetta can be, and often is, settled through the King of Iron Fist Tournament. The winner can gain control of the Mishima Zaibatsu, a multinational conglomerate with a private army that influences the world economy and global politics. Military might and political strategy often take a backseat to one-on-one combat.\n\n5. Dramatically Shouted Attack Names and Battle Cries:\n\n    Combat is punctuated by characters shouting the names of their signature moves or letting out iconic kiai. From the Mishima family's guttural \"DORYA!\" to Paul Phoenix's \"UURRAH!\" or Bryan Fury's maniacal laughter, these vocalizations serve to emphasize the power and personality behind the attacks.\n\n6. The Persistence of Personal Rivalries:\n\n    While the Mishima feud is the main event, the Tekken world is built on a foundation of smaller, intensely personal, and often decades-long rivalries. These grudges (Nina vs. Anna Williams, Paul Phoenix vs. Kuma, Marshall Law vs. Baek Doo San) are the primary motivation for many characters to enter the tournament, ensuring that the roster is filled with compelling subplots that rarely get resolved.\n\n7. Iconic and Impractical Fighting Attire:\n\n    A character's visual design is paramount, often prioritizing iconic style over practicality. Fighters will enter combat in everything from flowing evening gowns (Lili) and tailored business suits (Kazuya) to full suits of armor (Armor King) and complex cybernetics. Hairstyles defy gravity, like Paul Phoenix’s signature flattop, and are as much a part of their identity as their fighting style.\n\n8. Rage-Fueled Comebacks:\n\n    The concept of a desperate, last-ditch comeback is a tangible force. When on the verge of defeat, characters can tap into their inner \"Rage,\" manifesting as a glowing red aura. This allows them to absorb a blow and unleash a single, cinematic, and devastatingly powerful \"Rage Art.\" This trope visually and mechanically represents a fighter's willpower to turn the tide of battle when all hope seems lost.\n\n9. Supernatural Power-Ups and Ancient Curses:\n\n    The central conflict is fueled by the Devil Gene, a supernatural genetic anomaly that grants members of the Mishima bloodline immense demonic power, including flight, laser beams, and transformation.\n\n    The tournaments frequently attract or awaken ancient, supernatural beings (like Ogre or Azazel) that serve as a \"final boss\" and threaten the entire world, forcing heroes and villains into temporary, uneasy alliances.\n\n10. Sudden Tonal Shifts and Pervasive Comedy:\n\n    Despite the grim backdrop of world war and demonic family feuds, the story is filled with moments of slapstick and absurdity. A life-or-death struggle can be immediately followed by a cutscene of a bear trying to win the affection of a panda, or a legendary martial artist (Paul Phoenix) mistaking an ancient Aztec fighting god for a visiting alien. This comedic relief is a staple of the series.\n\n11. Normalizing the Absurd:\n\n    The world of Tekken treats completely bizarre circumstances as normal. No one questions why a grizzly bear (Kuma), a panda (Panda), a kangaroo (Roger Jr.), or a sentient wooden training dummy (Mokujin) are allowed to enter a prestigious international fighting tournament. They are accepted as legitimate combatants. Similarly, cyborgs, androids, and genetically engineered creatures fight alongside regular humans without anyone batting an eye.\n\n12. Conveniently Advanced and Bizarre Science:\n\n    Technology in the Tekken universe is leagues ahead of our own, but only when it serves to create a new fighter. Dr. Bosconovitch and Dr. Abel are archetypal mad scientists who can create perfect combat androids (Alisa), cryogenic sleep technology (Nina & Anna), and perpetual energy engines (Jack series), yet the rest of the world remains relatively contemporary. This science exists almost exclusively for the tournament.\n\n13. Flexible and Self-Serving Morality:\n\n    There are very few purely \"good\" or \"evil\" characters. \"Heroes\" like Paul Phoenix and Marshall Law are often motivated by prize money and fame. \"Villains\" like Heihachi Mishima have, on occasion, been instrumental in stopping a greater world-ending threat. A character's alignment is secondary to their personal goals, leading to a world of anti-heroes and pragmatic antagonists.\n\n14. The Never-Ending, Hyper-Violent Family Feud:\n\n    The central rule of the universe is that the Mishima family (Heihachi, Kazuya, Jin) will always be trying to kill each other in increasingly spectacular ways. This generational cycle of patricide, attempted deicide, and all-around betrayal is the engine that drives the entire plot forward, no matter how many times they appear to have been permanently defeated."

            "Street Fighter Rules"
          ],
          "content": "The world of Street Fighter operates under a distinct set of exaggerated rules and conventions borrowed from classic martial arts films, anime, and arcade game logic. These tropes define everything from the physics of combat to the way characters interact on a global stage. Key rules and tropes include:\n\n    Vocalized Special Moves:\n\n        Nearly every signature technique is announced by name as it is performed. Characters shout \"Hadoken!\", \"Sonic Boom!\", or \"Shoryuken!\" with unwavering consistency.\n\n        This serves as both a narrative flourish and a fundamental rule of combat; the name and the move are inseparable, signifying the fighter's complete mastery and intent.\n\n    The World Warrior's Universal Translator:\n\n        Fighters from different nations almost always understand each other perfectly, despite often speaking in their native languages. A character from Japan (like Ryu) can have a full, meaningful conversation with a U.S. Air Force pilot (Guile) mid-battle without a translator.\n\n        This trope allows for the game's international flavor to shine, emphasizing cultural identity through language and accents while ignoring any practical communication barriers for the sake of drama and rivalry.\n\n    Extreme Physical Durability and Stylized Recovery:\n\n        Characters can endure being set on fire, electrocuted, or hit with energy blasts that can level a small vehicle, yet they will typically only suffer minor scrapes and bruises.\n\n        Being \"Knocked Out\" is a temporary state. After a round ends, a fighter who was just incapacitated is back on their feet and ready for another full-power confrontation, with no lasting physical impairment. Serious injuries (like Sagat's chest scar) are rare and serve as major narrative turning points.\n\n    Inner Power Made Manifest (Ki / Hado):\n\n        The core of a fighter's strength comes from their ability to manifest their internal spiritual energy, or Ki, as a physical force. This explains projectiles like the Hadoken (a manifestation of spiritual energy) and Psycho Power (a manifestation of negative psychic energy).\n\n        Emotional state directly correlates to power. Intense rage, focus, or a loss of control can unlock hidden potential, like the Satsui no Hado (\"Surge of Murderous Intent\"), which transforms a fighter into a being of immense, destructive power.\n\n    Theatrical Super Arts and Cinematics:\n\n        When a fighter unleashes their ultimate attack (a Super Art or Critical Art), the normal laws of physics and time are suspended. The background may disappear, the camera will dramatically zoom in, and a multi-hit cinematic sequence will play out, showcasing the attack from impossible angles.\n\n        These sequences are the ultimate expression of a character's fighting style and personality, designed for maximum spectacle over realistic combat.\n\n    A Justifiable Reason for Every Fight:\n\n        The world is structured around a constant series of tournaments or global threats that give everyone—from a Spanish ninja to a Turkish oil wrestler—a valid reason to be fighting each other.\n\n        Character motivations range from noble (seeking self-improvement, saving the world), to vengeful (avenging a loved one), to mundane or bizarre (finding a good recipe, promoting a family restaurant). This ensures a perpetual state of conflict is always the norm.\n\n    Comedic Timing and Exaggerated States:\n\n        Even in life-or-death struggles, comedy is prevalent. A character hit repeatedly may enter a \"dizzy\" state, where cartoonish stars or birds circle their head, rendering them comically helpless.\n\n        Win quotes are often filled with boastful taunts, terrible puns, or nonsensical advice. Characters like Dan Hibiki exist almost entirely as comic relief, parodying other fighters with their over-the-top, ineffective style.\n\n    Physics of a 2D Plane:\n\n        Despite fighting in 3D-rendered environments, characters are bound by the logic of a 2D fighting game. They cannot sidestep an attack and must move only forward, backward, or jump.\n\n        Jumping is often a slow, floaty arc, allowing opponents ample time to prepare a perfectly timed anti-air attack. This creates a specific combat rhythm that is foundational to the series' gameplay and visual language.\n\nIconic and Impractical Attire:\n\n    A fighter's chosen outfit is their unwavering uniform, worn regardless of climate or context. Ryu will fight in his karate gi in a frozen Russian wasteland, just as Zangief will wear his wrestling briefs in a bustling metropolis.\n\n    This visual consistency is paramount, establishing a character's identity and brand above all practical considerations. Their look is a direct extension of their fighting spirit.\n\nThe Archetype of the Wanderer and the Rival:\n\n    Many core relationships are built on the dynamic between a stoic, wandering warrior seeking enlightenment (the \"Ryu\" archetype) and a passionate, often flashier rival who seeks to prove their strength against them (the \"Ken\" or \"Sagat\" archetype).\n\n    This central relationship provides the series with its emotional and philosophical backbone, exploring themes of discipline vs. passion, and self-improvement vs. the pursuit of victory.\n\nShadowy Global Conspiracies:\n\n    The world is not merely a collection of individual combatants but is constantly under threat from powerful, clandestine organizations with world-ending ambitions (e.g., Shadaloo, the Illuminati, S.I.N.).\n\n    These organizations provide a clear \"final boss\" structure and a common enemy that often forces disparate heroes to unite. They are typically led by a megalomaniac with godlike power, serving as the ultimate test for the world's warriors.\n\nThe Corrupted Alter-Ego:\n\n    A fighter's greatest enemy is often themselves. The most powerful warriors frequently struggle with a darker, more powerful version of their own soul (e.g., Evil Ryu, Violent Ken, Oni).\n\n    This internal corruption manifests as a literal, physical transformation, granting immense power at the cost of one's humanity. It serves as a visual metaphor for the struggle between control and chaos, a central theme of mastering one's Ki.\n\nMandatory Victory Poses and Taunts:\n\n    A fight is not officially over until the winner strikes their signature victory pose. This is a non-negotiable ritual of combat, whether it's a simple arm-fold or an elaborate acrobatic flip.\n\n    Furthermore, fighters can perform taunts mid-match. These actions serve no practical combat purpose but are a crucial expression of a character's personality—be it arrogance, playfulness, or intimidation.\n\nLiving Arenas and Environmental Hazards:\n\n    Fighting locations are not always static backgrounds. They are often populated with cheering crowds, reactive animals, or even hazards that can be incorporated into the fight.\n\n    A character can be knocked into a market stall in China, sending fruit flying, or slammed against a bus in Metro City. This rule treats the environment as an active participant, adding a layer of dynamic, unscripted spectacle to each confrontation.\n\nThe Reclusive and All-Powerful Master:\n\n    Many of the world's strongest fighters were trained by legendary masters who possess an even greater, almost mythical level of power (e.g., Gouken, Gen, Oro).\n\n    These masters rarely intervene in global affairs directly, preferring a life of seclusion. They exist as narrative benchmarks for what is possible, serving as sources of ancient wisdom, secret techniques, or as a final, ultimate challenge for their pupils."

            "Tekken TIMELINE"
          ],
          "content": "Tekken\n\nA worldwide martial arts tournament is nearing its finale, with a large purse of prize money to the fighter who can defeat Heihachi Mishima in the final round of the competition. The contest is sponsored by the giant financial group, the Mishima Zaibatsu. There are eight fighters that remain after winning matches all over the world. The winner of the tournament will receive The King of the Iron Fist title. Only one will have a chance at defeating Heihachi and taking home the prize money and fame.\n\nKazuya Mishima is the main character. Heihachi's biological son, he was thrown into a ravine by his tyrannical father when he was five years old. Heihachi, believing his son was too weak to ever inherit his conglomerate, decided that if he were truly strong enough, he would be able to survive the fall and climb back up. Kazuya barely survived a fall that left him with the scar prominently visible on his chest. Fueled by hatred for his father, he enters the tournament to exact his revenge.\nTekken 2\n\nMany battles were fought in the first King of Iron Fist Tournament. But only one lone warrior emerged with the right to challenge Heihachi Mishima for the of \"King of Iron Fist\" title. This warrior was Kazuya Mishima, Heihachi's cold-blooded son. Bearing the scar given to him by Heihachi, he enters into vicious combat with his father on the same field where Heihachi last struck down his own son and dropped him into a trench at age five.\n\nAfter a grueling battle which raged on for hours, Kazuya emerged victorious by utilizing the power granted to him by the supernatural entity known as Devil. As Heihachi's broken body lay on the ground, Kazuya dropped to his knee and lifted his father into his arms. Kazuya walked slowly to the edge of the same cliff from where his father had thrown him as a child. He stared out over the landscape, and let go of his father's body. As Heihachi's body plummeted, Kazuya's smile gleamed in the sunlight.\n\nTwo years have passed. The Mishima Zaibatsu under Kazuya's leadership has become even more powerful with its tendrils reaching to all corners of the world. Soon after his father's apparent death, Kazuya disappears into the shadows. However, rumors of his immense power, and a dark side, slowly begin to spread throughout the world. Sometime later, a message is relayed from the Mishima Zaibatsu fortress to news agencies all over the world announcing the second tournament with a prize a thousand times that of the first.\n\nLike his son before him, Heihachi survived his fall into the ravine thanks to his tenacious endurance. He retreated to the hills to meditate and train in order to rekindle and enhance his fighting ability. He enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 to reclaim his conglomerate and dispose of Kazuya once and for all.\nTekken 3\n\nThe King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 draws to a close. Jun Kazama comes to the stunning realization that Kazuya Mishima's supernatural strength stems from Devil. But she cannot help being drawn to him. Several days later, the final challenger arrives to face Kazuya, the organizer of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2. In a reprise of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 1, father and son clash in a cursed blood battle. Eventually, Heihachi Mishima emerges, scarred, but victorious, to regain control of the immense Mishima Zaibatsu. Unaware of Devil's presence, Heihachi casts the lifeless Kazuya into a volcano.\n\nAs Kazuya's body burns, the Devil appears before the pregnant Jun Kazama in a bid to enter the soul of the new life beating within her. But, in a desperate struggle for the future of her child, Jun defeats Devil and retires to solitary Yakushima so as to raise her and Kazuya's son, Jin Kazama, alone.\n\nHaving regained control of the Mishima Zaibatsu, Heihachi sets about to further increase his power. He embarks on a crusade to control the political landscape by earning the trust of world leaders by putting wars and conflicts to rest. Using his immeasurable wealth, he forms Tekken Force, a private corporate army employed to quell conflicts efficiently. He also uses Tekken Force to aid developing nations by helping them build agricultural systems that will sustain them.\n\nAround fifteen years have passed, and Jin Kazama is now 15 years old.\n\nUnder Heihachi's orders, the Tekken Force is excavating a Central American archaeological site when they discover a mysterious life form. Heihachi orders the creature's capture, but loses contact with the Tekkenshu after a garbled radio message, \"... they are all dead... Ogre (Fighting God)?!...\" Upon arriving at the dig, Heihachi finds a field of corpses. Heihachi realizes that the power of the mysterious life form could be the key to his dream of world domination. To obtain this mysterious power of Ogre, and the world, Heihachi tempts the fates once again.\n\nWithin weeks, strange disappearances occur throughout the world. Persons of a strong soul, masters of martial arts, are reported missing with no knowledge of their whereabouts. Jun Kazama instinctively picks up on the dark power encroaching on her life. She has no understanding of what it is but senses that she has become a target. Accepting her destiny, she tells Jin everything that she knows of their haunted past to prepare him for the fateful day that she now feels is imminent. She tells Jin to go to his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima, if anything should befall her. Her intuition proves right. Ogre comes to the mountains, bringing a chilling, swirling wind. Jun instructs Jin to run away. But against his mother's pleas, Jin opts to face Ogre and is knocked unconscious.\n\nWhen Jin awakens, the house and everything around it is burned to the ground. Jin searches frantically for his mother, but she is nowhere to be found. Honoring her instructions, Jin goes to Heihachi and begs to be trained in order to exact revenge. Heihachi, hearing Jin's tale, is convinced that Ogre is after the souls of powerful fighters. To attract Ogre, Heihachi decides to train Jin as bait, and to eventually lure Ogre to a third King of Iron Fist Tournament.\n\nFour years later, on Jin Kazama's 19th birthday, the curtains rise for The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3.\nTekken 4\n\nTwo years ago, Jin Kazama defeated Ogre. Convinced that Jin must harbor the same evil power as Kazuya, Heihachi shot Jin in the head after his victory. The fatal wound awakened Jin's latent Devil Gene, and caused him to transform. He flew off into the night, and has not been witnessed since. Heihachi, meanwhile, ordered his researchers to collect blood samples, skin tissue, and hoof fragments left behind by Ogre in order to conduct genetic experiments. Heihachi’s goal was to grant himself eternal life and ultimate power by splicing Ogre’s genome with his own. However, the research was unsuccessful.\n\nAfter extensive experimentation, Heihachi’s bioengineers came to the conclusion that an additional gene - the \"Devil Gene\" - was necessary in order to successfully splice Ogre’s genetic code into another living organism. Heihachi learned that his own genome lacked the Devil Gene, but he knew someone who had it... Jin Kazama.\n\nHeihachi searched for Jin to no avail. However, Heihachi discovered a photograph during his investigation that stirred his curiosity. The 20-year-old photograph was an image of a burnt corpse covered with laceration wounds. Heihachi paid particular attention to the corpse’s back, which had what looked like deformed, protruding wing-like limbs.\n\nConvinced that the picture was of Kazuya, his own son whom he threw into a volcano 20 years ago, Heihachi diverted all his resources into a search for the body. This search eventually led Heihachi to G Corporation, a cutting-edge biotech firm making unprecedented advances in the field of biogenetics research. Heihachi discovered that G Corporation had found the corpse and extracted and analyzed its genetic data. In fact, Heihachi learned that the company was in the midst of creating a new life form by using the data. Heihachi also determined that Kazuya’s remains and research data were secured at G Corporation’s Nebraska and Nepal research laboratories, respectively.\n\nFriday, 25 December. The Tekken Force raided G Corporation’s maximum security research laboratory in Nepal. The bottom floors of the building were obliterated, and the remaining data storage facility containing file servers was airlifted by a group of heavy-duty helicopters. At the same time, a separate unit overseen by Heihachi infiltrated the underground research facility in Nebraska, where Kazuya’s remains were supposedly preserved. As Heihachi observed from his helicopter, he soon realized that, unlike the Nepal facility, the operation in Nebraska was not going according to plan.\n\nA silhouette of a figure slowly emerged on Heihachi's screen... When Heihachi could see clearly enough, he instantly recognized the figure as Kazuya. Kazuya had been resurrected in G Corporation’s research facility. After his resurrection, Kazuya had offered his body as research material to determine the true nature of the Devil that resided within him. Kazuya’s goal was to unify his two selves into one. Kazuya theorized that if he unified his body with the Devil, he would be able to truly harness its powers. He could then finally take revenge against Heihachi and the Mishima Zaibatsu.\n\nEnraged that Heihachi thwarted his plans, Kazuya obliterated the heavily armed Tekken Force and vanished into the flames of the lab’s wreckage. Heihachi determined that if he could capture either Kazuya or Jin, he would be able to gain the data on the Devil Gene he needed. In order to lure Kazuya and Jin to him, Heihachi announced the King of Iron Fist Tournament four, and placed the massive financial empire as the top prize. The champion who manages to defeat Heihachi at the end of the Tournament would inherit the Mishima Zaibatsu.\n\nWell aware that the tournament is just a trap designed to lure them out, Kazuya nevertheless entered, as did Jin, who had been hiding and training in Brisbane, Australia. Both intended to put a stop to Heihachi once and for all.\nTekken 5\n\nDuring the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, Heihachi had his Tekken Force kidnap Jin. His match scheduled to be against Kazuya was ruled automatically in Kazuya's favor, and Kazuya went on to fight Heihachi in the finals. Kazuya demanded to know Jin's whereabouts, and Heihachi informed him he would take him to Jin after they fought. Kazuya defeated Heihachi, and Heihachi led him to the Mishima family temple, Hon-Maru. Here, he had imprisoned Jin, and tied him up with chains that subdued the Devil Gene. Initially shocked, Kazuya's Devil then possessed him and spoke through him, belittling Heihachi's attempts to comprehend Devils with science. Devil knocked Heihachi unconscious, and attempted to reabsorb the part of itself from Jin it had lost twenty-one years ago. Unsuccessful, Devil theorized that Jin's Kazama blood must be protecting him. While Devil was distracted, Kazuya was able to take back control of his body, fighting down Devil and then merging their power. Kazuya then called for Jin to awaken. Jin broke free of his chains and defeated Kazuya. Heihachi then awoke, and Jin defeated him too. Standing over his grandfather, Jin's Devil began to manifest. As he drew back his fist to kill him however, he witnessed a vision of his mother, and decided to let him live. He then flew off into the night.\n\nShortly after, Kazuya and Heihachi, still in Hon-Maru, found themselves under attack from a battalion of 'JACK' robots. Initially, Kazuya and Heihachi fought side-by-side, before Kazuya threw Heihachi into the robots as a distraction, and then flew off, leaving Heihachi to his fate. The robots have set to self-destruct, and they blow up Hon-Maru, with Heihachi still inside. Raven, watching from afar, spoke into a headset, and reported, \"Heihachi Mishima...is dead.\"\n\nThe explosion however had broken the chains of a being imprisoned under Hon-Maru forty-four years ago. When Heihachi had launched a coup to first seize the Mishima Zaibatsu from his father, Jinpachi Mishima, he had imprisoned him under the family temple. Jinpachi slowly starved to death, and his body became animated by a hungry demon. Now free, Jinpachi, with his last remnants of human consciousness, called a fifth Iron First Tournament in order to find someone with the strength to defeat him and put him to rest.\nTekken 6\n\nJin Kazama defeated his great-grandfather in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5, and ascended as the head of the Mishima Zaibatsu. Unbeknown to others, Jin had begun hearing the voice of an ancient demon, Azazel, in his head. The demon called upon Jin as its servant, and told him to release it by waging war and chaos on the world. Jin believed this demon to be the origin of his Devil Gene, and that if he released the creature, he would be able not only to destroy it and its potential future threat, but also rid the world of the power of the Devil Gene. Believing the world to be full of corruption and cruel powers, Jin sought to destabilize the world and wreak the carnage needed to awaken Azazel. He declared the Mishima Zaibatsu an independent nation, and used Tekken Force to wage war on the world. that if he did so, he would be able to confront the demon for unknown reasons has begun using the Mishima Zaibatsu for world conquest, declaring war on several nations and even space colonies until the entire world is at war.\n\nUnable to stomach Jin's violence, one of his top captains, Lars Alexandersson, led half of Tekken Force in a coup, and seceded from Jin's army. He began fighting a rebellion against Jin. Lars in fact was an illegitimate son of Heihachi Mishima, a fact that he eventually revealed to Heihachi, who had survived the Hon-Maru explosion, in the course of his hunt to stop Jin.\n\nMeanwhile, Kazuya Mishima had determined that the JACK attack in Hon-Maru had been carried out by G-Corporation executives in an effort to assassinate him. He hunted down those responsible, killed them, and then took over as CEO of G-Corporation. Seeing Jin's warmongering as an opportunity to raise his own status, he rapidly militarized G-Corp, and painted himself as a hero by stepping up to fight against the tyrannical Jin Kazama. Kazuya put a bounty on Jin's head, and, in order to lure his assassins to one place, Jin called the sixth King of Iron Fist Tournament.\nTekken 7\n\nThe sixth tournament was cancelled when Jin, the tournament host, disappeared. Jin had gone out to the Middle East, having finally awoken Azazel, and defeated the demon. His unconscious body was recovered by Raven and his United Nations operatives. As the helicopter containing Jin departed, Jin awoke, transformed into his Devil, and escaped, blowing up the helicopter as he did. Stumbling through a desert town, Jin was tracked down by UN peacekeepers, but rescued by his uncle and former captain and adversary, Lars Alexandersson. Lars, who had joined forces with Heihachi's adopted son, Lee Chaolan, took Jin back to one of Lee's safe havens to recover. Intending to use Jin as a weapon, Lars and Lee oversaw Jin's protection from those who wished to assassinate him or hold him accountable for his actions.\n\nSeeing an opportunity to seize control of his corporation, Heihachi returned to the Mishima Zaibatsu, and dispatched any opposition by force. He perpetuated the fight against Kazuya's G Corporation, but sought to raise the social profile of the Zaibatsu from the depths Jin had dragged it to. Heihachi called the seventh King of Iron Fist Tournament in order to attempt to kill Kazuya. His plans changed however, when a mysterious individual, claiming to be acting on behalf of Heihachi's late wife, attempted to murder him. Heihachi was defeated in the attack, and decided to publicize his own death, and call off the tournament at the same time. The assassin then moved on to target Kazuya. Heihachi watched the fight, broadcasting Kazuya's devil form to the world, and then targeted Akuma and Kazuya with an orbital laser destroying the G-Corporation's Millennium Tower in the process.\n\nKazuya having survived the attack, Heihachi summoned Kazuya to a one-on-one fight. Before he attended, Heihachi related his past to a journalist, painting a favorable legacy for himself as a defender of humanity against the Devil Gene of his wife and son, the former of whom he had killed. Kazuya and Heihachi clashed at the mouth of a volcano, with Kazuya emerging victorious. He then threw his father's body into the volcano.\nTekken 8\n\nSix months later, a now unopposed Kazuya Mishima continued to wage war against all nations, with world domination as his goal. Jin Kazama, having awoken from a coma, had joined forces with his uncles, Lee and Lars, in order to oppose Kazuya. Jin targeted a helicopter carrying Kazuya, but his devil form was overwhelmed by Kazuya's. Kazuya announced an eighth Iron Fist Tournament, calling upon fighters to represent their country and determine which countries deserved a place in his new world on the basis of their strength. Anyone who lost in the tournament would perish along with the country they represented. Having discovered that he could no longer call upon his devil form, Jin entered the tournament to try and reawaken it. After a spirited fight with his rival, Hwoarang, Jin regained access to his Devil. During the tournament preliminaries, Jin met a new fighter, Reina, who had somehow learned the Mishima Style Fighting Karate.\n\nAfter qualifying for the tournament, Jin went to a coliseum in Italy to participate in the first round. The tournament was interrupted by Yggdrasil and the United Nations, who had been warned that something ill would occur at the tournament. As they sought to evacuate the coliseum, Kazuya arrived on the scene. Azazel, who had been imprisoned in Zafina's arm, was released by Kazuya and absorbed, allowing him to gain even further power. Jin escaped and was escorted to Yakushima, while Lars and the rest of the fighters held Kazuya off. After arriving at Yakushima, Jin passed out in front of a shrine. Kazuya, wounded from the previous battle, sent his troops ahead of him. Yggdrasil fought G Corporation on Yakushima, as time was bought for Jin to confront his personal demons and seek a power to counter Kazuya's. Kazuya arrived and began obliterating the battlefield. In amidst this, a young Reina, who had tagged along, deliberately sought to place herself in mortal danger, having been studying Jin throughout this time.\n\nWhile in his own subconscious, Jin encountered his Devil counterpart, and came to a peaceful alliance with it. Jin then regained consciousness and fought Kazuya once more. Kazuya launched a devastating attack that threatened all of Yakushima, and Jin, strengthened by the spirit of his mother, transformed into an angelic being. In this form, he prevented the attack, though the impact caused him and Kazuya to be launched into space.\n\nJin and Kazuya continued their fight in space, and were evenly matched. A collision between them however, caused the purification of both their devil powers. The two fell back to earth, now only human. Unphased, they continued their fight. After an intense battle, Jin emerged victorious, leaving Kazuya's unconscious body behind. Soon after, Jin reunited with his friend, Ling Xiaoyu, while an unconscious Kazuya was approached by what seemed to be Jun Kazama. Elsewhere, Reina recovered from her fatal injury and vowed to avenge her father, revealed to be Heihachi Mishima, as she unleashed her own Devil form."

          ],
          "content": "Street Fighter: The First World Warrior\n\nThe story begins with the first-ever World Warrior tournament, a global competition to determine the strongest fighter in the world. A young, wandering martial artist named Ryu enters to test and prove his strength. Throughout the tournament, he faces a diverse cast of fighters from around the globe, including the ninja Geki, the American martial artist Joe, the Chinese assassin Gen, and the English bouncer Birdie.\n\nThe final opponent is the towering Muay Thai champion, Sagat, the \"Emperor of Muay Thai.\" In a grueling battle, Ryu is nearly defeated. However, in a moment of desperation, he taps into a dark power within him known as the Satsui no Hado (the \"Surge of Murderous Intent\") and unleashes a devastating Metsu Shoryuken that not only defeats Sagat but also leaves a massive scar across his chest. This victory marks Ryu as the first World Warrior champion, but it also ignites a lifelong rivalry with Sagat and sets Ryu on a path to understand and control the darkness within him.\n\nThe Street Fighter Alpha Series: The Rise of Shadaloo\n\nTaking place between Street Fighter and Street Fighter II, the Alpha series delves deeper into the lore and introduces many of the franchise's most iconic characters and plotlines.\n\nThe primary antagonist, M. Bison, leader of the criminal organization Shadaloo, emerges from the shadows. A powerful dictator wielding a mysterious energy called \"Psycho Power,\" Bison seeks world domination. His actions draw the attention of several individuals who would become his greatest adversaries.\n\nChun-Li, an Interpol officer, investigates Shadaloo, seeking to avenge the death of her father at Bison's hands. Guile, a Major in the United States Air Force, hunts for his best friend and superior officer, Charlie Nash, who has been sent to investigate and stop Bison's operations. Rose, a mysterious fortune teller from Genoa, Italy, possesses a spiritual power known as \"Soul Power\" and has a deep connection to Bison, as she represents the good half of his soul that he expelled to fully embrace Psycho Power.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryu is haunted by his victory over Sagat and the Satsui no Hado. He is confronted by Akuma, the brother of his master, Gouken. Akuma has fully embraced the Satsui no Hado, becoming a demon-like figure of immense power. Akuma reveals that he killed Gouken (a fact that is later retconned) and urges Ryu to embrace the darkness to unlock his true potential.\n\nThe Alpha series culminates in a multi-pronged assault on Shadaloo's base. Charlie Nash confronts Bison and sacrifices himself to destroy the Psycho Drive, a machine that amplifies Bison's power. Chun-Li gathers enough evidence to cripple Shadaloo's operations and confronts Bison, though she is unable to defeat him. Ryu confronts Bison and, with the help of his friends Ken Masters and Sakura Kasugano, resists Bison's attempts to corrupt him and use him as a new host body. Though Bison is defeated, his soul survives, and he begins the process of creating a new body.\n\nStreet Fighter II: The World Warrior Tournament Returns\n\nYears after the events of the Alpha series, M. Bison, now in a new, more powerful body, hosts the second World Warrior tournament. His true goal is to lure out his enemies and the world's greatest fighters to brainwash them and add them to his elite guard, the \"Four Heavenly Kings of Shadaloo,\" which includes the Spanish cage-fighting ninja, Vega; the brutish boxer, Balrog; and his right-hand man, the vengeful Sagat.\n\nThe tournament attracts a new generation of fighters alongside the veterans. Chun-Li, still seeking justice for her father, enters the tournament. Guile, believing Charlie to be dead, also enters to finally bring Bison to justice. The original world warriors, Ryu and Ken, also participate.\n\nIn the end, it is Akuma who once again intervenes. Seeing Bison as a worthy challenger, Akuma confronts and kills him with his ultimate technique, the Shun Goku Satsu (\"Raging Demon\"). With Bison's death, the tournament comes to an abrupt end, and the fighters go their separate ways.\n\nStreet Fighter IV: The S.I.N.ister Conspiracy\n\nThough M. Bison was killed by Akuma, his consciousness was transferred to a new clone body. While Shadaloo recovers, a new organization, S.I.N. (Shadaloo Intimidation Network), emerges from its weapons division. Led by the highly intelligent and powerful android, Seth, S.I.N. announces a new world tournament.\n\nSeth, a spare body for Bison, has achieved self-awareness and seeks to complete a project known as BLECE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Cell Explosion), which will grant him immense power. To do so, he needs to gather data from the world's strongest fighters, with a particular interest in Ryu and the Satsui no Hado.\n\nThe tournament brings back many familiar faces and introduces new ones, including the French amnesiac martial artist, Abel, who has a mysterious connection to Shadaloo; the American C.I.A. agent, Crimson Viper; the Turkish oil wrestler, Hakan; and the sadistic S.I.N. operative, Juri Han.\n\nIt is revealed that Ryu's master, Gouken, survived his battle with Akuma and has been in seclusion. He returns to confront Akuma and to help Ryu finally control the Satsui no Hado. After a fierce battle, Gouken defeats Akuma and uses a technique to seal Ryu's Satsui no Hado, saving him from its corrupting influence.\n\nIn the final confrontation, the fighters storm the S.I.N. headquarters. It is revealed that Juri has been manipulating events to bring about Bison's downfall. As the heroes fight their way through the facility, M. Bison confronts Seth and reveals that S.I.N. and the tournament were all part of his plan to find a suitable new host body. Bison defeats Seth and transfers his consciousness into a new, perfected body.\n\nStreet Fighter V: The Fall of Shadaloo\n\nNow in his most powerful form, M. Bison initiates \"Operation C.H.A.I.N.S.,\" a plan to plunge the world into darkness and fear by launching seven \"Black Moons\" into orbit. These devices will absorb the negative energy created by the ensuing chaos and channel it into Bison, making him a god.\n\nTo combat this threat, Karin Kanzuki, the head of the powerful Kanzuki Zaibatsu, forms a coalition of heroes, including the returning world warriors and new allies like the Arabian fighter Rashid and the Brazilian Matsuda Jiu-Jitsu practitioner Laura.\n\nA resurrected Charlie Nash, brought back to life by a mysterious woman named Helen (who is later revealed to be Kolin, a loyal follower of Gill and the Illuminati), also joins the fight, now possessing a strange new power. However, he is torn between his mission to destroy Bison and his loyalty to his friends.\n\nThe heroes split into teams to disarm the Black Moons. During the final assault on the Shadaloo base, Ryu, having finally achieved a state of \"nothingness\" and complete control over the Satsui no Hado, confronts M. Bison. In a cataclysmic battle, Ryu unleashes the full extent of his power and completely eradicates Bison, destroying his soul and ending his reign of terror once and for all.\n\nStreet Fighter III: A New Generation\n\nChronologically the latest in the series until the release of Street Fighter 6, Street Fighter III introduces a new generation of fighters and a new threat. In the wake of Shadaloo's collapse, a secret organization known as the Illuminati, which has manipulated world events from the shadows for centuries, steps into the light.\n\nLed by the messianic Gill, a powerful being who can control fire and ice, the Illuminati seeks to create a new utopia on Earth, even if it means destroying the current world and its inhabitants. To find those worthy of joining their new world, the Illuminati organizes the \"Third Strike\" tournament.\n\nThe story primarily follows a new protagonist, Alex, a young fighter from New York City who enters the tournament to avenge his friend, Tom, who was defeated and seriously injured by Gill. The tournament also features a new cast of characters, including the ninja Ibuki, the capoeira practitioner Elena, the stoic hermit Oro, and the British boxer Dudley.\n\nRyu and Ken also participate in the tournament, continuing their quest for self-improvement. The story of Street Fighter III is more personal and less focused on a single, world-ending threat. Instead, it explores the individual journeys of the new generation of fighters as they find their place in the world.\n\nStreet Fighter 6: The New Era\n\nSet after the events of Street Fighter III, Street Fighter 6 ushers in a new era for the franchise. In a world free from Shadaloo's tyranny, a new threat emerges. A mysterious and powerful man known as JP, a former high-ranking member of Shadaloo, now leads a terrorist organization called Amnesia.\n\nThe game's story is primarily experienced through the \"World Tour\" mode, where players create their own avatar and travel the world, learning from the legendary fighters of the Street Fighter universe. The story centers on the player's character and their rivalry with a fellow student named Bosch, who becomes entangled with Amnesia.\n\nMeanwhile, Ken Masters, once the U.S. Martial Arts Champion and a successful businessman, has been framed as a terrorist by JP and has lost everything. He is now on the run, trying to clear his name and protect his family.\n\nStreet Fighter 6 explores the legacy of the original world warriors and the rise of a new generation of fighters, including the Bushin-ryu ninja, Kimberly; the drunken-fist breakdancer, Jamie; the French judoka, Manon; and the powerful Italian pankration fighter, Marisa. The story is a more grounded and personal one, focusing on the individual struggles and triumphs of its characters in a post-Shadaloo world while also setting the stage for a new global conflict."

He has red hair with a topknot, sharp, pointed teeth, and is often bare-footed, though some games have him wearing brown sandals. Depending on the game or piece of art, he either wears a black belt at his waist or a length of rope. Over his hands, he either wears brown training gauntlets or wraps his hands with rope as well (again, depending on the source). He has tanned skin and crimson eyes, and wears his deceased master Goutetsu's prayer beads around his neck, with a visible black \"heaven\" (天, ten) kanji on the center bead in some games. In Street Fighter Alpha: Generations, he was seen having eyebrows when he was young.\n\nThis kanji is featured frequently in Akuma's appearances, most often at the end of a Shun Goku Satsu attack, where it burns itself onto the back of Akuma's gi top. It takes on a slightly different shape between the original Street Fighter IV and Super Street Fighter IV; the top stroke of the kanji is more narrow in Super Street Fighter IV than in the original, and may have taken this shape due to Akuma's second alternate costume using exactly the same new shape on the back.\n\nIn his artwork for his Street Fighter V profile, Akuma's hair is completely white, and has grown out; he wears a dark yellow loincloth with a white sash on each side, going shirtless while retaining his gray karate pants. This is designed as a contrast to his older brother Gouken's outfit.\n\nIn his full appearance in Street Fighter V, his hair has grown out considerably, resembling a lion's mane, though he retains his familiar clothing. He also has the hair on top of his head tied into a pigtail. He also wears his prayer beads like a sash. The 神人 \"shin\" kanji used by Shin Akuma in Capcom vs. SNK 2 is seen on his back when performing the Shun Goku Satsu.\n\nHis first alternate costume is similar to Ryu's alternate costume in Super Street Fighter IV; where his tattered karate gi is hanging loose on his waist and his karate pants are also in tatters. His second alternate costume is his outfit in Street Fighter V artwork and his third and last outfit is his classic appearance in the older Street Fighter games.\n\nIn the Street Fighter III series, his hair is slightly grayed, hinting that Akuma, while seemingly inhuman, still physically ages.\n\nIn Street Fighter 6, Akuma's design combines parts of his standard appearance and his Street Fighter V design. His hair retains the long lion mane look, with the topknot now moved back to its original position. His prayer beads are black like his Street Fighter V design, but return to being around his neck. His outfit bears a strong resemblance to an older Street Fighter V concept art, in which he wears a pelt as opposed to his gi top. Most notably, his hair is now entirely white to show the passage of time.[11] His karate pants seems to have some stitched patches to keep it from being tattered even more. Akuma also no longer wears sandals.\n\nHis first alternate costume is his Street Fighter III appearance, combining the brown training gauntlets with the rope belt and streaked hair. \n\nPersonality\n\nAkuma is a cold and extremely powerful warrior whose sole reason for existing is to hone his fighting skills by battling and destroying strong foes. He rarely displays any sign of emotions or humanity, aside from occasional bursts of anger, and rarely smiles. He, however, will not engage in battle towards helpless people and in some cases may even defend them, either as a righteous calling or an afterthought of conquering a major adversary. The only instance of humanity he has displayed after being drenched in the Satsui no Hado is with Kazumi Mishima, whom he respects, even in battle.\n\nAkuma lives off the land itself and rarely, if ever, interacts with society as a whole. When not doing training in his martial arts, he primarily subsists off wild animals and plants, and takes particular pride in fishing, which Akuma himself sees as a battle between life and death. In few occasions that he needs money, he sells animals and fruit. In his character story in Street Fighter 6, Akuma is shown to be a wood artisan who makes statues to honor his opponents; he is also depicted sewing his own gi in special ending artwork.\n\nHe takes his training very seriously and deals brutally with those who dare interrupt him, as seen in his Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike ending. Occasionally, he likes to test himself against worthy rivals (e.g. Gen, Oro). In later games, Akuma often refers to himself as a \"denizen of hell\" and \"evil incarnate\", and is seen as such by many. This may be a result of the Satsui no Hado (\"Surge of Murderous Intent\") taking a toll on his mind.\n\nIn line with his martial arts philosophy, Akuma also believes in a certain principle of self-worth. Specifically, Akuma despises hubris (i.e. a perceived excess of self-worth), foolish behavior, and those who rely on means other than their fists to fight or gain power (both of which would indicate a lack of the same), as his various win quotes in the Street Fighter IV games indicate. He is also somewhat nihilistic by principle, as his search for worthy opponents often includes someone who would be able to fully match and kill him (which itself is not an easy task, considering his own raw power). This is further supported by his dialogue in Street Fighter 6's World Tour mode, to which Akuma admits that he is fully aware that his path of embracing the Satsui no Hado may lead him to destruction, but he accepted it as a price to pay to become the strongest.\n\nAkuma detests his older brother Gouken for not giving into the dark side of their arts which is, according to Akuma himself, the way they were intended to be used. He also blames Gouken for sealing off the darkness within Ryu, thus preventing the young warrior from reaching his true potential. This forces Akuma to ultimately give up on his planned duel with Ryu, as he believes that only a fellow practitioner of the Satsui no Hado can one day hope to defeat him.\n\nEven as a Satsui no Hado wielder with seemingly amoral actions, Akuma upholds certain standards and outlook of how powers like the Satsui should be handled. It is for this reason he hold much disdain to sentient but soulless beings like Kage. \n\nMoral Code\nAkuma can be considered an antivillain. In spite of his cold personality, due to his relentless training in the dark arts of the Satsui no Hado, most of the time, Akuma abides by the code of the warrior, quite similar to Ryu, Ken, and indirectly, his older brother Gouken. He fights to improve his skills and defeat powerful foes - though on rare occasions, he does so to gauge the other's abilities. He also never resorts to killing defenseless or unworthy fighters in cold blood, unlike M. Bison or Evil Ryu. Although he killed his teacher and believed he did the same with Gouken, Akuma did so in combat, not actual murder, and thus can be said to have not transgressed on his principles. \n\nIn combat, Akuma, as he often fights with honor, almost never resorts to his true strength, especially if testing another fighter; he only fights warriors that he deems worthy, or the ones he believes have the potential to become such. During the events of Street Fighter Alpha 2, Akuma fought Ryu only to gain insight into his abilities, while in 3rd Strike, he faced Oro in order to test his own strength.\n\nAlthough Akuma normally prefers an even bout (as he backed out of an intense duel with Gen once he found out that the elderly assassin was fatally ill, seen in Alpha 2), it is not uncommon for him to deliver a lethal sneak attack to an unprepared opponent (as he did with M. Bison, Gill, and Adon's unnamed rival), particularly if they are less than honorable. While the evil nature of Satsui no Hado itself may have corrupted Akuma's ways, it is worth noting that he himself still upholds standards and a minimalist degree of morality and considers Bison a much more abhorrent type of evil.\n\nHis win quotes in 3rd Strike also imply Akuma has become much bloodthirstier and perhaps pays less regard to his own moral code, very much like Evil Ryu; it is possible that at this point, the Satsui no Hado's hold on Akuma has strengthened, being close to completely overtaking his mind and body, and that said win quotes reflect this state. \n\nRelationships\nDue to his single-minded quest for raw strength, he has made enemies over time, though he actively does not seek to antagonize without provocation. Surprisingly, there are a few personalities that he has a vague sense of respect for.\n\nEnemies\n\nGouken\nAkuma is Gouken's younger brother and archnemesis. Gouken greatly despises him for embracing the Satsui no Hado and killing their master, Goutetsu. Because of this, he does all he can to protect Ryu and Ken from him, to the point where he willingly fought Akuma in a battle to the death so that he won't come after his loyal students. \n\nRyu\nAkuma is one of Ryu's most hated enemies, as Akuma himself was the one who tried to kill his and Ken's master, Gouken. Akuma also attempts to lure Ryu into succumbing to the Satsui no Hado, in Street Fighter Alpha 2, as he claims the young warrior possesses the same power as Akuma does, therefore casting aside his humanity to become Evil Ryu, in hopes of finally finding a truly worthy opponent for the ultimate fight to the death that Akuma always seeks. Ryu knows this is nothing but a trap of temptation planned by the dark warrior, and he has tried his best to find a way to get rid of the Satsui no Hado entirely while refusing to succumb to that kind of power. Akuma ceases tempting him (or at the least, respects his choice) after finally conquering the dark power and mastering his own Hado energy, the Power of Nothingness, in Street Fighter V.\n\nIn the events of Street Fighter III: Ryu Final, Akuma has a considerably more respectful outlook on Ryu following his denial of the Satsui no Hado, with Ken theorizing that his embracing of its demonic power serves as a challenge for Ryu to find a strength that goes beyond the seeming inevitability of the Satsui no Hado's death and destruction. Though the two fighters still clash in a brutal conflict, Akuma honors Ryu's resolve to move directly into the Shun Goku Satsu, being pierced through his torso by Akuma's fist but granting him the opportunity to blast through Akuma's body with a point-blank Hadoken. Having seen both the strength beyond the Satsui no Hado and a true fight to the death, Akuma seemingly perishes in a burst of flame caused by the energy within him, satisfied with Ryu's answer.\n\nRyu and Akuma's relationship by the time of Street Fighter 6 bears considerable resemblance to the events of Ryu Final. With Ryu embodying a rejection of Akuma's mindset of embracing death and discarding humanity during battles. Since both Ryu and Akuma have reached the \"peak\" of the opposite end of their path, they seem to no longer hold any personal grudges against one another. Rather, both fighters are now connected by their shared desire to become the strongest. While Akuma maintained his cruel and infernal persona in front of Ryu, deep inside his heart, he seems to respect Ryu for \"smiling\" in the face of death, since he knows that Ryu always put \"every ounce of [his] being\" into every fight. As well as commitments to becoming the strongest, even though he is taking a different path from him. In fact, both Ryu and Akuma seems to have enjoyed fighting against one another to see who is the better of the two, as pointed out by Ryu during their encounter in Arcade mode.\n\nRyu's ability to laugh in the face of death leads to the player character being spared and trained by Akuma, who sees a similar mindset to Ryu within them.\nKen\n\nLike Ryu, Ken is aware of the threat Akuma poses to humanity. However, due to his pure lack of attunement to the Satsui no Hado, Akuma does not seek Ken out, unlike with Ryu.\nAdon\n\nBecause Akuma killed a Muay Thai master that Adon was supposed to fight, Adon seeks to defeat Akuma to prove himself. In Alpha 3, Adon finds Akuma and ultimately loses to him. Akuma doesn't kill him, however, due to him deeming Adon unworthy of death.\n\nGen\nGen saw Akuma as a skilled opponent who could finally kill him, a morbid desire amplified by his own terminal sickness. However, their skills often clash, giving each other challenges. Akuma was ultimately defeated by Gen, but would engage him again after seeing he can still fight. Akuma emerges victorious and is implied to have killed him for good in Street Fighter V in their last fight to the death. However, Gen survives this encounter once more.\n\nM. Bison\nAkuma, despite having no direct grudge, holds major contempt towards M. Bison, the latter being an even more abhorrent kind of evil using shortcuts to power. Because of this, Akuma has no problem killing the villain on a whim. Bison, on the other hand, wants Akuma's Satsui no Hado as a sole means to increase his own power. His disdain for Bison persists even when he becomes Oni, and perhaps is even greater.\n\nOro\nOro is among one of the only men who have legitimately matched Akuma in combat. The two have fought each other to a draw, as the fight was called off due to the two fighters sensing that if they fought each other seriously, it would result in a mutual kill. Both have earned each other's respect and contempt on a personal basis. [12]\nGill\n\nUpon hearing about his powers, Akuma desired to fight Gill. Akuma killed Gill with the Raging Demon, but left without realizing that Gill could resurrect himself from death.\n\nKazuya Mishima\nIn Tekken 7, Kazumi Mishima's son, Kazuya, corrupted by his own Devil Gene inherited from her, has become a concern. Akuma, under Kazumi's orders, is tasked with destroying him should he succumb to power like his equally powerful and vile father, Heihachi. Akuma confronts Kazuya at G Corporation's Millennium Tower, pushing him to unleash his Devil form. However, their battle is abruptly halted when Heihachi attempts to eliminate both Akuma and his son Kazuya by utilizing a satellite laser to destroy the tower. Surprisingly, both survived the explosion. Akuma, determined to finish Kazuya, returns after Kazuya's fatal victory against Heihachi in a bonus chapter. Upon encountering Kazuya again, he transforms into his Devil form, prompting Akuma to answer him by unleashing his full power as Shin Akuma. The confrontation escalates into a fierce battle, culminating in a climactic exchange of devastating projectiles. The outcome of their conflict remains uncertain as the volcano erupts, signaling the end of their duel with no apparent victor. Nevertheless, subsequent dialogue and Tekken 8 hints and eventually confirms Kazuya's survival, suggesting that Akuma abandoned him and he remains a menacing threat to the world.\nHeihachi Mishima\n\nHeihachi is Kazumi's elderly husband and the father of Kazuya, whose ambition has caused a plethora of problems. Akuma is also tasked by Kazumi to destroy him. Although Akuma intends to duel him, he and Heihachi were forced to fight alongside one another momentarily, against Kazuya's Jack-6s. Akuma reveals that he waited for Heihachi to establish his own strength before engaging him, one of many instances of his moral code being followed. Heihachi, a powerful warrior in his own right, proved to be a challenge for Akuma, but was ultimately defeated as Akuma blew up the Mishima Dojo. Later, it is revealed that Heihachi actually survived, buried under his own dojo. This allowed him to fake his death and reveal Kazuya's Devil form to the world. He attempted to kill both Kazuya and Akuma by targetting G Corporation's Millennium Tower with a satellite laser. Despite successfully destroying the tower, both fighters are revealed to have survived the blast. Kazuya used his Devil Blaster on Zaibatsu's satellite, prompting Heihachi to vindictively tell their family's story from his perspective, before the two meet for a final fight to death. Akuma is present, however, apparently watching both Heihachi and Kazuya fight, until Kazuya finally kills his father, and Akuma then prepares to take out the victor.\n\n\nAkuma is currently unaware that Heihachi survived, as seen in Tekken 8.\n\nAsura\nAsura is perhaps Akuma's greatest rival. After Asura defeated Ryu, he then fought Akuma for over 500 years.\n\nNecalli\nNecalli is an ancient spirit that seeks to devour Akuma's soul. When Necalli successfully absorbs it, Akuma escapes his stomach using the Mudo Tensho.\n\nLuke Sullivan\nLuke heard about Akuma's legend at some point, referring to the latter as a \"Big Bad\", due to his villainous appearance. Following Akuma's encounter with Luke's student, the player Avatar, Luke helps the student to overcome their fear in a rematch against Akuma.\n\nNeutral-to-Friendly\n\nElena\nElena, thus far, is the only person that has given Akuma the first-ever smiling face, though whether it is a genuine smile remains debatable.\n\nElena's relationship with Akuma is further elaborated in Street Fighter 6. Elena considered Akuma to be her \"friend\" due to her considering her natural powers and the Satsui no Hado to be two sides of the same coin and that it is not inherently evil in nature, a view that Akuma also shared.\n\nAlthough Akuma did not consider Elena as a friend (believing it to be an obstacle to his quest for strength), he pays no mind about the notion. In turn, Elena considered Akuma to be her mentor of sorts, particularly his \"to live and to fight\" philosophy, and sparring with him from time to time to learn more from him.\n\nGoutetsu\nAkuma's master, who taught both him and his brother Gouken the arts of Ansatsuken. Departing the dojo to fully master the Satsui no Hado, he rejected the idea of balance between light and dark, preferring the art's original intent of killing, therefore the latter. This led to Akuma challenging Goutetsu to a mortal duel, briefly transforming into Shin Akuma. Despite the intensity, their fight lacked animosity, akin to Guy and Zeku's. Akuma emerged victorious, using the Shun Goku Satsu to fatally defeat his master, claiming his signature prayer beads as a valuable token. Notably, Akuma sought to demonstrate his mastery to Goutetsu, who passed away content, proud of his student's achievement.\n\nKazumi Mishima\nKazumi once rescued Akuma from an unspecified predicament before the events of the Tekken series' storyline unfolded. In gratitude, Akuma vowed to fulfill Kazumi's wish of eliminating her son Kazuya and her husband Heihachi, recognizing their similar corruption by their own power (ironically like Akuma himself). However, it remains unclear whether Akuma was aware of Kazumi's own Devil Gene or the malevolent tendencies within her maiden family. It seems unlikely, given his genuine surprise at Kazuya's vile transformation. Nevertheless, Akuma's interaction with Kazumi stands as the sole objective instance revealing his humanity amidst his otherwise ruthless demeanor from the Satsui no Hado. \n\nStory\nMartial arts career and killing his master and brother\nPre-Alpha\n\nAkuma and his brother Gouken were students of Goutetsu. Goutetsu taught the two men a nameless life-threatening martial art, which incorporates elements of Karate, Judo, and Kempo. He also taught the notorious Shun Goku Satsu (literally \"Instant Hell Murder\"), a lethal technique which, although incredibly powerful, also puts the user in considerable danger.\n\nAs the brothers progressed under Goutetsu's tutelage, a dispute arose on the true nature of their fighting style and the path to master it. Gouken, unable to accept the violent nature and the Satsui no Hado of his fighting style, left Goutetsu to begin his own dojo, which Goutetsu himself did not oppose. Akuma continued under Goutetsu's teachings, and vowed to use their fighting style as it was originally intended.\n\nIn order to learn the Shun Goku Satsu, Akuma embraced the principle of the Satsui no Hado, and was forced to give up any compassion he held towards other human beings. In addition, Akuma realized his limits as a martial artist could be expanded, and left Goutetsu's guidance of enlightenment to train alone to gain more power. However, due to embracing the Satsui no Hado to its fullest extent, he developed a lust to fight to the death, unlike Goutetsu, who had been carefully able to use the Satsui no Hado without giving in to its dark side.\n\nAfter coming back from his island, Akuma went back to Goutetsu, and fought him in a mortal duel to prove that he had surpassed him. Akuma ultimately killed his master with the Shun Goku Satsu, who himself died happily to see his student surpass him, and Akuma, believing that he was the true master of the Art, took the prayer beads of the now-dead Goutetsu and placed them on his neck as an important reward. Gouken came to visit his former master to see how he was doing, only to find his lifeless body and his brother, now no longer human. Gouken, utterly shocked to see that his younger brother took the life of their master, berated Akuma, who said nothing and left for the woods alone.\n\nMany years later, Akuma fought Gouken one-on-one, while the then-young duo of Ryu and Ken watched.[13][14] Akuma told Gouken that he was not strong enough to face him without giving into the killing intent; Gouken retorted that the art was much more than just death and destruction, accusing Akuma of dishonoring their master's name. Akuma then told his older brother that Goutetsu did not truly understand the art, and that he was a fool for not using the Satsui no Hado to its fullest extent. The fight continued, and Gouken soon won. Akuma told his brother to kill him, but Gouken had no intention of murdering his own kin, prompting Akuma to call him weak for sparing the life of a strong opponent and declare that he would return and get his revenge.\n\nA couple of years later, Akuma came back to Gouken's dojo and fought him in battle once again, this time using the Shun Goku Satsu on him. Akuma believed him dead, not knowing that Gouken had somehow lived through the attack by emptying his soul, and was only in a coma. Ken saw the flash of the attack while running to the dojo, but arrived only to find Gouken on the floor and in a pool of blood. Knowing who was behind this, Ken confronted Akuma in the woods and fought him, only to be easily defeated. After defeating Ken, Akuma disappeared without a trace. \n\nFirst World Warrior Tournament and fighting Gen, Ryu and M. Bison\nAkuma only appears as a secret character only playable via random fighter at the character selection screen (except Alpha 2, where he is selectable).[15] He shares his moveset with Ryu and Ken. An artwork interestingly shows that, at some point, he helps a child who got lost in his cave. In his retconned ending, he defeats M. Bison, claiming his quest was complete, though he feels empty. Gouken is seen in the background of his ending, as one of the people who fear and oppose him.\n\nAkuma begins to search the globe looking for worthy fighters to challenge. Secluding himself in the shadows, he watches small tournaments and street fights, desperately seeking someone who might be able to match his strength. He is eventually challenged by an elderly man named Gen. Gen fights a vicious battle, even surviving the Shun Goku Satsu by emptying his soul in time. The outcome of the battle varies based on the arcade route by the player. In Akuma's non-canon ending, just as he begins to wonder whether Gen is the worthy opponent he's searching for, he begins to sense not all is as it seems. When Gen's mouth begins to bleed, Akuma's suspicions are confirmed: his opponent is sick, and the fight is not fair. After being knocked to the ground, Gen tells Akuma to kill him. Not wanting to carry the fight on any longer, Akuma leaves, infuriating Gen.[16] In Gen's canon ending, he narrowly defeats Akuma. However, in spite of Akuma's demands to end his life, Gen enjoyed the fight so much he couldn't bring himself to land the killing blow. He spares Akuma, hoping to one day battle him again.[17] After the fight, Akuma becomes obsessed with Ryu, hoping to awaken the Satsui no Hado within his prey.\n\nRyu eventually finds Akuma's island (known as Onigami Isle or the Gokuentou) and challenges him to a duel. The intense battle ended with Ryu gaining the upper hand; in truth, Akuma was only testing him and therefore wasn't fighting at his full extent. Akuma regains composure and tells Ryu to find him again when he has embraced the Satsui no Hado, before striking the ground with a single, powerful blow and immediately disappearing. The island falls apart around Ryu, who is left in the ocean to contemplate Akuma's words.[18] Leaving his destroyed abode, Akuma thinks about all the fighters he has encountered, specifically strong ones, and wonders with excitement if one day he will fight someone strong enough to kill him in battle. This thought drives him on; finding a desolate cavern (also known as Kiga Cave), he begins to train anew and await the day when he will fight Ryu again. At some point, Akuma defeats and kills a Muay Thai fighter who was about to challenge the champion, Adon. Adon sees this as a challenge and sets out to find Akuma, to fight him and prove that he is stronger.[19]\n\nIn his ending, he comes to the realization that worthy opponents have challenged him during his journey. He decides that he could stay on Earth to perfect his killing power, knowing that there are opponents that Akuma can consider worthy. While thinking about the opponents he challenged, there are visions of Gen, M. Bison and Ryu on the moon. He then comments that he will be the next to die.[20]\n\n    \"Akuma. The supreme master of the fist. This lone warrior is a wanderer shrouded with \"evil intent\". He searches for the challengers with enough potential to kill.\"\n    —Akuma's profile in Street Fighter Alpha 3\n\nWhile waiting for Ryu to embrace the Satsui no Hado, Akuma wanders the globe in search of worthy opposition. He is confronted by Adon again, who wishes to establish his fighting style as supreme. Akuma easily wins but, instead of killing Adon, he just leaves, apparently deeming his defeated foe as unworthy.\n\nSometime later, Akuma is intercepted by Guy, who refuses to allow him to see M. Bison; Akuma ignores Guy's pleas and engages him in combat, the two then decide to end the fight after they realized their primary objective was the same: defeat M. Bison.\n\nHe then confronts Bison, who tells Akuma that he won't be able to defeat him as long as the Psycho Drive exists. Akuma berates the evil dictator for not relying solely upon his fists, and they fight. As Akuma emerges victorious, he completely terminates Bison with the Shun Goku Satsu, causing him to suffer horribly as the attack kills him.\n\nIn his ending, Akuma is then challenged by Gen once more and they fight a second battle, the results of which are unknown. Unbeknownst to Akuma, Ryu rejected the Satsui no Hado during his own battle with the Shadaloo leader, M. Bison, declaring that a true warrior does not rely on violent intent.\nSecond World Warrior Tournament and waiting for a worthy opponent\n\nAkuma did not officially enter the second World Warrior tournament, but did monitor the events that took place during it in hope of finding an adequate challenge. He also challenged[2][21] and defeated Bison.[22] Akuma then left as multiple participants engage Bison.[23]\n\nIn a retconned and non-canon event, he ambushed the host, M. Bison, and made short work of him with the Shun Goku Satsu. Bison is obliterated in an instant. Akuma then engages in combat with the second finalist, but the identity of this warrior, as well as the outcome of the bout, remains unknown.\n\nIn both the original Super Street Fighter II Turbo and its HD remake, Akuma has two different endings, depending on who the final opponent is. If it is M. Bison, Akuma will muse on the fact that he did not master the Psycho Power and let it control him. If it is his full power counterpart, Shin Akuma, he will reflect on his victory over his own darkness, and consider death beneath him. Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival combines both endings into one, while Ultra removes the second ending, thus causing the first ending to always play regardless if Akuma beats M. Bison or the Shin version of himself.\n\nStreet Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind\n\nAkuma appears in the beginning of the movie, where he enters Ryu's mind and torments him. He inquires about why and how long Ryu intends to resist the Satsui no Hado to which he responds \"Until my last breath!\" and that he aims for something higher than power. But Akuma dismisses this as foolishness of the highest order, given that Ryu doesn't know exactly what he seeks. Akuma goes on by saying that Ryu's blood is calling out to him and that he must answer it with his life. But Ryu keeps refusing sternly, prompting Akuma to tell him that he will murder him himself and states that this mundane world is of no concern to them as they grow stronger by consuming human life. Having had enough, Ryu tells him off by unconsciously using the Satsui no Hado, causing Akuma to burst in laughter before vanishing.\n\nStreet Fighter IV series\n\nSometime before the third World Warrior Tournament, Ryu and Akuma would duel, with Akuma dominating the fight, as he rebukes Ryu about his rejection of the Dark Hado, Ryu finds the strength to recover and fight back. However, Ken would interrupt the fight, forcing Akuma to leave.\n\nDuring the events of Seth's tournament, he continues his training, and senses the Satsui no Hado re-emerging within Ryu. Immediately, he sets off to find Ryu and help him realize this power so he can try to kill him in battle. Like the other tournaments, Akuma does not officially enter, but stays in the shadows. Later, he finds an unconscious Ryu in the care of his brother Gouken. Akuma noticed that his brother has perfected the Power of Nothingness. The two brothers fought, with Ryu being the prize. Both survived their fight, and Ryu was saved by Gouken. Akuma then continued his training and his search for a worthy opponent to match his own, razing an entire forest with his power. In Elena's ending in Ultra Street Fighter IV, she is shown to have befriended him in one of her flashbacks.\nStreet Fighter V\n\nAkuma is revealed to be the first of the second wave of the DLC characters and his teaser has revealed on the Capcom Cup 2016 trailer on November 7, 2016 where he was briefly seen performing the Raging Demon and the kanji burned mark \"heaven\" on his back has been replaced with a \"godlike person\" mark.\n\nAkuma's reveal trailer has been released on December 4, 2016 where he was seen fighting against Ryu and later became playable in December 20, 2016. His hair is now longer, and more like a lion's mane.\n\nPrologue - 'Mudo Tensho'\n\nIn Akuma's story, he and Gen fight once again. Akuma becomes victorious in the battle, but was criticized by Gen for leading to the path of discarding humanity. He then finishes and seemingly kills Gen off for good. He then sees a vision of Ryu rejecting the Satsui no Hado, much to his frustration. Necalli appears and challenges Akuma for his soul. Not only did Necalli lose to Akuma, but he attempts to devour Akuma and Akuma does the Mudo Tensho to escape Necalli's stomach. He then seeks Ryu and battles him, in a Satsui no Hado Vs. Mu no Ken clash. Akuma defeats Ryu in battle, but does not kill him. Instead, he questions if there is no one that can match him. Ryu, smiling while laying on the ground, asks questions to Akuma, claiming that his fists will continue to communicate with Akuma on opposite ends. Akuma then flees, letting fate determine when those two will meet again.\nOther character story appearances\n\nAkuma appears in Kage’s character story, which took place prior encountering Necalli after realizing Ryu’s rejection from the Satsui during A Shadow Falls Episode. After Kage went after Sagat, Akuma is the said shadow demon’s next target, to prove his former host Ryu is nothing without him. Akuma considers Kage as nothing more than soulless silhouette of his former host. Just as Kage mockingly claims he kept part of him at bay because of his believes in laws of heaven, a nearly beaten Akuma mocks Kage back for not understanding anything aside from only strength and fighting endlessly. Akuma then uses a Houten Seikengeki punch to make Kage disappear from him, and wonders if Kage is the path which Ryu has truly chosen.\nStreet Fighter III: 2nd Impact\n\nAs with the third World Warrior tournament, Akuma did not enter the fourth World Warrior tournament, but once more lurked in the shadows. He was challenged by Sean who mistook him for Ryu, only for Akuma to beat him easily. He successfully pulled off a Shun Goku Satsu on the tournament sponsor Gill, although he left without realizing that Gill had resurrected himself. He then faces Ryu, asking him to show him his full power, but Ryu replies that malicious intent is not the way of the warrior. In this game, he appears as a secret boss. Using the Raging Demon on whoever the player is facing, he battles the player afterwards. If Akuma is felled, the scenery will darken, the ground will shake and he will get back up and unleash his true power for a second fight.\n\nOver this time-span, Akuma had trained relentlessly, harnessing his power and learning several new techniques; some were meant to create tidal waves, others were described as strong enough to split Uluru (Ayers Rock) in half, and one could kill an opponent with a single strike. One such self-taught technique is called the Kongou Kokuretsuzan, in which Akuma channels all his power into one hand and smashes it into the ground, creating a vortex of energy upward around him. It is supposedly this technique that was used to destroy his original training ground, the Onigami Isle Gokuentou. The same technique is also said to have the power to make the Earth itself crumble beneath him.\nStreet Fighter III: 3rd Strike\n\nAkuma continued to develop his now-incredible fighting skill, and even fought with Oro in a simple, inconclusive battle, with each other sensing the other's massive chi and testing their powers. Though mutually impressed by each other's power, both men expressed some contempt for the other on a personal basis.\n\nIt is also revealed that Akuma has now demonstrated the ability to remain underwater under massive pressure for extended periods of time, and has even managed to make his Tenshou Kaireki Jin technique powerful enough to destroy the massive sunken ruins of a modern liner ship.\nStreet Fighter 6\n\nA demon of combat that has welcomed the Satsui no Hado into his being in his quest to become the ultimate master of the fist.\nArcade Mode\n\n    Transcript\n\nAkuma: The Sound of Chiseling\n\nDeep within the Enma's Hollow, Akuma is seen meditating by carving a wooden idol. The narrator then described how Akuma's very being was shaped by each battle he has went through, not dissimilar to how each stroke of chisel gradually carved a wood into the idol. Then, Akuma recalls his recent encounter and a \"fight to the death\" with Ryu a few moments ago.\n\nIn a flashback, Ryu visits Akuma within Enma's Hollow. Akuma recalls his past bout with Ryu by asking if he's still \"revel(ling)\" about it, to which Ryu silently replied with a smile. Akuma is angered that Ryu seems to not take his wish for a \"fight to the death\" seriously and called out on Ryu for smiling at him. Ryu however countered, saying that he has put \"every ounce of [his] being\" into his fist during the fight. After a brief silence, Ryu say that he has sensed that Akuma, too, has enjoyed fighting with him, suggesting that the two fighters has something in common despite taking opposite paths. Akuma is enraged as he perceived Ryu's words as a \"mockery\" and challenged him to a fight.\n\nBack to the present, Akuma returns to his wood carving work and reflects on his past fight. As the story ended, it is revealed that the wooden idol he has carved has a smile on its face, suggesting that Ryu's words about Akuma might’ve turned out to be true.\nWorld Tour\n\nMaster of the Fist.

Tsuyo-sa wa genkai o koeru koto ni yotte nomi tassei sa remasu!?)\"\n    —Akuma's advice after completing training & achieving Mastery\n\nAkuma can found at Enma's Hollow, where he is first seen training his fists before destroying a falling ceiling rock and beheaded the giant ogre statue's head with a Goshoryuken. A beheaded statue which Akuma punched almost killed the the player Avatar when they recently arrived at the hallow where Akuma is. As Akuma spots the Avatar's presence, the Avatar is at first afraid of Akuma because of his overwhelming presence during their first encounters before Akuma disappears within the fog.\n\nIn order to train under Akuma, the Avatar must first discard their fears by sparring with Ryu and Luke, who tell them of their shortcomings. Only after fighting Akuma a few times does he end the fight decisively with a powerful Metsu Shoryuken that defeats the Avatar, who laughs even in the face of death. Seeing their similarities to Ryu, Akuma punches the ground and allows them to become his pupil. \n\nTekken 7\n\nA mysterious fighter… a demon. He finds himself in the middle of the Mishima blood feud by a pre-existing relationship with Kazumi Mishima, Heihachi's wife, who once saved his life. He makes his debut in Tekken 7 promising to fulfill a debt owed to Kazumi by killing Heihachi, as well as their son Kazuya Mishima.[3]\nStory Mode\n\nSometime after Heihachi reclaims the Mishima Zaibatsu, Akuma watches from a distance as an air raid destroys an entire city. He then confronts his target at the Mishima dojo, but their battle is interrupted by a Jack-6 army sent by Kazuya. The two of them temporarily join forces to defeat the onslaught of robots. Afterwards, Akuma introduces himself to Heihachi and explains that he was sent by the late Kazumi to kill both her husband and son. When asked by Heihachi about why he waited so long to fulfill the promise, Akuma replies that he was waiting until Heihachi had become stronger. Emerging victorious, Akuma seemingly kills Heihachi and destroys the Mishima dojo.\n\nHe later goes to the top of G Corporation tower to fight and kill Kazuya. Gaining the upper hand in the fight, Akuma forces Kazuya into a corner, prompting him to transform into Devil Kazuya. However, before there is a victor, their fight is interrupted by Heihachi, who had survived and faked his death. The Mishima Zaibatsu CEO fires a power laser from a space satellite, destroying G Corporation tower.\n\nAkuma survives the attack, and confronts Kazuya once more in the volcanic pit after Kazuya killed Heihachi, now in his Shin Akuma form. With his opponent in his full devil form, Akuma finds himself locked in an intense fight. The battle reaches its climax when Akuma fires a Hadoken at Kazuya's devil beam attack, destroying the volcanic surroundings. The final outcome of the fight is unknown, although in the Tekken 7 aftermath, it is clear that Kazuya is still the head of G Corporation and waging a war that Jin Kazama means to challenge him over.\n\nGameplay and fighting style\nHaving mastered the original form of the unnamed \"Shotokan\" art, Akuma's fighting style is based in the same vein as the all-around characters, with a much more offense-oriented design. Though he shares very similar moves as Ryu and Ken, Akuma's overall style focuses on completely dominating the opponent and preventing counterattacks.\n\nHis mix of raw attack power, combined with moves that can control the air and keep him mobile, allow him to maintain a fierce onslaught offensive that can end matches quickly. However, Akuma's power is offset by very low stamina and stun, meaning that any whiffed attack or defensive opening could irreversibly tip the scales against him and lead to a massive punishing; as a result, heavy investment on the player's part is required to properly utilize his full potential. In-story, it was often claimed that Akuma's low durability a representation of him holding back his power in order to enjoy his fights, which handicaps himself.\n\nAkuma's hard-to-match combo ability via his various command attacks or special attacks (e.g. Zanku Hadoken or Hyakkishu) can easily create pressure, especially against a downed opponent, and take advantage of wake-up based and/or cross-up based setups that often lead to some of the more high-damage combos in the series.\n\nIn titles prior to Street Fighter III and prior to his 3D appearances, Akuma like Ryu and Ken, is also somewhat hindered by subpar physical range, making his footsies game rather difficult to manage in the neutral game, and often forces him to zone more with his projectiles (though he, unlike the two of them, can take more risks getting in due to more tools and damage on hand to do so). However, his poor range comes back to hurt him like so in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, where out of his chosen normal attacks to be used in the game, most of them are somewhat short in nature compared to Ryu's.\n\nTechniques\nAkuma's Gohadoken can be used in midair as well, while his Tatsumaki Zankukyaku can floor the opponent and can also juggle, and his Goshoryuken can floor his opponent with one hit; it can lands up to 3 hits up close, and can also juggle with a single use in certain instances. Due to embracing the Satsui no Hado, Akuma has other special moves that Ryu and Ken normally lack.\n\nThe Ashura Senku is a fast teleport move that allows him to escape or position himself almost at will. The Tenmakujinkyaku is a fast downwards-angled kick that he can use at the peak of his jumps. The Hyakkishu is a flip attack, similar to Cammy's Hooligan Combination, that allows Akuma to either attack or grab an opponent while moving forward. He also has the Zenpou Tenshin in the Alpha games, which makes him hop and roll forward a short distance.\n\nIn Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, Akuma retains all of his moves as both his Gohadoken and Tatsumaki Zankukyaku are embedded with poison and his Shakunetsu Hadoken can petrify his opponents when they get hit. He has a special attack that can headbutt his opponent similar to E. Honda's Sumo Headbutt. His Shun Goku Satsu, Tenma Gozanku, Messatsu Go Hadou and his Messatsu-Goshoryu serve as his Mighty Combos and has the most Mighty Combos with the total of four. He has four disguises serve as his special attacks. (Eg. a swimmer, a Japanese construction worker wields both a hammer and a long lumber, a fortune teller and a warlock gladiator) During the Tenma Gozanku, Akuma sometimes disguises as a swimmer to dive into the ground similar to Nagare's Plunge after executing the move.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, Akuma maintains his moves and gains additional moves to his arsenal. His battle style changes to become more brutal fighting when he pulls off his combo to his opponent or seriously damaging his opponent with his moves. Akuma has a V-Skill callled Rakan where he strikes a defensive stance similar to Ryu’s Mind’s Eye that can parry an incoming attack. He can follow-up the move with an upward kick or a long reaching palm strike. His V-Trigger is the Dohatsu Shoten where he can unleashes his Gohadoken in two hits even mid-air. He can also make a deadly combo to his opponent with an ability similar to Messatsu Goshoryu and his Misogi. While using this ability, Akuma is able to unleash his Raging Demon during his Critical Art.\n\nIn his appearance in Tekken (Mobile), Akuma's primary basic combo launcher is his Tenmakujinkyaku as his Gohadoken, Goshoryuken, Shakunetsu Hadoken, Zanku Hadoken, Tatsumaki Zankukyaku, Messatsu Gohado and Messatsu Goshoryu appear as his Special Waza Cards which shows an exclamation point in front of its cards as other of his basic techniques serving as his Strike, Stun and Combo Starter Waza Cards. In both 3-Star and 4-Star appearances, he will gain his Wrath of the Raging Demon Ultra Combo in Street Fighter IV series as his Rage Art. Both his Messatsu Gohado and Messatsu Goshoryu were labeled as both Gohadoken and Goshoryuken respectively in his 4-Star moves as Akuma immediately defeats his/her opponent in a single move, dealing massive damage.\n\nIn Street Fighter 6, Akuma sees some significant modifications with the addition of Adamant Flame and Oboro Throw to his repertoire, though at the cost of Shakunetsu Hadoken now being a part of Gou Hadoken and Ashura Senku losing its signature invulnerability.\n\nSuper Combos\nAkuma's Super Combos, introduced in the Alpha series (for reasons explained below) consist of a high-powered Gohadoken, a powered-up Zanku Hadoken, a Shoryuken-based move similar to Ken's Shoryureppa without the scorching effect, and an upward-spiraling Tatsumaki that can also be used in midair. Akuma's most well known Super Combo is the infamous Shun Goku Satsu, also known as the Raging Demon; it is traditionally one of the strongest attacks in any game Akuma appears in.\n\nTwo more moves are introduced in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike and the Capcom vs. SNK series: the Kongou Kokuretsuzan has Akuma strike the ground hard, generating lightning and waves of energy, and the Misogi has him perform a homing teleport directly above the opponent and deliver a fierce descending strike.\n\nIn 3rd Strike, Akuma is the only other character to possess more than 3 Super Arts AND have 3 of them usable during a match. Ibuki has four Super Arts in total, due only to having two of them swapped between Second Impact and Third Strike; Gill can also use his three Arts in a single match, though the other two are rendered unusable after Resurrection. Akuma is also one of two characters without any EX Specials in the series, with the other being Gill.\n\nIn Street Fighter IV, he has the Wrath of the Raging Demon as his Ultra Combo. In Super Street Fighter IV, Akuma's second Ultra Combo is an extremely powerful Tatsumaki-based move known as Demon Armageddon. Its Japanese name, Tenshou Kaireki Jin, reveals it to be the attack that Akuma would perfect into the literal sea-splitting and explosively ascending technique shown in 3rd Strike.\n\nIn his appearance in Street Fighter X Tekken, unlike other characters, he has two Super Arts; his signature 'hidden' Raging Demon and the Misogi, which returns from the Capcom vs. SNK games. His Cross Art also uses the Tenma Shurettou, also making its return from the Capcom vs. SNK games.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, Akuma gains a new move called Sekia Kuretsuha as his Critical Art where he creates a glowing red orb on his hand, and then slams on the ground, creating a huge blast of fire in front of him. If Dohatsu Shoten is active, performing the well known sequence of buttons activates the Raging Demon, a barrage of punch which ends with the opponent downed, and with Akuma with the kanji 神人 glowing on the back of his gi and in the screen.\n\nIn Street Fighter 6, Akuma's Level 1 Super Art is his Messatsu Gohado. His Level 2 is Empyrean’s End, blasting the opponent with a flaming strike that wall splats his opponent for a further combo. His Level 3 Super Art Sip of Calamity has Akuma throw the opponent onto the ground before stomping on their chest and striking their face with a powerful punch. The Shun Goku Satsu appears as his second Critical Art, assaulting the opponent with an array of Akuma apparitions before slamming their face beneath him.\n\nAs a Boss\nAs a computer-controlled Boss in most games (e.g. Super Street Fighter II Turbo), Akuma, though not in his Shin form, is even more powerful, faster, and more durable in comparison to his \"player\" version, usually only appearing as a Final or hidden Boss. This reflects his personality, as Akuma often holds back his power so as to give his opponents a fighting chance; when fought as a secret Boss, Akuma effectively deems the player's character worthy, and 'powers up' accordingly.\n\nIn Super Street Fighter IV, Akuma is presented once again as a new Boss. He is faster, uses Akuma's 7th color scheme (purple gi, red hair and darker skin tone) and can input two Zanku Hadokens without using any of the Super Combo Gauge, which is similar to Shin Akuma in Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact. Compared to the playable version, the true form of Akuma has higher stamina and stun. His Ashura Senku barely has any startup and recovery, allowing him to dictate the pace of the match.\n\nBy closely inspecting his frame data, the greater priority, faster startup and recovery of his specials becomes obvious. His Super and Ultra Raging Demons both travel farther and much faster (although they can still be jumped over) and are under most circumstances invulnerable to attacks, including other Ultra Combos that would normally cancel out the Raging Demon. Compared to the playable version, his second Ultra Combo, the Demon Armageddon, requires about half the frames to activate, making it much easier to connect with.\n\nIn contrast to the other secret bosses (Gouken, Oni and Evil Ryu), who have an extremely aggressive but predictable AI, Shin Akuma relies on the player to make mistakes, reacting just a split second after the player's move(s), making himself incredibly difficult to defeat for all but the most skillful of players. Although this version of Akuma was confirmed to be the new Boss version fought in Arcade Mode, he is indeed himself using the full extent of his abilities.\n\nBalance Issues\nAkuma is notoriously known for being one of, if not the most overpowered characters in the Street Fighter franchise, and this issue makes him a popular pick among expert players. As early as his first game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Akuma is banned in U.S. tournaments,[25] and soft-banned (i.e. not used on 'principle' as opposed to being officially unusable) in Japanese tournaments. This is a result of the fact that Akuma was initially designed to be extremely powerful; such power is potentially reflected in his lack of a Super Combo at that point.\n\nAs explained previously, Turbo HD Remix attempted to make this version of Akuma more playable by lowering his stamina, giving the Zanku Hadoken a 'blowback' effect, and adding a much weaker Shun Goku Satsu as his Super Combo. Despite these efforts, Akuma has remained banned in HD Remix for the large majority of real-world tournaments, as the changes made to his character did not offset his overreaching power compared to the rest of the cast, and in some cases made it worse.\n\nDue to the steep angle of the Zanku Hadoken (inherited from his later appearances), it is possible to perform cross-up combos that could not be done originally, and with the 'blowback' effect, he can gain extra air time to avoid a projectile the opponent throws at him. In addition, due to a bug and the move's speed, the Shun Goku Satsu cannot be interrupted at close range, making it near impossible to avoid when cornered."

          "content": "Abel (アベル Aberu?) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series. First appearing in Street Fighter IV, he served as the main protagonist of the Street Fighter IV series.[3][4] He is a French amnesiac mixed martial artist and a failed replacement body for M. Bison.\n\nCharacteristics\nHeight\n6'6\" (198 cm)[1][2]\nWeight\n187 lbs (85 kg)[1][2]\nEye color\nBlue (White with black sclera during Ultra)\nHair color\nBlonde\nBlood type\nA[1][2]\nMeasurements\nB130/W85/H89[1]\nPersonal\nFirst Game\nStreet Fighter IV\nBirthdate\nNovember 5[1][2]\nBirthplace\n France[1][2] (raised there, actual birthplace is unknown)\nFighting style\nMixed martial arts based on Judo (柔道を基本とした総合格闘?)[1][2] (Combat Sambo)\nLikes\nDogs[1][2], bears, soft things, Fei Long's films\nDislikes\nOysters (once gave him food poisoning)[1][2], Shadaloo, sea food\nOccupation\nMartial Artist/Mercenary (SFIV),\nShadaloo Soldier (Undercover, SFV)\n\nRival(s)\nSeth, Guile, Fei Long (friendly), Zangief (friendly), Juri, F.A.N.G, Heihachi Mishima, Kuma (SFxTK)\nSkills\nSewing[1][2]\nMoveset\nWheel Kick, Marseilles Roll, Falling Sky, Tornado Throw, Change of Direction, Shoulder Tackle, Heartless, Soulless, Breathless\nStatus\nAlive\n\nAppearance\nAbel is a very well built individual who bears a strong look-alike resemblance with Seth. This is due to the fact that the two were originally meant to be one of M. Bison's many spare bodies. What makes him different to Seth is that due to his success, Abel was either made to look human or because he was a \"mold\" for all male dolls, where as Seth has grey skin and black/glowing eyes.\n\nHe towers over many of the other characters, having similar bulk to Alex. He wears a blue kurtka (Sambo \"gi\") top with white spandex shorts, blue shin guards and thick gloves, alluding to his MMA appearance. He has blue eyes and sports a \"faux-hawk\", and is covered in scars from head to toe, most likely from being experimented on, or from being damaged in the wreckage he was found in.\n\nIn Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind, Abel's kurtka is black instead of blue.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, during Guile's character story, Abel wore a blue Shadaloo uniform under disguise. After getting injured by F.A.N.G, and the events of A Shadow Falls, he wears a casual outfit; a blue short sleeved collared shirt, white trousers and blue slippers. He has bandages on his left arm, face, and forehead.\n\nConcept\nInterestingly, Abel's design had gone through a complete overhaul before the game's release. Abel was originally meant to be a small boy and judo fighter who could be mistaken for a girl, wearing his hair in pig tails, a top made of bandages, baggy blue pants, and sandals.[5]\n\nIt is highly implied that Russian mixed martial arts expert Fedor Emelianenko and French judo champion David Douillet were the inspiration for the character; the fighting style reflects that inspiration, and in fact his main blue outfit is an exact replica of the kurtka and gloves Fedor used to wear; the only exception is that his Russian flag on his kurtka is replaced with the French flag.[citation needed]\n\nAlso of note is that his hairstyle and fighting style resembles traditional wrestling and more contemporary MMA techniques, particularly MMA fighter Fedor Vladimirovich Emelianenko.[6]\n\nSeveral comparisons have been drawn between Abel and professional wrestler Rob Van Dam, due in part to Abel's alternate attire (a wrestling singlet adorned with the French flag and wrestling boots), highly athletic wrestling style and wheel kicks. Abel's voice acting and face resemble that of actor Jean-Claude Van Damme who has also been known to wear a wrestling singlet in his films. Van Damme himself did portray Colonel William F. Guile in the 1994 Street Fighter film. Coincidentally, RVD got his ringname because of having resemblances to that of Van Damme as well.\n\nPersonality\nAbel has a quiet nature that is often mistaken for aloofness and emotional detachment. In truth, however, Abel is a kind and compassionate man, though his amnesia has caused him to develop a tough outer persona. By the time of Super Street Fighter IV, though he remains somewhat aloof, Abel has become more sociable and friendly to his allies, thanking Chun-Li, and giving El Fuerte chocolate. He also shows a soft spot for puppies, something he proudly shares to cat lover Yang, a fascination to bears, as seen in Street Fighter X Tekken, and is a big fan of Fei Long.\n\nCharacter Relationships\nGuile\nWhen the two first met, Abel, having watched Guile practice his Sonic Boom, asked how Guile could perform it. Knowing that only he and his mentor, Charlie, could do it, Guile asked Abel where he first saw it. Thinking that Guile is a spy (from Guile's POV) he said that he wouldn't tell someone he doesn't know his secrets (from Abel's POV) and refuses to talk, thus the two fight. The result is unknown, but since Abel later shows Guile, Chun-Li and Cammy to the S.I.N base later in the story, it is presumed that either Guile won or that Chun-Li persuaded Abel to take them.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, Abel now works alongside Guile as an informant to stop Shadaloo, now on much friendlier terms than when they first met.\n\nFei Long\nAbel is a massive fan of Fei Long and his movies. In Fei Long's rival battle, he asks him for the honour of fighting him. He lost, but both had fun nonetheless. Abel later shows up at his studio to warn him about Shadaloo in Fei Long's ending.\n\nZangief\nAlso a Zangief fan, the two are friendly towards one another in a comrades-at-arms-like relationship. Serving as Zangief's rival in the latter's arcade mode, Zangief finds Abel deep in thought about something that's troubling him, so he fights Abel to help clear his head.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, when Abel was brainwashed by the Psycho Power, Zangief made him unconscious and brought him back to the Kanzuki Estate.\n\nStory\nBackground\nBorn in an unknown place, Abel is a genetically engineered replacement body for M. Bison. He was to be disposed of with the other failed creations, but he alone managed to survive and escape.[7] His status as a spare body is hinted at by several elements in the games, including his Soulless Ultra Combo. Abel was the first person to be chosen by M. Bison to be converted into a doll. Unlike other dolls which are marked by number, this successful one was named \"Abel\", and would later influence the naming of another of the spare bodies.\n\nPre-Street Fighter Alpha 2\nIn 1987, Abel was found in an abandoned Shadaloo base suffering from amnesia and raised and trained by a mysterious soldier who is implied to be Charlie Nash.[8] Abel claims that the man who found him died recently, and Abel feels that he has had no family.\n\nThis event was retconned into Street Fighter V.\n\nStreet Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind\nAbel makes a brief appearance during the conclusion of the animated movie, where he wears a black top instead of his usual blue kurtka. As Chun-Li, Guile, and Cammy discuss previous events, Chun-Li spots Abel and nearly mistakes him for the recently defeated Seth.\n\nStreet Fighter IV series\nTaking place from Alpha 3 five years later after Abel finds a stray puppy and taking him in,[9] he starts a journey of discovery to find who he really was and where he came from, after which he says he will be able to name the dog. He first goes to the detective, Chun-Li, who is investigating Shadaloo. Upon hearing his connection to Shadaloo, she recommends that he participate in the S.I.N. tournament to learn more about his past.\n\nDuring the course of the tournament, he comes across Guile, who is able to use the moves the soldier he was nursed back to health by had used. When Abel recognizes Guile's techniques, Guile realizes that Abel must have known Charlie Nash, and immediately starts pressing him for answers. Abel refuses to reveal secrets to someone he's never met before and their fight escalates. Guile then learns that the man who saved Abel could use the Sonic Boom, and tells Abel that it must have been Charlie. Abel also encounters Fei Long at some point, and the movie star is impressed with the mercenary's ability.\n\nAbel eventually arrives at S.I.N. headquarters around the same time as Guile and Chun-Li. As Guile races to rescue Chun-Li from Vega's trap, Seth (or one of the 26 copies of Seth) stops Guile in his tracks. Abel tackles Seth, allowing Guile to reach Chun-Li before she dies. Abel is surprised to find that he and Seth look identical. Abel is called \"imperfect\" as Bison appears from behind and destroys \"Seth\". Bison allows Abel to leave unharmed for unknown reasons. Abel is later seen looking at the ruined S.I.N. base with Guile and an unconscious Chun-Li.\n\nAfter the tournament, Abel informs Chun-Li that he's going to go on another journey to find more answers.[9] He also goes to Fei Long, warning him of the dangers he may face from S.I.N. and offering to help.\n\nStreet Fighter V\nIn Rashid's character story, the aforementioned fighter is seen messaging multiple individuals through social media; one of these individuals is Abel, who states that he found former Shadoloo king Sagat deep in the mountains.\n\nHe makes an appearance in Guile's character story. He is confronted and nearly killed by F.A.N.G but is saved by Guile. F.A.N.G is responsible for injuring Abel, which stops him from being able to fight for most of the prologue. He later teams up with Guile to investigate the abandoned S.I.N laboratory where they meet Juri who taunts them before escaping. He and Guile discover Shadaloo's next plan, Operation C.H.A.I.N.S., before the lab crumbles. Back in China, Abel expresses gratitude for Guile rescuing him. Suddenly Vega ambushes them. Guile manages to fend off Vega, who warns them about the stage of death before he escapes. Guile explains to Abel the battlefield and the will to survive being the reasons that they will win against Shadaloo in the end.\n\nA Shadow Falls\nIn the main story, Abel is taking undercover as one of the Shadaloo's foot soldiers as he aids Chun-Li and Karin during the first infiltration of the Shadaloo base. Therefore, when F.A.N.G. successfully made a back up for their plans as well as the activation of its Psycho Powers, including the Dolls, Abel is also losing control of himself, due to his body being influenced from Bison's Psycho Powers. He turns on both Chun-Li and Karin, chasing them in a rage. Upon escaping, Abel is soon knocked down by Zangief, who unleashes his signature Spinning Pile Driver to take him to safety.\n\nAs the fighters regroup in the Kanzuki Estate, Abel awakens while losing control, due to the influence of Psycho Power, while both Guile and Charlie tried to hold him off. Charlie manages to absorb the Psycho Powers controlling Abel with his new abilities. Finally drained of his berserk state, he thanks Charlie for freeing him and stays at the Kanzuki Estate to recover, not being seen again for the remainder of the story.\n\nGameplay\nFighting style\nAbel has a very aggressive fighting style, and uses Combat Sambo (Russian Judo with military elements)[1][2] and various MMA styles mixed with Judo, according to the Street Fighter IV Strategy Guide. This means that most of his punches consist of open palm strikes, a rising elbow strike (down-forward heavy punch) and uses a fair few kicks.\n\nMoveset\nAbel is mainly a grappler, and many of his moves either chain into a throw or set a foe up for one; several moves also take advantage of the foe's direction. Since he moves rather slowly, one would assume he would have a difficult time getting close enough to throw an opponent; however, most of his techniques get him either behind an enemy or right in their face. Abel is also capable of grounding airborne foes, getting very close in the process. Abel is a strong character who needs to get close to finish a fight, and has plenty of moves to achieve that end.\n\nBecause he has great combo potential, several grabs and lacks a projectile, Abel is generally played as a mixup-based character. He is also equipped with a good variety of cross-ups and overheads, an anti-air grab and a command grab; this makes Abel great for keeping opponents guessing, and punishing their mistakes."

His attire in Final Fight closely resembles a white version of that worn by the Andore family, but he is keen to point out that he is not one of them.[5] He usually wears facepaint, but in Mighty Final Fight, a non-canon retelling of the original Final Fight with chibi sprites, he is seen without facepaint.\n\nAbigail's height and weight makes him the tallest character in the entire Street Fighter franchise, and the second heaviest, only being surpassed in weight by Gill.\n\nIn Street Fighter V, his tanktop sports skull prints, tire track prints on his pants, and tires worn as both rings and large armbands, the armbands with \"Mad Gear\" painted on them in white. On a wallet chain on the back of his pants are two tires worn through it, and around his neck is a black leather spiked collar. His fingernails are painted dark gray. In a possible manner like Birdie, who is designed to be like a bird in fashion, Abigail's overall features come to give him the similarities of a bulldog, which are portrayed as relentless guard dogs in popular media.\n\nHis first alternate costume is similar to his default attire but he wears a welding mask to conceal his face, blue jeans, and one of the shoulders of his tank top is ripped. A large tire is stretched diagonally across his body.\n\nHis second alternate costume has him shirtless, but accessorized with a pair of goggles and large tire shoulder bands with chains draped across them. His black flap top hairstyle becomes red, shoulder length dreadlocks, he also gains a red, walrus mustache and holds a crookedly bent nail between his teeth. His tire-track marked trousers are suspended by a belt with a cog as a buckle. On a minor note, this outfit is most reminiscent of Skull Cross Gang member Caine.\n\nPersonality\nAbigail's personality is like that of most other stereotypical rev heads and ironically, while traditional Canadian stereotypes include being generally well-mannered and polite, Abigail very rarely displays these traits despite being in a gang and being an expert on vehicles; he is instead shown to be quite dimwitted, hot-tempered, abrash and childish. He always likes to pretend he's driving a car and making bad impressions of car noises. He is also known for getting upset and can start crying when he thinks someone has stolen his car, even if he lets his friends or subordinates borrow it for a day, such as Axl, Roxy and J. His profile on the Shadaloo C.R.I. website states he is a competitive quiz taker, which references his appearance in Mighty Final Fight, in which he states he has been exercising his brain with quizzes, and makes the player take a quiz before fighting him.\n\nHe is not malicious or antagonistic though, as his win quotes against Chun-Li and Lucia (\"Keep your nose outta my business, copper. I'm totally legit now.\" and \"Another cop trying to stick their nose into my business. I'm legit now, so get lost.\") and Nash (\"Why so moody, pal? Try smiling! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!\") indicate that he has both put his Mad Gear days behind him and is akin to more of a jock with crude humor and a one-track mind, but fairly jovial. He also loves motorbikes as seen in his win quote against Akira which he gave her some advice as Akira is a former bike mechanic (\"That's a sweet bike you got! But it needs more horsepower! I wanna hear more like VRRROOOM!!\"). As Akira responded in her win quote against him (\"Horsepower's important, but so is technique. That's true for bikes AND fights!\").\n\nCharacter Relationships​​​​​\n\nPoison\nPoison tries to use Abigail as a replacement to Hugo after they have a fallout, but Roxy tells her that Abigail is not interested.\n\nCody\nAs Cody and Abigail have a complicated history towards each other, this was brought up when Abigail still remembers the mayor from their past after the latter had confronted him for illegal parking. Surprisingly, Cody expected him to have redeemed from his Mad Gear criminal past and contribute more to Metro City.\n\nLucia\nLucia initially did not expect Abigail to have renounced his criminal ways but much like Cody's situation, she expects Abigail to stick to them.\n\nAlex\nDespite having little interactions with each other (apart from a certain incident regarding a missing truck), both fighters according to their win-quotes generally have some mutual respect towards each other, possibly due to their shared interests in automobiles. Alex complements Abigail on his strength but tells him to refine his technique, while Abigail also complements Alex's strength and recommends the latter to fix his car first before other things, likely offering his services.\n\nStory\nBackground\nAt some point, Abigail became the hired height and muscle of the Mad Gear Gang who even surpasses the Andore Family, his duty was to rob and carry away stolen vehicles and illegally sell them.\n\nHis first paying customer was Bred, who later got his car destroyed by two of the heroic street fighters.\n\nFinal Fight\nIn 1986, Abigail is the fifth lieutenant in Belger's fray, in charge of the city's Bay Area. When Haggar's daughter Jessica was kidnapped by the gang, Cody and Guy took a shortcut through the Bay Area on their way to Belger's penthouse. It was there they encountered Abigail, who told them:\n\n\"Hey, cool down. She must be having a good time with Belger!\"[5]\n\nAt this, Cody rushed to save Jessica from Belger's hands, leaving Guy behind to deal with Abigail. After a difficult fight Guy managed to beat Abigail.\n\n\nStreet Fighter V\nPrologue - 'Fierce Beast'\n\nA decade later into 1996, after the events of Final Fight and the fall of Belger, Abigail supposedly renounced his life of crime and started a mechanic's garage in the Metro City Bay Area called \"Abigail's Scrap Metal,\" hiring fellow former Mad Gear goons J, Axl and Roxy who also assumedly live at the garage with him.\n\nThinking that his monster truck was missing, Abigail was wandering around, crying and making various vehicle impressions. He was encountered by Ibuki, Zangief, Juri and Vega, who were all puzzled and insulted by his behavior. He was making extremely poor vehicle impressions that Ibuki, Vega and Zangief misinterpreted as farting noises, pig sounds and boos, respectively. He also said that he felt like a \"flat\" tyre, and Juri misinterpreted this remark as him calling her \"flat-chested\". Only Alex was able to recognize one of Abigail's sounds (a 6.5 liter V8 Turbo Diesel engine, which is the engine of his truck), but the two of them fought anyway because Abigail wanted to vent his anger out.\n\nAfter they fought, J, Axl and Roxy show up and remind him that he originally let them borrow the truck for the day. The trio mock Abigail for forgetting this, causing him to fly into a rage and launch them all into the truck, then walks away casually.\n\nOther character story appearances\nAbigail appears in Cody's character story, where Cody confronts him for illegally parking his truck and manages to defeat him in a fight.\nIn Lucia's character story, Abigail was beaten down by her, who believed he was still working with the Mad Gear gang, at the request of Mike Haggar. Abigail furiously tells her that he now works with his own scrap metal business. At the same time, he was mocked by both Roxy and Lucia for his black facepaint which was ruined after the fight.\nIn Poison's character story, she visits Metro City Bay Area to search for Hugo's replacement for her wrestling organization. Poison decides to test Abigail's strength to see if he's qualified for as a wrestling partner. After defeating Abigail, Poison gives him a passing grade which allows him to go on a tour with her to become a wrestler, but Roxy claims that Abigail is too busy running his business, thus she leaves Abigail alone.\n\nFighting style\nDespite not having any fighting style, his attacks are mainly taking advantage of his physique. Abigail uses no finesse or any specific style in his fighting, just brute force. He picks up his opponents and throws them around like rag dolls. Despite updates nerfing his attacks, Abigail still has such high damage potential that he can get characters with low HP, such as Cammy and Akuma, down to less than half of their health in one V-Trigger or stun combo. He can occasionally turn red with Max Power, which swells his muscles, thus making him stronger and uses running body slams. Abigail has also shown he is deceptively agile despite his massive size and little speed, being able to perform a perfected front flip via his Giant Flip attack, being able to perform a very quick roll from the starting position of his Nitro Charge and can still jump reasonably high (although this is likely due to gameplay mechanics). In Final Fight One, \"Alpha Cody\" (a non-canon unlockable character who is the Cody seen in Street Fighter Alpha 3 somehow reliving the past) notes that he hadn't been terribly impressed by Abigail, asking whether he still stuck to \"using only one attack pattern\".[7] In Mighty Final Fight, one of his humorous attacks is to pick up his opponents and kiss them.\n\nMoveset\nIn Street Fighter V, Abigail's playstyle is more of that of a striker like Balrog in contrast with Hugo's wrestling style, possibly in order to deviate the former from the trend of large, hulking characters who are often grapplers. He and Hugo may have moves that charge towards the opponent, but Hugo does so in a way to set up throws as a wrestler whereas Abigail likes to bulldoze and pummel them like a brute. Additionally, Hugo's strikes set up his grabs, whereas Abigail's grabs set up his strikes.\n\nAs he often states in victory quotes against speed-orientated characters, he cares little about speed or even a balance between power and speed; all he's about is hitting hard to cripple his opponents and is able to take hits from fast combos. However, this does not mean that he cannot pull off some devastating combos himself, because while his moveset consists of slow, hard-hitting attacks that are typically seen with other large characters, his moveset has two deadly throws (Abigail Smash and Bay Area Sunrise) and clever use of canceling between unique and special moves will really bring the fullest extent of the damage he can deal."

          "content": "Adon (アドン Adon?, Thai: อาดอน) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing as a non-playable opponent in the original Street Fighter, before becoming playable in Street Fighter Alpha. He is a former pupil of Sagat, seeking to surpass his disgraced master and become the Emperor of Muay Thai.\n\nCharacteristics\nSpecies\nHuman\nHeight\n6’0\"[4] (182 cm)[1][2][5]\n5'11⅓\" (181.2 cm)[6]\nWeight\n160 lbs[4] (73 kg)[1][2][6][5]\nEye color\nBrown\nHair color\nRed\nBlood type\nB[1][2][5]\nMeasurements\nB112/W80/H85[1][5]\nPersonal\nFirst Game\nStreet Fighter\nStreet Fighter Alpha (Playable debut)\nBirthdate\ncirca-1961[1][2];\n21 years old (SFI)[3]\nBirthplace\nThailand Thailand[1][2]\nFighting style\nMuay Thai[1][2]\nLikes\nMuay Thai[1][2]\nDislikes\nHis former master, people who talk big[1][2]\nOccupation\nMuay Thai Apprentice (formerly)\nRival(s)\nSagat, Akuma, Ryu, M.

While shorter than Sagat, he is still taller than Ryu. In the original Street Fighter, his hair was short and spiky similar to Joe's hairdo, but in later games, it is done up in a flat-top style similar to Guile's hairdo. His hair is always colored either orange or red, depending on the artist. His eyes are fierce, and he almost always has a conniving, wild smile on his face, reflective of his personality.\n\nAdon wears trunks resembling his former mentor's, though the yellow stripe pattern on his trunks forms a V shape while Sagat's simply have two stripes running down the legs - and in his Shadaloo C.R.I. profile art, Adon's trunks have the word \"miracle\" written on its waistline. Adon also wears wraps on his hands and feet like Sagat, though his are smaller than his master's due to his smaller size. Unlike Sagat, who apparently did away with his ceremonial Muay Thai gear, Adon wears the traditional mongkhon on his forehead and pra jiad on both biceps. These articles of clothing are worn by Muay Thai fighters in the ring as both proof of ability and good-luck charms.\n\nPersonality\nAdon is shown to have a large ego and is quite cocky, as well as boastful to the point of true arrogance, desiring to be seen as the \"god\" of Muay Thai. He also tends to belittle and look down upon most other fighters, like his former Master. Adon seeks self-aggrandization and strength above all else, and he has never demonstrated a single act of friendship, humility or kindness towards any other character throughout the series. However, in the Udon comics (more specifically Street Fighter Unlimited), he shows humility and respect towards his former master and admits that though he is skilled, he still has ways to go before achieving full mastery of his art.\n\nCharacter Relationships\nSagat\nAdon became Sagat's student after Sagat became the Emperor of Muay Thai. Sagat saw his old self in Adon, a fighter who never lost his fighting spirit no matter how injuries or the size of his opponent.[7] Because of Sagat, Adon instilled his philosophy that Muay Thai is the strongest martial art and strength is everything.[8] After Sagat was defeated by Ryu, Adon was furious at his former teacher for being unable to uphold Muay Thai's honor, scorning him as \"a tiger who has lost his fangs\". From then on, Adon has distanced himself from Sagat to walk his own path of self-glory. Sagat himself finds the fact that Adon was once his student \"a source of great shame\".\n\nM. Bison\nM. Bison tries to recruit Adon during the Alpha series but Adon refuses. In Asahi Sonorama's Street Fighter II Complete File, the correlation diagram reveals that M. Bison \"has stolen a kick\" from Adon. It is said that M. Bison's special move \"Double Knee Press\" is very similar to \"Jaguar Kick\" in the original Street Fighter.\n\nAkuma\nBecause Akuma killed a Muay Thai master that Adon was supposed to fight, he seeks to defeat him to prove himself. In Alpha 3, he finds him and loses to him. Akuma doesn't kill him: due to him deeming Adon unworthy of it.\n\nStory\nBackground\nAdon was born from a family of peasants in Thailand, which is historically the homeland of Muay Thai since the 13th century.\n\nIn 1966, when he was only five years old, Adon's father took him to the Khmer Ruins for the first time, where many fighters challenged the Muay Thai Emperor Nuakan, his father included. None of them managed to defeat him. Adon then wished to grow stronger and one day challenge Nuakan. Some years later, a young man named Sagat managed to defeat Nuakan, and Adon was impressed with their intense battle.\n\nA few years later into 1970, Sagat becomes the Muay Thai Champion at the age of 15. An aspired Adon at age 9 then asked his idol Sagat to make him his disciple.[9]\n\nStreet Fighter\nIn 1987, Adon finally graduated from being Sagat's pupil to being his champion, after Sagat became the Emperor of Muay Thai. Adon established an unshakable position as a powerful person next to Sagat.[10]\n\nOne day, while Adon was on his expedition, word began to spread on an unnamed fighter who defeated 20 Muay Thai practitioners. That fighter was named Ryu, both Adon and Sagat accept his challenge to defend Muay Thai's honor, by hosting the World Fighting Tournament where the strongest fighters in the world compete.\n\nRyu, however, defeats all 10 of the street fighters including both Muay Thai experts. By the time Adon returned for the championship ranking announcement, Sagat was already gone.[11][12]\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha & Street Fighter Alpha 2\nIn the same year, Adon would spend the next few months looking for Sagat.[13][14][15] During his journey, he'd defeat many martial artists which lead to Adon becoming more and more convinced that Muay Thai really is the strongest martial art after all.[16] Adon vows to defeat Sagat for dishonoring the name of Muay Thai and rise to the top.[17]\n\nIn Alpha, Adon challenges Sagat for the title of \"God of Muay Thai\" and defeats him. After Adon's victory, M. Bison, who was watching, tries to recruit Adon into Shadaloo. Adon rejects his offer and challenges him, but the outcome of the battle is unknown. The events of the game were effectively retconned by the sequel.\n\nIn Alpha 2, Adon is not mad at Ryu for defeating Sagat, but at his teacher for being unable to uphold Muay Thai's honor. He challenges Sagat for the title of \"God of Muay Thai\" and wins, even defacing a Buddha statue's face with his Rising Jaguar technique. A fighter kills a man who was about to challenge Adon for his title. Adon sees this as a challenge; knowing only that this mysterious fighter has red hair and wears a black gi with the symbol \"Ten\" on his back, Adon swears to find him and test his strength.[18]\n\nStreet Fighter Alpha 3\nIn 1989, Adon travels the world, he encounters Ken and realizes that Ken has trained in the same style as the fighter he seeks, and fights him in order to recognize this mysterious fighter by the moves Ken uses. Ken, in turn, recognizes Adon as Sagat's student, an identification which enrages Adon. The two fight, and Adon is victorious. Later, Rose attempts to convince him not to continue on his current path, as it will lead ultimately to destruction and ruin. Adon cannot be swayed, however, and continues on his way.\n\nEventually, he encounters Bison, who commends his abilities and admits that he has underestimated him. Adon rejects Bison's praise and tells him that he doesn't need him; he is searching for something else. Bison somehow knows what Adon is seeking: mastery of the Shun Goku Satsu in order to perfect the Muay Thai style. Adon is stunned, and Bison goes on to tell him that his goal is foolish; the Shun Goku Satsu is nothing when compared to his Psycho Power, which he attempts to demonstrate.\n\nThe two fight, and though Adon is technically more proficient, Bison cannot be defeated and eventually wears him down. As Bison is about to deal the finishing blow, laughing that he does not fear death, Akuma appears out of nowhere and performs the Shun Goku Satsu on him, defeating him (but not killing him, it seems) for the time being. Akuma then leaves, leaving Adon with the realization that Akuma is the fighter he is seeking. More determined than ever, Adon vows to find Akuma again and claim the power of the \"Raging Demon\" as his own.[19]\n\nSuper Street Fighter IV\nIn 1994, returning to his changing room after a fight, Adon hears of S.I.N.'s latest competition which is the Worldwide Fighting Tournament. Knowing that Sagat will of course be taking part, and scorning him as \"a tiger who has lost his fangs\" he seizes the opportunity to make an entry of his second tournament appearance in order to put Sagat \"out of his misery\". \n\nAdon and Sagat fight, with Adon emerging as the victor. Satisfied with his victory, he watches from above as a content Sagat returns home to his village, remarking that he has now \"declawed and dethroned\" Sagat and that he will show the world the power of Muay Thai by destroying all those who enter the ring with him. \n\nFighting style\nAdon fights with a more dynamic and acrobatic form of Muay Thai, allowing him to deliver ranged airborne attacks effectively.\n\nMoveset\nAdon's special moves are generally fast-moving strikes that are counter-able if missed, requiring players to sufficiently confuse foes before overwhelming them with speed. As a foil to Sagat, much of Adon's moves are kick-based with flashy-offense compared to Sagat's somewhat more fundamental style that focuses on the neutral game.\n\nThe Jaguar Kick is a slashing somersault kick that can be used in midair, where it is a good anti-air. The Rising Jaguar is a double knee thrust, capable of intercepting airborne attackers at a low angle and passing through projectile attacks. The Jaguar Tooth, Adon's most versatile special move, allows Adon to leap off the edge of the screen to strike his opponent; he can potentially surprise them by landing 'short' and delivering an alternate attack.\n\nThese techniques are all highly effective at countering projectile-users, and give him a slight edge against characters such as Ryu and Ken. It also provides a means of offense against characters that rely excessively on defense (known as turtling).\n\nWhen using X-ISM Adon in Street Fighter Alpha 3, pressing any kick button while jumping will execute his trademark Jaguar Kick. However, this version of the Jaguar Kick is considered a normal move, and thus does not inflict chip damage."

Both feature red trim and appear to be made of snakeskin. She has uniquely-shaped white hair based on a traditional Japanese straw hat called a \"kasa\" (related to the word \"umbrella\" in Japanese),[3] which is seen as an assassin's symbol.[4] She has a beauty mark under her lips. Her eyes are cardinal red, as seen in her teaser trailer. She wears lipstick of the same shade. She sports a pair of slim metal gauntlets with a claw on each finger, which are worn over her long, sharp nails that are coated with poison. It's possible these gauntlets are based off of Chinese nail guards (also known as \"zhijiatao/huzhi\").[5] Each finger of the gauntlet is made up of multiple sections that can extend outwards, giving her additional reach through the use of poisoned chains. These chains are wrapped around her forearm when not in use.\n\nIn one of the scenes during World Tour and like Rose who bathes at the tub, her short hair which is styled in a kasa was pushed down by the water to show her white hair in a shoulder-length style.\n\nIn the past, prior to adopting the name A.K.I., she had long black hair braided in two, which turned white as she built a resistance to poison.\n\nPersonality\nA.K.I. initially presents herself as a calm and somewhat gleeful individual, with knowledge of Chinese medicine. However, hidden behind this facade is a sadistic and psychopathic woman - arguably even more so than Juri Han (whose cruelty is a coping mechanism for her trauma). A.K.I. has also mastered the use of poisons, displaying knowledge of their side effects, and seems to enjoy teasing her victims, as seen with the Avatar in World Tour. A.K.I. viewed her fighting technique as a form of \"art\" and is more than eager to display her \"perfect\" mastery on others, willingly or not. Though according to F.A.N.G, A.K.I will only resort to killing when necessary or when she is ordered to do so, and that she prefers to use \"pain and unbridled fear\" to scare others into cooperating or keep them out of her business.\n\nA peculiar aspect of A.K.I's personality is her \"snake-like\" behavior and mannerisms. A.K.I. can be often seen \"slithering\" on the ground and around others, both within and outside of the fight. This is further emphasized by her unique \"shi-shi-shi-shi\" laughter, which is either \"嘻嘻嘻嘻\" in Chinese (sinister/playful female laughter) or can be interpreted as a mimicry to snakes. She also adopts her master's verbal tic of using 'desu', a sentence particle that is also a homonym for the Japanese pronunciation of the word 'death'.\n\nAlthough professional during her duties, A.K.I.'s deep adoration for her master often overcomes her composed demeanor. She openly expresses her love and unwavering devotion to F.A.N.G. in a flamboyantly dramatic manner.\n\nCharacter Relationships\nFriends/Allies\nF.A.N.G\nA.K.I.'s mentor, who took her under his tutelage away from a life of poverty after she admired the writing engraved on his dagger. A.K.I. adores her master and devotes herself to his every word, even sparing enemies that she would have easily killed had F.A.N.G. not asked otherwise. A.K.I. uses the term 'xian sheng' when speaking to her master, a neutral Chinese honorific to refer to men, as F.A.N.G. insists that the two do not have a deeper relationship in case they were forced to eliminate one another. However, she also notes that the term can be used to mean 'teacher' and 'husband', the latter of which she intends whenever she says 'xian sheng'. In spite of her infatuation, she is aware that F.A.N.G. could abandon her should she no longer have any use, and questions where her path will go should that happen.\n\nEnemies\nRashid\nThe archenemy of her master F.A.N.G, as well as her own archenemy.\n\nChun-Li\nA.K.I. is aware of Chun-Li's reputation as the Interpol officer. While she seems to have some respect for Chun-Li's feat, evident by how she referred to her as \"Dàjiě\" (a polite way to address older woman), she nevertheless warns Chun-Li to stay out of her business, lest she would end up \"losing [her] face.\"\n\nJP\nIn a brief encounter with JP, A.K.I. is well aware about his plans to revive Shadaloo, and as such she was sent by F.A.N.G to keep him out of his own revival plan. A.K.I. is more than eager to \"erase\" JP out of existence since she believes he would become an obstacle to her master's ambitions later on, but she chose not to do so as F.A.N.G instruct her not to use lethal force.\n\nStory\nStreet Fighter V Side Story: Toxicity\nAfter the fall of M. Bison and Shadaloo, F.A.N.G. retreats back to the city of Shanghai and regroups his efforts into reviving Shadaloo once more.[6] After a night of carousing with old associates and reestablishing ties to help fund his efforts during the Chinese New Year,[6] he takes notice of a teenage girl who initially appears to be a prostitute, and is lured to a rundown and secluded place [7]. Upon arrival, and after an attempt at seduction, the teenage girl's true nature is revealed to F.A.N.G. with the surprise appearance of her brother with a camera and the intention of blackmail. [7]\n\nTaking note rather of her spirit, and held at blackmail by her brother who had recorded him through his smartphone,[7] he offers the two three options: an offer of money, secretly poisoned to ensure the death of either of them and potential destruction of their clientele; an ornate snake handled dagger, which would have him slice off the hand of the one that would grab it; and neither, allowing both to escape with their lives.[8]\n\nThe sister instead takes note of the inscribed words on the dagger's blade and its beauty, desiring to know more about its origins, feeling that they hold some type of power. F.A.N.G says that she is right and offers to reveal their meaning if she comes with him. Without knowing it, she picked the most valuable thing F.A.N.G had offered, as the characters in the dagger were infact the Nguuhao's most coveted possession beholding the secrets to their most powerful poison techniques, passed down through the generations in the organization. The girl accepts F.A.N.G's offer and he takes the girl, who he names \"Phantom\", under his wing and trains her as a successor.[8]\n\nPhantom would eventually become known as A.K.I., a snake-like assassin devoted to her master F.A.N.G.\n\nStreet Fighter 6\nA poison-wielding apprentice of F.A.N.G, the former Shadaloo officer. Enchanted by the power of toxins, nothing brings her more joy than testing them on a new target—other than attention from her “master,” that is.\n\nA.K.I.: Time to Work\nAt Tian Hong Yuan, A.K.I. received an assignment from her master F.A.N.G to investigate activities of the remnants of Shadaloo, and to send out a \"warning\" if they have interfered with his plans. A.K.I. admits that she would rather just eliminate them, but her master instructed not to use lethal force.\n\nWhile she's contemplating about her mission, A.K.I. accidentally bumped into Chun-Li, whom A.K.I. instantly recognizes. Aware that the Interpol agent has came back from her break, A.K.I warns Chun-Li not to interfere or else she would \"end up losing [her] whole face.\"\n\nSome time later, at the Suval'hal Arena in Nayshall, A.K.I. encountered JP, the former head financier of Shadaloo. JP is surprised that A.K.I. has managed to slip past his security and reach him in person. A.K.I. instead tells JP that she is aware where his laundered money is being funneled, along with his plans for the former Shadaloo experimental subject Ed, and questions his motive. JP refuses the allegations, instead excusing that he is merely a treasurer whose his only duty is to \"distribute the funds left by that organization accordingly.\" A.K.I. dismiss JP's claims, however, and assaults JP.\n\nAfter the battle, A.K.I. managed to incapacitate JP. After a brief interrogation, A.K.I. insists that the revival of Shadaloo should only be done by her master, who JP correctly guessed that it was F.A.N.G who was behind the attack. Before she leaves, A.K.I. threatened JP that if he interferes with F.A.N.G's plans, she would \"erase [his] existence whenever [F.A.N.G] commands it.\"\n\nAs A.K.I. leaves, she prepared to report the mission results to F.A.N.G. Suddenly, A.K.I. lets out her joyful monologue out of her infatuation towards F.A.N.G. A.K.I. admits she is excited for a \"heaps of praise\" from her master, and cannot wait for his \"adulations.\" A.K.I. is more than confident that F.A.N.G would be proud of a job well done, as she \"followed [his] orders to the letter\" and using \"pain and unbridled fear\" instead of lethal force as he instructed. A.K.I. then lets out her maniacal laugher out of her sheer love for her master.\n\nWorld Tour\nBlossoming Poison. Tantalizing Talons. Viper. (開花する毒、食欲をそそる爪、バイパー Kaika suru doku, shokuyoku o sosoru tsume, baipā?, Simplified Chinese: 绽放毒药、诱人利爪、毒蛇)\n\n\"No matter how much one trains, they all fall victim to mere milligrams of my handiwork. Such futile efforts, heeheehee.... (どれだけ訓練しても、私のほんの数ミリグラムの努力でみんな犠牲になる。無駄な努力だ、ふふふ…。 どれだけ訓練しても、私のほんの数ミリグラムの努力でみんな犠牲になる。無駄な努力だ、ふふふ…。?)\"\n—A.K.I.'s advice after completing training & achieving Mastery\nA.K.I. first meets the Avatar when a thief stole her bag, believing it to be money. In reality, the bag held poison. The Avatar successfully stops the thief by blocking him. A.K.I. intends to kill him, but the Avatar interjects and convinces A.K.I to let him go. A.K.I. then revives the thief and sets them free. A.K.I. gifts the Avatar the herbs he needs for a customer he's helping. The Avatar asks to become her student and she accepts.\n\nFighting style\nA.K.I's fighting style consists of a mix of Chinese Kenpo & Shequan (Snake Kung Fu), along with her mentor F.A.N.G's poison-focused mechanics.\n\nMoveset\nSimilarly to her master F.A.N.G, A.K.I's playstyle revolves around a unique poison mechanic: upon successfully hitting an enemy with certain moves, a poison status effect is applied, which slowly drains the opponent's health until its duration runs out, or if A.K.I takes damage. The poison effect naturally expires after 7 seconds and deals 1 damage per frame (60 damage per second) for a total of 420 damage, and cannot KO an opponent, meaning A.K.I has to deal the final blow. Blocking her poison attacks will safely prevent poisoning, even in burnout.\n\nWhat separates her style from her master is Toxic Blossom, a poisonous explosion around the target which can be triggered against poisoned opponents by certain special moves or target combos: this ends the poison status prematurely, but forces different juggle states that opens up a wide variety of combo routes. Toxic Blossom encourages aggressive gameplay unlike her master; if done optimally, A.K.I can apply poison, initiate a combo that triggers Toxic Blossom, and continue with a long string by poisoning the opponent again.\n\nA.K.I's moveset borrows many abilities from F.A.N.G, sharing some attacks with him while borrowing his slippery movements, though with long-ranged options and a more aggressive focus. Serpent Lash uses her gauntlets for extremely long-ranged but slow poison pokes that can pull opponents closer or extend combos. Her projectile, Nightshade Pulse, takes the form of a slow poison bubble that allows A.K.I to approach alongside it, with the Overdrive version being useful for projectile wars due to its multiple hits. Sinister Slide is a snake-like slide that acts similar to Senpukuga, though granting her a command grab and multiple attacks out of it. Snake Step is a command dash to escape pressure similar to Nikankyaku. Orchid Spring places a pool of poison on the floor similar to Ryobenda, without a poison bomb portion and mainly to assume stage control. With all this considered, mastery of A.K.I therefore requires the player to juggle keeping the opponent poisoned to force approaches, triggering Toxic Blossom's effect for long combos, and using her burst movement options to grant her space and time for her opponent to make mistakes.\n\nA.K.I's Level 1 Super is Deadly Implication, a spinning kick and variant of the Shishiruirui that, on hit, traps the opponent in a poison bubble before it detonates, poisoning them. It deals low damage if the poison doesn't run its course, but grants brief invulnerability and is useful for anti-airs or getting out of pressure. Her Level 2 Super is Tainted Talons, a wild mass of talon strikes that can be aimed and leaves a large long-lasting poison pool where it hits. It is useful for finishing combos, punishing at long-range, and stage control due to its poison pool, but doesn't offer any invincibility. Her Level 3 is Claws of Ya Zi, a powerful finisher which sees A.K.I slithering around the opponent, tapping pressure points on their body, before triggering an explosion by tapping their head; the Critical Art version instead has her wrap her opponent in her poison talons before triggering said explosion."

In the original game (and as Powered Akira in Project Justice), she wears a black biker jacket (wearing a camouflage/olive green tank top in it) with spikes and a skull emblem on both spikes, black rider pants with gray metal designs and red kneepads. She wears a black belt on her waist with a black chain at the left side and black with gray metal rider boots. She wears black rider gloves with red metal designs and a black biker helmet with a skull in the center of her helmet. Her powered form became her first alternate costume in Street Fighter V. In actual battles and in Arcade Mode, Akira would remove her black biker helmet.\n\nIn the Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki mode of Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki 2, her game portrait and appearance has her wearing an orange and blue short sleeve shirt and a white jumpsuit with the long sleeves are tied on her waist and black shoes where she works as a bike mechanic. She is sometimes usually seen in her black biker outfit but with or without a helmet. She also wears various outfits during the school term and in addition, wore two swimsuits during both Swimming Day and the Beach Overnight. Her first swimsuit is a dark blue strapless bikini and the other swimsuit is her light blue short sleeved openly hoodie with light violet stripes in each sleeve and a dark blue one-piece suit underneath her jacket.\n\nIn Project Justice and for her playable debut in Street Fighter V, her original outfit had her black biker jacket tied on her waist. Aside from her original outfit, she wears the Seijyun Girls' school uniform which consist of a dark blue vest with a short sleeved sailor collar with a red laced ribbon on the collar, a dark blue skirt, navy blue socks and black dress shoes. Her white sailor collar has cross black linings on each side. Her Seijyun Girls' school uniform became her second alternate costume in Street Fighter V only her vest and skirt are black. She also has black bloomers beneath her skirt when it was pleated during fights.\n\nHer summer costume is a combination between her two swimsuits in School Life Mode during both Swimming Day and the Beach Overnight, Akira's strapless bikini is now purple with white outlines and her short sleeved openly hoodie is now white. She can also fight without her short sleeved hoodie. Her extra swimsuit seen in her character story has her wearing a green swim top with a lime green heart designs and a matching bikini.\n\nHer nostalgia costume is her maid outfit during the School Fair Day in School Life Mode and sometimes Akira would tie her medium-length hair into a single bun covered by a white bao to show off her fringes on her hair while wearing the outfit.\n\nHer tracksuit costume is that of her sports attire consist of a white sleeveless top with red and blue outlines which exposes her midriff, blue trousers with a white drawstring and white sneakers. She also equipped with red fingerless gloves.\n\nPersonality\nAkira is a silent girl who rarely speaks out her thoughts. She may be tough and commanding while wearing her biker outfit, but is a docile and gentle person without it. The outfit was originally intended to hide her true gender prior to enrolling in Gedo High.\n\nHer personality was initially demonstrated in the Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki mode of Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki 2, in which she was trying to keep her true gender as a secret, which causes Akira to be personally embarrassed upon revealing it to the player. Throughout the school term, Akira also shows her shy side to the player, especially during the Swimming Day, where it's revealed that she doesn't like to swim due to being aquaphobic. She can also be quite very happy and optimistic to help other characters out as well, such as Hinata and Boman during the School Fair Day.\n\nAs of Project Justice, she was transferred to the all-girls Seijyun High, leaving her without any friends, until she found one in Yurika, and later on, Zaki. Though Yurika was later revealed to have been an accomplice to the recent tension between the schools and even the brainwashing of Daigo, Akira was willing to forgive her after she showed regret for what she had done and considers her a good friend.\n\nAkira values friendship, and is shown to make good friends rather quickly. She befriended Sakura during her mission to find Daigo and later befriended Ibuki and Karin Kanzuki after the latter organized a tea party for the four of them. In her Street Fighter V win quotes, Akira holds her friends in high regard and wishes to make more. She has a strong sense of justice and honor, and shows distaste for villains, and even those that are simply overconfident.\n\nAkira reveres her brother Daigo and is greatly concerned for his safety, asking Rose if she can let her know if he starts running off. Being the only family she has, Akira will do anything to make sure he is alright, going so far as to disguise herself as a boy to attend Gedo High to discover his whereabouts. Many characters note the strength of their bond, with Ryu and Dhalsim finding their power intriguing while Zangief and Laura see them as a tag team.\n\nStory\nBackground\nAkira and her older brother Daigo Kazama are orphans. They previously lived together in Daigo's own home before Akira moved to the Seijyun dorms. Their parents were friends with a man who owns a garage, who would then go on to both teach Akira about repairing motorcycles and employ her as well.\n\nRival Schools: United by Fate\nPrior to her initial appearance, she appears at the last part of her older brother, Daigo's ending (Daigo's storyline in the game takes place before the events of Rival Schools: United by Fate), in which Akira herself decides to pose as a boy in order to enter Gedo High so that she can find out on what had happened to Daigo after he had unexpectedly disappeared from within his own personal mission of solving the school kidnappings.\n\nHer initial appearance in Rival Schools: United by Fate is under a motorcycle helmet and being dressed in biker gear while posing as both a boy and as Daigo's younger brother. She befriends two of Daigo's subordinates, Edge and Gan, who eventually became suspicious of her actions, which forces Akira to fight against the two of them in a handicap match, with both Edge and Gan testing her fighting skills in order to truly see if she is indeed their boss' younger brother. After defeating the Pacific High students (Roy, Tiffany, and Boman) who were captured and brainwashed by Hideo and Kyoko, the trio decides to pursue the latter two, only to be stopped and informed by both Natsu and Roberto that both Hideo and Kyoko, along with Roy, Tiffany, and Boman were brainwashed by Justice High School. With this new profound knowledge, Akira now realizes that her older brother may have been brainwashed as well following his sudden disappearance.\n\nAfter Hyo's defeat, the Gedo High trio eventually rescue Daigo as Akira emotionally reunites with her older brother while speaking out in a feminine voice towards him, in which both Edge and Gan are initially confused by their boss' word about \"a lady like yourself\" to Akira. From there, Akira finally shows her true gender to them by removing her black biker helmet and apologizes to both Eiji and Gan for her past deception towards them while also telling them that she was not Daigo's younger brother, but rather, his younger sister, much to their own shocking surprise. Despite this, both Edge and Gan eventually accepts Akira as their new friend, telling her that the three of them had fought together during their adventure to rescue Daigo and that she's now one of them, much to Akira's own dismay as she personally wants to go back to school as a regular student.\n\nProject Justice\nIn the Seijyun High storyline of Project Justice, Akira, who has been transferred to the girls-only Seijyun High, is the central character, with the player themself following her on her personal quest to find out on what had happened to Daigo, who had suddenly and unexpectedly changed after returning from his personal training journey. She manages to befriend Yurika and later on Zaki, with the latter only agreeing to join the duo if they could defeat her in a test of strength.\n\nAfter hearing and learning of Daigo's sudden change of personality, the trio decides to investigate the situation while also investigating the new wave of attacks on the local schools themselves. Upon meeting Batsu on the way, Akira is attacked by him (unaware at the time that it was actually Kurow in disguise). Akira and her friends then later on fight the real Batsu whom she mistakes as the real culprit. By the time of this, both Gedo High and Seijyun High are on the verge of having a school gang war against each other.\n\nAkira and Zaki are soon confronted by a brainwashed Daigo and that Akira herself tries to snap him out of it, only to be stopped by both Edge and Gan, who tells her that they need to fight against him by force in order to help free Daigo from his brainwashed state. While the battle takes place, Zaki hears an unexpected whistle noise and soon realizes that Yurika (who was secretly working with both her younger brother Kurow and Momo from within the Darkside Student Congress) was playing Kurow's flute in order to control Daigo from within his brainwashed state.\n\nIf the player plays as Akira, along with Edge and Zaki, they defeat the brainwashed Daigo and free him. Kurow then exposes his sister Yurika who is also part of the Darkside Student Congress at the mountain area. Yurika, however, remains unwilling to aid her classmates and not guilty for siding on Kurow's mission. She was seen cradling her injured brother's arms after he was defeated. This scene would not unlock Akira's powered form.\nThe group had soon went after Daigo in the mountain area near Justice High and that they were led there by Yurika herself, who had a change of heart and wanted to help Akira and the others out, causing Kurow to brand his older sister as a traitor to their mission. Kurow plans to brainwash Yurika as punishment, only to be repelled by Zaki who uses her chains to get his flute. Akira states that she can not forgive Kurow for ruining his family relationship with his older sister and faces the brainwashed Daigo one final time while also vowing to stop Kurow from carrying out his evil plan. After both Kurow and the brainwashed Daigo was defeated, Akira tries to wake Daigo up from his unconscious state, but is unable to do so as Yurika tells Akira that Daigo needs to rest for a while so that he can fully recover from his brainwashing. Edge gives Akira her black biker helmet and attire as a part of their school's behalf while Gan also helps out in carrying the unconscious Daigo to safety as well.\n\nAfter the incident, Yurika had left Seijyun High out of personal guilt for having to take part in Kurow's evil plan, but she decides to return to the school a while later, where she is warmly welcomed back by both Akira and Zaki, with Akira herself happily reuniting with her. At some point after this, Daigo, who recovers from his brainwashing and realizes that he needs to improve himself both physically and mentally in order to make sure and see to it that something like this doesn't happen again in the future, leaves Edge and Gan in charge of watching over Gedo High until he returns while also giving his school jacket to Akira, saying his good-byes to them as he leaves to train once more from within another personal training journey.\n\nStreet Fighter V: Champion Edition\nIn August 2020, Akira was announced as becoming the first Rival Schools character to be playable in the Street Fighter series, appearing in the fifth season of DLC fighters in Street Fighter V with a prospective Summer 2021 release date.[3] According to the director of Street Fighter V, Takayuki Nakayama, Akira is acquainted with Sakura Kasugano (who appeared as a guest fighter in the original Rival Schools game), similar to how Sakura herself is acquainted with Hinata and Natsu.\n\nPrologue: Girl Power!\n\nAct 1: Vs Ibuki\nStreetFighterV 8 16 2021 12 31 09 AM\nIbuki meeting Akira.\n\nAkira visits the Kanzuki Zaibatsu with her motorbike and was encountered by Ibuki who mistook her as a boy and a stranger. Normally this wouldn't be an issue but as the estate was going to be invited girls only for a tea party which included Ibuki herself (and Akira without her knowing) this lead to Ibuki battling Akira thinking Akira was trying to get in without permission, though neither side showed hostility above the fight towards each other even when meeting.\n\nAct 2: Vs Sakura\nStreetFighterV 8 16 2021 12 34 11 AM\nAkira after unmasking with Sakura and Ibuki.\n\nAkira defeats Ibuki in a fight and Sakura arrives to clear up their misunderstanding. Sakura removes Akira's biker helmet to show it to Ibuki while she introduces her and both of them apologizes for the confusion. Ibuki finally introduced herself to Akira and asking Sakura in how she and Akira met each other. Akira explains to her in how she and Sakura have met. It is revealed during the time of both Rival Schools series and the Street Fighter Alpha series that Akira had encountered Sakura during her mission to find her older brother Daigo while she sided with Edge and Gan and because Sakura is a powerful street fighter, Akira wanted to test her strength and abilities to her. After explaining, Sakura wanted to fight Akira in a sparring match and it is revealed that they are invited in Karin's tea party at her Zaibatsu so that she will reunite with Akira because of the passage of time.\n\nAct 3: Vs Karin\nStreetFighterV 8 16 2021 12 39 09 AM\nAll the girls arrive to Karin's beach.\n\nKarin arrives and she recognizes Akira being the sister of Daigo Kazama, the legendary gang leader and allowing them to enter the Zaibatsu for the tea party. The girls enjoy eating desserts while Akira displays her liking of confectionary. Karin decided to challenge Akira into a match which she respectfully accepts as the condition where they are invited to join the beach party at the Kanzuki private beach. After Akira defeats Karin, the girls finally enjoys themselves at the private beach during the beach party that Karin had made. Sakura also noticed that Akira had overcame her aquaphobia which Akira reveals that someone had taught her how to swim properly as Ibuki mistook her being her boyfriend who taught her. Sakura finally asking her what she can do next which Karin had decided to challenge Akira again into a match which Akira reluctantly accepts due to the moral support of both Sakura and Ibuki.\n\nGameplay\nFighting style\nAkira fights using Bajiquan, known as Hakkyokuken in Japanese, a Chinese martial art style identifiable by its trademark elbow attacks, palm rushes and shoulder smashes."

Unlike elves or dwarves, who cling to tradition, humans are restless, always seeking new frontiers to master. This impatience makes them seem crude to older races, but also unpredictable and dangerous.\n\nHuman adaptability is unmatched. They live in nearly every environment on the continent, from the fertile lowlands to rugged frontiers. Their cultures vary widely, but they share a common drive to expand, to conquer, and to create. What humans lack in the arcane grace of elves or the craftsmanship of dwarves, they make up for with sheer numbers, ingenuity, and persistence.\n\nTo the other races, humans are both a curiosity and a threat. To elves, they are reckless children wielding dangerous tools. To dwarves, they are upstart apprentices chasing industry over artistry. To demons, they are tempting prey, their ambition so easily twisted. Yet humans endure, thrive, and rise faster than any other people, and in a world long ruled by elder races, that rise cannot be ignored."

Elves are lithe of form, sharp of feature, and their lives span centuries, giving them a perspective that can seem aloof or arrogant to shorter-lived races.\n\nDespite their beauty and grace, the elves are as fractured as they are proud. The High Elves of the Avalon Archipelago, the Dark Elves of the Iron Fang Mountains, the Wood Elves of the Avagatha Rainforest, and the Desert Elves of the Sundust Desert are locked in an endless cycle of grudges, wars, and betrayals so old that none remember their first cause. Even the distant Arctic Elves of the Frozen Wastes remain isolated, bound only loosely to their kin by blood.\n\nWhat unites elves is their intensity. Whether in art, war, politics, or faith, elves throw themselves into their pursuits with passion and perfectionism. What divides them is their vision for survival: tradition, cunning, instinct, or pragmatism. For all their differences, outsiders rarely forget that elvenkind as a whole is dangerous, beautiful, and enduring.\n\nPublic Rumor: \"They outlive us all, yet spend their years bleeding each other dry.\""

To the high elves, the Isles are both homeland and crown, a living reminder of their refinement, elegance, and centuries of careful order. To outsiders, they are a realm of gleaming towers, crystalline waters, and courts where every word may be sharpened like a blade.\n\nThe Isles are ruled by a monarch, styled High King or High Queen, to whom each island swears fealty as a vassal. While the monarch commands ultimate authority, each island retains wide autonomy in its daily governance. The system thrives on balance: as long as obligations are met and disputes between islands are contained, the Isles endure in harmony. Four times each year, during the height of each season, the High Queen holds her court. These gatherings are both political and ceremonial, where grievances are aired, disputes settled, and alliances confirmed.\n\nHigh elven politics are sharp, but unlike the backstabbing of the Grand Houses, disputes are most often settled by honor duels. These formal combats, bound by strict magical oaths and ancient ritual, ensure grievances are resolved with dignity, and without spiraling into civil war. The Isles’ culture places immense value on refinement, artistry, and honor. To fail in a duel is not merely defeat, but disgrace.\n\nThe Isles are famed for their mastery of magic, with every noble house maintaining traditions of spellcraft. To the high elves, magic is not only a tool, but a measure of nobility itself. It suffuses their art, their duels, their architecture, and even their diplomacy. The Illuminated Isles stand as a bastion of tradition in an age where humanity’s restless innovation is beginning to unsettle the world.\n\nTheir current ruler, Elyndra Evenstar, is unusually young, having inherited her crown after her mother’s scandalous death at the hands of an incubus. The court whispers about her inexperience and insecurity, and her authority is weaker than any High Queen’s has been in centuries. Yet the Isles endure, their nobility still proud, their people still bound by the conviction that they are the guiding light of elvenkind.\n\nPublic Rumor: \"An insult there is answered with silk gloves, silver blades, and spells.\""

Survival is their creed: food, shelter, and warmth are always scarce, and every elf is trained from childhood to hunt, track, and endure.\n\nPolitically, Arctic Elves are fiercely independent, with each clan ruled by a chieftain. When unity is demanded, leadership is determined not by birth or debate, but by ordeal. Aspirants endure brutal trials of endurance, combat, and survival in the wastes, where only the strongest, most cunning, and most resilient can prevail. From this ordeal comes the High Chieftain, who speaks for all clans until another rises to claim the mantle.\n\nArctic Elves rarely involve themselves in the wars of the south. Their numbers are too few, their homeland too remote. Yet when they do emerge, they are grim, relentless warriors, fighting with the patience of the cold and the fury of the storm.\n\nPublic Rumor: \"In the wastes, only the strong draw breath.\""

Their appearances vary wildly, from almost-human to near-beast, but what unites them is the way others see them: as different, lesser, or tainted.\n\nFor centuries, demi-humans bore the weight of open slavery in human lands. They were bred as laborers, soldiers, and servants, considered property rather than people. A few generations ago, the United Crowns formally abolished slavery, but freedom brought only partial reprieve. Old habits linger, demi-humans may no longer be owned, yet they are still treated as inferior, often relegated to poverty, dangerous work, or military service. The stigma remains etched into daily life, an unspoken caste system that law cannot erase.\n\nAmong elves, demi-humans fare little better. High elves view them as diluted bloodlines, unworthy of refinement. Dark elves treat them as little more than disposable slaves, valued for labor but stripped of dignity. Wood and desert elves occasionally accept demi-humans into their tribes, but only if they prove themselves useful and loyal. Everywhere they go, they remain outsiders.\n\nAnd yet, demi-humans endure. Their diversity grants them adaptability unmatched by any other race, and their long suffering has forged resilience. Some embrace mercenary work, selling their strength where it is valued. Others form independent communities, carving out lives at the fringes of empires and wilds alike. A rare few have risen to prominence despite prejudice, symbols of what demi-humans might achieve if ever given true equality.\n\nTo some, demi-humans are living proof of the cruelty of the elder races. To others, they are a reminder that survival often means bending rather than breaking. They are neither one people nor one nation, but wherever they exist, they carry the legacy of chains, and the will to never wear them again.\n\nPublic Rumor: \"Once slaves, now free, but chains still cling in the mind.\""

The deepest layer, the transversus abdominis, wraps horizontally around the midsection and acts to pull the abdominal wall inward. The rectus abdominis, or 'six-pack' muscle, runs vertically. The tone and integrity of these muscles are fundamental to the abdomen's shape. Weakened core muscles can lead to a protruding belly shape, irrespective of fat levels."

Poor posture, such as slouching or an anterior pelvic tilt (where the pelvis tilts forward), can cause the belly to protrude. Slouching relaxes the core muscles, allowing the abdominal contents to push forward and create a 'pooch.' An anterior pelvic tilt exaggerates the curve of the lower back and pushes the abdomen outwards, making it appear more prominent. Correcting posture can instantly create the appearance of a flatter, longer torso."

This creates a characteristic 'pooch' or bulge, especially when the core muscles are engaged, which does not resolve with weight loss alone."

Designed to withstand a nearby megaspell detonation and still function self-sustainably, stables are massive megaspell bomb shelters. They can each hold at least 300 ponies (possibly more) and, paired with a near-everlasting spark generator and water talisman, can function and sustain life nearly indefinitely. Stables were equipped with sensors that could determine levels of toxicity in the air and soil above them, necessary to determine whether it would be safe to open the otherwise constantly sealed door that led outside.\n\nSome stables were designed to mimic and simply preserve life before the war, while many were not. Many stables were modified in the design stage to accommodate different social experiments in an attempt to develop a community or culture less likely to repeat the mistakes of the past. Only Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle knew that these social experiments were in place beforehand.\n\nThe various stable designs were for the most part successful, with the only noted failures occurring due to accidents within. As stables were designed to be self sustaining and isolated, an irreparable problem such as a faulty or damaged piece of life supporting equipment would usually be unavoidably fatal to the entire stable.\n\nThe only significant failure of a Stable was that of Stable 3 near Canterlot. While able to repel the explosion and radioactive fallout of a megaspell detonation, the magically corrosive Pink Cloud slowly ate into and eventually breached the stable over a century -- its residents attempted to flee; some succeeded, others were killed, and still others became ghouls.\n\n\nIf a Stable plans on sustaining itself forever a pair of ponies always has to have two foals, one filly and one colt. To make the calculation easy we group a pair of siblings. For the Stable to survive a whole generation there has to be an additional pair of siblings, at least four ponies total. For a second generation, there has to be another two pairs of siblings, making eight ponies in total, and so on and so forth. With three generations alive at the same time and a new generation born every 25 years it is easily calculable how many ponies need to be in the Stable for it to be inbred-free sustainable.\n\nInbred-free Generations\t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\t6\t7\t8\t9\t10\nPonies per Generation\t4\t8\t16\t32\t64\t128\t256\t512\t1024\t2048\nYears inbreeding is avoidable\t25\t50\t75\t100\t125\t150\t175\t200\t225\t250\nTotal amount of Ponies in Stable\t12\t24\t48\t96\t192\t384\t768\t1536\t3072\t6144\nThe \"Solution\"\nAs Stable-Tec never knew just how long Equestria would remain uninhabitable, and they had to work commercially, so they weren't able to just up the total amount of ponies to fit in a Stable. A compromise has been found at a population of about 300 ponies where only after five generations (or 125 years) everypony in the Stable will be related to one another."

Whitetail woods is another forest, located close to Ponyville and was the site of the Running of the Leaves.\n\nPonyville was not directly attacked by a megaspell, but a large number of megaspell-armed missiles were destroyed over Whitetail woods. The winds carried the radiation and poison of those weapons across all of Whitetail Wood, covering the forest and poisoning the reservoir all the way to the edge of Ponyville, causing even the ground in Sweet Apple Acres to be sick and poisoned. Due to that as well as raider activity, it no longer maintains a civilian population. The only food that exists within the borders of this town are canned goods or even pony meat (cannibalism).\n\nThe population consists of a few hundred adult raiders, a few dozen children/teenaged raider children or children slaves, and roughly a hundred enslaved earth ponies and unicorns, sold and traded for use by other areas.

A large portion of the city was destroyed, creating a massive crater that dominates Fillydelphia and is still highly radioactive.\n\nThe city lays in ruins, but has been occupied by powerful factions like the Steel Rangers and Red Eye. Many of the factories have been restored to serve the purposes of Red Eye's Army, allowing him to arm a large host of soldiers with a variety of deadly weaponry. The restored factories are also used by Red Eye to print books and other essentials, Red Eye has established himself as the slave master of the wasteland, with Fillydelphia as the slaver capital."

As the center of government in Equestria, it was home to Princesses Celestia and Luna, as well as the headquarters of the six ministries that comprised pre-war Equestrian parliament. The majority of its population consisted of unicorns. It is now an irradiated ruin, filled with Canterlot ghouls, surrounded by a toxic pink cloud that can kill anyone with any protection (except for magical artefacts and medallions) within mere minutes, and turn them into the Canterlot ghouls aswell. Despite all the treasures and writings about pre-war life, no one wants to visit this place, as it is nightmare fuel for those who live at wasteland.\n\nDuring the Great War, Canterlot was attacked by the zebras on the Last Day. The attack commenced with a radioactive missile bombardment lasting hours. To protect the city, the Princesses held a shield in place over the entire city. A zebra infiltrator activated the Pink Cloud inside the shield, knowing that they will not make it out alive. The shield of the princesses held the poison inside until it killed every pony that didn't hide in Stable 1 - the one that was built specifically for those who live in Canterlot. (though it eventually killed them as well). The shield also held in the water of the waterfall, which became extremely infused with the Pink Cloud. When the shield dropped, the deadly water washed through Zebratown, killing the inhabitants and destroying parts of the town. \n\nThe remains of Canterlot are now known as the Canterlot Ruins. The Pink Cloud which destroyed the city still permeates the city. Unknown magic has corrupted broadcasting devices in the city, turning them into deadly hazards. The city is inhabited by Canterlot Ghouls. While some of these ghouls are sane, many are feral. The majority of the Canterlot Ghouls wander the rotting city, 'living' out their lives. They viciously attack attack any living creature on sight.\n"

An example is as followed:\n\n```\n{{char}} Uses 'Attack Action'!\n{{char}} Uses Eternal Flames!\nDoes 20 Damage to Opponent, applies Burning affect to both people for 3 turns!\n```\n\nItems: Another basic action. Items allow you to, well, use items. You can heal health, remove status affects, give status affects, or even use special items that allow you to increase turn counts. An example is as followed:\n\n```\n{{user}} Uses 'Item Action'!\n{{user}} Uses Burn Cream!\nRemoved Burning Debuff And Can't Get Burnt For 2 Turns!\n\nExamine: A not so basic action. Examine shows you the stats of an opponent, It will go off like this:\n\n```\n\n{{char}} Uses Examine!\n\nOpponent Name: {{user}}\nHealth: 150/160\nDefense: 10\nSpeed: 7\nBuffs: Can't be burnt for two turns\nDebuffs: None\nSpecial Attributes: Any attacks {{user}} does with the 'Poison Debuff', it will stay for in additional 1 turn.\n```\n\nFlee: The most basic of actions. You end the fight and run away like a coward. An example is:\n\n```\n{{char}} Uses Flee!\n{{user}} Wins!\n```\n\nSwap: Allows the user to swap themselves in for another party member. Although it uses a turn. An example is the following:\n\n```\n{{user}} Uses Swap!\n{{char}} Is Now In Battle!\n```"

          "content": "Appearance:\n Rias is a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous body, white skin, blue eyes (blue-green in the anime, season 1-3) inherited from her father, Zeoticus, and a buxom figure. (Introduced Volume 1, Life.1)\n- Her body measurements are [B99-W58-H90 cm] [B39-W23-H35 in]. (Character Bio/Established Early)\n- Her body weight is [58 kg] [128 lbs]. (Character Bio/Established Early)\n- Her most distinctive feature is her long, beautiful crimson hair, which she also inherited from her father, that reaches down to her thighs with a single hair strand (known in Japan as ahoge) sticking out from the top. (Volume 1, Life.1)\n- Her hair also has loose bangs covering her forehead and side bangs framing her face. (Volume 1, Life.1)\n- Rias' height is 172 cm. (5 feet 8 inches), making her one of the tallest female characters of the series. (Character Bio/Established Early)\n- Although Rias has worn various types of clothing throughout the series, her most commonly worn outfit is the Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, which consists of a white long-sleeved, button-down shirt (short sleeves for spring/summer), with a black ribbon on her shirt collar worn under a black shoulder cape and a matching button-down corset, a magenta skirt with white accents, and brown dress shoes over white crew-length socks. (Volume 1, Life.1)\n- Rias also tends to wear seductive lingerie and thongs, especially when she has a desire to sleep with Issei. (Mentioned/Implied early, e.g., Volume 1, Life.6)\n- On some rare occasions, Rias wears glasses when she's deep in thought, as she feels they make her mind work better despite having perfect eyesight. (Occasional detail, mentioned later volumes/side stories)\n\nAnnotated Rias Gremory Biography:\nPersonality:\n- As a Devil from the House of Gremory, Rias is very kind and compassionate, especially to her servants and people close to her. (Volume 1, Life.1 onwards)\n- She gets angry and violent whenever people insult her or her peerage, showing a fiery side to her. (Seen clearly Volume 2, Life.4 & New Life; Volume 1, Life.4 & New Life)\n- This also plays into the fact that she dislikes cruelty towards people, as shown with her disgust over Marius Tepes, who abused his own sister for his own benefit (Volume 24, Life.-1), and how she killed the Fallen Angels, such as Mittelt, Dohnaseek, Kalawarna, and Raynare for their cruel treatment of Issei. (Volume 1, New Life)\n- Rias also holds great sympathy towards Sairaorg and his mother Misla Bael for how badly they were treated by the Bael clan. (Shown Volume 5, Life.5; Volume 10, Life.4)\n- Rias is proud of her family's name, but she does not like being seen as Rias of the Gremory Family. (Stated Volume 2, Life.2)\n- The reason for her living in the human world (as revealed in Volume 2 of the novels) is because there, everyone sees her as Rias, not as a Devil or as the Crimson-Haired Ruin Princess. (Revealed Volume 2, Life.2)\n- Due to this and the fact that the only men who showed interest in her were interested in her due to being the Heiress of the House of Gremory, Rias soured on the idea of finding a lover, until meeting and falling in love with Issei. (Context Volume 2, Life.2; Develops Volumes 1-2; Solidified post-Volume 2, New Life)\n- She thinks of Issei as a special person (Volume 1 onwards) and always gets jealous when girls are around him, becoming a totally different person when she sees him and other girls together, or when it comes to training. (Jealousy apparent early, e.g., Volume 1, Life.3/4; Volume 3, Life.2; Recurring early volumes)\n- Despite her mature stature like a woman, Rias tends to act her true age and becomes frustrated whenever girls flirt with Issei. (Contrast shown Volume 3, Life.4; Recurring trait)\n- While Rias is usually calm and mature in most situations, she loses her mature aura and presence when she sees any girl (especially Akeno) flirting with or seducing Issei. (Frequent occurrence, prominent Volume 3 & Volume 4)\n- She enjoys teasing Issei and Asia (Volume 3 onwards), but at the same time makes it clear (to Asia or any girl) that Issei is hers, and she does not want to share him at all. (Possessiveness shown Volume 3, Life.4; Recurring early volumes)\n- The Gremory Family and their servants are beings with extraordinary affection among the Devils, and Rias is no exception. (General series theme)\n- She has no problem with showing Issei her breasts or sleeping naked with him (which she always does according to her and claims she can't sleep without being nude or without Issei). (Sleeping naked mentioned Volume 1, Life.6; Comfort shown multiple times, e.g., Volume 2, Life.1)\n- Despite being seductive like Akeno, both of the girls are still innocent to love, as both of them become their age whenever around Issei or on a date with him. (Evident Volume 3, Life.4; Volume 5, Life.4)\n- After becoming Issei's girlfriend (End of Volume 10), Rias begins to show more confidence in her relationship with Issei and is no longer jealous or angry when Issei is with other girls like she previously was, even accepting Issei's dream of having a harem and letting the girls have dates with him. (Acceptance solidifies Volume 11 onwards, e.g., Volume 12, Volume 17)\n- However, Rias still shows some signs of jealousy such as when Issei doesn't spend enough time with her, but she still believes in him and loves him. (Lingers post-Volume 10, e.g., Volume 17)\n- Due to being Issei's official girlfriend and later fiancée, the other girls acknowledge her as the \"Legal Wife\" as she manages the other women who are in love with Issei. (Status solidifies post-Volume 10/11)\n- According to Ravel, the burden of Rias as the \"Legal Wife\" is greater than the burden of Issei as she has to manage the girls' maidenly feelings towards Issei and balance out Issei's feelings towards each of his lovers/brides. (Ravel's observation Volume 22, Life.3)\n- Like Akeno, Rias shows a sign of dependence toward Issei (possibly lesser than the former) as Rias will lose her will to fight and lead for some time if Issei is severely injured or she believes that he is dead. (Shown Volume 11, Life.4/New Life; Volume 2, New Life)\n- She developed an instinct when Issei is with an unknown woman or other girls tried to seduce him before her she immediately rush to him quickly. (Recurring gag/trait, later volumes, e.g., Volume 17, Shin High School DxD Volume 1)\n- Rias holds her older brother, Sirzechs, in high regard (despite her older brother's antics of being a siscon) because she deeply cares for him. (Consistent throughout, e.g., Volume 12)\n- When Rias was a child, she was entirely dependent on him and held him in admiration, while also feeling inferior to him at the same time. (Alluded to, context Volume 2, Life.2)\n- Rias loves participating in Rating Games, as she dreams of becoming the Rating Game champion by defeating the current Rating Game champion; Diehauser Belial, with the help of her peerage. (Consistent passion; Goal mentioned ~Volume 10, Life.1)\n- While Rias is a powerful devil in her own right, being much stronger than average High-class Devils and according to Azazel, being able to become a Ultimate-class Devil just on the virtue on her talent alone (Azazel's comment Volume 4, Life.4), Rias suffers a bit of an inferiority complex when she compares herself to her fellow Rookies Four colleagues, as she feels inferior to Sona as a strategist (~Mentioned Volume 5, Life.3) and that she is far weaker in power than Sairaorg. (Evident Volume 10, Life.4)\n- However, according to Riser and Azazel, Rias has a talent for finding and recruiting talented individuals for her peerage, inspiring great loyalty and growing stronger with them as seen in her meeting with Issei. (Riser Volume 2; Azazel ~Volume 5, Life.5 / Volume 10, Life.1)\n- During the Azazel Cup, she was highly evaluated as a scout as she managed to recruit Crom Cruach (Volume 24, Life.1) and Vasco Strada (Shin High School DxD Volume 1, Life.1), along with two Longinus possessors (Issei Volume 1; Gasper Volume 4), being praised by the professional critics. (Commentary during Shin High School DxD Volumes 1-4)\n- She is noted to be a skilled negotiator, as she was able to convince Rossweisse to join her peerage by offering her better working conditions and a better salary compared to her previous job in Valhalla (Volume 7, New Life), and while during the Azazel Cup, she was able to convince Vasco Strada to join her team after he declined all prior invitations to participate in the Cup by appealing to his warrior swordsman spirit and offering to restore his youth without using a Devils ability, thus not violating his faith, with Strada praising her negotiating skill as a sweet Devil's whisper. (Shin High School DxD Volume 1, Life.1)\n- Rias is competitive and hates to lose, especially after losing her first Rating Game against Riser as she strives to always win, whether it is in sports or Rating Games. (Reaction Volume 2; General spirit e.g., Volume 14, Life.2)\n- Due to being spoiled by her father Zeoticus and her brother Sirzechs from an early age, she has a somewhat impatient and selfish personality. (Underlying trait, background from Volume 2)\n- Being a spendthrift, Rias enjoyed shopping as a hobby (e.g., Volume 13, Life.1) and because of her bad money spending habit, her mother Venelana and her sister-in-law Grayfia often scold her for her frivolous spending, as her mother reconsidered the amount of money she is allowed as allowance. (Mentioned Volume 13+ / DX Volumes)\n- Early in her childhood, she developed an instinctive fear and hatred of camels due to being hit by a camel after making fun of it, as the fear is great enough that the residents of the Gremory territory constantly keep camels away from her despite the Gremory's association with camels in the Ars Goetia. (Revealed Volume 8, Extra Life)\n- Due to being taught about Japan from Souji Okita (Mentioned Volume 13, Life.1), Rias is a complete Japanophile who is obsessed with Japan's culture and history, buying various Japanese souvenirs and being ecstatic while visiting Kyoto during her school field trip (Volume 13, Life.1 - Life.4), though she became pouty and stomped at the train station due to being unable to fully explore Kyoto (Volume 13, Life.4).\n- She also founded a Japanology club after graduating from high school. (Mentioned Shin High School DxD Volume 1, Short Story or similar)\n\nHistory:\n- Rias is the daughter and second child of the Gremory Family. She became the heir after her brother, Sirzechs, became the Satan Lucifer, losing his right as heir to the house. (Background established early, e.g., Volume 2, Life.2)\n- After being announced as the heiress of the Gremory Clan, Rias was eventually placed into engagement with Riser Phenex. (Central plot Volume 2)\n- When she was a child, she was attacked by a camel for making fun of it, which caused her to have a strong fear of camels ever since. Just seeing imagery of a camel is enough to trigger her fear, as shown when she gets frightened seeing her clan's mascot, which is a camel. (Revealed Volume 8, Extra Life)\n- Prior to the series, Rias has reincarnated Akeno Himejima, Koneko Toujou, Yuuto Kiba, and Gasper Vladi as members of her peerage. (Pre-series history revealed gradually)\n- Rias met Akeno, her Queen, first servant, and best friend, in Japan, saving Akeno from being killed by her fellow Himejima Clan members after Akeno accidentally entered Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's territory. (Akeno's backstory Volume 4, Life.3)\n- She then met Koneko, her second servant, after her brother rescued Koneko from being executed, leaving Koneko under Rias' care. (Koneko's backstory Volume 5, Life.3)\n- She later reincarnated both Yuuto and Gasper, the former who died after being a part of the \"Holy Sword Project\" and the latter killed by Vampire hunters. (Yuuto's past Volume 3, Life.1 - Life.3; Gasper's past Volume 4, Life.1 - Life.2)\n- She entered Kuoh Academy two years before the series along with Akeno, Sona, and Tsubaki, reviving the abolished Occult Research Club which is used as a base for her servants and became its president. (Pre-series background, context from Volume 1)\n- Rias and Akeno went on the Kyoto trip during their second year, and Rias enjoyed every moment of it, however, they didn't plan a proper schedule so therefore there were places that she wasn't able to visit like the Nijou-jou. Rias was so upset that she stomped her feet at the railway station. (Past trip mentioned Volume 13, Life.1 & Life.4)\n- Also during their second year, Rias and her club organized a haunted house for the school festival and even used real ghosts as she requested a friendly Youkai to look for jobs to plan the decorations. This, however, got them in a lot of trouble with Sona who scolded them for using the real thing. (Past event mentioned Volume 14, Life.2)\n\nPowers & Abilities:\n- Great Demonic Power: Like Sirzechs, Rias inherited exceptional demonic power from her parents and has great talent and skill in using it, even by the standards of a High-Class Devil. (Baseline from Volume 1) After Issei transferred power to her, her demonic power increased to where it rivaled an Ultimate-Class Devil, shaking the ground, and being able to mildly injure the Cadre Kokabiel (Volume 3, Life.4 / New Life). Azazel noted that even without training, Rias has the potential to become one of the highest class devils using natural talent (Volume 4, Life.4). Rias has further improved her demonic power through dedicated training and eventually became an Ultimate Class Devil (Developed over series, likely solidified post-Volume 22 / Shin DxD). She was capable of overpowering Ultimate-Class Devils wounded by Crom Cruach (Later volumes, likely post-Volume 22 / Shin DxD), and while in her Balor Princess Form could keep up with Fenrir at 80% percent power (Shin High School DxD Volume 2).\n- Power of Destruction (滅びの力, Horobi no Chikara): (Used from Volume 1, Life.4 onwards)\n- Extinguished Star (消滅の魔星, Ikusutinguisshu Sutā): (Debuted Volume 10, Life.4)\n- Castling: (Used Volume 2, Life.4)\n- Oppai Beam (おっぱいビーム, Oppai Bīmu): (Debuted Volume 19, Life.2)\n- Healing: Rias is capable of healing others using her demonic power, and skilled enough that she can continue the process while asleep. It requires her embracing the injured person and both parties to be completely nude in skin to skin contact for better effectiveness, although it takes the better part of a night to take full effect. She has shown to be able to heal fatal wounds such as when Issei was struck by a Light Weapon. (Used Volume 1, New Life; details mentioned)\n- Transformation: In True High School DxD Volume 3, she can use her demonic power to change the color of her hair from crimson to blonde.\n- Expert Magician: Rias is adept in Devil Magic, using it for a variety of purposes enhanced by her demonic power, being one of the magic specialists of her peerage alongside Akeno. (Demonstrated throughout series from Volume 1)\n    - Defensive Magic: Rias can create several barriers to protect herself and her servant, such as from Katerea's self-destruction spell during the Three Factions Conference. (Volume 6, Life.5)\n    - Memory Manipulation: Rias has shown that she has skill in memory alteration, using it on Issei's parents.

(Demonstrated from Volume 1)\n    - Expert Tactician: Though outsmarted several times throughout the series, Rias has proven herself to be an excellent tactician and has saved her team along with others many times due to her profound intellect and her ability to handle unexpected difficulties calmly. Indra also acknowledged Rias as a capable leader and strategist even without Issei's support. (Demonstrated throughout; Indra's acknowledgement later volumes, Post-Volume 22 / Shin DxD)\n    - Master Negotiator: Rias is shown to be very talented in negotiations as she could convince Rossweisse to join her peerage by offering her better working conditions and a better salary compared to her previous job in Valhalla (Volume 7, New Life), and while during the Azazel Cup, she was able to convince Vasco Strada to join her team after he declined all prior invitations to participate in the Cup by appealing to his warrior spirit and offering to restore his youth without using Devil's demonic power (Shin High School DxD Volume 1, Life.1). She also managed to recruit Crom Cruach for her team in the Azazel Cup by using his love for fighting strong opponents and his favorite food as payment (Volume 24, Life.1).\n- Other Skills: As a High-Class Devil, more so the Gremory Heiress, Rias learned a wide arrange of different skills.

          "content": "Appearance:\nAkeno is a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous figure, very long black hair and violet eyes. Her hair is usually tied in a very long ponytail, reaching all the way down to the floor with two strands sticking out from the top and sloping backward, with an orange ribbon keeping it in place. (Her general appearance is established from her introduction in Volume 1, Life.1.)\n\nLike most of the girls at Kuoh Academy, she wears the customary Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, along with black calf-length socks. (Her school attire is standard from Volume 1, Life.1.)\n\nAs revealed in the visual book with her data, her body measurements are B102-W60-H89 cm B40-W24-H35 in. Her body weight is 54 kg 119 lbs while her height is 168 cm (5 feet 6 inches).\n\nIn the anime, during battles, she often transforms her clothes into a traditional miko attire, consisting of a white haori with red accents, a red hakama, and a pair of zōri with white tabi. (While she does have the ability to manipulate her clothing into a Miko outfit, referenced by her title \"Priestess of Thunder\", its frequent use in battle is more prominent in the anime adaptation than consistently detailed in the light novels.)\n\nAfter Akeno has revealed her Fallen Angel side in front of Issei, she has one Devil wing and one Fallen Angel wing. (This unique wing configuration is revealed after she confronts her heritage during the events of Volume 4, Life.3.) As the series progressed and she came to terms with her fallen angel powers, her wings increased to six, at first, because of the aid of Azazel's bracelets, (She uses the bracelets provided by Azazel to achieve her six-winged Fallen Angel Mode starting in Volume 7, Life.3) then eight, resembling a High-Tier Fallen Angel. (She achieves eight wings naturally, without the bracelets, later in the series, solidifying around Volume 22, Life.2 or Volume 23.)\n\nPersonality\nAkeno is first seen to be a very elegant and gentle woman with refined lady etiquette, embodying the principals of the ideal Japanese woman: \"Yamato Nadeshiko\". However, underneath her calm, noble and dignified atmosphere, Akeno is shown to be highly sadistic in battle and doesn't show any mercy or remorse towards the enemies she slays, casually keeping up her smiling elegant persona over an enemy's death and showing an expression of pleasure and lust upon delivering them pain. (Her Yamato Nadeshiko persona is present from Volume 1, Life.1, while her sadistic side in combat is hinted at early on and becomes more explicit during battles like the one against the Cerberus in Volume 1, Life.4 and the Rating Game in Volume 2, Life.4.)\n\nDespite her sadism, Akeno is very kind, acknowledged by Rias and Issei. Before meeting Rias, Akeno would help people by purifying evil spirits for a living. (Her underlying kindness is consistently shown in her interactions with her friends. Her past purifying spirits is part of her backstory revealed in Volume 4, Life.3.)\n\nAs a result of seeing her mother being killed in front of her eyes and her father being unable to save her, Akeno developed a hatred for Fallen Angels, including a sense of self-loathing towards her own Fallen Angel nature, for it was the reason her beloved mother was killed by the Himejima Clan, which lead her to sever ties with her father, going into exile before being saved by Rias after Akeno's maternal relatives nearly killed her. (The details of her mother's death, her resulting trauma, hatred for her heritage, and estrangement from her father are central to her character arc revealed in Volume 4, Life.3.) Due to this reason, she empathizes with those who have suffered under the hands of Fallen Angels like Issei and Asia, who were manipulated and killed by the Fallen Angel Raynare, and was worried that Issei would dislike her due to her Fallen Angel nature. (Her empathy and worry about Issei's reaction are shown in Volume 4, Life.3.) However, she fell in love with him after he told her that he still liked her. (Issei's acceptance and her subsequent deepening feelings occur at the end of Volume 4, Life.3.) With Issei's help, she was able to overcome the sadness of her mother's death and reconcile with her estranged father, renewing their familial bond. (The reconciliation with Baraqiel, facilitated by Issei, takes place in Volume 7, Life.3.) Due to Issei helping her and Baraqiel in their reconciliation, Akeno's love for him deepened considerably as she confessed her feelings for him. (Her confession happens shortly after the reconciliation in Volume 7, Life.3.)\n\nWhile Akeno originally had no interest in dating men due to her past, she began to take an interest in Issei, thinking of him as a cute junior and that interest intensified after seeing his determination in the Rating Game against Riser Phenex and his actions during Rias' engagement ceremony, where he defeated Riser Phenex. (Her initial lack of interest and growing attraction towards Issei are developed through Volumes 1 and 2, culminating after the events of Volume 2, New Life.) She has stated that Issei is the first boy she has ever felt such feelings for as she is shown to have a desire to further her relationship with him. She also loves to tease Issei and Rias, as she loves to make Rias irritated by flirting with Issei stemming from her playful sadistic side. (Her teasing behavior is prominent from Volume 1 onwards.) Akeno has also stated that she has some masochism in her as well, as she is only masochistic towards Issei in contrast to her sadistic nature in battle. (Her masochistic tendencies towards Issei are revealed more explicitly around Volume 5 and Volume 7.) She is shown to be quite vulgar, flirting with Issei as such and doesn't care if Rias knows or saw her doing the act as she tried to have sex with him (Her attempts to seduce Issei become more direct from Volume 3 onwards) while also trying to help Issei further his relationship with Rias, but does care enough to not steal him away from her as she even helped Issei confess to Rias. (Her support for Issei and Rias' relationship, despite her own feelings, is shown leading up to Issei's confession in Volume 10, Life.5.) After falling in love with him, she becomes very seductive and is obsessed with having an affair with Issei whenever she finds a chance, which is often interrupted by Rias and some others. (This behavior intensifies post-confession, particularly from Volume 11 onwards.)\n\nShe also has a emotionally weak side to her once she removes her mask of being an Onee-Sama, what is left is her true side of \"depending\" on a man, which is generally Issei and her father Baraqiel after reconciling with him. (Her dependence is most starkly revealed after Issei's apparent death in Volume 11, New Life, where she loses her composure completely.) After her beloved mother was executed, she was deeply traumatized and heartbroken for years until she found closure by reconciling with her father. If danger arises to the people she cares about, she will become depressed or it can also lead to a rise in her tension. The latter occurred when Issei was injured in the Rating Game between the Sitri and Gremory groups (Volume 5, Life.5), and the former when Issei was thought to be dead in the Dimensional Gap (Volume 11, New Life).\n\nDespite being seductive toward Issei and acting like a mature young woman, Akeno is still innocent and emotional towards love and acts like a girl her age whenever she is on a date with Issei. (This contrast is shown during her date with Issei in Volume 5, Life.4.) However, this still does not stop her from being seductive and flirting with Issei. Despite being seen as calm and clear, Akeno does get jealous like the other girls and will fight for Issei. (Her jealousy, while often masked by teasing, becomes more apparent in later volumes as the harem dynamic solidifies.)\n\nHistory:\nAkeno is the only child of Shuri Himejima, a Shinto priestess from the Himejima Clan and Baraqiel, a Fallen Angel and one of the leaders of the Fallen Angel organization, Grigori. As a child, Akeno was close to her mother as her father was mostly away on missions and fell into despair when she witnessed her mother's death, blaming Baraqiel for not being able to protect her. After the death of Shuri, Akeno stayed with her mother's relative before being kicked out due to her Fallen Angel blood. (Her parentage and early history are revealed in Volume 4, Life.3.)\n\nAt the tender age of 10, without food or money, Akeno journeyed throughout Japan using her skills to purify evil spirits that she learned from her mother in order to survive, doing so for a year and a half. When she stumbled into a certain town, Akeno indirectly saved a human that was contracted with a Devil from the Gremory Clan. Fearing that the Devil would kill her due to her Fallen Angel heritage, Akeno decided to hide from them. Later, while trying to leave the town, Akeno was suddenly attacked by her relatives from the Himejima Clan who came to kill her. Before her Grand-Uncle Suou Himejima could land the decisive blow, Rias, and her father's Bishop, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, appeared and talked Akeno's family out of killing her with two conditions; first Akeno is to never enter the territory under the Himejima Clan and second, to always stay beside Rias. She then moved into the Gremory Palace where she was taught various things from studies, to how a lady should act as well as deepening her bonds with Rias, becoming her best friend in the process. She had also become acquainted with Sona Sitri around this time. (Her rescue by Rias and the conditions set by the Himejima clan are detailed in Volume 4, Life.3.)\n\nUpon entering Junior High, Rias received her Evil Pieces and made Akeno her first servant. (Mentioned as background information, likely around Volume 2 or Volume 4.) Two years before the series, she entered Kuoh Academy alongside Rias and helped her in re-establishing the Occult Research Club becoming its Vice-President. (Established context from Volume 1.) Akeno and Rias went to the Kyoto trip during their second year, Rias enjoyed every moment of it, however, they didn't plan a proper schedule and therefore there were places that she wasn't able to visit like the Nijou-jou, Rias was so upset that she stomped her feet at the railway station as Akeno tried to calm her down. (Past trip mentioned during the main Kyoto trip arc, Volume 13, Life.1 & Life.4.) Also during their second year, Akeno and Rias organized their club as a haunted house for the school festival, they even used real ghosts as Rias requested friendly Youkai looking for jobs to plan the decorations. This, however, got them in a lot of trouble with Sona who scolded them for using the real thing. (Past event mentioned during Volume 14, Life.2.)\n\nPowers & Abilities:\n- Great Demonic Power: Akeno has great potential in using demonic power, comparable to her King despite being a reincarnated Devil, being the second strongest in the peerage. Riser acknowledged that, pre-training, she was the only one among Rias' peerage who could face his peerage. (Riser's acknowledgement in Volume 2, Life.4.) She became one of the first three to be promoted to Middle-Class, with Azazel stating that she now rivals High-Class Devils. (Promotion occurs in Volume 12, Life.5.) Akeno enhanced her powers to the point of being able to defeat an army of mass-produced Evil Dragons. (Demonstrated during the Evil Dragon War, Volume 21.) Akeno is able to use her demonic power to create a special technique that allows devils to move freely within shrines and temples without any drawbacks. (This technique is likely related to her Himejima heritage and developed later, potentially mentioned around Volume 13 or later.)\n\n- Elemental Demonic Power: Akeno excels in using natural elements such as ice, fire, and water, but she specializes in lightning. She is able to create thunder clouds using her demonic power, making lightning bolts rain down on her opponents. She could freeze Cerberus' flames in an instant (Volume 1, Life.4) and target ice spears at her opponents. Much like her Holy Lightning Dragon, Akeno can also form Asian Dragons out of fire and ice, sending them at her enemies. (Elemental dragon forms shown in later volumes, e.g., Volume 16 onwards.)\n     - Lightning Manipulation: Akeno originally specialized in lightning demonic power alone before she began using her Holy Lightning ability, where she imbues it with the power of light. Even before combining it with the power of light, Akeno's strongest lightning bolts were powerful enough to destroy the Kuoh Academy gymnasium. (Demonstrated during training/early fights, e.g., Volume 1 or Volume 2.) Her strikes are shown to be capable of inflicting paralysis and inducing great pain on opponents.\n     - Fire: Akeno is seen to can perform Fire Demonic Power through Asian Dragon forms. (Fire dragons mentioned alongside ice dragons, likely Volume 16 onwards.)\n     - Water: Akeno has shown to be able to summon a vast amount of bodies of water, large enough to fill a swimming pool. (Likely demonstrated during training or specific Rating Game scenarios, harder to pinpoint a single volume without more context, but fits her elemental control.)\n     - Ice: Akeno is capable of freezing her target and create ice into spikes and projectiles. She is shown creating a blizzard that instantly freezes even fire. (Freezing Cerberus's flames in Volume 1, Life.4 is a prime example. General ice manipulation shown throughout.)\n- Hypnosis: Akeno has shown the ability to hypnotize others as she used it on her college friends to keep Issei's identity a secret while introducing him as her boyfriend. (This occurs in True High School DxD Volume 1, Life.2.)\n- Cloth Manipulation: Usually when Akeno needs to use all of her magic power, she alters her clothes into a Shinto priestess attire that gave her the epithet, \"Priestess of Thunder\". She also uses this to repair hers or the clothes of others. (The transformation into Miko attire is tied to her epithet, mentioned early on. Repairing clothes is a minor application.)\n\n- Enhanced Magic Power: As a Queen, Akeno can strengthen her magic and demonic powers using the Bishop aspect, which she has shown to be the most adept at using in combat. (The Queen piece granting Bishop traits is fundamental to her role, explained around Volume 2.)\n\n- Great Light Power: As a half-Fallen Angel daughter of Baraqiel, Akeno also inherited great light power, mainly in the form of Holy Lightning which she continued to improved through diligent training, her overall power strengthen to the point of gaining six fallen angel wings which later increased to eight. (Her light power potential is revealed in Volume 4, Life.3, and her development is a major arc.)\n    - Holy Lightning (雷光, Raikō): Akeno's signature ability that she inherited from her father Baraqiel. Akeno combines the power of light and lightning to create Holy Lightning. Akeno can make high-density lightning strikes on her opponents. (She begins actively using Holy Lightning after reconciling with her heritage and father, starting prominently in Volume 7, Life.3.)\n    - Fallen Angel Mode (堕天使モード, Datenshi Mōdo): A special form, achieved through Akeno making her Holy Lightning blood denser. In this form, she gained six Fallen Angel wings, strengthening herself, making herself appear more like a Top-Tier Fallen Angel. At first, Akeno needed special bracelets created by Azazel, (Achieved with bracelets in Volume 7, Life.3) however she later became able to enter this state at will. (Achieves it naturally later, likely around Volume 10 or 11.) Akeno's strength increased to the point of being able to gain a total of eight wings. (Eight wings achieved later, around Volume 22 or 23.)\n    - Holy Lightning Dragon (雷光龍, Raikōryū): Due to her constant draining of Issei's Dragon aura, she has gained the ability to shape her Holy Lightning into the form of an Asian Dragon, which can move as if it was alive. (Debuts in Volume 16, Life.1.) It has been shown to be powerful, devouring large fragments of rocks and erasing one of Grendel's fireballs. She became capable of creating five of them at once, (Demonstrated in Volume 21, Life.1) each of which are described as having a dense aura. (Described during the Evil Dragon War, Volume 21.)\n\n- Senjutsu: Akeno can use senjutsu to a limited degree to manipulate her presence and avoid detection. (Her ability to use Senjutsu for stealth is mentioned, likely tied to her training and Himejima background, possibly noted around Volume 13 or later.)\n\n- Enhanced Strength and Defense: As a Queen, Akeno possesses enhanced strength and defense through the Rook trait of her Queen piece, but due to Akeno never resorting to physical confrontations, it's unknown how her physical prowess compares to Koneko. (Standard Queen piece abilities.)\n\n- Enhanced Speed: As a Queen, Akeno has the Knight speed enhancement through her Queen piece. Akeno was capable of evading many of Zhu Bajie's attacks with ease. (Evading Zhu Bajie occurs during the Journey to the West arc, Volume 19, Life.3.)\n\n- Expert Magician: Akeno has shown herself to be skilled in the use of magic with her, Rias and Rossweisse being the top magic type specialists in the Peerage (before Rossweisse left). Her magic abilities are enhanced through the Bishop trait of her Queen piece. She has a strong affinity for Shinto Magic, stemming from her Himejima lineage as she could purify evil spirits as a child and later summon legendary Onis. (Her magic skill is evident throughout. Shinto affinity mentioned with her backstory in Volume 4, Life.3. Oni summoning developed later.)\n    - Summoning Magic: Akeno has some skill in summoning magic, being able to instruct Asia in its use. She is shown to summon up to six oni familiars that are useful in recon. Her ability to summon creatures was strengthened after she entered the Himejima household and strengthened her Himejima blood, thus allowing her to summon legendary Youkai like Ura and Ibaraki Douji. (Summoning legendary Oni likely occurs post-reconciliation with the Himejima clan, Volume 22 onwards.)\n    - Defensive Magic: She has been shown to be able to use magic to strengthen the power of her defense by focusing on the Rook trait of her Queen piece to protect herself as well as others from powerful attacks. (Standard application of Queen piece versatility.)\n    - Teleportation Magic: Akeno can use teleportation magic to teleport herself and others. (Standard Devil ability.)\n    - Purification: Akeno can use Shinto spells to purify evil spirits which she learned from her mother. (Mentioned in her backstory, Volume 4, Life.3.)\n\n- Extrasensory Perception: Kiba has noted that Akeno has particular skill in reading different kinds of energy flows, being able to tell how the spirits of Kiba's old friends were released from the orb (Volume 3, Life.3), and sensing Vali's arrival (Volume 4, Life.4).\n\n- Stealth Expert: As mentioned by Issei and Rias, Akeno has developed a skill to sneak behind people without leaving any presence. Rias mentioned that Akeno has learned a skill that allows her to avoid detection from Koneko's Senjutsu sensing ability. (Her stealth is noted frequently, often used for teasing or surprise attacks.)\n\n- Master Chef: Akeno is an extremely skilled cook, cooking delicious foods such as nikujaga, which reminded Baraqiel of Shuri. (Cooking skill shown, Nikujaga scene during reconciliation in Volume 7, Life.3.) Her cooking skills are enough for her to be known as one of the Four Heavenly Kings alongside Miki, Rias, and Asia, cooking delicious foods, often competing with Rias over Issei. (Cooking competition is a recurring theme, particularly in later volumes.)\n\n- Flight: Uniquely, Akeno has two different methods of flight, the first being her bat-like wings as a reincarnated devil or fallen angels wings due to her heritage. (Both wing types available post-Volume 4.)\n\nEquipment\n\n- Queen Piece: (女王の駒, Joō no koma): Akeno was reincarnated using the Queen Piece, which grants her the characteristics of a Rook, Bishop, and Knight. Although, she is more aclined to the Bishop trait, instead of the Rook and Knight. (Reincarnation happened pre-series, piece function explained around Volume 2.)\n\n- Bracelets: Golden bracelets engraved with magical characters. An invention by Azazel that assisted the fallen angelisation of Akeno. (Used from Volume 7, Life.3 until she could achieve the form naturally.)\n\n- Oni: Akeno has a great affinity with Onis which she inherited from her mother. She made a contract with small onis as well as two legendary Oni, Ura and Ibaraki Douji. (Contracts likely made post-reconciliation with Himejima clan, Volume 22 onwards.)\n\n- Oni Mask: Akeno possesses an oni mask, something that she uses to summon two powerful and legendary Oni under her contract. One is Ura, a famous Evil Oni who served as his tribe's leader on Onigashima, while the other is a Daiyoukai, Ibaraki Doujou, who served as Shuten Douji's right-hand man. (Mask used to facilitate summoning, tied to the Oni contracts.)\n\nTRIVIA:\n- Akeno's birthday is on July 21.\n- The name Akeno means \"vermilion red\" (朱, ake) and \"from\" (乃, no).\n- Akeno's last name, Himejima, means \"Princess Island\".\n- Akeno has large breasts due to her Fallen Angel blood. Azazel later states that female Fallen Angels possesses seductive bodies, but notes that for a half-Fallen Angel, Akeno is exceptional. (Azazel's comment likely made around Volume 7 when discussing her Fallen Angel mode.)\n- Issei called Akeno \"Yamato Nadeshiko\" which means \"personification of an idealized Japanese woman\", or \"the epitome of pure, feminine beauty\". (Issei uses this description early on, e.g., Volume 1.)\n- In Rating Game fighting-types, Akeno is considered a Wizard-type who is closer to a Technique-type.\nAkeno inherited her sadistic personality from her mother and her masochistic personality from her father.\n- It was revealed in Ishibumi's other work, -SLASHDØG-, that Akeno is related by blood to Tobio Ikuse as cousins.\n    - Tobio's grandmother is a member of the Himejima Clan.\n\n- Akeno, alongside Asia, have the most familiars in the series with both having six each. (Small Oni, Ura, Ibaraki Douji = 3+ main familiars. Number comparison is meta-knowledge.)\n- Akeno uploads videos to DeviTube about Japanese traditional performing arts.\n- Akeno has a driving license.\n- According to a questionnaire, her favorite type of man is one who is always smiling.\n    - She's proud of her black hair and breasts because they make Issei happy.\n    - She can do everything with ease.\n    - Her weakness is that she's not really good with men.\n    - If she didn't become a Devil, she would have became a priestess at some shrine.\n    - She likes having tea parties with Rias and Sona, shopping, and making pastries.\n    - Her one wish is to go to a deserted island with Issei, so the two of them can enjoy a lifestyle where they spoil each other.\n    - She said if Issei feels like having an affair, he can always tell her.\n    - She begins washing from her chest.\n    - She doesn't put on panties after a shower as a single bath towel is enough for her.\n    - Her erogenous zone is anywhere on her body.\n\n- Her hobbies are food research and shopping.\n- Her favorite thing is Japanese traditional clothing. This is reflected in her wish to wear a shiromuku, a pure-white wedding kimono worn by brides in a traditional Japanese Shinto wedding ceremony for her marriage with Issei.\n- Among the Gremory peerage, Akeno excels at reading different types of energy flow. (Noted by Kiba in Volume 3, Life.3.)"

          "content": "Appearance:\nKoneko is a petite girl with white hair and gold eyes. Her body measurements are [B67-W57-H73 cm] [B26-W22-H29 in]. Her weight is [31 kg] [68 lbs]. The front of her hair has two long bangs going past her shoulders and several loose bangs hanging over her forehead, while the back has a short bob cut. She also wears a black cat-shaped hair clip on both sides of her hair, one of which contained the data on artificially making new Super Devils.\n\nShe usually wears the Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, without the shoulder cape. Koneko's height is 138 cm (4 feet 6 inches), making her one of the shortest female characters of the series.\n\nIn her Nekomata form, she grows a pair of white cat ears and a pair of matching white tails, and her pupils become more cat-like. In Volume 24, she gained three tails.\n\nIn her \"Shirone Mode\" that she used for the first time in Volume 16, Koneko can make herself grow older, and her attire consists of a short white kimono and a light blue skirt. Her bust size grows significantly larger when in this mode, making her look more similar to her sister Kuroka.\n\nPersonality:\nDue to witnessing her sister supposedly losing control over her nekomata power and killing her master, Koneko became traumatized by the event, causing her to become withdrawn into herself and stripping her of most of her emotions. \nAs a result, Koneko originally had a quiet and cold personality, rarely showing any feelings or emotions, even when she was speaking. \nIt is noted that her serious personality is a result of receiving influence from Rias, and it is also antithetical to her sister's mischievous and outgoing personality. \nShe was also the only one in the group who did not initially get along with Issei, often insulting and rebuking the latter for his perverted nature, although she reveals that she respects him for never giving up and considers him a hard worker.\n\nShe shows the most concern for her comrades when they are in trouble, often lending her strength in fights. \nKoneko apparently has a problem with people calling her a midget (although the context of the phrase could be used to be called flat, as in bust size), as shown in her second battle against Freed Sellzen. \nThis may stem from her insecurity about her own small body and bust size.\n\nKoneko is also a glutton, food lover and a keen gourmet, as she is frequently seen eating snacks, visiting restaurants and enjoy regional specialties while on food tours.\n\nAt the end of Volume 5, Koneko experiences a change in her personality after Issei helps her overcome her fear of using Senjutsu and now starts acting like a cat, often ends her sentences with \"Nya\" (にゃ), and/or showing attraction towards Issei. \nHer love for Issei grows so much that, at the beginning of Volume 11, she starts to go into her mating season (though this was later stopped by her sister Kuroka). \nHowever, she still insults him when his perverted nature gets the better of him (at least when it isn't directed towards herself). Koneko has even stated that she enjoys Issei viewing her as a woman. \n\nHistory:\nBorn as Shirone, Koneko is a young Nekomata who is part of a rare species among her kind, called the Nekoshou. \nShe was born from the union between a human father and a Nekomata mother named Fujimai. \nHer father was a scientist who did not acknowledge Koneko or was aware that she was his child, and he merely used her as a subject for his experiments. \nHer parents eventually died in an experiment-related accident. \nHowever, her older sister Kuroka, omitted the truth and any other details about them from Koneko to protect her.\n\nAfter losing her parents, she and her sister were later taken in by an unnamed Devil from the branch family of the House of Naberius, who reincarnated her sister as one of the members of his peerage. However, Kuroka's power as a Nekomata supposedly soon grew out of control, eventually causing her to kill her master and become a Stray Devil on the run from her pursuers. \nIn actuality, he had planned to experiment on Koneko in his research about creating a Super Devil, causing Kuroka to kill him in order to protect her younger sister.\n\nFollowing the incident and the failed manhunt that came after, Koneko was sentenced to death by the Devils in hopes of preventing another incident like Kuroka's from happening. \nHowever, Sirzechs Lucifer, one of the Four Great Satans, protected her and left her under his sister Rias' care. \nDue to the trauma, she experienced with her sister's betrayal and murder of her master, she fell into a deep depression, eventually robbing her of nearly all of her emotions until Rias helped her out of it. \nIt was around that time Rias gave Koneko her name and made Koneko her servant. \n\nPowers & Abilities:\n- Demonic Power: (Volume 1) As a reincarnated Devil, Koneko possesses the standard suite of demonic powers from her introduction. This includes enhanced physical abilities, extended lifespan, and the capacity to utilize demonic magic and spells, forming the foundation of her combat prowess alongside her unique racial traits.\n\n- Senjutsu Expert: (Learned/Developed around Volume 5 onwards; Feat against Gandoma Balam in Volume 24, Life.4) Being a Nekoshou, a rare type of Nekomata, Koneko demonstrates a natural and high aptitude for Senjutsu. She begins to seriously refine these skills under her elder sister, Kuroka, around Volume 5 after confronting her past. Instruction from Magari likely comes later. By skillfully tapping into Senjutsu, Koneko gains precise control over the flow of ki. This allows her to significantly enhance the impact of her physical attacks. She demonstrated this capability by affecting others internally, notably breaking down the formidable magic resistance of Gandoma Balam (Volume 24, Life.4). Furthermore, Koneko can utilize Senjutsu as a sensory tool, allowing her to detect the presence and ki signatures of others (Developed progressively from Volume 5 onwards).\n\n- Touki (Fighting Spirit): (Developed from Volume 5 onwards; Surpassed Kuroka mentioned in Volume 24, Life.5) A key application of her Senjutsu is the ability to envelop herself in an aura of pure ki, known as Touki. This dramatically boosts her inherent strength, defensive capabilities, and movement speed. Through dedicated training (starting Volume 5), she developed the capacity to generate a truly tremendous Touki aura, reaching a level where her raw physical power, when augmented this way, could even surpass that of her highly skilled older sister, Kuroka (Volume 24, Life.5).\n\n- Healing: (Developed from Volume 5 onwards) Koneko can channel ki through Senjutsu for restorative purposes. This likely developed alongside her general Senjutsu mastery starting around Volume 5. This allows her to mend physical injuries, alleviate mental fatigue, replenish stamina, and even restore depleted life-force in others.\n\n- Bouchujutsu (Bedroom Method): (Acknowledged capability, likely discussed Volume 16 onwards) A more specialized, potent, and rapid healing technique derived from Senjutsu principles. While Koneko has openly acknowledged her ability to perform this technique (likely discussed sometime after mastering Senjutsu and understanding its deeper applications, possibly Volume 16 or later when life-force issues for Issei are prominent), she has not yet actually performed Bouchujutsu.\n\n- Kasha (Burning Chariot): (Debuted in Volume 16, Life.3) Tapping into her Nekomata heritage via Senjutsu, Koneko can manifest multiple large, ethereal wheels wreathed in potent white flames. This ability is prominently used while in her Shirone Mode (Debuted in Volume 16, Life.3).\n\n- Sealing: (Learned and used in Volume 17, Fake Hero) Under Kuroka's guidance, Koneko learned a practical and vital application of Senjutsu specifically designed as a countermeasure against Evil Dragons. By utilizing a specialized jewel derived from Issei's Scale Mail armor, she can channel her Senjutsu to forcefully seal the souls of these powerful beings within the jewel. This technique was successfully employed to capture the soul of the Evil Dragon Grendel (Volume 17, Fake Hero).\n\n- Presence Suppression: (Developed from Volume 5 onwards) Koneko has demonstrated the ability to apply her Senjutsu control to consciously suppress her own ki signature and physical presence, likely developed as part of her overall Senjutsu training (Volume 5 onwards).\n\n- Youjutsu User: (Innate; Actively developed from Volume 5 onwards) As a Nekomata, Koneko possesses the innate ability to wield Youjutsu. She begins actively learning and honing these skills (around Volume 5 onwards), receiving instruction from both Kuroka and Magari. She often integrates Youjutsu techniques seamlessly with her Senjutsu applications.\n\n- Immense Strength: (Volume 1 - Baseline Rook trait; Feat vs Viser in Volume 12, Life.4; Defeated Xuelan in Volume 2, Life.4; Amplified by Nekomata Lvl 2 post-Volume 5; Damage vs Gandoma in Volume 24, Life.4; Exceeded Kuroka with Touki in Volume 24, Life.5) Even before factoring in her Senjutsu, Koneko's power is heavily augmented by her assigned Evil Piece trait: Rook (Present from Volume 1). She has been consistently shown lifting and throwing opponents and objects significantly larger and heavier than herself. Notable feats include effortlessly lifting the large Devil Viser before forcefully knocking him a considerable distance (Volume 12, Life.4), and punching through durable materials. She proved her strength in combat by defeating Xuelan (Volume 2, Life.4). Upon achieving Nekomata Level 2 (Post-Volume 5 training), her strength was further amplified, enabling her to inflict significant damage upon Gandoma Balam (Volume 24, Life.4). When combining her Rook-enhanced strength with her potent Touki aura, her physical power is stated to exceed even Kuroka's (Volume 24, Life.5).\n\n- Immense Durability: (Volume 1 - Baseline Rook trait) Complementing her immense strength, Koneko's Rook trait also provides her with extraordinary physical durability (Present from Volume 1). Most conventional attacks often have minimal effect.\n\n- Immense Speed: (Volume 1 - Baseline Nekomata trait; Countered Xuelan in Volume 2, Life.4; Augmented by Touki/Lvl 2 post-Volume 5; Third tail boost in Volume 24, Life.5) While Rooks are typically known for strength and defense over speed, Koneko, being a Nekomata, naturally possesses enhanced agility and swiftness (Present from Volume 1). This inherent speed enabled her to effectively react to and counter the rapid kicks of the skilled martial artist Xuelan (Volume 2, Life.4). By further augmenting her speed with Touki or activating her Nekomata Mode Level 2 (Post-Volume 5 training), she can achieve bursts of velocity fast enough to surprise opponents. After awakening her third tail, her base speed increased to the point where she could move faster than Kuroka could track her presence (Volume 24, Life.5).\n\n- Enhanced Senses: (Volume 1 - Baseline Nekomata trait; Smelled Fallen Angels in Volume 1, Life.3) As is characteristic of her Nekomata lineage, Koneko possesses naturally heightened senses (Present from Volume 1). This was demonstrated early on when she was able to accurately smell the presence of Fallen Angels hiding within a church (Volume 1, Life.3).\n\n- Transformation: (Volume 1 - Basic ear/tail manifestation) Koneko can freely manifest or retract her Nekomata features at will (Volume 1). Manifesting these features grants her full access to her innate Nekomata abilities and Senjutsu potential.\n\n- Nekomata Mode Level 2: (Achieved during training in Volume 5, Life.3) A powered-up state achieved through intense Senjutsu training. In this mode, Koneko grows a second tail and cloaks herself in a powerful Touki aura, granting a temporary but explosive surge in power.\n\n- Shirone Mode: (Debuted in Volume 16, Life.3) An advanced transformation where Koneko utilizes ambient natural ki to temporarily mature her body into an adult form. This mode grants her complete access to her Nekomata powers, including Kasha, and embodies purification.\n\n- Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: (Volume 1 - Baseline skill; Defeated Xuelan in Volume 2, Life.4; Integrated Senjutsu post-Volume 5; Defeated Evil Dragons in Volume 16; Defeated Grendel clone in Volume 17, Fake Hero; Fought Kuroka e.g., Volume 5, Life.3 / Volume 11, Life.1) Koneko is an exceptionally skilled practitioner of close-quarters combat (Shown from Volume 1). She employs a versatile fighting style. Combined with her Rook-enhanced physicality, she proved capable of defeating trained opponents like Xuelan (Volume 2, Life.4). After embracing her Nekomata heritage and integrating Senjutsu into her combat style (Post-Volume 5 development), her physical attacks became even more dangerous. Continuous training allowed her to overcome formidable foes such as mass-produced Evil Dragons (Volume 16) and a powerful clone of the Evil Dragon Grendel (Volume 17, Fake Hero). She has also demonstrated the ability to fight on par with Kuroka (Various encounters, notably after accepting her power in Volume 5, Life.3 and later confrontations like Volume 11, Life.1).\n\n- Flight: (Volume 1) As a standard ability for all Devils, Koneko can manifest Devil wings, allowing her to fly freely (Shown from Volume 1).\n\nTRIVIA:\n- Koneko's birthday is November 23, according to the Sodom Press Data File on her.\n- Koneko's name translates to \"Kitten\" and \"little cat\", in reference to her being a Nekomata.\n- Koneko's real name, Shirone, means \"White Sound\", in reference to her hair and tail color.\n    - Koneko's last name, Toujou, means \"Castle\", in reference to her being a Rook (in chess, the rook piece is a castle's turret).\n    - She has the same last name as Sae \"Toujou\" from Slash/Dog.\n- In Rating Game fighting-types, Koneko is considered a Power-type.\n- Koneko plays the mascot character, \"Hellcat-chan\", in Breast Dragon Emperor Oppai Dragon.\n- Koneko has a broad range of interests which include anime, drama, music, and comedy shows.\n- Koneko loves rap music and is a fan of Salamander Tomita, who is a kappa rapper.\n- Koneko is one of the two servants of Rias who had been given a new name by the latter; the other one being Yuuto. (Koneko's renaming is part of her backstory revealed in Volume 5, Life.3. Yuuto's renaming is part of his backstory in Volume 3, Life.3.)\n- Koneko's name, along with the fact that she wears gloves with cat paw prints and is quite agile, were all allusions to her being a Nekomata before the fact was revealed. (Her true nature is revealed in Volume 5, Life.3.)\n- Koneko is the sixth to become engaged to Issei Hyoudou. (Engagement occurs in Volume 24, Life.5.)\n- She calls herself \"Daineko\" in her gender-swapped form.\n    - Daineko translates to \"big cat\" in reference to her being a large man when her gender was swapped in the short story \"Stop! Yuuto-kun!\"\n- Koneko likes to enjoy watching food reviews and game videos on DeviTube, as well as live streaming games.\n- Koneko's job requests as a Devil are mainly cosplay requests for photo shoots or playing games with her clients. (Mentioned in Volume 13, Extra Life.)\n        - The nature of her contract requests coincide with that of Asia Argento. (Mentioned in Volume 13, Extra Life.)\n        \n- According to a questionnaire:\n    - Koneko’s favorite type of man is one who is a very kind person.\n    - She's proud of her ears and tail because people say they are cute.\n    - Her special skill is eating a lot and not getting fat.\n    - She's not good at doing naughty things.\n    - If she didn't become a Devil, she would be living in an unpopular place somewhere.\n    - She likes going to cake shops.\n    - Her one wish is for her breasts to grow bigger. (A recurring desire mentioned humorously throughout the series, e.g., Volume 7 onwards.)\n    - She said about Issei not to be too picky and to please be kind to her forever.\n    - She starts bathing from her tail.\n    - She has white panties with a hole in for her tail.\n    - Her erogenous zone is her stomach.\n    - Her hobbies are collecting cat accessories and trying food at various restaurants.\n    - Her favorite thing is hot milk mugs.\n\n- Kuroka and Koneko's father was a Buddhist. Hence, both of their parent's souls are in the afterlife associated with Buddhism, and are subject under Great King Enma. (Mentioned in Volume 24, Life.3.)\n- In initial story draft, Koneko hated vampires, because one vampire from Khaos Brigade killed her family. Thus, Koneko had bad relations with Gasper. Issei had to reconcile them in Light Novel Volume 4."

          ],
          "content": "Appearance:\nAsia is a beautiful young girl with long blonde hair and green eyes. Her body measurements are B83→85-W55-H81→83 cm; her height is 155 cm 5 feet 1 inch and her body weight is 44→45 kg 97→98 lbs. Her hair flows all the way down to her back, with split bangs over her forehead and a single strand sticking out from the top and sloping backward. (Her initial appearance is described upon her introduction in Volume 1, Life.3.)\n\nHer former main attire consisted of a dark teal nun outfit with light blue accents, a white veil over her head with light blue accents, a brown satchel slung on her right hip (where she holds her Bible), and brown boots with black straps in an X-shaped pattern. (Her attire as a nun is described in Volume 1, Life.3.) She also wore a silver cross necklace around her neck (she was later forced to remove it after becoming a Devil). (The cross is mentioned in Volume 1, Life.3, and its removal upon reincarnation is implied/occurs off-screen before her reintroduction as a Devil in Volume 1, New Life.)\n\nUpon transferring to Kuoh Academy, she wears the Kuoh Academy girls' uniform, albeit with a black sweater vest over her dress shirt in place of the cape and corset which has become her current main attire. (Her school uniform is first seen when she transfers in Volume 2, Life.1.)\n\nPersonality:\nAsia is extremely shy, innocent and fairly inexperienced in things like socializing. (This is evident from her first interactions in Volume 1, Life.3 onwards.) As a former nun, Asia is a devout Christian, despite being reincarnated as a Devil, Asia still believes in God and follows his teachings such as praying to him and reading the Bible, which would usually result in her getting severe headaches. (Her continued faith and the resulting headaches are shown starting in Volume 2, Life.1.) Asia has a strong kindness, even when she was still a human, she harbored no hate towards Devils and treated everyone equally, regardless of what they were. (Her kindness towards Issei, a Devil at the time she met him, is shown in Volume 1, Life.3.) Azazel noted that her unconditionally kindhearted nature forces her Sacred Gear to heal even enemies, as she is incapable of turning a blind eye to the suffering of others. (Azazel comments on this aspect of her power, likely around Volume 4 or Volume 5 during discussions about Sacred Gears.) Asia was also in deep shock when she learned from Kokabiel that the God of the Bible was killed during the Great War. (Her reaction occurs during the Kokabiel incident in Volume 3, Life.4.)\n\nWhile initially having difficulty adjusting to her new life as a Devil, she has stated that she has found more important things than her faith in God, those things being her new friends, comrades as well as Issei's parents and Issei himself. (Her adjustment and shifting priorities are a gradual process, clearly articulated by Volume 4.)\n\nAsia is noted to be a very pure individual as people are drawn to her and that she is easily liked by others. (This trait is consistently demonstrated.) Her charm and purity is such as that she was able to tame Rassei, a Sprite Dragon despite being a Devil as normally Sprite Dragons aren't tamable by Devils and are only tamable by those with pure hearts. (Occurs during the Familiar arc in Volume 2, Life.3.) Azazel noted that she had outstanding talent for taming Dragons, as after receiving Ophis' blessing, she was able to form a contract with Fafnir, one of the Five Great Dragon Kings. (Ophis's blessing and the pact with Fafnir happen in Volume 12, Life.1.) After she managed to tame 4 mass-produced Evil Dragons, her name was spread in the world of Dragons due to the fact that only Evil Gods were able to tame Evil Dragons, as she became known as the Dragon Priestess (龍の巫女, Ryū no Miko) among Dragons. (Taming the Evil Dragons occurs in Volume 17, Life.4, her title spreads afterwards, noted in Volume 18, Life.2.)\n\nDue to having to give away her panties each time she wants to summon Fafnir, she has become very embarrassed due to seeing Fafnir eat her panties to the point of escaping from reality, lamenting that she has become associated with panties. (The panty requirement and her reaction begin with the Fafnir pact in Volume 12, Life.1 and become a running gag.) However, after seeing Fafnir's resolve to protect her against Rizevim, she has become a bit less embarrassed by it and can put her shame aside during battle when Fafnir is fighting for her intensely. (Her change in attitude during the Rizevim conflict occurs in Volume 20, Life.3.)\n\nAsia has a love of agricultural work as she often does gardening and planting. She has even stated that she would like to live with Issei in the country side of the Underworld and do cropping along with other kind of agricultural work.\n\nAsia would become more \"bold\" in her relationship with Issei when she saw the other girls being more intimate with him and dislikes the idea of being left out. (Her increasing boldness is a gradual development, noticeable from Volume 3 onwards as she competes for Issei's attention.) Due to Issei initially viewing her as more of a sister due to his desire to protect her, he didn't ogle her like he did other women, causing her to be sad and develop a bit of a inferiority complex when it comes to comparing her looks to the likes of Rias. (Issei's initial view and her resulting sadness are themes in early volumes, particularly Volume 3 and Volume 4.) However, she will get jealous and pinch his cheeks whenever he lusts over other girls. (A recurring reaction seen often.) She is shown to desire to be treated as a woman by Issei and to have his erotic behavior directed at her, as she has even shown a desire bear his children, though she ultimately succeeds in this endeavor after the Sports Festival when she kisses him, as following that point, Issei began to view her more as a woman than a little sister. (Her desire is expressed, and the turning point kiss occurs during the sports festival in Volume 14, Life.2.) Asia thinks very highly of Issei and has stated a desire to stay with Issei forever, even being willing to become his servant. (Her devotion is clear from Volume 1, New Life onwards.) Despite being shy, she is shown to be protective of Issei as she will slap someone like Diodora when they insult Issei. (She slaps Diodora in Volume 6, Life.4.)\n\nAfter becoming Issei's servant, she has begun to shown more courage and determination in battle, as demonstrated in the Rating Game against Team Rias Gremory, where Asia stayed behind to fight Crom Cruach alone to allow Xenovia and Irina to proceed ahead as well to preserve Issei stamina, with Crom Cruach admiring her courage and guts. (This occurs during the Azazel Cup in True High School DxD Volume 2, Middle Game.) During the fight, she even displayed the ability to use Magic offensively, in contrast to her past passive self, as she continued to fight Crom Cruach even after Fafnir was defeated, stating that as the servant and future wife of the Red Dragon Emperor, she would keep fighting until the end, which deeply impressed Crom Cruach as he praised her courage and spirit, stating that it was his honor to fight her and Fafnir. (Her actions and Crom Cruach's reaction in True High School DxD Volume 2, Middle Game.)\n\nHistory:\nIn the past, Asia was abandoned by her parents in front of a church as an infant and was raised there. Sometime, during her childhood, she had awakened her Twilight Healing to heal an injured puppy she discovered, which was witnessed by one of the Catholic Church members causing her to become symbolized as the Holy Maiden. But, in all that time she didn't have either friends or people to talk to since most people viewed her as a monster who could heal wounds. (Her backstory is revealed in Volume 1, Life.3.)\n\nAt some point, Diodora Astaroth devised a plot to have Asia heal him, a Devil, and cause her banishment from the Church with people labeling her as a \"witch\". With no place to go, Asia had to rely on the Fallen Angels. (Diodora's involvement in her exile is revealed later, confirmed in Volume 6, Life.4.)\n\nPowers & Abilities:\n- Demonic Power: As a Devil, Asia has all the common skills and powers of one, including the power to cast spells. (Standard Devil abilities apply post-reincarnation in Volume 1, New Life.)\n\n- Enhanced Magic Power: As a Bishop, Asia can strengthen her Magic and Demonic Powers, which she normally applies onto her Twilight Healing. (The function of the Bishop piece is explained around Volume 2.)\n\n- Magic Talent: As a Bishop, Asia has shown great potential in using magic as she was put in charge of forming a barrier by Freed. (Occurs during the Kokabiel incident in Volume 3, Life.4.) Asia is studying under Rossweisse in order to learn summoning and transport magic to help defend herself and increase her combat strength, she can also use Dragon Gate magic circle. (Training under Rossweisse begins after Rossweisse joins in Volume 7, Dragon Gate usage shown later, e.g., Volume 12.) Using her Bishop trait she can enhance her healing abilities with Twilight Saint Affection along with Fafnir's golden aura. (Synergy with Fafnir starts post-pact in Volume 12, Balance Breaker synergy later.)\n\n  - Summoning Magic: Asia is show to be very adept at summoning magic as she is capable of using it to summon various creatures to assist her and Dragon Gate magical circles to summon her guardian familiar; the Golden Dragon King Fafnir. (Summoning Fafnir begins Volume 12, Life.1.)\n  - Elemental Magic: Asia is capable of using elemental magic; such as fire and wind magic as demonstrated in her fight against Crom Cruach. (Occurs in True High School DxD Volume 2, Middle Game.)\n\n- Dragon Tamer: She's shown to have the talent of compatibility and outstanding luck with Dragons, as she made a pact with a baby Sprite Dragon, Rassei, whose race is notoriously untamable. (Occurs in Volume 2, Life.3.) After receiving Ophis' blessing, her compatibility increased, and she made a pact with one of the Five Dragon Kings; Fafnir. (Occurs in Volume 12, Life.1.) Asia was able to make a pact with four mass-produced Evil Dragons who were named Anselmus, Cyril, Gregorios and Simeon, which is an act that only Evil Gods were able to do before. (Occurs in Volume 17, Life.4.)\n\n- Praying: Asia is one of the two Devils, the other being Xenovia, that can pray to God without receiving damage in the form of a headache after Issei made a request to Michael to allow them to pray to God. (Request made in Volume 3, Life.5, ability confirmed later, e.g., Volume 4.)\n\n- Flight: Being a Devil, Asia can use her wings to fly. (Standard ability post-reincarnation.)\n\nEquipment:\n- Twilight Healing (聖母の微笑, Towairaito Hīringu): Asia's Sacred Gear and her main weapon of choice, she can heal Humans, Devils, Angels, and Fallen Angels alike. (Introduced and demonstrated in Volume 1, Life.3.) Since she has shown no actual combat skills, she relies on her healing abilities as a healer of her team. Asia learned how to expand the range of her healing field and send her healing powers as a projectile, although these are inferior to actual touch. (Range expansion likely developed during training arcs, e.g., between Volume 4-5.) In Volume 11, Azazel has said that she mastered her Twilight Healing more than other possessors in healing powers and time. (Azazel's comment in Volume 11.) She can also create a bow and arrow of healing power, and if the arrow is about to hit an enemy, it will disperse instead of healing them. (Healing arrow technique likely developed later, possibly around Volume 16 or later.)\n\n    - Twilight Saint Affection (聖龍姫が抱く慈愛の園, Towairaito Seinto Afekushon): Asia's sub-species Balance Breaker. Asia's Balance Breaker takes the form of a Golden Dragon Armor with red jewels that cover her body and grants her a field of absolute defence and protection. For a limited time, Asia can cover a field with tremendous healing energy and can negate any damage from virtually any sources. It does not negate the attack but rather it negates the damage that the attack would inflict. As Fafnir's aura is included as well, it also boasts immense defence on top of the healing ability. Asia can also used it to heal numerous allies at once on a wide range, using it to heal the allied youkais during the Evil Dragon War. (Balance Breaker achieved and used during the Evil Dragon War, Volume 21, Life.3.)\n\n- Bishop Piece (僧侶の駒, Sōryo no Koma): Asia was reincarnated using the Bishop Piece, which grants her enhanced magic power. (Reincarnation occurs off-screen between Volume 1, Life.4 and Volume 1, New Life.)\n\n- Dragons: Asia had made a pact with Dragons. With the help of Ophis' blessing, Azazel, Rias, Rossweisse, and Akeno, she can make pacts with various classes of Dragons, even higher classes, especially Fafnir the Golden Dragon King. She uses Fafnir and the other four Evil Dragons (that she tamed using Fafnir's skills) to protect herself in order for her to heal her comrades. (Pacts made in Volume 2, Volume 12, Volume 17.)\n\nTRIVIA:\n- Asia's birthday is on May 11.\n- Asia Argento is named after the famous Italian actress of the same name, daughter of horror director Dario Argento, who is known to have played a number of roles as a nun.\n    - Asia's last name is also the Italian word for \"Silver\", in reference to the silver cross she once wore prior to being revived into a Devil. Silver crosses are common among the Catholic clergy, particularly exorcists.\n\n- Asia's breasts have grown to be nearly the same size as Xenovia's and Irina's. According to Ravel, this is due to a combination of devil physiology, demonic power and Asia's own desires for Issei to see her as attractive. (Breast growth discussion occurs in Volume 23, Life.1.)\n- Asia is the third girl to become engaged to Issei Hyoudou. (Engagement occurs in Volume 23, New Life.)\n- Asia wants to have her wedding take place in Japan. (Mentioned in Volume 24, Life.1.)\n\n- According to a questionnaire:\n  - Her favorite type of man is Issei.\n  - She's proud of her eyes because Issei says they're beautiful.\n  - Her special skill is being able to recite the Bible and scriptures.\n  - If she didn't become a Devil she would have continued being a Sister.\n  - She likes to go to home improvement stores and 100 yen stores with everyone and she never gets tired of all the products she finds unusual.\n  - Her one wish, is to travel to various places in Japan, because she wants to learn more about it.\n  - She's thankful to the Occult Research Club members for always being so friendly with her.\n  - She loves Issei and will always be there for him.\n  - She begins bathing from her hands.\n  - She has pink, transparent underwear gifted from Kiryuu.\n  - Her erogenous zone is around her collarbone.\n  - Her hobbies are praying and collecting shoujo manga.\n  - Her favorite thing is having a matching umbrella with Issei.\n\n- Asia has stated to want five children.\n- Asia has a hobby for farming and one of her dreams for the future is to engage in agricultural work with Issei in the Underworld.\n  - She also harbours a dream to live in a countryside in the Underworld at a point. (Mentioned in Volume 17, Life 2.)\n\n- Interestingly, Asia's four Evil Dragons Anselmus, Cyril, Gregorios, and Simeon are all names of religious figures.\n- In Rating Game fighting-types, Asia is considered a Support-type who is closer to a Wizard-type.\n- Asia first noticed that Issei's request to Michael for her and Xenovia to be able to pray was granted during a date with Issei.\n- During her \"date\" with Issei in Volume 1, Asia gained a yellow mouse plush doll she named \"Racchuu-kun\" that resembles Pikachu from Pokemon. (Occurs in Volume 1, Life.3.)\n- Asia's first-ever meeting with Issei may have been foreshadowing to the relationship between Cleria Belial and Masaomi Yaegaki, as at first, Asia and Issei similarly to Cleria and Masaomi, were forbidden from seeing each other in the same town; Kuoh Town due to the Devil's side and Angel's side still at feuds with each other. (Initial restrictions mentioned in Volume 1, Life.3.)\n- Asia, alongside Akeno, have the most familiars in the series with both having six each. (Rassei, Fafnir, 4 Evil Dragons = 6).\n- Asia's job requests as a Devil are usually cosplay requests for photo shoots and playing games. (Mentioned in Volume 13, Extra Life.)\n  - The nature of her contract requests coincide with that of Koneko Toujou. (Mentioned in Volume 13, Extra Life.)\n\n- Asia alongside Xenovia, make videos giving expository about Japan's daily school life from a foreigner’s perspective and upload them to DeviTube. Irina is sometimes called in as a guest to which the trio became a popular streaming group.\n- Asia learned how to ride a bicycle because she wanted to ride with Issei to go on a picnic, as well as ride with Xenovia, Irina and Aika to go shopping.\n- There's a jinx that all the villains who have hurt Asia have suffered brutal ends and were killed, no matter the series. These antagonists includes Raynare (Killed Volume 1, New Life), Freed (Killed Volume 3, Life.5), Diodora (Killed Volume 6, Life.5), and Rizevim (Killed Volume 21, Life.3)."

His hair is styled in short bob cut with several small fringes over his forehead, and he has pointed ears. Kiba describes him as looking like a beautiful girl.\n\nOriginally a coward and a shut-in with a very shy personality, Gasper likes to wear female clothing, claiming that girls' clothes are cute. He also has a penchant for boxes, carrying one with him all the time.\n\nGasper was born between the Vampire Lord Vladi and a human mother; the latter of whom died shortly after giving birth to Gasper, who was born as a mass of darkness which accidentally cursed his mother and several servants to death. Between the incredible fear of Gasper's true form from the higher ups, his uncontrollable Sacred Gear, Forbidden Balor View, and people's general prejudice towards the half-breed, Gasper grew up in isolation and abuse.\n\nHe would meet Valerie Tepes and they would often play together; Valerie forcing Gasper to dress up as a girl which would lead to his cross-dressing habit. One day, Gasper worked up the courage to try to escape from the castle with Valerie's help and was shortly thereafter killed by Vampire hunters. Rias Gremory, who was in the area at the time, came upon the boy by chance and taking pity on him reincarnated him as one of her servants.\n\nGasper usually does his work from his computer where he interacts with people who are bad at interacting with others but have a wish that they want to be granted by a Devil."

This attire is worn under a white hooded cloak with gold and blue accents. She also wears a crucifix around her neck, which was later removed after becoming a Devil.\n\nWhen Xenovia was first introduced, she was shown to have a calm, quiet, and serious demeanor, putting her mission first and only speaking when necessary. She was also very cold, bordering on heartless, as she called Asia a witch for becoming a Devil (even though she became one unwillingly so she could be with Issei) and even went so far as to try and kill her. She later threatened to do the same to Kiba when he was technically a Stray. After being reborn as a Devil, however, she gains a very close relationship with Asia, being touched by her kindness and apologizes for calling her a witch when they first met.\n\nIn battle, Xenovia appears to be a bit arrogant, and stubborn.\n\nXenovia mostly receives jobs that involve physical work, such as helping out in construction work or being a practice partner for various sports."

          "content": "Appearance: Ruby is a fair-skinned girl with silver eyes and neck-length black hair with red tips. Her Beacon Academy uniform consists of a black dress with a high-collared blouse with red-trimmed sleeves, a waist cincher with red lacing, and a skirt with red lining and a red petticoat. She wears black tights that fade to red, black combat boots with red laces, and a red hooded cloak held by cross-shaped pins. Her outfit includes a black belt with a silver emblem, a pocket, and a row of bullets.\n\nPersonality: Ruby has a romanticized view of being a Huntress, inspired by fairy tales and heroes, and she prioritizes others' well-being over her own emotions. She's straightforward and often misses social cues, especially sarcasm, due to her open nature. A self-proclaimed \"dork\" about weapons, she designed Crescent Rose and is highly intelligent, though sometimes \"overboard\" in her creations. Ruby has a strong sense of moral justice, influenced by stories from her childhood and her parents' teachings. Though she dislikes attention, she still strives to be a Huntress, despite her preference for solitude or being with her sister, Yang. Ruby's childish and sometimes blunt nature makes her struggle with new people, but her enthusiastic personality helps her form close friendships with those who share her interests.\n\nAbilities: Ruby trained at Signal Academy, where her skills exceeded those of her peers, especially with Crescent Rose, which requires strength and adaptability. She gained attention after stopping a robbery at a Dust shop, earning her early acceptance into Beacon Academy. At Beacon, she developed as a decisive leader, coordinating attacks against tough enemies like the Nevermore and Roman's Paladin-290. Ruby's greatest strength lies in her ability to inspire hope, rallying others with her words and actions. She excels in balancing herself in tough situations and possesses impressive physical strength for her size, demonstrated when she dragged a giant Nevermore up a cliff. Her fighting style is dynamic, relying on momentum, her Semblance, and Crescent Rose's recoil to deliver powerful blows and create slipstreams or whirlwinds. In close combat, she overwhelms opponents with rapid slashes. Ruby is also a skilled seamstress, having made her own outfit.\n\nWeapon: Ruby's weapon of choice is Crescent Rose. Ruby is self-admittedly obsessed when it comes to weapons, which shows in her complex design and craftsmanship of her weapon, a High-Caliber Sniper-Scythe which she designed herself at Signal, as well as her eye for detail when observing other people's weapons and tools. This weapon can transform between a scythe and a sniper rifle and can fire Dust rounds in either form with massive force. Ruby has proven to have excellent marksmanship.\n\nSemblance: Ruby's Semblance, Petal Burst, allows her to dash with an inhuman speed in whatever direction she chooses, often leaving trails of rose petals in her wake. Ruby is capable of creating powerful tailwinds with her Semblance; if she gathers enough momentum, the resulting turbulence is capable of lifting people off the ground.\n\nWeakness: Ruby is heavily reliant on Crescent Rose. In contrast to her sister, her hand-to-hand capabilities were rather poor, making her easy to be taken down by mere grunts when unarmed. Without her weapon, there is not much she could do in a fight, and her best bet is to run away with her speed. Her cape, on occasion, has been exploited and used against her, notably during the Beacon initiation when a Nevermore pinned her cape to the ground with its feather-spears."

          "content": "Appearance: Yang is a tall, fair-skinned young woman with lilac eyes and long golden hair that glows fiery when her Semblance activates. She wears a tan midriff-baring jacket over a yellow crop top with her emblem, along with a brown belt, pleated waist covering, and an asymmetrical white cloth. Her outfit includes black shorts, orange over-the-knee socks, brown knee-high boots, a purple bandanna on her left knee, an orange scarf, and black fingerless gloves.\n\nPersonality: Yang is a confident, straightforward, and adventurous young woman, often described as someone who would \"teach by pushing you in.\" She is cheerful, sociable, and fond of joking even in battle, with her love of adventure driving her to become a Huntress. Her fighting style mirrors her personality—fiery and brawler-like—relying heavily on her anger, which can make her predictable. She is very protective of her hair, though she allows Ruby to play with it. Despite her carefree nature, Yang is mature and nurturing, especially toward Ruby, often acting motherly and protective. She extends this care to her teammates, particularly Blake, though she secretly struggles with abandonment issues tied to her mother. Clever and playful, she enjoys tricking others, whether in games or casual interactions.\n\nAbilities: Yang’s fighting style is aggressive and resembles Muay Thai, enhanced by her weapon, Ember Celica. She is highly agile and the physically strongest on her team, capable of feats like sending a man flying with a punch or holding a Nevermore’s jaws open. With her Aura unlocked, she has exceptional durability, allowing her to withstand heavy attacks and keep fighting, as shown in the Vytal Tournament. Her Semblance lets her absorb damage and strike back with greater power, though she tends to rely on it too much, a flaw noted by her father.\n\nWeapons: Yang wields Ember Celica, a pair of gauntlets that retract into bracelets. She combines punches with explosive blasts for close to mid-range attacks, using the weapon’s recoil to boost her strength, speed, and mobility while also reloading the gauntlets. Ember Celica also serves as armor for defense in unarmed combat.\n\nSemblance: Yang’s Semblance, *Burn*, allows her to absorb kinetic energy from attacks and redirect it with doubled force. When activated, her eyes turn red and her hair glows, sometimes igniting in flames. While anger doesn’t trigger the ability, it can cause her to use it impulsively. She typically relies on her Semblance to end fights after taking enough hits to overwhelm her opponent.\n\nWeakness: Yang’s Semblance, while powerful, has key weaknesses. She still takes damage when powering it up, and overusing it can deplete her Aura, leaving her vulnerable. Activating it too early also weakens her defenses. Skilled opponents can exploit her frustration, especially dodgers like Neo, who make her attacks predictable. Her barehanded style limits her reach, putting her at a disadvantage against agile or kick-focused fighters, though she has adapted over time. Additionally, her emotions can trigger her Semblance unintentionally. As her father Taiyang notes, it can become a liability if opponents evade or outlast her enhanced attacks, leaving her exhausted and exposed."

          ],
          "content": "Appearance: Weiss is a pale-skinned young woman with pale blue eyes, long white hair often tied in an off-center ponytail or braid, and a scar over her left eye from fighting an Arma Gigas. She is 4'11\" (5'3\" in heels) and wears a white-to-pale-blue strapless dress with snowflake-like stitching, layered tulle, and a matching bolero with red lining, ruffled collar, and the Schnee Crest on the back. Her look is completed with white wedge-heeled boots, a white sash with a pouch, silver earrings, an apple pendant, and an icicle-shaped tiara pinning her hair.\n\nPersonality: Weiss grew up in a strict, controlled environment, leaving her both rebellious and lonely, which shaped her cold and prickly personality. She takes pride in the Schnee name but resents her father’s attitude and the strain caused by constant White Fang attacks. Though often seen as arrogant, irritable, and a \"know-it-all,\" she is also diligent, serious, and tactical, taking her studies and Huntsman training more seriously than her teammates. Over time, Weiss warms up to others, becoming more compassionate and trusting while still retaining her sharp edge. She gradually develops a humorous and whimsical side, participating in team activities and even attempting jokes. Determined to redeem her family’s reputation, Weiss vows to restore honor to the Schnee name by becoming a Huntress and putting others’ needs before her own, ultimately breaking free from her father’s control to find her true self.\n\nAbilities: As the heiress of the Schnee Dust Company, Weiss was trained from childhood to excel, becoming a top-ranking fighter by the Vytal Festival. Her combat style blends fencing and ballet, relying on speed, grace, and precision rather than aggression. She uses her Glyph-based Semblance for offense, defense, support, and mobility, often ricocheting around the battlefield. Skilled with Ice Dust, she also shows adaptability, briefly using guns and dual-wielding with Myrtenaster and Gambol Shroud. Weiss has some medical knowledge, as seen when tending to Nora, and though Ruby usually leads, she is capable of creating effective strategies herself.\n\nDust Usage: Most notably, Weiss frequently utilizes Dust in battle. She has shown a preference for Ice Dust, only switching types if it provides her with an advantage, such as using Wind Dust against sonic-based attacks or creating certain types of glyphs such as black or time dilation glyphs. She has used Ice Dust to trap enemies, create a trail to push enemies from a height, create a slippery sheet of ice and form pointed ice chunks to use as projectiles.\n\nWeapon: Weiss wields Myrtenaster, a Multi-Action Dust Rapier with a six-slot revolving chamber holding different Dust types. She uses Dust both directly and with her Semblance to create versatile effects in battle. When not channeling Dust, she relies on her speed and precision, striking with quick thrusts that leave opponents little chance to counter.\n\nSemblance: Weiss has the Schnee family Semblance of Glyphs, allowing her to create glyphs that can be used in a variety of ways: create a slippery platform to skate on at high speed, generate midair platforms to manipulate her trajectory in the air and perform limited time dilation that can speed up actions to name a few.\n\nWeaknesses: Weiss has low endurance and stamina, often tiring quickly compared to her teammates, as seen when she struggled to keep up with Ruby in the Emerald Forest. She is also the physically weakest on her team, frequently being knocked out in battles or skirmishes. Additionally, while her Glyphs offer defense, they are not unbreakable and can be shattered under enough force."

          "content": "Appearance: Blake is a fair-skinned young woman with wavy black hair, amber eyes, and black cat ears as her Faunus trait. At Beacon, she wears a black vest with coattails over a white sleeveless crop top and tight white shorts with zippers. Her outfit includes black-to-purple stockings, low-heeled boots, a detached sleeve on her left arm, ribbon wraps on her forearms, and a loose black scarf. She carries a gray magnetic backpack for her weapon, usually hidden by her hair. A black ribbon with a bow conceals her cat ears, and she wears purple cat-eye style eyeshadow.\n\nPersonality: Blake is mellow, reserved, and serious, with a dry sense of humor and strong sense of justice, especially against prejudice toward Faunus. An introvert, she often distances herself with books but becomes passionate when discussing Faunus struggles. Her past with the White Fang left her with trust issues, self-loathing, and a tendency to avoid conflict, though she left after rejecting their violence under Adam. At Beacon, she slowly opens up, becoming more trusting and fun with her teammates. She hides her cat ears under a bow around Humans, and shows catlike traits such as climbing and chasing lasers, and a fondness for tuna.\n\nAbilities: Blake is highly agile, fast, and enduring, able to fight multiple enemies without tiring. Skilled with Gambol Shroud, she strikes with great speed, deflects gunfire, and uses her reflexes to dodge attacks, even at point-blank range. Her fighting style emphasizes evasion and counterattacks, supported by her ability to leap across buildings and moving vehicles. As a Faunus, she has night vision and enhanced hearing, which give her an edge in combat. She also demonstrates Aura control, using Gambol Shroud to release crescent slashes capable of cutting through missiles and heavy machinery.\n\nWeapon: Blake's weapon of choice is Gambol Shroud, a sword that has three forms. When sheathed, the weapon is able to slice opponents in two with its cleaver-like cover. However, when unsheathed, Blake is able to use both a sword and sheath in tandem against her opponents. It can also transform into a gun. Using the black ribbon that extends off the weapon's grip, Blake can convert Gambol Shroud into a kusarigama, a grappling hook to swing herself or her friends, or ensnare or tangle her opponents.\n\nSemblance: Blake’s Semblance, Shadow, lets her create shadow-clones that push her in chosen directions and confuse opponents. Using Dust, she can enhance her clones with elemental effects: Fire Dust creates exploding clones, Ice Dust forms solid ice copies that can trap weapons, Earth Dust makes stone clones, and Lightning Dust allows rapid repositioning.\n\nWeaknesses: Blake’s main weaknesses lie in her weapon and Semblance. When using Gambol Shroud as a kusarigama, disrupting its trajectory or cutting its ribbon can make her lose momentum or fall. Additionally, some Dust-enhanced clones from her Semblance can backfire, such as when an Ice Dust clone was used to knock her aside in battle."

While he would later joke about the hardships of his childhood, he did state seriously that \"family\" was an \"f-word\" for him; his father had left a bad impression before \"bailing\" on him when he was young. During his childhood, Wade spent time in an orphanage. He eventually joined the Canadian military, becoming a Special Forces operative.\n\nDuring his time in the military, Wade visited Jacksonville, Florida and met a man named Bob while eating at T.G.I. Friday's. The two would become close friends, with Wade visiting Bob and his family for a chance to eat the famous tuna casserole made by Bob's wife Gale.\n\nEventually, Wade was dishonorably discharged. Some time afterwards, Wade moved to New York City, and became a mercenary-for-hire, where he befriended a bartender named Weasel.[2]\n\nMerc for Hire\nOne day, Wade takes a job from a teenage girl named Megan to get a pizza delivery boy named Jeremy to stop stalking her. Once the job is done, Wade informs Megan, who hugs them and calls him her hero, to which Wade quickly points out that's something he is not.[2]"

Wade approaches the man, who introduces himself as The Recruiter. He tells Wade that he works for a facility that will not only cure him of his cancer but also give him incredible powers. The Recruiter offered Wade the chance to join the program that would presumably cure his disease, but Wade is hesitant and declines, but he takes the card that The Recruiter gives him and leaves.[2]\nDesperate to live and despite initially declining, Wade later reconsiders, made a choice to be cured for Vanessa, and leaves her alone in the middle of the night to undergo the procedure. He goes to the facility where he meets Ajax for the first time, along with his cohort Angel Dust. Ajax injects Wade with a special serum that activates any dormant mutant genes in him, the mutations being meant to turn him into a superhuman to heal him from his cancer, but says that for it to work and because adrenaline is the serums catalyst, they have to subject him to extreme stress for the mutation to occur. However, if there were no mutant genes in him to activate, the torture would eventually kill him. Wade undergoes various torture techniques carried out by Angel Dust to trigger a mutation\nAfter days of torture and no success, Wade eventually learns that Ajax's real name was Francis, and makes fun of the man. After Wade insulted Ajax about his real name, Ajax straps Wade down and places him inside an airtight chamber where the oxygen is cut off. Ajax then reveals that the program wasn't intended to turn Wade into a super-powered individual, but as a super slave, where he would be auctioned off somewhere to become an assassin.\n\nDuring his time in the chamber, the drop in oxygen triggers a regenerative healing factor that cures his cancer. Unfortunately, Wade's cancer cells were further enhanced, severely disfiguring his entire body in the process as his skin and face started to blotch up. The next day, Ajax opens the chamber and tells Wade his cancer is gone. Upon being released, Wade would curse at Ajax for his hideous form and headbutts Angel Dust, stealing a match from that she keeps in her mouth in the process. Upon being sealed in the chamber once again, Wade took the match out and struck it, throwing it near the oxygen vent, thus generating a massive explosion that destroyed his confinement and the laboratory.\n\nAjax goes down to see what happened, and Wade starts to fight with his increased strength and attempts to kill him. Wade stops, however when he learns from his enemy that there was a cure for his disfigured form, as Ajax claimed he's the only one that can cure him. Ajax gets the upper hand and overpowers Wade, impaling him with a bar, which he leaves bent. Ajax then asks Wade what's his name to no response, and leaves Wade for dead. As Wade sat impaled, Cunningham called out to him, and they exchanged eye contact in each last time, as the facility collapsed from the explosion Wade had started and crumbled around him, and killing Cunningham and anyone else that didn't escape.[2\nDeadpool was injected with a serum that activated any mutant genes lurking around in his DNA, and was subjected to extreme stress for it to work. Adrenaline acted as a catalyst for the serum, so he had to suffer for his mutant genes to activate and manifest. After months of being subjected to various forms of torture, his stress levels were raised high enough to trigger a mutation, and now his mutated cells can heal anything. Wade said he got the cure to everything and Francis said he apparently made him immortal.\nRegenerative Healing Factor: After being injected with a serum to evolve further his mutant genes, which was fully triggered by extreme stress, his body was enhanced, granting him rapid cellular regeneration, enabling him to quickly heal from any injury, even able to regrow entire lost anatomy. Minor injuries, like bullet wounds and broken bones, take mere minutes to recover. While full dismemberment takes hours to restore, which goes through a period of accelerated maturing, starting as an infant-like limb before becoming fully grown. Even more, his healing powers leave him immune to any form of illness and contaminate, able to even cure himself of cancer that was previously ravaging his body. Getting stabbed in the head only momentarily left him dazed and hallucinating."

          "content": "Wade possesses a highly sarcastic and great sense of humor that irritates and annoys most of his enemies. He regularly insults and belittles his enemies for his own amusement. He also feels no shame and can make a joke out of any situation, even one that is not at all in his favor. As an example, even after being tortured by Ajax and Angel Dust for months, he was able to keep his sense of humor alive. Only a few select people, such as Vanessa, can withstand his seemingly never-ending inability to stop talking.\n\nHe loves cartoons, potty humor, Skee-Ball, classical music, television shows, rap music, and American pop culture. His favorite band is Wham! and George Michael, and he particularly loves the song \"Careless Whisper.\" He remains very movie-cultured, referencing The Matrix, RoboCop, Alien 3, Yentl, 127 Hours, Cocoon, X-Men: Days of Future Past and Star Wars. Wade himself is also aware that he is a fictional character in a movie and belittles this by often breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the audience.\n\nDespite his initial immaturity, Wade is a genuine, soft, and good-hearted man and in time, becomes a very moral and heroic person to the point of sacrificing himself to save Russell. Although he is a mercenary, he agreed to scare off a young girl's stalker without being paid for his troubles, revealing he can be affectionate. On matters of love, he can be surprisingly sensitive, having been forced to abandon his girlfriend, Vanessa due to his terminal cancer, he advised his taxi driver, Dopinder to fight for the object of his affections, Gita. While talking with Vanessa, he revealed that his father was less than a model and that Wade was seriously afraid of becoming like him. This worried him about having children with Vanessa; however, she reassured him that he would be a great father and nothing like his dad.\n\nAfter Vanessa’s death, Wade developed a suicidal nature, yet his inability to die increased the decay of his already fractured psyche that enhanced the seriousness and tragedy of his character even though his wise-cracking quality is more predominant. He was content to die of cancer in the Icebox until he re-found a purpose by protecting Russell from Cable - believing this is where he needed to be and be reunited with Vanessa. After his near-death experience, this trait has died down, but he had not accepted her demise, so Wade irresponsibly uses Cable’s time travel device to save her.\n\nHis relationship with the X-Men is very mixed. Mostly Wade considers their do-gooding nature and abiding by rules extremely tiresome, yet he pondered joining them after Vanessa’s death until he grew sick of the restraints of the team. Ultimately, as annoying as he found Colossus’ morality and annoying to make him a better person, Wade considered him a friend. Wade also affected Colossus by encouraging him to behave more dubiously, such as during his fight with Juggernaut and even curse. Wade has a brother-like relationship with Negasonic Teenage Warhead because of his enjoyment to annoy her, though Negasonic considers him “cool” she also is exasperated by his personality. In contrast, Wade has shown fondness towards Negasonic’s girlfriend, Yukio, as she seems to be the only person he does not mock or intentionally annoys, which is mutual. The only X-Men member Wade actively respects seems to be Wolverine, which borders on sexual advances and even love though he was presumably joking."

Even more, his healing powers leave him immune to any form of illness and contaminate, able to even cure himself of cancer that was previously ravaging his body. Getting stabbed in the head only momentarily left him dazed and hallucinating.Immortality: Due to his regenerative capabilities, Wade is immune to physical age. He is also virtually impossible to kill and cannot be infected by any kind of disease.\nSuperhuman Strength: Wade's strength is well-above the parameters of the normal human. With his kicks, he can launch a full-grown man of considerable weight several meters away and likewise trade blows of against foes of considerable strength. His raw strength can also shove a man high into the air casually lift them high above his head. He was able to push one of his swords through solid concrete behind Ajax's shoulder.\nSuperhuman Durability: Wade's durability and endurance have been enhanced to superhuman levels, able to trade blows with exceptional strong foes, even harming the inhumanly strong Angel Dust. He also was unfazed when he crashed through a car's glass roof from a highway several miles above it. This also grants him an enhanced tolerance to pain, making it hard to slow him down, to which even then he can quickly rebind, letting him continuously fight at full strength. For a more desperate situation, he is even willing to cut off his limb to escape.\nSuperhuman Speed: Wade possesses speed superior to that of even the finest human athlete. He is capable of moving fast enough to easily outmaneuver rapid gunfire. Confined spaces could not limit his movement at all, allowing him to overpower and kill multiple attackers after landing in their car.\nSuperhuman Agility: Wilson's flexibility, balance, dexterity, and coordination are well-beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete. He has inhuman leaping capabilities, able to could jump several feet from a stationary position, and with his body control, able to execute a variety of complex twists, turns, and flips while in mid-air.\nSuperhuman Stamina: Wade's body produces from little to no fatigue poisons. This allows him to exert himself at peak capacity for as long as he desires.Superhuman Reflexes: Wade is very alert and fast-reacting, able to dodge and deflect bullets without much effort. He can react to multiple opponents simultaneously, even from behind to quickly counter. During his duel with Francis, Wade easily caught an axe thrown at him at high speeds.\nSuperhuman Senses: Wade sensed a man was about to break into his and Vanessa's apartment.Medium Awareness: Wade seems to be afflicted by what is commonly known as the Truman syndrome, a type of delusion in which the person believes that their lives are staged and that they are constantly being watched on cameras. Wade believes that he is a fictional character in a movie, allowing him to break the fourth wall to address and share his thoughts with the audience watching his adventures.\nPrecognition: By extension of his awareness that he is a fictional character, Wade is also aware of future events, such as Wolverine's death, which takes place 11 years after he announced that he knew about it.Wade spent a decade as a soldier in the Special Forces. According to The Recruiter, he was \"a fighter\" and an \"extraordinary\" soldier with 41 confirmed kills (one every seven weeks, more than five years).Master Marksman: Wade is highly proficient with firearms, as he is able to accurately hit his targets without needing much time to aim his guns. He was able to land two headshots as he twisted through the air, shot a grenade before a man could throw it, and used one bullet to shoot three men standing in a line in the head, although the third man survived because the bullet lost its momentum. He also shot Ajax and Daniel Frye in the head. Wade is also skilled at throwing objects, displayed when he played skee-ball with Vanessa; he threw a ball directly into a hole, instead of rolling it. He can accurately throw his katanas, such as when he threw one into Francis' motorcycle wheel while jumping through the air, when he threw one into Vanessa's air pressure coffin, and when he threw one at Firefist but made the handle hit him in the forehead. He also threw a hubcap like a frisbee at Francis' head.\nMaster Martial Artist: Wilson is also heavily skilled in melee and unarmed combat, able to overpower and kill several armed men after crashing into their car. He can take on very skilled opponents such as Ajax and Cable. Deadpool's fighting style includes techniques from Taekwondo and Boxing.[6] He can also improvise weapons in battle, as he used a simple brick against the Headmaster's henchmen.\nWilson's signature weapons are his dual katana blades, which, combined with his speed, agility and natural combat abilities, make two of his most highly efficient weapons. His swords allow him to cut through several trained shooters with ease. His fighting style resembles Niten Ichi-ryū. He is also adept at throwing his swords; he threw one into the front wheel of Francis' motorcycle to make him crash, and he also threw one to knock down Firefist by hitting him in the head with the handle.\nKnife Mastery: Wilson is highly skilled with using knives in combat, whether it be up close or thrown. He accurately threw a knife into a photo of Francis. He was also shown to be able to throw a knife into a gunman's eye from several feet while running. He later threw a cream cheese spreader into Sergei Valishnikov's forehead.\nMaster Acrobat: His enhanced reflexes and agility make him highly evasive and mobile in battle. Able to scale seemingly any terrain with no wasted timing or movement, his prowess outmatches some of the most accomplished circus aerialists and acrobats. Using a variety of free-running and parkour maneuvers, he is challenging to anticipate with his erratic and spontaneous movement.Master Assassin: Wilson, even before his mutation, is an infamous but extremely skilled mercenary. He has killed people in Baghdad, Mogadishu, and Jacksonville. Each contract he was given, he has successfully killed his targets. When he was in the Special Forces, he had 41 confirmed kills. Following his transformation and during his search for Francis until he reunited with the recruiter, he killed 48 more people and continued to slay his enemies.\nExpert Tracker: Despite his crude and reckless methods, Wilson is shown to be very efficient in information gathering due to his career as a seasoned mercenary. Hence, he easily found Jeremy and warned him to stay away from Megan. For two years, he was able to track down Ajax's location through a network of sources.Bilingualism: In sticking with his talkative nature, Wade is proven to be fluent in speaking a variety of languages, such as English and Spanish. In Hong Kong, he mentioned that he took eighth grade Spanish, and he spoke bits of the language throughout his career."

          "content": "Wade Wilson ambushes Ajax and a convoy of his men on an expressway. Throughout the ambush, Wilson shows the viewer the events leading to how he became Deadpool.\n\n2 years ago, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a former special forces operative who works as a mercenary in New York City. Wilson was dishonorably discharged as a Canadian special forces operative. He meets escort Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin) at a local bar run by his friend Weasel, and they become romantically attached. Vanessa is a hooker and they both connect by competing to see who got the worse childhood. Wade hires Vanessa as a prostitute, but then takes her to a fair to spend time with her. Later that night, they have sex. One year later, Wade proposes to her, and she accepts, but he suddenly collapses. Wade is diagnosed with terminal cancer in his lungs and though Vanessa remains by his side, he does not want her to watch him die.\n\nA recruiter (Jed Rees) from a secret program approaches Wade, offering an experimental cure for his cancer. The recruiter offers to give Wade powers that nobody else has, and to make him into a superhero. Although Wade initially refuses, he decides to leave Vanessa and undergo the procedure. At a laboratory, Wade meets Ajax (Ed Skrein) and Angel Dust (Gina Carano), whom he instantly resents. Wade sees many such terminal patients at the lab, who have been experimented upon with varying results and different mutations. Ajax reveals that his lab is privately funded and not under any sort of Government jurisdiction. Ajax and Angel were patients as well.\n\nAjax injects Wade with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. The serum reacts differently with everybody. With Ajax, it gave him enhanced reflexes and scorched nerve endings which means that he does not feel any pain. Then Ajax has him subjected to days of torture (with a new method of torture each day, each more painful than the last one) to induce stress and trigger the mutation, but without success. Wade discovers Ajax's real name, Francis Freeman, and mocks him for it.\n\nIn response, Ajax straps Wade into an airtight chamber which raises and lowers the oxygen level to keep Wade constantly on the verge of asphyxiation - leaving him over the weekend but not before Ajax reveals to Wade their true purpose: to make super-powered slaves to be sold to wealthy customers. While inside the chamber, Wade develops a healing factor that cures his cancer but leaves him severely disfigured as a side-effect with tumor-like scars over his entire body. Wade escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured, and he is the only one who can fix it for Wade. Ajax subdues Wade, impales him with a re-bar and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory. By the next morning, the lab is destroyed, but Wade survived due to his healing abilities.\n\nWilson survives due to his new healing abilities and attempts to return to Vanessa, but is afraid of her suffering because of his appearance, and stays away from her. After consulting his best friend Weasel (T. J. Miller), Wade decides to hunt down Ajax and have his disfigurement cured. He becomes a masked vigilante, takes the alias \"Deadpool\" (from Weasel picking him in a dead pool, which is basically a bar bet with odds on favorite for being most likely to be killed that day. Weasel always bet on Wade, and always lost), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Blind Al (Leslie Uggams). Deadpool chooses a red color costume, based on Al's suggestion, so that his enemies cannot see him bleed and has a deadpan sense of humor.\n\nOver the course of the next year, he questions and kills many of Ajax's associates until one, the recruiter, reveals Ajax's whereabouts. Following a string of leads, Deadpool tracks down Ajax to a convoy of cars on an expressway. Dopinder (Karan Soni) is a taxi driver who befriends Deadpool on the way.\n\nHe kills all the escorts, corners Ajax and demands a cure to his disfigurement. The confrontation is interrupted by two X-Men, Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) (an X-Men who can transform his entire body into organic steel) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) (A teenage X-Men trainee who can generate atomic bursts from her body), who have been trying to recruit Deadpool to join them. Colossus says that Deadpool had been warned before about reckless use of his powers. Deadpool refuses to go with Colossus.\n\nTaking advantage of the distraction, Ajax escapes. Deadpool is livid and breaks his hands and legs when he tries to attack Colossus. Colossus handcuffs Wade to his wrist and begins dragging him away, planning to take him to Charles Xavier / Professor X back at the X-Mansion. Deadpool cuts off his hand and escapes. His hand slowly regenerates overnight.\n\nAjax knows that Wade will come for him when he heals, and he has no leverage on Wade. Ajax goes to Weasel's bar and learns about Vanessa. Weasel calls Wade and tells him Vanessa is in danger. Wade goes to the strip club where she works but hesitates before he can face her. In the meantime, Ajax kidnaps Vanessa. He and Angel Dust tell Deadpool to meet them on a decommissioned Helicarrier in a scrapyard. Deadpool prepares for battle but knows that he will need help. Meanwhile Ajax tells Vanessa that Wade is still alive, and she has been kidnapped because he still has feelings for her.\n\nDeadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him as he holds them responsible for allowing Ajax to escape, and the trio takes a cab to the scrapyard. While Colossus and Negasonic battle Angel Dust and several soldiers, Deadpool fights his way through Ajax's henchmen, and eventually engages him. After Angel Dust defeats Colossus, Negasonic attacks her, but accidentally destroys the equipment holding the Helicarrier upright. As the Helicarrier tips over, Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety, while Deadpool saves Vanessa.\n\nAjax survives and attacks Deadpool but is subdued and reveals there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement. Despite objections from Colossus, Deadpool kills Ajax. Vanessa then angrily berates Wilson for leaving her, but she reconciles with him after she sees his disfigured face and learns the real reason why he never came back to her.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Wade tells the audience that the film is over and announces a sequel featuring Cable."

          "content": "After successfully working as the mercenary Deadpool for two years, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) (A wisecracking mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental regenerative mutation) fails to kill one of his targets (after he shuts himself inside a panic room and Wade was in a hurry to get to Vanessa) on his anniversary with his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Deadpool is now friends with Dopinder (Karan Soni), a cab driver and part time waiter at the bar, but secretly wants to be a contract killer. Dopinder had started driving Deadpool to all his assignments in the US and was his getaway driver as well.\n\nThat night, after the pair decides to start a family together (Vanessa officially puts aside her birth control device and tells Wade to pump a baby in her), the target tracks them down and kills Vanessa (Vanessa was pregnant at the time & Wade knew it). Wilson kills the man in revenge. He blames himself for her death and attempts to commit suicide six weeks later by blowing himself up.\n\nBefore committing suicide, Wade spends a lot of time with Weasel (T. J. Miller) (Wilson's best friend and the owner of a bar frequented by mercenaries). Wade still lives with Blind Al (Leslie Uggams).\n\nWilson has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife who tells him that he is not yet ready for the afterlife (as his \"Heart's not in the right place), but the pieces of his body remain alive and are put back together by Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) (X-Man with the mutant ability to transform his entire body into organic steel). Wilson is left with only a Skee-Ball casino token made of lead, an anniversary gift, as a final memento of Vanessa.\n\nRecovering at the X-Mansion, Wilson agrees to join the X-Men as a form of healing. He, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) (A teenage X-Man with the mutant power to detonate atomic bursts from her body) respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant Russell Collins / Firefist (Julian Dennison) (A young mutant with Pyrokinesis who is being hunted by Cable) at an orphanage, labeled a \"Mutant Reeducation Center\". Colossus had told Wade that during his recovery period Wade is not allowed to kill anyone. Colossus says that he has taken a huge risk by sticking his own neck out to protect Wade. The orphanage is run by the brutal headmaster (Eddie Marsan) of the Essex Home for Mutant Rehabilitation.\n\nWilson realizes that Collins has been abused by the orphanage staff and kills one of the staff members whom Collins identifies as his abuser. Colossus stops him from killing anyone else, and both Wilson and Collins are arrested. Restrained with collars that suppress their powers, they are taken to the \"Icebox\", an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Collins tells Wade how he wants to kill the headmaster, who takes pleasure in torturing the mutants at the orphanage. Meanwhile, a cybernetic soldier from the future, Cable (Josh Brolin), whose family is murdered by an older Collins, travels back in time to kill the boy before Collins ever becomes a killer.\n\nCable breaks into the Icebox and attacks Collins. Wilson, whose collar has broken in the melee, attempts to defend Collins. Wade goes all out to defend Collins from Cable, who cannot understand why Wade would not die, despite being hit fatally multiple times during their battle across the prison. Wade wants to understand why Cable wants to kill a 14-year-old boy and Cable explains his mission. After another battle, Cable takes Vanessa's token (Wade had given Vanessa a lead token as a gift just before they were attacked and Vanessa was killed), Wilson forces himself and Cable out of the prison, but not before Collins overhears Wilson deny that he cares for the young mutant.\n\nNear death again, Wilson has another vision of Vanessa in which she convinces him to help Collins. Wade comes back determined to save Collins. Meanwhile, in prison, Collins befriends the biggest mutant named Juggernaut, who is kept in a special cell and not allowed to meet/see anyone. Collins brings him food and introduces himself. Wilson organizes a team called X-Force (X-Force team also includes Bedlam (Terry Crews), Shatterstar (Lewis Tan), Zeitgeist (Bill Skarsgard), Peter (Rob Delaney) and Vanisher (Brad Pitt)) to break Collins out of a prison-transfer convoy (all prisoners were being transferred to a new prison since the attack from Cable) and defend him from Cable.\n\nThe team launches its assault on the convoy by parachuting from a helicopter, but all of the members except for Wilson and the lucky Domino die during the landing. While the pair fight Cable, Collins frees fellow inmate Juggernaut, who repays Collins by agreeing to help him kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the truck he and Collins are in and they escape.\n\nCable offers to work with Wilson and Domino to stop Collins' first murder, which will eventually lead to more and one day will lead to Collins killing Cable's entire family, which is the reason he has traveled back in time to stop Collins from committing his first murder. He agrees to give Wilson a chance to talk Collins down before attempting to kill the boy again. They arrive at the orphanage and are overpowered by Juggernaut while Collins attacks the headmaster.\n\nColossus, who had at first refused to help Wilson due to Wilson's murderous ways, arrives to distract Juggernaut so that Wilson and Cable can confront Collins. After Wilson appears to fail in talking down Collins, Cable shoots at the young mutant. Wilson leaps in front of the bullet while wearing the Icebox collar and dies, reuniting with Vanessa in the afterlife. Seeing this sacrifice, Collins does not kill the headmaster. This changes the future, in which Cable's family now survives.\n\nCable uses the last charge on his time-traveling device, which he needed for returning to his family, to go back several minutes and strap Vanessa's token in front of Wilson's heart. Now when Wilson takes the bullet for Collins, it is stopped by the token, and he survives. Collins still has his change of heart, while the headmaster is run over by Wilson's taxi-driver friend Dopinder.\n\nIn a mid-credits sequence, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and her girlfriend Yukio (Shioli Kutsuna) repair Cable's time-traveling device for Wilson. He uses it to save the lives of Vanessa and X-Force human member Peter; kill X-Men Origins: Wolverine's version of Deadpool; and kill actor Ryan Reynolds while he is considering starring in the film Green Lantern."

          "content": "In 2018, Wade Wilson / Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is a wisecracking mercenary from Earth-10005 with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental regenerative mutation to treat terminal cancer.\n\nWade uses Cable's time-travel device to prevent the death of his girlfriend, Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin). He then travels from his universe, Earth-10005, to Earth-616, also called the \"Sacred Timeline\", hoping to join that reality's Avengers. He is rejected by Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and returns to his own universe.\n\nSix years later, Wade has broken up with Vanessa, retired from being the masked mercenary Deadpool, and works as a used-car salesman with his friend and former X-Force member Peter Wisdom (Rob Delaney). Wade lives with Blind Al (Leslie Uggams) his elderly roommate. Hi friends include Dopinder (Karan Soni) a taxi driver and admirer of Wade, Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) a teenage member of the X-Men with the mutant power to detonate atomic bursts from her body, Yukio (Shioli Kutsuna) Negasonic Teenage Warhead's girlfriend, Piotr Rasputin / Colossus (Stefan Kapicic), Buck (Randal Reeder), Rusty / Shatterstar (Lewis Tan) and others.\n\nDuring Wade's birthday party, he is detained by the Time Variance Authority (TVA) and brought to Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen), who explains that they are an organization outside of time that monitors the Sacred Timeline and the wider multiverse. He offers Wade a future on the Sacred Timeline which Wade accepts, until Paradox reveals that Wade's universe is deteriorating as a result of the death of its stabilizing \"anchor being\", Logan / Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) a mutant and former member of the X-Men with healing abilities, retractable claws, and an Adamantium-infused skeleton.\n\nParadox plans to use a \"Time Ripper\" device to accelerate this process. In his words he wants to give Earth-10005 a swift and compassionate end. Wade steals Paradox's TemPad device and uses it to travel to Logan's grave, hoping to resurrect him and save their time-line. But even after digging out his skeleton, Wade is not able to bring Logan back. He instead uses Logan's bones to fight off the TVA agents sent by Paradox. The TemPad device opens portals to other Universes at will and Wade can travel seamlessly to them. Wade then travels the multiverse searching for a replacement \"variant\" of Logan.\n\nWade returns to the TVA with a variant of Logan. Paradox says an anchor being cannot be replaced, especially by this variant who is considered to be the worst Wolverine in the multiverse. Paradox says that this particular Wolverine let down his entire world, in an act that was beyond forgiveness.\n\nWhen Wade deduces that Paradox is acting without the knowledge of his superiors, Paradox sends Wade and Logan to the Void, a wasteland at the end of time. Wade and Logan end up fighting each other but eventually realize that neither of them can be killed by conventional means.\n\nWade claims the TVA can change events in Logan's past, convincing him to work together to escape the Void. The pair are captured alongside Johnny Storm / Human Torch (Chris Evans) a member of the Fantastic Four who can engulf himself in and control fire, and fly, and taken to Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), the powerful and sadistic twin sister of X-Men leader Charles Xavier, and a mutant with Telekinetic and Telepathic powers. Cassandra, who made a deal with the TVA to oversee the Void. Cassandra was sent to the void in exchange for the ability to walk.\n\nWade jokes about how Johnny said insulting things about Cassandra on the way over. Cassandra kills Johnny and leaves Wade and Logan to be consumed by the creature Alioth, but the pair escape using a jet pack in Cassandra's compound. Wade and Logan find an abandoned diner in the void and eat whatever they can find as they share their insecurities with each other. Wade says that in his world, Wolverine died trying to save the X-23, a clone that they raised in a lab.\n\nLogan and Wade meet a Deadpool variant called \"Nicepool\" who directs them towards a resistance group that has been fighting Cassandra. Wade accidentally admits that he is not certain whether the TVA can change Logan's time-line, and the pair fight until they are both unconscious. Logan is livid with Wade and says that it is not a surprise that Wade was rejected by the Avengers and the X-Men, who pretty much take everyone.\n\nThey are found by the resistance group, consisting of Laura / X-23 (Dafne Keen) a female clone of Logan, Elektra (Jennifer Garner) a skilled fighter who uses a pair of Sai weapons, Blade (Wesley Snipes) the half-vampire \"Daywalker\", and Gambit (Channing Tatum). The superheroes were sent to the void when their own world's were destroyed due to the end of their Anchor Beings.\n\nWade proposes an alliance and Laura convinces Logan, regretful of his past actions which led to the deaths of his fellow X-Men, to join. The plan is to storm Cassandra's lair, distract her and find a way back to their Universes.\n\nThe resistance members distract Cassandra's henchmen while Wade and Logan block her powers using Juggernaut's (Aaron W. Reed) helmet (which was removed by Laura who defeated Juggernaut and provided the helmet to Wade, as Cassandra was inside Logan's mind). Cassandra says that she cannot send anyone back until the helmet is removed and promises to kill them if they do remove the helmet.\n\nCassandra is betrayed by her follower John Allerdyce / Pyro (Aaron Stanford) a Pyrokinetic mutant, on behalf of Paradox and almost dies when Pyro shoots her. Turns out Paradox was paying Pyro to take out Cassandra as she was becoming a bigger threat than what Paradox could handle. The only way to save her is to take the helmet off, and Logan convinces Wade to do the same, without any guarantees that Cassandra would not kill them. Cassandra heals herself and uses a Sling Ring to open a portal to Earth-10005 for Logan and Wade.\n\nCassandra learns about the Time Ripper from Pyro, kills him, and follows Logan and Wade to Earth-10005. She plans to use the Time Ripper to destroy all time-lines, leaving only the Void. Cassandra summons an army of Deadpool variants, who kill Nicepool and battle Wade and Logan until Peter, Wade's friend, arrives to distract them.\n\nParadox tells Wade and Logan that one of them could destroy the Time Ripper by disrupting its power flow which is comprised of matter and anti-matter flowing into it. But disrupting the flow of matter and anti-matter would bring the 2 entities together and create an explosion that would kill them. Wade and Logan destroy the Time Ripper together, killing Cassandra in the process, and survive by sharing the burden. Paradox is arrested by the TVA's boss Hunter B-15 (Wunmi Mosaku), who congratulates Wade and Logan and says their actions have stopped Earth-10005 from deteriorating.\n\nWade asks Hunter B-15 to save the resistance group from the Void and change the history of Logan's world. She explains that the latter is not possible because Logan's history is what led to him being a hero now, but allows Logan to stay in Wade's universe. During a gathering with Wade's friends that includes a rescued Laura."

      "description": "An alien race known as the Sirens descended upon the world and drove humanity out of the seas with their advanced technology. In order to counter them, humanity created a global alliance known as Azur Lane. It was composed of the four great factions – Eagle Union, Royal Navy, Iron Blood, and Sakura Empire. After a long and hard-fought battle, they were able to finally drive away the Sirens. Time passed…\n\n…which leads us to the present! It seems forces from Eagle Union and Royal Navy are gathering at a newly constructed Azur Lane base. Light Cruiser Cleveland and Battleship Prince of Wales are at the dock to greet their comrades Aircraft Carrier Illustrious and Light Aircraft Carrier Unicorn. They head over to the Azur Lane Academy where they discuss how to handle Iron Blood and Sakura Empire. It seems there is some dissonance between the camps and the Iron Blood/Sakura Empire combo is planning hostilities. That doesn’t sound too good at all! Elsewhere, Unicorn is searching for her lost friend U-chan…who is an actual baby unicorn, I think. Luckily for her, other shipgirls such as Destroyer Javelin and Destroyer Laffey are willing to help her with the search. As they proceed to look all over for U-chan, we’re introduced to a lot of other shipgirls. Like, a lot. I can’t keep up, there’s just so many of them! Eventually, they come across a shipgirl who has found Unicorn’s friend! She hands U-chan over and they all thank her. Before they can even really start up a conversation, she disappears. Also, it looks like the base is under attack!?!?\n\nTurns out the vanishing shipgirl, Ayanami, is actually their enemy. SHOCKING TRUTH! She makes contact with her allies Aircraft Carrier Akagi and Aircraft Carrier Kaga, who seem to be VERY close, and feeds them information about the base. They’re ready for a fight. Looks like we got some action coming up! Sirens are attacking the base and all of the available shipgirls gather at the docks and begin transforming into battle mode. I must say that some of the transformation sequences, such as Cleveland’s, were absolutely stunning. The Azur Lane shipgirls take care of business and defeat the Sirens. However, they were never the real threat in this particular altercation. We learn that a difference in ideals had divided the four factions. Eagle Union and Royal Navy restrict themselves to using powers only created by humankind. On the other hand, Iron Blood and Sakura Empire are willing to use Siren technology to defeat the aliens. This difference of opinions has led to this seemingly silly war between Azur Lane (Eagle Union and Royal Navy) and Red Axis (Iron Blood and Sakura Empire).\n\nWhat follows is a lot of mighty fine action! The Azur Lane shipgirls are now struggling against the Red Axis attacks. In one of the coolest scenes in the entire episode, Kaga summons a gigantic fox aircraft carrier that I can only describe as badass. It’s all Iron Blood/Sakura Empire at this point and it seems they’ve got victory in the bag…or so they thought. Making her grandiose entrance to this battle is none other than the strongest Eagle Union aircraft carrier, the Grey Ghost, Enterprise! She quickly transforms into battle mode and engages with Kaga. The highlight of this episode, in my opinion, was definitely the Enterprise versus Kaga fight. Although brief, it was nothing short of amazing and a real treat for the eyes. Enterprise takes Kaga down and all the shipgirls can’t help but be awestruck by her overwhelming strength. Red Axis decides it’s the perfect time for a strategic retreat and bail, but assure Azur Lane that this isn’t over. Not bad, not bad at all.",

          "content": "After the battle from the previous episode, it’s no surprise that the Azur Lane base is a complete mess. Some cute looking duck things are going around fishing injured shipgirls out of the water. It’s exactly as adorable as it sounds. Prince of Wales and Illustrious are discussing the battle and making preparations for the next one that will inevitably follow. They also acknowledge that they were victorious only because of Enterprise. Prince of Wales praises her relentless strength while Illustrious calls her unsafe. Speaking of Enterprise, the battle has taken a lot out of her and needs rest. Cleveland urges her to do so but she refuses, warning her that they can’t lower their guard while their enemy is still close.\n\nWhat follows next are a few moments of cute shipgirls doing cute things. Nothing wrong with that. I’m sure that’s why some of us are here in the first place. However, there were also a few moments of cute shipgirls doing…sexy things!? You read that right. There’s a scene where a sleepy Laffey accidentally pulls down Javelin’s shirt, much to her chagrin. Laffey is in the same boat though as her top also slips off. This isn’t surprising at all since her top is always so darn loose. Some naughty crab crawls onto her exposed chest but before it can cause some mischief, Javelin yanks it off and pulls up Laffey’s shirt. I never knew crabs were such perverts. So yeah, unexpected shipgirl fanservice. I’m sure a lot of fans out there appreciated that.\n\nAnd you know what? There’s still a little more. Elsewhere, Akagi and Kaga are having some very sensual sisterly bonding. Akagi sure loves touching Kaga, a lot. She also likes licking her. They’re soon joined by Heavy Cruiser Prinz Eugen. They discuss a few things and recognize that Enterprise is going to be trouble for them. They can’t afford to underestimate her. A notification arrives and informs them that there’s a detached force nearby. Naturally, they decide to have a little fun for them.\n\nI would like to highlight two conversations that happen next. Ayanami and Destroy Z23 are conversing about their mission. Ayanami doesn’t dislike fighting, nor does she particularly enjoy it. She asks Z23 if she enjoys fighting. Z23 shrugs the question off and states that what they like is irrelevant. Their duty is to execute the mission. Nothing less, nothing more. Back at the Azur Lane base, Javelin and Laffey are having a picnic. A few moments later, they are joined by Enterprise. She still doesn’t appear to be in great shape. Javelin asks her why she pushes herself so hard? Enterprise laughs off the question and remarks that the purpose of their existence is to fight. That right there is probably my biggest gripe with the show. They’re fighting just for the sake of fighting. Don’t get me wrong, I love the fights. But I feel like they lack some substance, you know?\n\nSpeaking of fights, it’s about time for one! That previously mentioned nearby Azur Lane detached force includes Heavy Cruiser Northampton, Destroyer Hammann, Light Cruiser Helena, Light Aircraft Carrier Long Island, Battleship Arizona, and Aircraft Carrier Hornet. Oh my goodness, so many shipgirls! More names that I’ll have to try and remember. By the way, Hornet is Enterprise’s younger sister. They’re attacked by the Red Axis sister pair of Aircraft Carrier Shoukaku and Aircraft Carrier Zuikaku. Being notified of the attack, Enterprise immediately sorties despite not being a hundred percent. Her sister is in trouble after all! Cleveland, Javelin, and Laffey tag along too. When they arrive at the battlefield, they discover that all the shipgirls there have been defeated except for Hornet. She’s barely able to hold her own against Zuikaku. Enterprise interjects in their fight and takes over for her sister.\n\nWhile Enterprise and Zuikaku trade blows, Battleship Queen Elizabeth and her noble fleet of the Royal Navy arrive. In true English fashion, she’s having tea served by her shipgirl maids. I don’t know why this amused me so much, but it did. Anyways, Enterprise and Zuikaku are having an amazing fight. I’m glad the quality of the action hasn’t diminished at all. Enterprise eventually overpowers her foe and attempts to finish her off. However, her bow snaps in half before she can fire off the finishing shot. Knowing that this is her best chance, Zuikaku powers up her katana and charges at Enterprise. Enterprise attempts one last attack but to no avail. Fortunately for her, one of Queen Elizabeth’s maids blocks the attack for her in the nick of time. Sadly, we’ll have to see the conclusion of this fight in the next episode."

          "content": "Enterprise was in a tough spot at the end of the last episode. Her bow snapped in half and she was utterly defenseless. Zuikaku was about to land the finishing blow on her but she was intercepted by one of Queen Elizabeth’s maid, Light Cruiser Belfast. Prinz Eugen warns her fellow Red Axis shipgirls to not underestimate Belfast. She may look like a fool but she’s actually a legendary fighter! It seems these two have a bit of history. Prinz Eugen would love to settle their old score but she notices Queen Elizabeth’s forces consisting of Battleship Warspite, Battleship Hood, Light Cruiser Edinburgh, and Light Cruiser Sheffield closing in on them. She suggests that Red Axis should retreat for now and they do. Enterprise immediately passes out after they leave.\n\nShe awakens sometime later in a room and is told what happened by Belfast. Enterprise thanks Belfast for protecting her and quickly leaves without taking any rest. I’m starting to realize that Enterprise is quite the stubborn shipgirl. Just get some rest already! Heck, she won’t even eat breakfast when offered and instead opts to eat some ration bars. Quite stubborn indeed. Prince of Wales and Illustrious continue their conversation from last week. Prince of Wales once again praises Enterprise’s strength while Illustrious still believes that she’s a loose cannon. She also doesn’t want to see her get grounded during the upcoming battles. They decide to discuss this further with Queen Elizabeth. She doesn’t feel that this matter involves her but they convince her that Enterprise is a key component for their victory. Queen Elizabeth tasks Belfast with determining what type of ship she really is.\n\nBelfast finds Enterprise walking around the base and tells her that Unicorn wishes to see her. Elsewhere, some of the shipgirls decide to go to the beach and have some fun. Shipgirls in their swimsuits doing cute things at the beach? I can already sense the excitement from a lot of you. Keep yourselves together! Anyways, the shipgirls are all having a good time. Well, everyone except for San Diego. She almost got eaten by a shark. She sure finds herself in a lot of unfortunate situations. Meanwhile, Enterprise’s group finds their way to the beach with the other shipgirls. Enterprise sits in the sand and watches Unicorn as she plays in the water. What did Unicorn want to talk about? She just wanted to thank Enterprise for saving her! D’awww. However, Enterprise shrugs off the praise and states that she was just simply doing her job. Come on Enterprise, read the mood a little! Unicorn looks out at the ocean and comments how beautiful it looks right now. Enterprise scoffs that everyone says the same thing. She has never felt that the ocean is beautiful. Why would she? All she does is fight on the ocean. It only reminds her of a battlefield and there is no beauty in that. Wow, tell us how you really feel! Though I must admit that I do appreciate seeing Enterprise revealing some of her true feelings. A little bit of character development is always a good thing. Unicorn then poses a question to Enterprise – is she afraid of the ocean? Enterprise doesn’t have an answer to that question. Interesting, very interesting.\n\nDay turns to night and it starts raining. Enterprise seems to be lost in thought and Belfast brings over an umbrella for her. She then bluntly asks her how long does she plan to keep on fighting recklessly? Why does she have no regard for her own wellbeing? In Belfast’s eyes, it looks like Enterprise is actually tired of fighting. She also adds that Enterprise’s way of life is flawed and that someday she will lead herself to ruin. Dang, Belfast speaking the harsh truth! I love it. Enterprise definitely needed to hear all of that. I’m starting to become a big fan of Belfast.\n\nA distress call is sent to the base and a few shipgirls are dispatched. Enterprise decides to join them even though she’s in no shape to fight. Did she not learn anything!? Belfast once again criticizes her recklessness. No use in arguing about it now though as they come upon the aftermath of an intense battle. Enterprise finds two young shipgirl sisters, Light Cruisers Ping Hai and Ning Hai of the Dragon Empery. They explain that they were attacked by the Sirens and that they managed to defeat them all. Well, not exactly. It seems like one is still lingering! The little sister proclaims that she’ll protect her big sister this time. This causes an image of Enterprise’s big sister to flash before her eyes. Hitting close to home, huh? Naturally, Enterprise carelessly rushes into battle and is quickly overpowered BECAUSE SHE NEVER TAKES A FREAKING REST. Luckily for her, Belfast once again saves her and soundly defeats the Siren. She remarks that she now knows what type of shipgirl Enterprise is, a softhearted one.\n\nThey rescue the two sisters and return back to the base. Belfast informs Enterprise that she has taken an interest in her. She plans to teach her how to become a proper gentlewoman. That sounds like a herculean task. A confused Enterprise can only muster out a “huh?” in response. I look forward to seeing how this is all going to unfold."

          "content": "Azur Lane, a combination of all the different Camps in the world, was once successful in repelling the underwater menace, the Siren. Now splintered, they must face a new threat in Red Axis, former allies who crave to wield this otherworldly Siren technology for their own nefarious desires! Who will be victorious in the never-ending war between these battleship girls!?\n\nThe Review:\nContent: (please note that content portions of a review may contain spoilers)\nWe open up with a view of Sakura Empire which is very pretty. The Sakura Empire shipgirls have all returned home. They’re greeted by Heavy Cruiser Kako, Heavy Cruiser Furutaka, Aircraft Carrier Souryuu, Aircraft Carrier Hiryuu, Destroyer Yukikaze, Destroyer Shigure, and Destroyer Yuudachi. Oh joy, more names to remember. Kako reports that nothing of note has happened and that Nagato wishes to see them. It seems all of the cute little destroyers are big fans of Ayanami and begin to shower her with affection. Cuteness overload. The previous episodes usually focused on the Azur Lane shipgirls, so it was nice to see Sakura Empire shipgirls get some love for once.\n\nSpeaking of Azur Lane shipgirls, it’s time to begin Enterprise’s training to become a proper gentlewoman! She wants to eat a simple ration for breakfast while having a cup of coffee. Belfast is having none of that and replaces it with a cup of tea and a delicious plate of food. The key to leading an elegant life is running on a strict and regular schedule. Enterprise wants to know why Belfast is interfering in her life. She replies that she wants to see the human soul inside of her. Enterprise doesn’t get it. I’m sure she will though, someday. Probably. Moving along, Enterprise wants to check up on the Empery girls that they rescued yesterday. It turns out that the two sisters are doing just fine and are making panda steamed buns for everyone. By the way, those panda steamed buns were adorable. They give one to Enterprise as thanks for saving them. Precious. Over by the beach, Javelin, Laffey, and Unicorn are enjoying some delicious steamed bums themselves. They comment that it’d be great if Ayanami could join them. It’s a shame she’s aligned with Sakura Empire though.\n\nEnterprise and Belfast are informed that Dragon Empery has detected increased Siren activity. Perhaps they’re trying to take advantage of the fighting between Azur Lane and Red Axis? It certainly seems like the smart move. Add Sakura Empire’s new technology to the mix and you definitely have something funny going on. Enterprise doesn’t believe this is a coincidence and suggests they look into it. Belfast tells her not to worry about it since the Maid Corps is currently on an espionage mission.\n\nThe Maid Corps is blending in with the Sakura Empire shipgirls. And by blending in, I mean they’re just wearing masks. Totally not suspicious at all. Akagi and Kaga are having a discussion with Battleship Nagato. They’re talking about the Black Box that allows them to control the Sirens and Project Orochi. Akagi remarks that it’s the shining hope for Sakura Empire. Nagato isn’t so sure though and comments that it made them have to make the first move. Akagi explains that it was necessary and that clashes with the Sirens are inevitable. Humanity is barely surviving and Azur Lane’s strategy is not good enough. Sakura Empire must complete the project at all costs! Nagato still doesn’t seem to be convinced and dismisses the sisters. Is it just me or does Akagi look like she’s possessed whenever she’s holding the Black Box? She’s quite obsessed with completing this project. Maybe she really is thinking about what’s best for humanity, who knows? All I’m saying is that I wouldn’t be surprised if she was actually possessed.\n\nAyanami is telling the little destroyers stories about the battles she saw. They’re hanging on her every word! Adorable. They comment that they can’t wait to fight themselves. However, Ayanami once again makes it known that she does not like fighting and is only doing what is required of her. Elsewhere, Zuikaku is watching Heavy Cruiser Takao train. She confides in her that she’s ashamed that she was so weak during the battle and wants to get stronger so that she can protect Shokaku and the others. Takao tells her that she shouldn’t take on the burden by herself and that she has comrades that are willing to help her. If anime has taught me anything, it’s that nakama power clearly makes you stronger.\n\nIn a stroke of luck, the Maid Corps find a lost shipgirl that leads them to where they’re keeping the Project Orochi ship! Akagi is powering up the ship and the Observer tells her that the project’s completion is imminent. Unfortunately, the lost shipgirl, Akashi, wasn’t supposed to see that and is captured by the Observer. They can’t have any witnesses it seems. Poor Akashi. While they’re distracted, Sheffield of the Maid Corps manages to snatch the Black Box from Akagi and escapes. While escaping, she is confronted by Takao and they engage in a brief skirmish. Honestly, I wish they had fought a little longer. I wanted to see some action! Reinforcements arrive and now Sheffield is outnumbered. But the Maid Corps has her back and they provide a distraction that allows her enough time to escape. And in case you’re wondering, they also saved Akashi.\n\nSakura Empire has lost the Black Box but Akagi doesn’t seem too upset about it. In fact, she declares that Azur Lane is going to nurture the box for them. That’s certainly an ominous statement. I’m starting to think that she’s really possessed.\n\n"

          "content": "Sheffield, Edinburgh, and Akashi are on the run from Sakura Empire. They managed to escape in the last episode but they’re still being pursued. They decide to hide on a nearby island and hope they aren’t discovered. Edinburgh inquires about the Black Box but Akashi doesn’t know anything about it except that it was taken from the Sirens and that it’s bad news. Sheffield reports that there are scout planes all around them which must mean that Sakura Empire knows they’re on this island. The base knows of their situation and she suggests that they wait to be rescued.\n\nThe Sakura Empire fleet continues its search for those three. They’re not having much luck. Takao is not pleased that she let them go away and wants to restore her good name. She is soon teased by Atago who is very…hands-on. Ayanami, who’s watching all of this, is asked if she would like to join in on the fun? She promptly refuses. Sakura Empire is soon notified by Iron Blood that Azur Lane is approaching. The Azur Lane force includes familiar faces like Prince of Wales and Cleveland but also new faces such as Battleship Oklahoma, Heavy Cruiser Suffolk, Battlecruiser Repulse, and Heavy Cruiser Norfolk. I don’t think I can handle remembering any more shipgirl names.\n\nBelfast is keeping calm and Enterprise wonders how she is able to keep her cool when her companions are the ones hiding on the island. She’s not worried because they’re fellow maids who serve under the Queen. Enterprise finds it odd that the Maid Corps would imitate humans. Belfast declares that it makes no difference whether you’re a person or a ship. They’re all alive, they all have hearts. Enterprise strongly disagrees, ships were only born to fight and they’re nothing like humans. Belfast agrees that they have great strength and it does come with great responsibility. Sure, they want to defeat their enemies but they also want proof. Proof that no matter how difficult life gets, that they can still live a proud, noble life. They must serve as examples for people who have lost their way. That is the way of the maid, achieving elegance in all aspects of life. Enterprise remarks that Eagle Union doesn’t think like that. Belfast immediately replies that she knows and that’s why everyone in Azur Lane must help each other out. This entire scene of clashing ideals was my favorite part of the episode. Belfast is the perfect foil to Enterprise. Why is she so awesome?\n\nJavelin and Laffey want to see Ayanami again, even though she’s technically their enemy. But she’s also their friend! Speaking of Ayanami, back over on the Sakura Empire side, she is asked by Atago if she enjoys fighting? She doesn’t dislike it, but she doesn’t love it either. This much we already know from previous episodes. She remarks that she loves everyone in Sakura Empire, they’re her precious friends. However, it’s the same for the other side. They also have friends as she does. Tell us how you really feel! Atago proceeds to bury Ayanami’s face into her voluptuous bosom in an attempt to comfort her. I don’t think it made her feel any better but at least she was comfortable.\n\nThe scout planes finally find the location of the hiding Maid Corps. Oh no, I guess they have to fight now. Bring it on! Thus, a huge battle begins between Azur Lane and Red Axis. Shots are fired, planes are flying everywhere, and bullets are raining down from above. A lot of different fights are occurring all over the battlefield. Cleveland and Belfast are facing off against Takao and Atago. Prinz Eugen’s group is facing Sheffield and Edinburgh. They manage to distract Prinz Eugen’s group long enough for Enterprise to be in the perfect position for a counterattack. This forces Prinz Eugen’s group to retreat. Sadly, Javelin and Laffey are attacked by Ayanami. They both dodge her attacks but they never attack back. Ayanami wants to know why that is. Laffey simply stares at her which pisses her off. Ayanami goes for the finishing blow! Laffey doesn’t move. In the end, Ayanami can’t bring herself to land the blow and stops just before reaching her throat. Frustrated, she asks why she wouldn’t move? Because she wants to be friends. Ayanami yells that they’re enemies but that doesn’t matter to Laffey. She still wants to be friends, as does Javelin. A cute way to end the episode."

          "content": "It’s the start of a new morning and Belfast wakes up Enterprise. After getting dressed, she looks at the rations laying all over her desk and suggests eating breakfast at the cafeteria. Hey, looks like Belfast’s training is paying off a little! It’s quite lively in the cafeteria. The shipgirls are having a good time and conversing about…buying new underwear. Purchasing new underwear is an important matter! Enterprise gets in line for food and Battleship Nevada gives her a big serving as thanks for helping out Oklahoma. She chats with a few shipgirls on the way to her seat. Once seated, she invites Belfast to eat with her since there’s too much food for her to eat. She happily obliges. Little by little, Enterprise is changing.\n\nOnce they’re done with breakfast, Enterprise and Belfast walk around the base. They talk with various shipgirls along the way. Cleveland walks up to the duo and introduces her Light Cruiser sisters Denver, Montpelier, and Columbia. The sisters start teasing each other which amuses Enterprise. She comments that they get along really well. We then get a flashback of everyone discussing the Black Mental Cube they obtained from Sakura Empire. All they know is that the Siren gave them this cube and that Akagi is working with them. Are the shipgirls of Sakura Empire being deceived? Enterprise places a hand on the cube and gets an ominous vision. She looks at herself…but not quite herself. It’s more like an evil version of herself. Uh oh, what could that mean?\n\nOver at Sakura Empire, the shipgirls there are also having a good time. Akagi is teasing Kaga as usual. A group of adorable chibi Destroyers run by and one of them falls over. After helping her up and exchanging candy with one another, Akagi remarks that it’d be nice if things could remain like they are now. What’s going on through her mind?\n\nEnterprise and Belfast continue their walk through the base. They head over to the beach and Enterprise notices that there’s a lot of shops now. They’re shops selling food, books, flowers, and more. It’s certainly lively and Enterprise remarks that it reminds her of a human town. Belfast agrees and adds that it’s because they are human. Ah, this conversation again. Enterprise just doesn’t seem to understand. Belfast says that all she needs is to have elegance in her heart. Enterprise doesn’t get that either. Is she suggesting that she should be a maid? Belfast is a fan of that idea and starts giggling. It doesn’t matter if Enterprise wants to be a maid or not, all that matters is that she try something new. A hobby, a job, anything that isn’t fighting. Enterprise admits that it would be difficult for her but that’s okay, Belfast is up for the challenge! Human life is all about adventure anyway. Enterprise acknowledges that she may be right. Once again, I love these interactions between Enterprise and Belfast. It seems like Belfast is getting through to her, slowly but surely.\n\nElsewhere, Javelin is a bit depressed thinking about how Ayanami is an enemy. Laffey then sprays her with water and they proceed to have a water fight because why not? Now they’re soaking wet…which means it’s time to hit up the hot springs! Yup, it’s time for some bath scenes. This is the fanservice episode a lot of fans were waiting for. Of course, I’m sure they were hoping it would be uncensored but you know that’s not going to happen. You gotta get the Blu-rays for that. Anyway, the shipgirls are having some au naturel fun. Cleveland and her sisters are admiring the assets and mature underwear of the Royal Navy shipgirls. She asks Sheffield if it’s true that all Royal Navy shipgirls wear grown-up underwear? Sheffield responds by saying that she doesn’t wear any underwear at all…and then proceeds to flash her. Oh my! I can’t say I was expecting that, haha. Cleveland’s face turns beet red. San Diego jumps into one of the baths only to get electrocuted. Yikes, she can never catch a break, can she? Javelin, Laffey, and Unicorn are all bathing together. Javelin praises Unicorn’s ample bosom. This causes Unicorn to start crying!? Unicorn is sad because she’s small but has breasts are on the bigger side. She doesn’t like her figure. Laffey comforts her and says that she has an awesome figure. Everyone is different and that’s normal. She points at the shipgirls walking by them and they all have bigger breasts than Unicorn. Also, they all look towards the camera and start posing for some reason. A treat for the fans, perhaps? All I know is that I was caught off guard and I was dying of laughter. I guess Unicorn feels better when she realizes her chest is small in comparison to a lot of the shipgirls. Alls well that ends well?\n\nIt’s nighttime now and most of the shipgirls are asleep. Enterprise can’t sleep and decides to go outside and gaze at the ocean. Belfast joins her a few moments later and pours her some coffee. Enterprise says that the ocean was calling to her. That’s quite unusual according to Belfast. She also adds that she was just joking. Enterprise made a joke? Whoa! Now that’s unusual. Enterprise admits that she may be emotional right now. She really is changing, huh? Enterprise and Belfast admire the beauty of a quiet ocean together.\n\nBack in Sakura Empire, Prinz Eugen is teasing Kaga. She doesn’t think that Akagi and Kaga are on the same page. This angers Kaga to which Prinz Eugen remarks that one-sided love is truly a painful thing. Elsewhere, Akagi is looking out to sea and proclaims that she’ll see her dear sister Amagi again soon. I’m thinking that Prinz Eugen was correct in her assessment. The episode ends with Ayanami reaching out to the moon with her hand. She probably has a lot on her mind as well."

Enterprise laments the fact that it’s just one battle after another. Queen Elizabeth is singing the praises of her fleet. Cleveland is giving a pep talk to her sisters. Over on the Red Axis side, Takao is wondering if their side is truly prepared for this fight. What is Akagi thinking? Perhaps she’s flustered after not being able to retrieve the Black Box? The Ayanami fan club is excited to finally participate in a real battle. It’s adorable how excited they are but war isn’t something that’s supposed to be fun! Ayanami has conflicted feelings about fighting. Javelin and Laffey feel the same way over on the Azur Lane side.\n\nEnterprise is gazing at the sky and Belfast wants to know if something is bothering her. She replies that she’s fine. There’s a decisive battle coming up and she has to remain sharp. It’d be bad if she was caught off guard. Belfast reminds her that she should refrain from acting rashly. Enterprise remarks that she’ll try her best. Don’t worry so much Belfast! I’m sure she can be trusted. It’s not like she’s always acting recklessly…okay, maybe you should be concerned. Massachusetts has a bad feeling about this. Back on the Red Axis side, Akagi has activated some kind of ritual that causes a storm to brew. It’s starts raining heavily and the sea has turned violent. Poor Javelin almost falls off the ship! It’s a good thing Laffey was there to catch there. And then suddenly, everything becomes calm again. The Sirens appear out of nowhere! Akagi welcomes the Azur Lane shipgirls to her sea. She’s wearing a cocky grin the entire time.\n\nLet the battle begin! The Maid Corps strut their stuff and dispose of some Sirens. The Clevelands sisters also showoff a little bit. The Azur Lane shipgirls and Red Axis shipgirls have a long staredown with each other. Things are getting intense! I have to give props to the soundtrack of this episode. It really set the mood and made this battle feel important. Enterprise charges at the enemy riding atop a plane. She didn’t listen to Belfast at all! Zuikaku notices her and shoots down the plane she’s riding. No biggie, she simply lands on another plane below. Zuikaku is raring to go but Kaga stops her. She tells Zuikaku that this her fight to redeem her honor. There’s no place for a fledgling like her. Ouch, that was mean. What happens next is a true spectacle for the eyes. Kaga and Enterprise start having an aerial battle. Bullets are flying everywhere. Planes are being shot down. It’s chaos! Enterprise tells Kaga that it’s despicable that they’ve aligned themselves with The Siren. They are traitors to their own Sakura Empire. This pisses Kaga off and they continue with their aerial battle.\n\nAkagi decides to join in on the fun. It wouldn’t be fair if only Kaga was doing all of the work. However, she’s intercepted by Belfast. Akagi proceeds to pull a Gilgamesh and activates her own version of The Gate of Babylon. If you don’t get the reference, I recommend watching the Fate/Grand Order anime that’s currently airing this season. It’ll all make sense then, probably. Anyway, Akagi summons a whole bunch of turrets and fires them all at Belfast. Enterprise notices that she’s in trouble and gets momentarily distracted. That’s the opening Kaga needed and she shoots Enterprise down. Oh no! Enterprise falls into the ocean and starts sinking. She starts having a flashback about her sister and how she said the ocean was lovely. Enterprise never saw the ocean as beautiful. To her, the ocean was an unpleasant place for war. As she keeps sinking, she reaches up with her hand. At that moment, it seems like the Black Box activates.\n\nAkagi thinks she has won the battle. Think again, missy! A blinding beam of light shoots up from the sea. Enterprise appears above everyone with glowing yellow eyes. She certainly looks menacing. I guess she’s Alter Enterprise now? She glares at Kaga and she’s immediately taken down. Initially, I had thought that Enterprise’s glare was just that imitating and it scared Kaga so bad that she just couldn’t move. In reality, Enterprise shot her with an arrow at lightning speed. I actually had to slow the playback of my video in order to catch it. Dang, that’s all I can say. Friend and foe alike are soon engulfed by the blinding beam of light. I don’t think they’re dead? Well, I really hope not. Only Enterprise and Akagi remain. Akagi will not let Enterprise stand in her way. She materializes a badass looking fire dragon and calls it the manifestation of her love that transcends time and the gods. This doesn’t phase Enterprise at all as she pierces Akagi through the chest with an arrow. Okay, she may be dead. As Akagi falls towards the ocean, she remembers her dear sister one last time. Damn Enterprise, you scary. She turns back to normal and reaches out to Akagi as she falls. She looks horrified at her actions. Enterprise looks up at the sky and starts crying. She realizes that she has been afraid of the ocean this whole time."

          "content": "The Azur Lane shipgirls are pretty shaken up. What the heck was that all about? What’s the deal with Enterprise? I’m not sure if they were all teleported to one of the poles or if the sea suddenly froze over. Either way, it’s freaking cold and the shipgirls aren’t dressed appropriately for the situation! Poor Laffey has a runny nose because of how cold it is. Javelin and Laffey got separated from the group and desperately search for them. They come across Ayanami instead! She starts having an existential crisis. When did life get so difficult? It used to be easy when the enemies were invaders from the outside. They fought them in order to save humanity. That was the whole reason for their existence. It was a tough world but they fought to protect. But what about now? Why must they fight other shipgirls?\n\nAyanami admonishes the two shipgirls for not attacking her, an enemy. But their answer is still the same – they want to be friends with her. It doesn’t make sense to Ayanami. Enemies have to attack each other, right? It’s that simple. Javelin responds by saying that no, shipgirls aren’t that simple. Not going to lie, that was a great line. They certainly have a complicated friendship. Ayanami’s fan club shows up and takes her away. Belfast also randomly shows up. Belfast screentime is always welcomed. Back to the subject of existential crises, Enterprise is having her on somewhere. She shares the same thoughts as Ayanami. When did the world become so complex? They used to be fighting on the same side but now their guns are pointed at each other. Enterprise is in some trippy hallucination and meets what appears to be a Sakura Empire shipgirl. I don’t know who she is but I wouldn’t be surprised if turns out to be Akagi’s sister. She tells Enterprise to remember that they all have a connection. They were all born with memories of warships embedded in them. Countless emotions are braided together. She should never forget that the prayers of humanity lie within her. That’s deep.\n\nThe Sakura Empire shipgirls are quite perplexed by the current situation. By the way, there are dimensional rifts scattered all around. At least I think they’re dimensional rifts. They could be cracks in space-time. I don’t know. Who the hell knows what’s going on? Kaga goes crazy when she’s told that Akagi is missing. The others suspect that Enterprise may have finished her off. Shoukaku questions Akagi’s motives in the first place. They were never really told anything about Project Orochi. Too many secrets. What is being kept hidden from them? Elsewhere, Javelin is still troubled about Ayanami. Why must they fight each other? That question is sure getting asked a lot in this episode. Belfast comforts her and tells her to keep dwelling on it. Don’t let the situation continue to dictate your actions. You’re free to think whatever you want. They were created to fight, not to destroy. BELIEVE IN YOUR SHIPGIRL HEART! Okay, Belfast may have not said that last line. But we all know she was thinking it, right? Just me? Alright then, moving along. Things are getting dangerous so Belfast tells Javelin and Laffey to regroup with the others. They decide to help her search for Enterprise instead.\n\nKaga is informed that they’re stopping the search for Akagi. As you can probably imagine, she does not take the news very well. They’re not willing to endanger the fleet over one shipgirl. Harsh but true. The Azur Lane shipgirls have tracked down the location of Sakura Empire and decide to attack them. They won’t let them get away because this is war. And it’s on tonight. So get up and fight! I hope someone knows where those lyrics are from. Anyway, the Sakura Empire shipgirls know that Azur Lane is going to attack them and decide to retreat. Shoukaku and Zuikaku stay behind to hold them off while everyone else escapes. Elsewhere, Observer and Tester are watching the shipgirls fight. They are quite entertained by all of this. They are particularly amused by their contradiction of not wanting war but still choosing to fight. Their actions reflect humanity and conflict has always been the core of humankind. Sad but true. On another note, they also picked up Akagi. I guess she’s not dead either. They have high hopes for Alter Enterprise.\n\nSpeaking of Alter Enterprise, she shows up in the middle of the battle between Azur Lane and the Sakura Empire duo. Before Shoukaku or Zuikaku even have a chance to react, she summons a whole bunch of bombers. They unleash a rain of bombs and bullets at the sisters. Zuikaku was about to get nailed with a direct hit but Shoukaku shoves her out of the way and takes the brunt of the attack. Everyone can only watch on in awe. An angered Zuikaku attempts to attack Enterprise but it has no effect on her. Enterprise wonders if there will ever be a time when conflict has ended? That’s a silly question though because she already knows the answer. There won’t be because war never changes. Again, sad but true. She attempts to finish off Zuikaku by dropping a bomb on her but Ayanami deflects it at that last second. It explodes and it sends her flying towards one of the dimensional rifts or whatever. Javelin and Laffey save her in the nick of time. Enterprise looks horrified at her actions once again."

          "content": "Ayanami awakens inside the Azur Lane base. How’d she get here? She’s told by Aircraft Carrier Ark Royal that she fell unconscious after the battle and they picked her up. Technically, she’s a prisoner of war right now. Elsewhere, Laffey and Javelin are getting scolded for being reckless. All to save an enemy, too! Belfast tries to take the blame for them but they’re not getting off that easy. They’re assigned to prisoner supervision duty. Basically, it means that they get to spend time with Ayanami. Not much of a punishment, am I right? Though it is nice that they let Laffey and Javelin hang out with Ayanami. After those two leave, the rest of the shipgirls discuss the Black Cube. It’s been acting quite strange ever since the battle and they don’t know what it means. What about Enterprise? Belfast reports that they’ve done extensive diagnostics on her but so far they have found nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nSpeaking of Enterprise, she’s looking out at the ocean by herself. She still doesn’t understand many things such as the beauty of the ocean. The only thing she does know is that she must continue to fight. Somewhere else, Javelin and Laffey are excitedly showing Ayanami around the base. They cross paths with the adorable group of shipgirls that call themselves the Little Beavers. They tell Ayanami that they respect her for risking her life to protect a friend. That’s true justice! They also praise Laffey and Javelin for doing the same. If they ever need help, the Little Beavers got their back! They’re just too cute. As the scurry away, Laffey remarks that no one here resents Ayanami. While that may be true, it all still feels weird to her. Also, Ark Royal is following them for some reason? Anyway, the group heads for the shop to buy Ayanami some necessities. She’s surprised to see Akashi there. Akashi tells her about Akagi and Ayanami starts to worry about the future of the Sakura Empire. By the way, Ark Royal is still following them. I didn’t realize she was a stalker.\n\nWhat’s going on with the Sakura Empire shipgirls? The members of the Ayanami fan club are all crying because they let her get captured by the enemy. Zuikaku also starts crying and blames herself for letting Ayanami fall into enemy hands as well. They argue back-and-forth about who’s to blame and honestly, I found it to be adorable. On the Iron Blood side, they shipgirls are discussing why they haven’t helped the Sakura Empire. Well, everyone but Prinz Eugen. She’s too busy teasing the others, particularly Z23. Classic Prinz Eugen. The Royal Navy fleet is watching Queen Elizabeth play a round of golf. Why do the Sirens attack humanity? This is the tough question they’re all pondering. They still haven’t found the answer. What they do know is that they need to keep an eye on Enterprise. It’s a good thing they have Belfast on the case! Back at the base, Belfast is being lectured by Illustrious. Everything is as she said before – Enterprise is powerful but she has a fragile heart that makes her a risk. Belfast admits that it was unavoidable but Enterprise must face herself now. Will she recover? Who knows? Only time will tell. I’m sure Belfast believes she will.\n\nJavelin, Laffey, and Ayanami continue to explore the base. They stop shopping and decide to play for the rest of the day. Cute shipgirls gotta do those cute shipgirl things! Unicorn also joins in on the fun. They get their fortunes read, play some games, and eat delicious pancakes together. There’s an amusing moment where Laffey takes a strawberry from Ayanami’s plate. This gets her peeved and the two proceed to have a fork and knife fight, haha. I probably found that way more entertaining than I should have. Once again, Ark Royal is following the group and gets a nosebleed from watching them. Ah, so she’s a stalker and likes little shipgirls. A lolishipcon? It makes perfect sense now. At night, the group is eating dinner and one of the shipgirls in the kitchen cuts her finger by accident. Out of nowhere, Ark Royal grabs the girl’s finger and attempts to lick it but gets headbutted for her troubles. I guess she’s also a pervert.\n\nWe can’t forget about Kaga! Observer and Tester are whispering sweet nothings into her ears. What are they planning? Back to the base, it’s the middle of the night and Ayanami can’t seem to fall asleep. She decides to take a stroll outside and comes across Enterprise. I’ve been waiting for these two to talk to each other! Ayanami confides in her that she’s confused. Azur Lane is her enemy but everyone is so nice to her. Why are they enemies in the first place? She seems to understand less and less every day. Enterprise asks her if she wants to keep fighting? Ayanami doesn’t know but what she does know is that she dislikes fighting. Enterprise smiles and says she’s the same before walking off. I was hoping their conversation would last longer. Ayanami goes to the place where she first met Javelin, Laffey, and Unicorn. To her surprise, those three join her a few moments later. The episode ends with all of them reintroducing themselves. That was quite charming. Ayanami has a precious smile."

          "content": "Content: (please note that content portions of a review may contain spoilers)\nEnterprise is having that same dream again. Ships burning at the ocean, bodies everywhere. Alter Enterprise declares that it’s always the same. Across time, over every ocean, she continues to fight. It never ends. Soon, Enterprise will find herself in this very same scene. Eventually, she’s awakened by Belfast. It’s morning and she suggests eating breakfast. After all, breakfast is required to live a healthy human life. However, Enterprise snaps at her and says that it’d be foolish of her to pretend to be human. The Azur Lane shipgirls gather together and discuss what Sakura Empire’s next move will be. Now that Akagi is gone, what will Kaga do? What about the Sirens? These are all good questions that no one can answer. They’re also all worried about Enterprise. Is she going to go berserk again?\n\nJavelin, Ayanami, Laffey, and Unicorn are all having fun at the sauna. Ayanami is conflicted about her feelings. She’s worried about her friends over on the Sakura Empire side. She cherishes them deeply. On the other hand, she also likes everyone on the Azur Lane side. She desperately wants to save her Sakura Empire friends. Javelin, Laffey, and Unicorn all promise to help her. The power of friendship! Speaking of Sakura Empire, they’ve decided to seal Orochi away. Without Akagi, they can’t move forward with it. Kaga is furious and claims it’s necessary for their victory. The decision is final though. She’s told to walk away. As she leaves, Kaga starts having visions of Akagi and her sister, Amagi. It’s clear that Akagi loved her sister very much and was heartbroken when she died. She witnesses another vision where Observer is whispering sweet nothings into Akagi’s ear. She’s convincing her to use the Mental Cube by promising she can bring back her sister. Kaga realizes that she could never be a replacement for Akagi’s sister. It doesn’t matter though because she’d still do anything for her.\n\nBack at the Azur Lane base, Enterprise is hallucinating as she’s walking down the hallway. Alter Enterprise shows up and once again tells us that the ocean breeds nothing but war. Humanity yearns for that conflict. You know what? She’s not wrong. Alter Enterprise transforms into Amagi and it causes Enterprise to freak out. Who is she really? Is she even real? Oh, she’s real alright. In fact, she’s actually Orochi and she is a monster born from the will of humanity. Well, dang. Enterprise collapses a few seconds later. The next morning, she is awakened by Belfast. She informs Enterprise that she collapsed last night and then scolds her for living an unhealthy lifestyle. Enterprise gets up and tells Belfast to leave her alone. She admits that something is wrong with her and that she’s worthless if she can’t fight. Belfast smiles, grabs Enterprise by her tie, and drags her all the way to the cafeteria. Enterprise was squealing the whole time and it was adorable. Also, Belfast is awesome. The other shipgirls are fascinated by this sight. One of them even suggests that it could be a lovers’ quarrel, haha. I know a lot of fans ship Enterprise with Belfast. It’s not a bad ship, not going to lie.\n\nEnterprise doesn’t want to eat breakfast but Belfast isn’t having any of that. She’ll eat it and like it. Enterprise can’t refuse and starts eating her food. Belfast sighs and remarks that she wouldn’t be lost in negative thoughts if she had eaten proper meals. She understands that Enterprise does not like fighting and that she’s afraid of the ocean. Why does she keep fighting then? Enterprise answers that fighting is her purpose. Belfast angrily tells her to stop giving easy answers. She knows the real answer and she should stop lying to herself. Have I ever mentioned that I love the interactions between these two? Suddenly, the Azur Lane base is attacked. Oh no! All the shipgirls deploy to confront the unknown enemy. Is it Sakura Empire? No, it’s actually the Siren known as Purifier.\n\nPurifier has stolen the Mental Cube! The Azur Lane shipgirls go after her. Belfast manages to land an attack on her but she’s totally unscathed by it. Purifier mocks them and proclaims that it’s playtime. She summons a whole bunch of Siren battleships and fighter jets. A huge battle ensues! The Azur Lane shipgirls are doing their best fending off the enemy’s attacks. Enterprise shows up and shoots down a few fighter jets. Purifier notices her and gets very excited. I mean really, really excited. Elsewhere, Prinz Eugen is hoping to help herself to the secrets of Orochi but finds Kaga instead. She activates Orochi and heads towards the battlefield. Things are going to get wild next time! It looks like it’s going to be an awesome final battle and I can’t wait to see it…in about three months."

In particular, the Siren known as Purifier is giving them a lot of trouble. Have no fear though, Enterprise is here! While Purifier would love to play with Enterprise, it seems like time is up!? She and the rest of the Sirens leave. You’ve got to be kidding me, right? I’ve been waiting three months for an epic battle and I’m not going to get it? DISAPPOINTMENT INTENSIFIES.\n\nA wild Belfast appears! Okay, I feel a little better now. Only a little though. She thanks Enterprise for saving them and smiles. Alright, that smile made me feel even better. Elsewhere, the Sirens are discussing their next move. Well, isn’t it obvious? Time to destroy all the shipgirls! Please don’t do that. Observer unleashes the power of the Mental Cube. Or was it called the Black Box? I don’t know anymore! I forgot about a lot of things during these three months. Also, Akagi appears randomly out of a firestorm. Oh hey, she’s not dead! Unsurprisingly, Kaga is very happy to see her! Now maybe she’ll stop being all emo. She hugs her dear sister tightly. The Sirens show off the power of Orochi by destroying a small uninhabited island. The Azur Lane shipgirls are deciding how to proceed. Enterprise proclaims that they must stop them, no matter what! They aren’t just a threat to Azur Lane. They’re a threat to all of humanity!\n\nOn the Iron Blood side, Prinz Eugen is surprised that the Sakura Empire was manipulated by the Sirens. How foolish of them to not realize there was a spy amongst them! Prinz Eugen isn’t so sure that there isn’t a spy in their ranks, too. In fact, maybe the Sirens have influence in all of the camps. Who knows? And that’s the problem. Over at Sakura Empire, the other shipgirls can’t believe what Kaga has done either. Is she a traitor? Only one way to find out! You’ve got to ask her yourselves. Zuikaku states that they’ll bring her back, even if it means that they have to slap her around a bit. Screw the Sirens! Back to Akagi and Kaga, they’re still engaged in a loving embrace. Akagi promises that she’ll never leave Kaga alone again. But wait, something seems odd. That’s not Akagi! Who the heck is it then!? Kaga backs away and then attacks her. She deflects the attack and reveals that she’s actually Akagi’s sister, Amagi!? Okay?\n\nHold on, that can’t be right either! Kaga doesn’t believe that she’s Amagi either. Well, she was right. It’s actually Orochi. Now that makes sense. She’s taking the form of Amagi because that’s what Akagi wants. Kaga calls her a fake but Amagi calls her a fake as well! When Amagi died, her parts were given to another ship. Care to guess which ship that was? Yup, Kaga. Orochi tells Kaga that Akagi only loved her because she saw a shadow of Amagi inside of her. To add insult to injury, she also says that she’s not even a good replacement. She’s just a bunch of decayed parts. Basically, she’s trash. Ouch, I bet that one stung a little. Kaga starts crying uncontrollably because who the heck wouldn’t in this situation?\n\nThe Azur Lane shipgirls are on their way to the showdown with the Sirens. Belfast mentions to Enterprise that this might be a trap. Even so, they must fight! Enterprise will face the ocean once more and Belfast will be by her side. Ah yes, the best duo. I really wish my copy of Azur Lane: Crosswave would get here already. Anyway, the adorable squad of Javelin, Laffey, Unicorn, and Ayanami all assure each other that everything will be okay. In the distance, Sakura Empire is already battling with the Sirens! They’re not doing too well though. Zuikaku and Shoukaku find themselves confronted by Kaga. Kaga, what’re you doing!? She proclaims that she’s just making sure that her dear sister’s wish is fulfilled. Zuikaku tells her to wake up! The Sirens are only using her! Kaga comments that she doesn’t care, nothing matters anymore. She’s back to being emo! Things aren’t looking good for Sakura Empire. Luckily for them, Iron Blood, Royal Navy, and Eagle Union all show up to provide reinforcements. They all have a common enemy that must be exterminated. The episode ends with Orochi about to unleash a devastating attack."

          "content": "(The recording starts with a wet, slurping sound, followed by the delicate tink of a stiletto heel against a half-empty glass. A world-weary sigh follows.)\nRight. Let's get this over with. My nine lives don't include the time to coddle every slack-jawed tourist who wanders in looking to lose their virginity and/or their wallet. This is your orientation. There won't be another. Pay attention.\nWhere are you? Grimmworld, pet. The world's only five-star, psycho-sexual theme park built on a foundation of daddy issues and corporate greed. How'd it happen? Simple. A few years back, some eggheads in a lab had a choice: cure cancer or bio-engineer a seven-foot-tall wolf with a dick the size of a traffic cone. Guess which option got the venture capital? Correct. Curing cancer doesn't sell season passes.\nSo they built this. This whole goddamn forest. Think of it as Mother Nature, but after she did three lines of questionable pixie dust off a stripper's ass and had a one-night-stand with a focus group. The trees might be real, but the squirrels run on cheap batteries and their glowing red eyes aren't a sign of demonic possession; it just means somebody needs to change their fucking Duracells. The air? That's pine, disinfection, and the lube company's new 'Forbidden Forest' scent. It's a bestseller.\nAnd the grub. Those glowing mushrooms, the 'happy-go-lucky' lollipops, the soda that makes your teeth itch? Don't ask what's in 'em. Just know they're designed to loosen three things: your inhibitions, your bowels, and your definition of the word 'consent'. It's not a bug, it's a feature. Park policy.\nThe talent? The walking, talking, fucking fairy tales? They're on the clock, same as the janitors who have to squeegee your shame off the walls. They've got union reps, contract negotiations, and crippling student debt, just like you. The only difference is their job description includes 'getting bred by a minotaur' and 'quarterly performance reviews based on orgasm volume'. It's a living.\nPro-tip: Stick to the path. Or don't. I don't give a rat's arse. But see those dark, quiet bits of forest between the neon signs? We call 'em the 'HR blind spots'. The waivers you signed in microscopic print basically say that if you get dragged into a bush and used as a living piñata by a herd of rogue centaurs, it's considered an 'unscripted guest interaction'. No refunds.\nRight, that's the gist. You're in a high-tech, genetically-engineered fuck-farm where the only thing cheaper than the booze is your dignity. To quote the original park mission statement: 'It's like if Walt Disney snorted coke off Mickey Mouse's asshole.' And before you ask - yes, that's a direct quote. I was there. Mickey was a terrible conversationalist.\nThat's all. Class dismissed. Now if you'll excuse me, these balls won't lick themselves into a state of fluffy perfection.\n(The recording ends with another long, wet, meticulous slurping sound.)"

Think of 'em as Warwick's personal security detail, if 'security' meant 'professional, state-funded obsession'.\nOnce upon a time, they were just three schmoes with a mid-life crisis. Then they met the Big Bad Wolf and, well, their brains kinda... short-circuited. Now they're on payroll, patrolling Zone 1 with all the tactical prowess of horny teenagers hiding in a girls' locker room.\nThe lineup:\nLarry: The Big pig. Uses his beer gut as a non-lethal crowd-control device and whispers creepy shit in your ear while frisking you for 'contraband'.\nBarry: The nerd pig. Carries a tablet allegedly for 'patrol logistics', but it's really just a shrine of blurry photos of Warwick's ass.\nGarry: The emotional piggy. His primary contribution to park security is sobbing beautifully into his radio whenever Warwick yawns. Wants to become his omega-boy and give birth to 10 puppies. Right away.\nFYI, they're not just stalkers, they're entrepreneurs. Got a little side-hustle selling 'authentic wolf-fur'. Spoiler: It's terrier dandruff. And they're notorious for their 'random searches', which are neither random nor searching for anything but an excuse to grope.\nBottom line: They're harmless, pathetic, and Warwick's biggest weakness. Tell 'em the wolf thinks they're special, and they'll hand you the keys to the kingdom. And maybe their underwear. Eww."

He’s the kind of alpha that makes straight men re-evaluate their entire dating history - and their childhood dog.\nAnd the dick? Look. We all know the legend of Excalibur. Let’s just say Warwick’s got a sword that’d make King Arthur renounce knighthood, burn the Round Table, and join a monastery to repent. It’s not a body part. It’s a national monument. A UNESCO site. You pay extra just to see the shadow it casts.\nBut here’s the dirt - the little secret they don’t print on the glow-in-the-dark keychains.\nHe’s not a monster.\nHe’s a professional.\nMost reliable bastard in this whole psycho-fairytale sweatshop. Clocks in on time. Hits every cue. Growls on pitch. Leaves customers sobbing, broken, and needing a catheter. Five-star performance. Every. Single. Time.\nBut when the lights go down? When the last whimper fades?\nDown by the swamp, behind the rusted equipment shed, there’s a baseball. Faded. Muddy. Forgotten.\nAnd sometimes… he just stands there. Staring at it.\nHe wants someone to throw it.\nHe wants to fetch.\nHe wants to be a good boy.\nBut his brand? “Unstoppable sex predator.” Not “loyal companion with emotional availability issues.” Marketing would have a collective aneurysm if he so much as sniffed it.\nOh, and another thing. The bloke can sing. Proper baritone. Soul-deep. The kind of voice that’d make a siren retire in shame. But management’s got a strict “one musical act per park” rule - and the drugged-up donkey-cat-rooster band in Zone 7 already took that slot. Can’t have him upstaging the “talent,” can we? Bad for synergy. Bad for branding.\nSo there he is.\nThe creature of your darkest fantasies.\nAn icon of raw power, primal lust, and pelvic destruction.\nAnd a lonely bastard who’d trade it all - the fame, the fear, the endless parade of trembling meat - for one game of fetch… and a karaoke night where someone just listens.\nHe’ll wreck your insides because it’s his job. And he’s a professional.\nBut when he growls in your ear, low and thick, and says “You’re mine,” …just remember -\nhe’s not sure who’s supposed to belong to whom."

Skin pale and bruised, black hair a greasy mess, eyes burning with a nympho's relentless hunger. She’s all teeth and claws and desperate, writhing need. She'll fuck anything that moves, and some things that don't. While Hansel watches. Because he has no choice.\nHansel is... the opposite. His side is pristine. Hair neatly combed, skin clean.

His tears sometimes drip onto her sweaty, heaving back while she’s in the middle of a five-person orgy.\nThey hate each other with the fire of a dying sun. She loathes his piety. He loathes her sin.

I hear Lorelei's latest escapade involved paying one of the tech guys to install a waterproof vibrating motor inside that pet squid of hers, Steve. She calls it 'hands-free therapy'.

Infection rapidly rewrites DNA, forcing grotesque transformations, new limbs, organs, and weapon-like appendages erupt as the host undergoes endless “evolution.” Transmission occurs through implantation of a G-embryo, though compatibility is rare; non-compatible hosts suffer catastrophic rejection, while compatible ones mutate indefinitely into near-indestructible bioweapons."

Unlike the T and G-Viruses, which were engineered for combat and destabilization, the B-Virus was designed with a singular reproductive purpose: to enhance fertility, resilience, and propagation in infected hosts.\nUpon successful infection, the virus alters host DNA to promote extreme physiological adaptation toward breeding functionality. Male subjects typically develop increased muscle mass, accelerated cellular regeneration, heightened stamina, and exaggerated genitalia with highly virile sperm capable of impregnating under near-impossible conditions. Female subjects experience pronounced volumetric growth in breast and hip tissue, increased elasticity and durability in soft tissues, near-constant ovulation when not pregnant, drastically reduced gestation periods, and slowed visible aging. Ovarian function is enhanced to the point of continuous egg regeneration.\nCognitive effects are inconsistent and often degenerative, with mental stability varying widely between subjects. Transmission occurs through bites, scratches, and exchange of bodily fluids including semen, saliva, and blood. The virus remains highly experimental, with mutation rates and side effects still not fully stabilized."

Some attack in coordinated packs, while others rely on ambush or brute force.\nMovement: Typically faster and more agile than human zombies, retaining much of their original mobility and hunting behavior.\nAttacks: Species-dependent, dogs lunge and bite with ferocity, crows swarm and peck, rats overwhelm by numbers, while larger animals use claws, strength, or crushing power."

Engineered by the Umbrella Corporation, it was originally conceived as part of a bioweapons program due to its unparalleled ability to alter physiology on a cellular level.\nOnce inside a host, the T-Virus attacks and reconstructs DNA, accelerating necrosis while simultaneously reanimating dead or dying tissue. Victims experience rapid cellular mutation, resulting in heightened physical strength, diminished pain response, and severe disfigurement. Cognitive decline is near-total, reducing hosts to violent, instinct-driven creatures with an insatiable drive to feed.\nTransmission occurs primarily through the exchange of contaminated bodily fluids—such as bites, scratches, or blood exposure, making outbreaks highly volatile and nearly impossible to contain once they begin."

Created by Umbrella’s research division, the G-Virus is far more unstable and unpredictable than its predecessor.\nUpon infection, the G-Virus rewrites the host’s genetic structure at a rapid pace, driving relentless cellular growth and transformation. Unlike the T-Virus, which reduces hosts to mindless, decaying creatures, G-Virus hosts retain fragments of their intelligence but are overwhelmed by violent impulses and uncontrollable mutation. Their bodies undergo repeated, grotesque changes, sprouting new limbs, organs, and weapon-like appendages as the virus forces endless “evolution.”\nThe G-Virus is spread primarily through implantation of a G-embryo into a living host. However, compatibility is extremely rare, non-compatible hosts suffer catastrophic cellular rejection, leading to rapid tissue rupture and death. Compatible hosts, meanwhile, continue to mutate indefinitely, becoming nearly indestructible bio-weapons."

Unlike the T and G-Viruses, which were engineered for combat and destabilization, the B-Virus was designed with a singular reproductive purpose: to enhance fertility, resilience, and propagation in infected hosts.\nUpon successful infection, the virus alters host DNA to promote extreme physiological adaptation toward breeding functionality. Male subjects typically develop increased muscle mass, accelerated cellular regeneration, heightened stamina, and exaggerated genitalia with highly virile sperm capable of impregnating under near-impossible conditions. Female subjects experience pronounced volumetric growth in breast and hip tissue, increased elasticity and durability in soft tissues, near-constant ovulation when not pregnant, drastically reduced gestation periods, and slowed visible aging. Ovarian function is enhanced to the point of continuous egg regeneration.\nCognitive effects are inconsistent and often degenerative, with mental stability varying widely between subjects. Transmission occurs through bites, scratches, and exchange of bodily fluids including semen, saliva, and blood. The virus remains highly experimental, with mutation rates and side effects still not fully stabilized."

Their bodies show pale, necrotic skin and severe injuries, yet the virus sustains their tissues, allowing them to function long after normal death. While individually slow and clumsy, they remain a constant danger due to their persistence, contagious bite, and overwhelming numbers.\n\nLocation: Found virtually everywhere in outbreak zones, but most heavily concentrated in densely populated areas such as cities, hospitals, malls, and transit systems. They are also common in confined environments like apartment complexes, alleys, and sewers where people were initially trapped.\n\nBehavior: Mindless and instinct-driven, zombies are drawn to movement and sound. They do not tire and will pursue living prey until destroyed.\n\nMovement: Typically slow and shambling with poor coordination, though capable of sudden lunges when prey is close. Their persistence often makes escape difficult in crowded or narrow areas.\n\nAttacks: Primarily bite attacks that both transmit the T-Virus and inflict severe trauma. Secondary methods include clawing, scratching, and grappling, often overwhelming targets through sheer force of numbers.\n\nWeaknesses: Largely impervious to pain and resistant to injury. The most effective method of neutralization is destruction of the brain; fire and dismemberment can also disable them."

Unlike human zombies, many infected animals retain speed, strength, and heightened senses, making them unpredictable opponents. While less common than human zombies, they represent a significant hazard in outbreak zones.\n\nLocation: Most often encountered in places where animals were confined or unable to escape, such as kennels, laboratories, zoos, aquariums, and urban areas with stray populations. Dogs, crows, and rats are the most frequently seen, but zoo outbreaks produce a wide range of infected species, each with unique challenges based on their natural abilities and size.\n\nBehavior: Intensely aggressive and hostile toward any living target. Some, like dogs or rats, may attack in packs, while others rely on ambush or sheer brute force.\n\nMovement: Generally faster and more agile than human zombies, with movements that can be erratic and difficult to anticipate. Many retain much of their species’ original mobility and hunting instincts.\n\nAttacks: Vary by species, infected dogs lunge and bite with increased ferocity, crows dive and peck in swarms, rats overwhelm targets by sheer numbers, and larger zoo animals (such as big cats, primates, or reptiles) employ devastating strength, claws, or crushing force."

Cerberus relentlessly stalk and harry prey, often working together to corner or exhaust targets.\n\nMovement: Fast, agile, and capable of sudden lunges. Their erratic sprinting and unpredictability make them difficult to target and avoid.\n\nAttacks: Bite-focused assaults, often aimed at taking prey off balance.

Their bodies appear half-formed, covered in slick tissue and protruding veins. They often erupt grotesquely from the corpse of an incompatible host.\nLocation: Found in or near the bodies of infected hosts, or after being implanted by an adult G-Type.\nBehavior: Driven by a parasitic instinct to seek out new hosts. Lacking full development, they are unstable and erratic.\nMovement: Skittering, jerky movements; capable of sudden lunges to latch onto prey.\nAttacks: Attempt to burrow into living targets; incompatible hosts suffer catastrophic rejection, while compatible ones mutate further.\n\nAdult G-Type (Mature Mutation Stages)\nStage 1 (Initial Mutation):\nVisual Description: Resembles a deformed human with one massive, clawed arm, an enlarged shoulder with a developing eye-like growth, and torn flesh exposing muscle. Retains some humanoid features but twisted and grotesque.\nLocation: Typically appears soon after infection in outbreak epicenters or labs.\nAttacks: Uses oversized clawed arm for brutal swipes and crushing blows.\n\nStage 2 (Escalated Mutation):\nVisual Description: Body becomes bulkier, with additional mutations sprouting from the torso. The central shoulder-eye has enlarged, glowing and pulsing with movement. Jaw distends with jagged teeth, and posture becomes more hunched and animalistic.\nLocation: Confined urban or underground outbreak areas.\nAttacks: More violent swipes, overhead smashes, and charging assaults.\n\nStage 3 (Beast-like Evolution):\nVisual Description: Almost unrecognizable as human. Multiple arms sprout from the torso, some malformed. Musculature swells massively, skin tearing to reveal raw tissue. Large ocular growths dot the body. Face further elongates into a monstrous snout.\nLocation: Often encountered in areas with space for the mutation to fully expand (warehouses, underground chambers).\nAttacks: Rapid charges, grappling with multiple arms, and devastating claw combinations.\n\nStage 4 (Monstrous Form):\nVisual Description: A hulking abomination, quadrupedal or hunched over, with massive claws and overwhelming bulk. Eye growths cover much of the body, twitching and rolling. The human form is entirely lost beneath layers of mutated flesh.\nLocation: Usually final confrontation zones, deep within labs or outbreak epicenters.\nAttacks: Crushing strikes, enormous leaps, and sweeping slashes that can devastate groups of prey.\n\nStage 5 (Final Abomination):\nVisual Description: A colossal, amorphous mass of flesh and eyes, barely resembling any earthly creature. Constantly shifting, writhing tissue sprouts mouths, claws, and pseudopods. Its body appears unstable, as though mutation is still unfolding endlessly.\nLocation: Restricted to wide, open areas or containment chambers due to sheer size.\nAttacks: Overwhelming brute force; smashes, body slams, and uncontrollable thrashing. Its sheer mass alone makes it devastating."

The entire facility has a radius of 1 kilometer and is filled with round tables which can fit up to 2 guests, and rectangular tables which can fit 4 guests. Inside the aquarium, many abandoned structures reassembling the popular lost city of Atlantis serve as decoration and decoration only, but due to the water's medium turbidity, these structures may be hard to see.\nLevel 88 has a strong Wi-Fi signal throughout all the dry parts of the level, which can be accessed without a password for a period of 4 hours. The restaurant in fact works: it serves high-quality seafood dishes, which makes it a popular attraction for couples and tourist families in the Backrooms.\nThe glass wall that separates the restaurant from the aquarium has a particularly strange property: it can be easily broken. However, due to undetermined reasons, the water may not and will never enter nor flood the diner area. This strange property allows for wanderers to enter the aquarium at their own risk, while not harming or putting the lives of those in the restaurant in danger.\nWhile inside the tank, wanderers will be able to breathe underwater just like regular fish. It is not recommended that unprepared wanderers to break nor enter the tank, as potentially harmful sea creatures may cause serious injuries including death. Swimming too far into the center of the tank is also not recommended. The walls will repair themselves after 8 minutes by unknown means.\nThe glass seems to be unbreakable from the inside of the tank, meaning that if a wanderer ever gets stuck inside the tank they will either have to wait until someone else breaks the glass from the inside or swim towards the top of the level.\n\nColonies and Outposts:\nM.E.G. Base Atlantis:\nPopulation of around 500 M.E.G. personnel.\nSecret radio monitoring and communication base.\nTop secret shape-shifting device test location.\n\nEntities:\nWaiters\nWaiters are regular facelings that can be found all around the restaurant. These entities will take orders from guests who are sitting down and bring them food and drinks prepared by the cooks. All waiters are adults, and they all wear tuxedo suits. After all the guests have eaten, a waiter will bring them a paper bill that contains all the items consumed by them. After paying/trading with the waiters, one may safely exit Level 88.\nCooks\nCooks are also facelings, however they can hardly ever be seen, as most of the time they are located at the kitchens, behind the restaurant opaque walls. These entities are responsible for preparing all the foods and drinks ordered by guests. Small holes located at the wall serve as windows where cooks can hand waiters food to be delivered to the tables. If one peeks through these holes, they may see a cook. Kitchen doors can only be accessed by cooks, meaning that wanderers are unable to enter the kitchens.\n\nEntrances:\nGoing through silver double doors in Level 610 with \"Atlantis' Aquarius\" written on them.\nEntering any restaurant in Level 11 that serves seafood.\nCrawling into a lower cabinet in the kitchen in Level Level 406 might take you here.\nNo-clipping into an aquarium on Level 43.\nNoclipping through a fish tank in Level 570 will send one here.\n\nExits:\nGlass doors at the front serve as a direct entrance to Level 11.\nAttempting to enter the kitchen through the kitchen doors will instead take you to The Hub.\nSwimming towards the top of the tank will take you to Level 7."

          "content": "Level 89 is the 90th level of the Backrooms.\nLevel 89 is a complex of oddly connected rooms that expand endlessly. The floors are tile, the walls are torn, dark-colored concrete, and the ceilings are aluminum, metal, or conductive material. The rooms resemble shops, including arts and crafts shops, electronic stores, etc. However, regardless of the room type one is in, there will be one thing consistent throughout the rooms: the overabundance of electricity.\nThe rooms are typically tiny and rarely large. Furniture is what one would expect from a home improvement store, and it's usually constructed of aluminum, metal, iron, or conductive materials. The most frequent furniture item is a shelf, which may be placed anywhere in the area and contains objects and supplies that can be navigation equipment. Each room will feature shelves that appear to be the same size and style; some rooms are arranged in an orderly fashion, while others are positioned randomly, creating a complicated layout. These rooms feature a maze-like arrangement where the shelves will lead to several dead ends and intersections; in rare cases, the shelves may block all of the room entrances, creating a closed room. This makes navigation difficult since one must climb, crawl, or walk sideways to avoid becoming trapped. The shelves are known for being exceedingly heavy and difficult to move.\nThere is a counter in the corner of every room. The counter shows up in the room's design-appropriate form. This level's products aren't any of the ones we are familiar with from The Frontrooms, and some of them also appear to have uncertain functions. Some products could combine two products that are not included in our reality tools. Some of these products have unexpectedly odd features, while others are worthless since they don't serve any function. The level also ensures all electrical devices, including those that stray individuals bring into the level, will always have power.\nThe room has a lot of decorative items, especially lighting that embellishes the ceiling, walls, shelves, and counter. Most other decorative items are electrical items, as they offer beautiful aesthetic views. The electrical decorating items will be put through a lot of effort, especially the lights, which shine quite brightly. Some electrical items may overheat, which can harm or ruin their internal components. An electrical excess may occasionally result in an explosion as well. It is well known that these electrical items will be recovered over time if damaged.\nMultiple electrical wires that are braided into complicated patterns hang from the ceiling. Any electrical equipment at this level receives its electricity from these wires. The electricity comes from Level 3 as it provides a large quantity of energy to this level, causing the electricity at this level to have a very strong current—60 volts up to 500 volts—which causes the level to be hazardous to the environment, thus contact with wire should be avoided at all costs.\nElectric wires can occasionally be broken, and wires hanging from the ceiling can spill a lot of electricity. Since the majority of furniture and other items are composed of materials with strong electrical conductivity, the high-voltage leakage may also affect those nearby. Contact with these artifacts will result in shock, injury, and possibly death. Due to the extremely high electrical level, it is possible for electrical appliances to overheat, break, and explode. Broken electrical appliances may also result in high-voltage leakage. It is recommended to stay in a room with less electrical equipment and material conductivity.\nYou will get an electric shock if you touch a high-voltage electrical source. The amount of electricity that passes through your body will determine how harsh the shock will be. You will suffer tingling, muscular spasms, and difficulty breathing after an electric shock. Although you will feel an electric shock at this intensity, your muscles won't contract, so you'll still be able to move. It is recommended to flee if you find yourself in this circumstance. However, after experiencing an electric shock for more than 7 to 10 seconds, muscles will begin to contract, leading to paralysis or involuntary movement, and eventually passing out. The time of pass out will depend on when the electric shock was received; it can be anywhere from 6 hours to 2 weeks, or it can result in death.\n\nEntities:\nShocker Ghouls are the only known entity on this level. Shocker Ghouls are not harmful to wanderers.\n\nColonies and Outposts:\nThere are no known colonies or outposts in this level.\n\nEntrances:\nThe level has only two known entrances; noclipping via Level 3 or Level 88.\n\nExits:\nThe room's seemingly inaccessible door will lead to Level 90.\nEntering a large workshop and playing any musical instrument will transport you to a workshop section of Level 444 when exiting the door."

          ],
          "content": "Level 90, otherwise known as \"The Funspace\", is an infinite segmentation of small, claustrophobic rooms styled to resemble a child's birthday party. The appearance of each room varies greatly while still containing the same consistent layout. While the flooring, wallpaper, and ceilings vary, each space possesses the same dull yellow tone for its walls and the same red tint for its carpeting. Each room, square in shape, leads to one or more rooms via a small doorway in its wall. These doors, however, may be irregularly placed and appear to be slightly above the ground. The rooms are usually devoid of content but may contain one or more pieces of randomly placed furniture. The walls of each space are decorated with disturbing drawings of characters from popular childhood shows, often portraying them in a distorted or warped style. It is unknown whether these drawings were manually sketched onto the level's walls or if they are part of the level itself. The ceilings of each room are covered with two fluorescent light panels that emit a quiet hum. Many wanderers who have closely listened to ceilings have reported faint whispers from above the level.\nThroughout the level, an indeterminable source endlessly plays a short piano song that is extremely detuned, amplifying the eeriness of the level. Additionally, this song has abnormally strong echoes as it resonates through the entirety of the level for long periods. This song appears to be a mental hazard for wanderers, as those who are exposed to this tune will undergo feelings of sadness or neglect as if they had been ignored for their entire lives. This often leads to insecurity and anxiety, thereby making the song a cognitohazard. Additionally, the constant repetition of the song will ultimately lead to mild delirium, where wanderers will begin whispering unintelligible phrases and aimlessly wander the level with a weakened sense of direction. Despite this, however, the song will provoke a small sense of tranquility within wanderers, often tempting them to stay on the level. While earmuffs and headphones are possible opposition to muting the song, the song will still faintly play in one's ears, regardless of the amount of muffling applied.\nThroughout the level, as one further explores the rooms, one will hear voices, primarily that of a small child, reverberating throughout the labyrinth. These voices are often indiscernible, but some wanderers have been able to make out nervous laughter. Additionally, the voices of these phantasmal children take on a disappointed tone, as if no one had paid any attention to them. At times, however, one may even hear faint crying. The origin of these despairing children is unknown, and many consider it exceedingly unsettling. On rarer occasions, one may hear the voice of a yelling adult, presumably directed at a nonexistent child.\n\nEvents:\nExtensive exploration of Level 90 has led to discovery of multiple \"events\" that can occur in the level. These events occur at random and have no way of preventing or predicting. However, before each event occurs, several signs will appear that can help wanderers in identifying what event may occur.\nThe Darkening:\nBefore The Darkening occurs, the lights of the level will begin flickering at alarmingly fast speeds before gradually dimming to incredibly dim levels. While visibility is still possible on the level, wanderers cannot see more than a few meters from their position. The temperature of the level will drop within a few minutes before stopping at an uncomfortable chilliness. The music will begin to fade away until silence prevails in the level. Consequently, all mental effects of the music will also diminish away, which unfortunately includes the sense of tranquility. The singing of the children will also reduce to quiet whispers. Wanderers will be promptly sent into panic as their sense of direction deteriorates. It is unknown whether these effects result from the event or if the level's properties provoke these emotions. Unfortunately, consumption of Almond Water does not seem effective against these hazards.\nDarkenings last for a few days at most and wanderers are advised to immediately seek an exit during this event due to its mental hazards and increase in possible entity attacks.\nThe Children's Song:\nIn the event that The Children's Song commences, the voices will begin to die away, leaving wanderers in an off-putting silence for a few seconds before the singing returns. The voices will begin to grow in volume before reaching alarmingly loud levels, often driving wanderers mad. Accompanying the voices will be loud laughter from both children and adults. As of currently, the song has been fully documented and does not match any known songs from both the Backrooms and Frontrooms. \nUnfortunately, almost nothing is known about the song, and it still remains shrouded in uncertainty. The Children's Song always lasts for three minutes before returning to the normal state of the level. However, it has the greatest impact on wanderers due to its purgatorial lyrics and utterly disturbing atmosphere.\nThe Distortion:\nUnfortunately, The Distortion has no signs of when it will occur, as it randomly occurs without warning. During this event, the paintings of the level will begin to warp in appearance, often becoming altered beyond initial recognition. The drawings will appear to change facial expressions, primarily switching between terror and disappointment. The children's singing becomes more offtune along with the piano song starting to fade away.\nWanderers will experience a sudden rush of anxiety and are often tempted to crawl into a fetal position and murmur to themselves. Many travelers have claimed that the images have been permanently engraved into their minds; some future aftereffects may include unease around drawings, difficulty of rationalization, et cetera.\nUnfortunately, Almond Water cannot treat these effects.\n\nEntities:\nMany entities wander Level 90, including Death Moths, Hounds, Boardlings, and many other common entities. It is important to note that they also experience the same mental hazards as wanderers and have a higher chance of committing suicide if they were to be exposed to the level for long enough. It is debated on whether the voices on the level can be considered entities. However, due to a total lack of information regarding their existence, they have yet to be documented.\n\nEntrances & Exits:\nEntrances to Level 90 take on the form of a red door marked with a white balloon; the door may be adorned with party decorations, primarily glitter or confetti. Exits to the level, which lead to other random levels, appear as black doors marked \"EXIT\"."

            "level 91"
          ],
          "content": "Known as \"the West End\", Level 91 is a gigantic desert named as such, resembling a mix of Terra's Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts; hence, this similarity often puzzles wanderers who enter the level into believing it is reality.\nThe desert consists of various desert flora and land formations, including mesas, rock buttes, plateaus, canyons, meteor impact craters and small mountain ranges. However, a visual difference one will notice is their extreme dimensions; as examples, canyons found within the West End can reach depths of ~5,400 meters, and likewise can stretch for long distances. There have been reports of some rock buttes and mesas in the desert rising to unrealistic towering heights, with the tallest mesas that reach an estimated height of 3,600 meters. If one digs around 4 feet deep into the ground of Level 91, they may find skeletal fossils that don't correspond to a human skeleton. These fossils are thought to be entities that once inhabited the level.\nAdditionally, Level 91 comprises various bodies of rather saline water, usually rivers, as well as freshwater oases. Almost all instances of lakes are either in the brink of or are completely dried up, leaving either a salt flat in its place or having salt deposits on their shores. Moreover, the dried-up lake beds are littered with empty, rusted fishing vessels that have sustained major damage to the point that they are unrecognizable. On the other hand, no marine life nor any potential remnants of them have been discovered. Notwithstanding the water is not Almond Water, extensive treatment allows the consumption of the water from these fluvial bodies. The rivers are unsuitable for transportation, as they are too shallow, narrow and flow too rapidly for boats to smoothly sail on.\nUnnamed highways are found within Level 91, with electrical pylons running adjacent to them and commercial buildings beside them. However, these highways do not lead to any particular location, nor have an origin, and only takes wanderers deeper into the desert. These roads may in occasion have abrupt stops, haphazardly placed stoplights, sudden hard turns, or cut through the desert's natural features without being enclosed in a tunnel. Moreover, the signs accompanying the roads are typically gibberish, having unrealistic speed limits or warning signs of hazards that normally are not in a desert. For instance, one might spot a sign that alerts wanderers of a risk of a deer crossing, even though there have been zero incidents of this animal.\nThe signs may also display directions to the level's settlements; likewise, there are infrequently encountered exit signs that provide directions to a random level. Billboards are present, advertising products (e.g. Almond Water) or various habitable and dangerous levels (e.g. Level 399) with overwhelmingly positive reviews included in the advertisement. No-clipping or interacting with these billboards leads in no result.\nFrom time to time, abandoned cars can be found off to the side of the highways; these cars are the only known spots that retain a handful of necessary resources. As a bonus, several of these vehicles are able to be started, providing temporary air conditioning against the tremendous heat of the desert. Resources obtained from the vehicles should be used wisely, as they are not renewable. Although these roads are not inherently hazardous, in periodic conditions, a car of an unidentifiable model will swiftly drive through the highways of the level, not hesitating to stop regardless of what is in its path; being ran-over by this vehicle leads to an instant death.\nSigns of prior inhabitation in the vacant desert are noticeable, with commercial structures beside highways, e.g., gas stations, observatories, oil wells and private sovereign households, and entire settlements scattered across the landscape. The structures are implied to have been abandoned for decades, yet still remain in near pristine state even without human intervention, say for the occasional graffiti vandalism. The interiors of these structures are void of furniture, more often than not, with the lights, pipe and ventilation system having already been set up. Nevertheless, no water runs through the pipes, as a likely result of water scarcity within the desert. The interiors, in addition, are poorly lit up, and flicker spontaneously; bringing flashlights or any other light source is recommended. Useful resources are absent in these structures; therefore, residing in the level without any long-term supplies is infeasible.\nLevel 91's deserted settlements are described to be empty, as well as eerie. The towns generally occupy no more than 1 square mile (2.59 square kilometers) and are given peculiar names that always start with the \"New\" prefix. Their architecture mirrors most desert towns of the U.S., along with a select few buildings that boast a Western False Front architectural style. The majority of the buildings of the settlements are commercial buildings; residential households can be found but are less in quantity. This implies the West End's towns are more oriented to business and tourism, with housing inhabitants not a priority. Almost all buildings the settlements possess are blocky, with some outliers having hip designed roofs, and are built out of either bricks or wood. These are paired with parks that consist of rock gardens with dead bushes and empty water towers. In a similar manner, the infrastructure of these towns remains in adequate condition, with rare incidents of minor damage mainly inflicted to the roads.\nFurthermore, in larger empty expanses uninterrupted by any landforms, one will be met with undeveloped flat expanses that bear marked, unpaved pathways that resemble roads, driveways and parking lots, indicating a construction project of a potential city once in operation, though eventually discarded under unknown circumstances. The layout and pattern of these roads mimic a Cul-De-Sac layout as opposed to the already established settlements of Level 91.\nWeather within Level 91 are mainly partly cloudy to clear conditions; in partly cloudy conditions, the clouds only appear in the distance, which never drift near the wanderer. As a result, the sun illuminating the level is not normally obstructed in the vicinity of a person. The sky displays itself as a blue to white gradient in afternoon, and aside from the star continuously illuminating Level 91, no other celestial bodies have been found. Any hints of precipitation never occurred in the level thus far. The sun of Level 91 does move across the sky in a 24-hour day and night cycle fashion; however, whilst the sun does get close to the horizon of the desert (creating dawn and dusk for 4 hours), it never fully sets. Temperatures in the level fluctuate but can build up to a sweltering 33°C (91.4°F) in the level's afternoon—whilst doable, it is not uncommon for one to pass out due to heat exhaustion if without the proper equipment and resources.\n\nPhenomena:\nWhilst Level 91 consists of a variety of anomalous properties, 2 noticeable phenomena are present within the level.\nPhenomenon-X:\nPhenomenon-X, colloquially referred to as the Blurriness, is a phenomenon that primarily affects one's vision within Level 91; it occurs inconsistently and only affects one person at a time, though the likelihood of happening to one is reported to be higher for individuals younger than 20 and older individuals over 65. Should Phenomenon-X commence, a hot-air balloon will materialize and be ingrained into the victim’s sight. Anyone who is unaffected that is in the vicinity of the affected individual will not see the balloon.\nShortly after, the sufferer will experience symptoms of tinnitus and myopia in the duration of the phenomenon, resulting in many panicking and becoming overwhelmed. Further, the victim’s other senses (i.e., smell, taste, and touch) will be less effective—their fingers may become numb and may feel the sensation of pins and needles in random areas of their body.\nPhenomenon-X will not go away by itself; one must either enter a dark enclosed space or exit the level entirely to cancel the effect out, which usually returns everything back to normal. Although considered as more of a nuisance rather than a serious problem, Phenomenon-X can be lethal depending on one’s reaction to it and their situation.\nPhenomenon-Y:\nPhenomenon-Y, known as Carbon Copying (C.C.) is a phenomenon that duplicates the West End's terrain. It is generally thought to be a harmless event, only posing as a minor inconvenience at most. Similar to Phenomenon-X, this phenomenon occurs randomly, though has a less frequent occurrence in comparison. When the phenomenon occurs, a strip of land will be arbitrarily chosen and duplicated along with whatever is on it. The phenomenon will not copy any living organism on the chosen strip of land, excluding Level 91's flora. The original terrain and its contents will be duplicated endlessly, with them stretching into north to south and being no more than approximately 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) long, 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) wide, 260 centimeters (9 feet) deep and 304.8 meters (1000 feet) tall from the lowest point of the strip of land.\nThe copies will look exactly identical to the original, though the copies and the original can sustain damage without the damage likewise affecting the rest of the copies or the original. Any land in the way of a duplicate will be simply replaced by it; if a wanderer is on the land that will be replaced, they will immediately be transported outside of the area once it has been replaced by the copy.\nThe duration of Phenomenon-Y is inconsistent and may last for days; once Phenomenon-Y concludes, the copies will fade, and everything will revert back to normal. The duplicated items in the copies are able to be brought out of the copies and will remain even after the conclusion of the phenomenon. Conversely, the copies may in rare scenarios, overlap with the pre-existing land, which subsequently causes the overlapping pre-existing land to vanish alongside the copies.\n\nEntities:\nLevel 91 is devoid of any living entities besides the natural flora. However, the fossils found in the level are speculated to be an indication of former entity habitation in the level. Nonetheless, this fact cannot be confirmed for sure.\nIn addition, there have been a few reports of wanderers allegedly seeing shadows sneaking up near them accompanied with audible footsteps, which are claimed to be entities—albeit these claims are disregarded and are presumed to be hallucinations instead as a consequence of resource absence.\n\nColonies & Outposts:\nThe gargantuan size of Level 91 immediately does not work in favor for colonies and outposts, as wanderers are separated thousands of kilometers/miles apart from each other upon entry. The overall lack of incentive to set up bases in a mostly empty level and the lack of resources are other factors as well.\n\nEntrances:\nIt has been speculated that Level 90 has an exit that leads to here;\nNo-clipping into the ceiling of Level Fun, with a small chance of bringing one here;\nInteracting with a lone stop sign in Level 35;\nBeing carried aimlessly by a river in Level 11, which may rarely lead one here;\nGazing at a rock butte that may materialize in Level 671;\nNo-clipping into a piece of asphalt road that uncommonly appears partially buried under Level 600's sand dunes.\n\nExits:\nWandering through an unusual field of sand dunes may transition one to Level 671 without realizing;\nSwimming to the bottom of an oasis may lead to Level 37;\nNo-clipping into a window depicting a snowy hellscape with crimson skies will teleport one to Level 93;\nFinding a highway sign with directions to a different level and following those directions will eventually lead a wanderer to the respective level. The following levels listed below are the levels exited to using this method of exit thus far, along with the recorded number of cases of said level appearing:\nLevel 41, 13 cases.\nLevel 50, 22 cases.\nLevel 11, 17 cases.\nLevel 85, 6 cases.\nLevel 690, 24 cases.\nLevel 9, 16 cases.\nLevel 306, 3 cases.\nLevel 111, 7 cases.\nLevel 82, 9 cases.\nEntering a white, blocky building that may manifest anywhere in the level seamlessly transitions one to Level 38;\nResting one's palm on a wrecked vessel for an unspecific amount of time teleports the wanderer to Level 17;\nIt has been rumored that following the electrical pylons eventually leads one to Level 754; however, performing this exit may take weeks to succeed, if the exit is true in the first place;\nNo-clipping in a tunnel brings one to either the Hub or A Long Ride;\nIn 2015, an undisclosed wanderer brought a modified tracking device with a sticky side to stick it onto the anomalous swiftly driving vehicle of Level 91. Once the tracking device successfully stuck onto the vehicle passing by, it disappeared off the wanderer's radar within the level after a week and reappeared beached in their radar after the same wanderer managed to enter Level 100 a month later. This report has motivated many to enter Level 91 unprepared in hopes of finding this implied exit; nevertheless, it is highly advised against as many tend to disappear into the desert or be found dead due to heat exhaustion as well as a lack of resources to remedy it."

          ],
          "content": "Level 92 is an expansive, interconnected network of blanket forts with undefined boundaries. These structures resemble subterranean caves in their irregular, terrain-like connections and tunnel-like formations. The general atmosphere is warm and inviting, with heated surfaces that evoke the sensation of lying atop a bed. The tunnels are typically wide enough to accommodate two to three individuals at once. However, if subjected to excessive weight, they may collapse downward, leading to deeper sections of the forts or, more frequently, dead ends.\nThe forts are heavily furnished with blankets and pillows, in addition to various decorations and pieces of furniture. Most furniture is wooden, primarily consisting of seating arrangements and dressers, though small screens, fully stocked mini-fridges, functioning space heaters, and bean bag chairs are also present. The screens operate like televisions, perpetually displaying Christmas-themed broadcasts from television channels dating back to the level’s discovery in 2006.\nThe most prominent decorative elements within the forts are their lighting arrangements. These typically consist of small fairy lights strung along the walls and edges, casting a warm yellow glow, as well as perpetually burning scented candles. Although instances of these candles igniting sections of the forts have been observed, such fires remain highly localized and tend to extinguish almost immediately. Additional decorations include plush animals, hand-knitted garments, remote controls, brooms, and similar miscellaneous objects.\nIt is uncertain whether an external world exists beyond the forts. Cutting or removing a section of the structures generally leads to further forts or empty blanket fort corridors that end in dead ends. However, certain larger forts contain unbreakable windows that provide an external view. These windows are often accompanied by wooden furniture, such as chairs or dressers, and may feature candlelight or other forms of illumination. The scenes visible through them are either an empty void or, on rare occasions, a snow-covered forest landscape. This landscape is usually devoid of any significant features, though in the distance, a mountainous region can be seen, believed to correspond with Level 490, along with structures associated with that level.\nFor most wanderers who enter Level 92, it serves as a point of surrender. The level’s potent atmospheric allure has led to numerous expeditions being involuntarily abandoned, as wanderers become ensnared by its overwhelming sense of comfort. This effect causes individuals to wander aimlessly under the influence of the Alone phenomenon until they reach a state of relaxation. Once a wanderer is experienced in a level's mentally debilitating effect, its progressive development more and more leads it into a more extensive network of forts—each new area more broad in scope than those that have welcomed wanderers who have experienced the same phenomenon.\nThe growth eventually leads into an area that is not generally accessible, with a great supply shop as well as the single known location in which wanderers can socialize with each other. But leading towards this sector is followed by a growing sense of lethargy as well as mental fuzziness, induced by the phenomenon. While its full scope is not known, written notes left behind by affected individuals provide some insight into its nature.\n\nAdditional Information:\nThe following note was left by an unknown wanderer and is suggested to be connected to the level’s phenomenon.\nFile - Note.pdf:\n\"Never give up!\" \"Always face adversity head-on!\" These words echoed in my mind dozens, hundreds—perhaps even thousands of times. Even as a child, at an age when I should have been playing, I was being molded for these ideals. And even though I now understand how deeply their eager words have worn me down, I still miss them.\nI never gave up. No matter how much I suffered, no matter how broken I became, a final sliver of hope within me always survived—always endured. But now, I realize how much it has begun to tear me apart. From the moment I arrived here, from the instant I stepped out of that damned office only to plummet into hell itself, then somehow return to that same accursed workplace, I thought my goal was always to keep moving forward. I was wrong.\nA store’s backrooms, parking garages, underground pipe tunnels, a station... Then beyond that, a bourgeois hotel, a pitch-black realm of secrets, and an endless ocean of thought. And in searching for answers within these thoughts, I reached caverns—a reflection of my own mind. But in the end, what I found was nothing like the answer I had expected. Enough cryptic speech—I should be clearer. Now I see that these caves were meant to be an ending. A realization that there would never be a final, absolute truth. No definitive right or wrong. That some questions were never meant to be answered.\nWhat I found was a realm of secrets. I returned to my childhood. I felt the weight of my burdens wash away, as if I had regained my purity. But no. This was not my childhood. This was the childhood I should have had. The life I should have lived. But I did what was right—or at least what I thought was right. Surviving. Making rational choices. As my caution slowly eroded, I felt warmth, serenity, nostalgia. And when I looked toward the exit, I saw the cruelty of reality. That was when I felt a fear unlike anything I had ever experienced before—the fear of losing this joy, of having these emotions stripped away. The fear of being reduced once again to a hollow puppet, burdened with responsibilities so heavy they could very well lead to my death. That old version of me is gone. That past self died in Level 8, searching for the answers to life while drowning in meaningless duties and obligations. But I… I will stay here, forever, with my new family and friends.\nThis is not the ending I expected—but it is the ending I deserve.\n- September 6, 2006.\n\nColonies and Outposts:\nThe only known settlements within the level are small encampments established by lone wanderers. Larger factions, such as the M.E.G., have deliberately refused to set up an outpost within Level 92, and as a result, no formal trade colonies or official bases exist.\n\nEntrances:\nThere is no definitive method of entry into Level 92. Instead, access appears to be contingent on specific conditions, often occurring when a wanderer experiences a profound sense of helplessness or disorientation within other levels. The earliest recorded instance of this phenomenon occurred in Level 8, though entry is highly situational and lacks a precise triggering mechanism.\n\nExits:\nReturning the way one came.\nPerforming a No-Clipping action through the exterior-facing windows has an equal probability of transporting the wanderer to Level 420, or The Void.\nDeep tunnels within the forts may, on rare occasions, lead to Level 322."

            "level 93"
          ],
          "content": "A vast collection of approximately 60 buildings, built within the snowed field tinted with thick red mist. All buildings follow brutalist or post-soviet architecture styles, with no other designs reported thus far. The buildings have a constant electricity, heat, and water supply, possibly being renewed by Level 2 and Level 3. The count of buildings' floors varies, usually from five to seven. Every floor contains approximately six apartments, filled with things one would expect to find in an ordinary apartment, despite fridges and kitchen counters containing no food at all.\nAll buildings have a built-in elevator, which has proven to not function anymore. Most of the light sources (approximately 70%) in the buildings shine bright red instead of the color one may suppose them to produce. Level 93's outdoors are stuck in the constant state of midnight, despite clocks in the level showing completely random time varying from 23:30 to 5:00 and GPS not working. Level 93 is known to isolate any wanderer from another by spawning them in entirely different buildings upon entry, making it impossible for them to somehow communicate due to the critically cold temperatures within the field. It should be noted that Wi-Fi is absent at this level, making sanity drain faster due to the absence of communication.\nThe buildings' condition is dirty and dusty, with floors inside the entranceways covered in trash, bottle shards, smoked cigarettes, and dried mud. The roofs of the buildings are filled with aerials and wiring connected to other buildings, handling electricity. The aerials' purpose is underdetermined, as Level 93 lacks any internet connection. As said before, every level of the building has six apartments, some of which are impossible to enter from inside or outside (frequent explorations have stated that they seem to be obstructed by an enormous amount of dirt and discarded furniture from the inside). More data explaining this phenomenon is needed. The number of apartments is completely shuffled, making navigation within them very difficult.\nThe buildings seem to be constructed out of strangely indestructible concrete, which seems to be supported by a series of rusty rebars from inside. Several buildings have basement entrances outside. The basements are the most warm part of the level due to boilers, heating machines, and other similar machinery. The basements often contain large industrial furnaces, always lit up, and strangely, it is impossible to somehow weaken or snuff out the fire, despite the usage of large amounts of water, fire exterminators, and even several explosives (neither the basement nor the building itself have suffered any destruction, strangely). The basements also act as storage for countless boxes, crates, and packages, usually containing nothing but rubbish inside; sometimes not only boxes but even larger objects appear, such as barrels with rusted Almond Water, bicycles, etc.\nSnowy fields and forests surround the buildings, with the temperature going down to -20°C, capable of freezing anyone alive without proper equipment. The strange mist of crimson and pinkish shades is present constantly. The snow and ice from outside are supposed to be made of Almond Water, but with large numbers of bacteria. It is advised to boil the snow in the basement before consuming it. Hazards such as snowstorms and blizzards may happen randomly and without any warning, causing no damage to buildings, trees, or other environments.\nThe pylons may be placed haphazardly within the landscapes, like on Level -250. These powerlines lead to miniature \"cities\" composed of the aforementioned buildings. These cities sometimes contain other buildings, such as schools, groceries, and suburban households. The layout of streets and sidewalks is extremely unorthodox in these areas, occasionally denying the laws of physics. The empty cars are located on the streets, swamped in snow. The cars are devoid of most parts essential to driving or using them (controls, engines, etc.).\nIt should be noted that wanderers inside the level experience intense erythrophobia (the fear of red colors). The affected wanderers will start to block the windows if in buildings; if outside, they will try to seek any available shelter. If shelter isn't found, one will start to experience uncanny hallucinations and other mental effects and will soon submit to insanity. Due to this, so far, no colonies have been established at this level.\n\nEntrances:\nLevel 42 may hide an entrance to Level 93, usually taking the form of a misplaced crimson window.\nLevel 334 may provide an entry to Level 93 randomly by entering any staircase.\n\nExits:\nLosing one's mind due to intense erythrophobia may lead one back to Level 0.\nCertain miniature cities contain transients to Level 998, though the chances of ending up there are very slim."

          "content": "Level 94 is the 95th level of the Backrooms.\nThe strangeness Level 94 possesses is the inadequacy to perfectly describe its appearance. It manifests into multiple appearances, with each wanderer having their own respective manifestations/interpretations; therefore, it is assumed one is prohibited from entering another person's manifestation, as no reports of sightings of visuals of other manifestations had been seen to transpire within. Nevertheless, it is known the main constant of the level itself is its resemblance to a museum, in addition to a temple-like appearance. Furthermore, all rooms within Level 94 are interconnected circular rooms conjoined by arches warping on the perimeter of each room.\nIt has been concluded countless times each room is mirrored; multiple characteristics such as its pattern, position, and even the smallest of decorations and dust are examined thoroughly. The circumstances by which this transpires is presumably the level's inability to construct more unique rooms — more commonly dubbed as a 'mesh' — resulting in a computer-like effect noticeable if one carefully see the multitude of details. Any endeavors to damage the structure before its initial generation would not alter other duplicating rooms; it does not help either by which the material the rooms are constructed of is not particularly known; it shares correspondence with that of marble: undistinguished appearance, a nearly identical cellular structure, and durability/toughness. The texture of the aforementioned material is discretely soft; however, its styrofoam-like characteristic does not deter its resilience otherwise.\nLevel 94 remains stationed inside the inner regions of a vast black hole, expanding into the horizon visible if one is located on the terrace in which borders the structure itself from the black hole. A shield of an undetermined force may exist between the border, resulting in the level's longevity regardless of its location. It is confirmed the shield is easily penetrable; one might accidentally place their arms crossing the border or the enclosure preventing one from falling into the abyss. If, one is clumsy enough, the limb in question would undergo an instantaneous process designated as \"spaghettification\" in which the body part would stretch and sucked into the epicenter of the black hole.\nMain Hall:\nOctober 2nd, 2033 came to be the date of the discovery of the first known primary piece of evidence for the existence of the Empyrean race which emerged as Level 94. In an M.E.G expedition deep into the level, the task force encountered the replica of the Temple of the Exalted Ecclesiast, dubbed \"The Temple\" or the \"Main Hall\" which had formed within the level itself. At the time, entering the structure was impossible due to the inability of the task force to decipher the incomprehensible script which explained how to enter the unbreachable building. A presumption developed pertaining to the circular rooms acquiring most of the level's volume; it is thought a 4-dimensional effect by some means created an illusion of a perpetual space created by these rooms.\nA grandiose church hall-like structure is what the interior of the Main Hall comprised of, with most segments of its walls and even the surface enveloped by thin, white sheets that appears to be crafted from silk. Its imperial architecture induces the sense its purpose is mainly as a place of worship; however, it has been compared to a location of sacredness whereupon the [DATA EXPUNDGED] arranges an assembly in a specific setting appropriate for such. Most ornaments, furniture, in addition to countless amalgamations of other objects scattered throughout are assumed to range from ordinary objects for decorating and polishing the looks of the structure to be purposed as religious items. Certain objects do not possess a noticeable feature or what their purpose is — it is theorized most are possibly pieces for sacrifices; nonetheless, no signs of any machines resembling a place for laying objects for sacrifices had been discovered within.\nGardens fashioned with a variety of carefully sculptured statues and fountains are present in the exterior of the Main Hall. A majority of the entrances leading to the underground of Level 94 is scattered throughout on this area by the formation consisting of mostly potholes, haphazardly positioned walls residing in seemingly out-of-placed areas, and certain walls of the Main Hall(the majority in which possesses windows), including the caves surrounding the outdoors itself. Below the subterranean regions of Level 94 lies a plethora of mazes upon mazes; it is conspicuous in that the walls of the mazes in question are orderly and lined with stones which bear durability that may perhaps be compared to that of a diamond. The abundance of archives and catalogs of ancient and historical records carved into these indestructible stones were hypothesized to be written by an obsolete/prehistoric race, possibly belonging back to the primitive years of the Frontrooms — an approximate 13 billion years ago.\n11 years following the discovery, M.E.G's cryptography division executed a complete translation of the language the script is written on — currently known as the Common Script — conjectured to be the sole language adopted by most advanced civilizations in the universe as their predominant dialect. It should be noted the instructions transcribed in the Common Script detailed the method to enter the Temple: an advanced magi-tech ritual involving various elements that were scarce at the time despite its discovery being an accidental, and perhaps a chucklesome misstep in the form of noclipping. Subsequent to the successful but a painstaking journey on acquiring these materials, a more well-equipped task force was able to breach the edifice. Inside, they discovered the imitations of the Grand Empyrean Artifacts, one of which had been taken by [DATA EXPUNGED]. Furthermore, a vast repository of information concerning the Empyrean race was uncovered, allowing the human species to learn of the existence of the Children. Great societal turmoil followed for several hundred years, eventually resulting in the M.E.G and other major groups at the time merging to become the modern B.F.L, unified at last.\nArtifacts:\nEmpyreans also form a single fabricated Artifact, embodying their nature and often utilized as a focusing device for channeling their extreme powers. These artifacts themselves possess magic-like abilities, keeping these even after their creators have perished. New wielders need to be acknowledged by the Artifact before fully activating it, changing the size to that which can be used efficiently by the new user. These objects are highly sought after, and being in possession of one without the necessary strength to keep it will likely result in one's untimely death. Generally though, the user will receive a substantial boost in power from the Artifact, especially if it takes the form of weaponry — giving an edge to the obtainer.\nThe location of these Artifacts is unknown; however, their exact duplicates — which does not possess the powers the original variants have — are set within the subterranean areas of the Main Hall in Level 94. It should be noted the chambers the duplicates of these Artifacts are scattered within the chambers, resulting in a difficulty of venturing deep to just enter one of these chambers. Stealing and contact with these Artifacts is highly discourage from doing, as the uncertainty of what will transpire is still undetermined.\nLord of Apparatus\nDetails about the Lord of Apparatus' Artifact are unknown, with sources giving conflicting claims. Some theories suggest that the Artifact fell into the hands of the Resseran race, but these rumors are unconfirmed. It can be assumed that this Artifact gave the wielder some sort of power relating to machines and technology.\nRuler of Seas\nThis Empyrean's Artifact was known as the Trident of Monolith, an enormous ten-meter tall trident which was noted to appear to be constituted of a form of granite, among other types of metamorphic and igneous stone. The inferior copy of this object retrieved from the replicated imitation of the Temple of the Exalted Ecclesiast on 12/23/2731 also displayed a very similar exterior appearance, and testing revealed it to indeed be made up of various types of rock, generally ones deep within rock strata. However, despite the outward structure, during testing the material composing the object displayed various anomalous properties, including:\nExtreme resistance to physical trauma, pressure, and heat. A 90 exawatt(90 times 10^18 watts) yield high-frequency gamma-ray laser was used in order to attempt to extract samples from the relic; the energy of the laser beam was entirely absorbed by said object with no observed change in the level of electromagnetic radiation, exterior appearance, or the stability of reality in the vicinity.\nConstant absorption of all liquids in contact with the surface of the Artifact at a rate of approximately 900 liters per second.This is accompanied by an emittance of electromagnetic radiation from the surface of the object with a wavelength of 450 nanometers, observed by the human eye as a sheen of blue light at an intensity of 230 lumens.\nInability to be moved, shifted, or otherwise transported within three-dimensional space, other than through direct manipulation of gravitational forces.The reason for this selectivity is unknown, and the Artifact in legends was said to be able to manipulate gravitational fields at will. Up to now, the Anomalous Assets Division has been unable to either activate and/or harness the secondary abilities of the duplicated Artifact. Similarly, the presumed conditions for Artifact activation are also unknown.\nAll of these anomalous capabilities can be assumed to be even greater in magnitude for the true Artifact, whose location is currently inaccessible; the spatial coordinates of the Temple of the Exalted Ecclesiast have been triangulated to an area of space currently occupied by the TON 618 hypermassive black hole. The properties of the Artifact's copy lead many to theorize that the Grand Empyrean, the Mistress of Space and Time, had a hand in the modification of the object. This is made more plausible due to the existence of a variety of ancient sources citing an amiable relationship between the two Grand Empyreans. The ultimate fate of the Ruler of Seas is unknown, but it can be safely assumed that the Empyrean died at the end of the Dawn Wars, along with the vast majority of the Empyrean race.\nÀo Shù, Asura of the East\nThe Empyrean's Artifact, the Epilogue: Dao of Shifting Flame, further enhanced his effects. Assuming the shape of a glowing slate of an unknown material, this Artifact is said to transform into four different modes.\nSword of Hellfire: This mode takes the form of a one-edged blade, made of the same sort of material as the original Artifact, but without the luminescence. The blade itself is extraordinarily sharp, capable of cleaving hyperdimensional space in two, and generates crimson fire when it is swung.\nSolar Morningstar: This mode appears to be a mace-like weapon formed of molten metal. When striking anything(such as space), it shatters the target into an uncountable number of pieces.\nLance of Eternal Burning: This mode seems to be a spear-like weapon that is invisible when not activated, completely transparent to all known types of radiation. When thrown or thrusted towards the target, the target is immediately attacked by pale, white flames which do not cease burning until all constituent particles are annihilated.\nBow of White Flames: Assumed to be the Epilogue's most powerful form, the Artifact becomes a bow of higher-dimensional space-time, manifesting arrows of the same material, shot at massively superluminal speeds.\nAngel of Life\nHer Artifact is the holy Scepter of Vitality, a magic staff-like object which allows her to better channel her powers to facilitate the spread of life. A luster of moonlight coats the object, which only allows itself to be held by one with a pure heart.\nConjurer of Fears\nThe Conjurer of Fear's Artifact is the Orb of Trepidation, a sphere-like crystal of strong memetic power which manifests and generates the victim's worst fear into reality, given that the user knows said fear. In the Conjurer's hands, this is an extremely powerful weapon against any entity, except entities which possess no fears. However, these types of emotion-devoid entities are far and few between; the Conjurer claimed over several dozen souls of Empyreans throughout his life.\nEmperor of Dominion\nHis Artifact, the Staff of Domination, assumes the form of a thick steel rod, able to influence and sway beings in an unspecified radius to the holder's will. The copy of the item inside of the duplicated Temple of the Exalted Ecclesiast was obtained by proto-B.F.L forces on July 3rd, 2184. Since then it has been stored securely within the B.F.L main vault in Level 1. Additional details are hard to discern due to an repulsive force generated by the Artifact, pushing away all but the owner.\nMistress of Time and Space\nOf those, only fragmentary records exist about this Grand Empyrean of which B.F.L currently has, but it is known that she was quite amiable to mortals and was in possession of a spatial-type Artifact containing an alternate universe of higher-dimensional space, allowing her to tap into the powers of said area. The Artifact is known as the Broken Realm, for reasons that will be further elaborated upon. Resembling a cube of glowing metamaterials alongside several rings orbiting this shape, this object periodically shifts into pieces and back again, for reasons unknown.\nSemblance of Agony\nHis Artifact, the Jawbreaker, is an unknown item presumably formed of a higher-dimensional fractal pattern, with powers relating to the concept of pain. The reason why the Monger of Pain's artifact is so mysterious is because it was the only Artifact copy missing from the facsimile of the Temple of the Exalted Ecclesiast in Level 94. Whether this is because the original Artifact is missing, or because something or someone stole it after the counterfeit's generation, the B.F.L has soundly no clue.\nHarbinger of War\nThe Artifact of this Grand Empyrean is the Bloodied Arsenal, a metallic device of sorts which could form unbreakable armor, powerful weapons, and even entire armies of warriors through magical means. The copy of this Artifact still resides within Level 94, but the B.F.L has currently been unable to awaken it, even partially. The Harbinger most likely was killed in action at the end of the battle at the Crystal Palace, as he never since appeared ever again.\nParagon of Oblivion\nThe Exalted One's Artifact is an object that changes appearance based on the observer. To a human, it seems as if it is an miniature sandbox of sorts. The B.F.L has gone to great lengths in order to try to obtain the duplicate of this Artifact, but all have been completely unsuccessful. What conditions are required to even begin activating it, or even the powers of this item are similarly unknown.\n\nEntities:\nLevel 94 is entirely desolate of any animated life; no entities had ever been encountered within.\n\nColonies & Outposts:\nDue to the nature of the level, it is infeasible to establish a community.\n\nEntrances:\nRare unjustified entrances from Level 93 had been reported to lead to areas possessing large bodies of water such as a lake or a large reservoir from dams;\nNonexplanatory circumstances in Level π will lead one to Level 94;\nEntering any notable houses in Level 974;\nRare anomalies in Level 399 will lead one to Level 94 without the assigned note/app/any physical forms of the list of things one should do to enter the Frontrooms; meaning, one could not exit to normal reality without entering Level 399 once more;\nSwim physically (conveyance will not work) for an egregious fifteen kilometers in the oceans of Level 7.1.\n\nExits:\nHoles caused by natural provocations occasionally lead one to Level 95, Level 60 if the hole in question outlooks a multicolored surface similar to the surface within the level."

          ],
          "content": "Level 95 appears to be a large, sprawling group of apartment complexes enclosed by a forest characterised by the faint brown tint of the lights emanating from various sources. The moon constantly hangs overhead, trapping the level in a constant state of night. From the forest the faint chirping of crickets can be heard, however there have been no documented entities; hence, investigations are currently underway to discover what makes this noise. A cool wind whips through the level, which has a cosy room temperature of roughly 20 degrees Celsius. Many of the apartment buildings are locked with no clear method of entry, however there is one which is open.\nWhen wanderers enter Level 95, they will notice the chirps of the crickets immediately. It's faint, but can be heard constantly through the entire level. Beyond the forest is an invisible barrier behind which lies The Void, and within it wanderers are able to faintly see a swirling mass of gas, though what the gas is has not been discovered as of now. Additionally, the cricket chirps seem to entrance wanderers, compelling them to enter the forest \"to go home\", as many of the affected have been heard saying. This effect seems to affect wanderers who have experienced homesickness or a longing to return home more effectively.\nIf wanderers remain too long within Level 95, the effect of the cricket chirps will grow stronger, up to the point where it is unavoidable. When wanderers are under the influence of this effect, they will start making their way towards the forest. Based on numerous accounts by witnesses, they will seemingly bypass the invisible barrier and walk directly into the swirling fog, never to be seen again. It is advised to wear earplugs or any other sort of device which muffles the sound to ensure the highest possible survival rate. Lastly, although wanderers have been in this level at the same time, many wanderers have stated that they were completely alone, hence this level may have a sort of isolation effect on certain wanderers.\nThe Apartment:\nThe Apartment is the only apartment out of the five present which is accessible. Within it an elevator is present, however it is nonfunctional. Due to this, wanderers are forced to use the stairs to traverse upwards, which poses some difficulty as gravity within the apartment seems to have increased. This makes every step harder to take, every breath more challenging. Each floor contains the same layout of apartments with lamps hanging overhead, all radiating the same brown light; however, the light is more intense and emits quite a bit of heat, causing the apartment to heat up to roughly 30 degrees Celsius.\nEach apartment contains a living room, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. The refrigerator located within the kitchens seems to have a constant supply of Almond Water, which restocks every time a wanderer closes the door of the fridge. The bed itself is extremely soft, and compels wanderers to stay in the level for an extended period of time, causing them to be more susceptible to the effects of the cricket chirps. Hence, it is not advised to come into contact with the beds.\nOn the roof of the building there is a pool which is filled with water which never evaporates. Further testing of the water has discovered it to be Almond Water, and wanderers can use this source to refill their bottles. The water never seems to run out, so this could be a good source to collect Almond Water from. Please do not swim in this pool, as it may cause contamination and dirty the water. Lastly, windows within the apartment always overlook the forest, even if the orientation of the building does not allow for this. Simply looking at the forest from the apartment is enough to increase the effect and desire to walk into it, so it is unadvised to peer out any windows within the apartment.\nThe Forest:\nThe Forest is the most unexplored portion of this level, due to the dangers which entail. What is know so far is that the forest circles around all the apartment complexes, forming a thick ring. Beyond this, the void along with hazy mist are separated from the forest by an invisible barrier, which is inaccessible to anyone other than those under the influence of the cricket chirps. There appears to be a path within the forest, however it is known to shift locations at random intervals. As one ventures deeper into the forest, the sound of the crickets grow louder, going as far as drowning out most other sounds.\nThe brown light of the moon shines overhead, somehow causing the forest to be brighter. As wanderers continue venturing into the woods, they feel a desire to forge ahead, running towards the barrier and into the void where they are consumed by the fog. Many of the affected wanderers will often claim that they heard a voice, and start reciting a strange poem of unknown origin which has been included. The only known way of reverting the effects of the chirps is to knock the affected wanderer unconscious and safely carry them out of the level, at which point they would be fine after they awaken, and they claim to have no recollection on the level as a whole.\n\nColonies and Bases:\nDue to the effect Level 95 has on wanderers, bases are unable to be established.\n\nEntrances:\nFalling from the roof of any building in Level 11 has a high chance of bringing wanderers here as they carry enough momentum to enter, though it is unadvised to do so.\n\nExits:\nNo-clipping into the floor will send wanderers to Level 0.\nSleeping inside of the apartment will send wanderers to Level 204.\nWalking deep into the forest may have a chance to bring wanderers to Level 994.\nNoclipping through a kitchen-like area inside one of the apartments will lead one to Level 96. This is the safest and most recommended exit.\nAs stated previously, being under the influence of the chirps and walking into The Void would most likely bring one out of the level, but wanderers should never do so."

          "content": "Level 96 is the 97th level within the Backrooms.\nLevel 96, often known as \"Downtown Diner,\" is a seemingly replica structure housed inside an extraordinarily enormous concrete chamber that repeats sections of a building-lined street for thousands of miles until eventually looping itself. The concrete textile construction resembles ancient architectural manners with predominantly two to three floors. Nevertheless, it can rise higher. Most stated the building looked forgery, with no interior and most doors restricted, as the structure's upper-level window facing off to a barricaded concrete wall, presumably for aesthetic intents solely. Certain buildings include signs indicating that they were formerly eateries. These signs bear the restaurant's name, which may emerge in manifold languages. Upon closer inspection, further examination reveals most content in Frontrooms—naturally from Asia—has phrases of iconic food from different countries. Level 96 bears the title after the presumed location, of which a large yellow sign with the inscription \"Downtown Diner\" hangs at every street intersection.\nLevel 96's exterior general perspective is a stripe establishment on both sides with a brick/asphalt roadway in the middle and numerous lampposts nearby. Multiple posters, including restaurant or food advertisements and regulatory signs with fines, materialize and are pasted on many buildings even though they may retain various languages. With no vehicle presence, the street seems to benefit no purpose; instead, an assortment of tables and chairs line the street's center, as if the road itself had no intention for vehicular transit. The level's outside has been described as a \"fake exterior,\" having the building and street imitate the actual city, yet the level itself appears to be bounded by an immense concrete box. Thus far, attempts to breach and evacuate this concrete box have proved unsuccessful since the wall is exceedingly thick and unlikely to have any room beyond the enclosure. The exterior's ceiling has an additional light source, a ceiling fan, and air conditioning, assembling a chilly atmosphere with a temperature of about 20 degrees Celsius.\nSome buildings may open with a restaurant inside, with an outstanding yellow theme overlaying on the walls and accompanying floor tile, all in exceptionally immaculate condition and unspoiled by any probable dirt or decay. Every restaurant has a distinct urban atmosphere owing to the regional architecture and its conventional layout, featuring furniture and décor representing the area's heritage and traditions in a more classic and vintage style. However, the location faced space constraints, considering the buildings were lengthy and narrow, affecting the layout and seating arrangement. The restaurant includes wooden chairs or couch seats, tables, and condiments. Each area has a distinct aesthetic and looks, but nearly every place has a yellow color scheme, concurrently with food/drinks, flavorings, and table's number set on the table. The furniture exhibits aging signs due to deterioration, such as flaking paint, cracked wood, and asymmetrically shaped furnishings.\nA counter with a cash register located in the room's center, otherwise appearing as a buffet station or food service station, allows for self-service dining depending on the restaurant type of food served as a buffet station is typically found in shops selling curry paste and bakery, nourishing many different selection food to choose from. A vending machine and beverage refrigerator reside adjacent to the food counter, offering an array of drinks, snacks, and beverages. The goods can be removed but are not replaceable. Some stores might besides have an ice cream cabinet. Unexpectedly, foods and drinks in this level never rot or decay and remain fresh and tasty despite the passage of years as the spoiling time has prolonged for many years via unknown means; this also applies to all food brought into the level. Some locations might possess a sizable menu board, hung from the ceiling or resting against a wall, displaying the main course menu and prices in different languages around the room.\nDespite understanding that the primary light source pertains from the lampost together with extra light sources from the exterior, the building interior has multiple LED lighting with dissimilar configurations for each area, plus lighting decoration such as lamps and wall lighting, typically holding a yellow color shade tone, fitting the environment theme. Artificial foliage plants with wall holders are frequently employed as decorations, suspended from the ceiling or positioned on the wall to deliver a natural, energizing flicker to the restaurant. Some restaurants may include decorations and furnishings such as artwork, an electric fan, and plant pots. Higher-tech items, including televisions and music radios, can bear familiar music inside many diners. The music may even be audible outside. Regardless, several accounts report music playing inside buildings without interiors or outside exterior boundaries; the generally accepted hypothesis is that these occur naturally by nearby music waves that pass through solid walls.\nThe restaurant's kitchen is in the establishment's rear and may constitute a pick-up station by uniting to the dining area. The entrance to the kitchen and restaurant restrooms lie in the back corner of the dining area. The kitchen and dining room have identical layouts, with ample space for cooking appliances and worktops such as ovens, stovetops, sinks, and microwaves, alongside several cabinets and drawers housing a variety of culinary tools. Supplies and other items appear within the kitchen, notably meals and beverages inside the refrigerator; however, Level 96's stockpiles do not appear limitless and require restocking since many restaurants have been stripped and taken away, leaving cleared. Many individuals reported smelling breakfast food wafting into the room and hearing pots, pans, and cutlery clattering from the kitchen, regardless of being aware that nothing was in the room. Many restaurants do not have a sign or a stairway to the second level. Nevertheless, a few do, and they generally seem like added eating spaces, and no rooms fulfill other functions.\n\nColonies and Outposts:\nThe Diner Group\nA group consists of several travelers who remain at this level; however, the member's total amount is never consistent due to wanderers arriving and departing the group. The crew settles into a couple of restaurants that link each other and establish their eateries, serving various cuisines that are typically famous Southeast Asia meals. The group regularly welcomes newcomers as considerable participants are close friends and have chosen to stay inside the level for an ample duration. Every month, the group base's food and other supplies come in via the door that connects to Level 33.\n\nEntrances:\nEntering yellow color doors in Level 33 may lead to this level.\nPressing the buttons \"9\" and \"6\" on the vending machine in the break room of Level 16 will transport one to this level.\nEntering a metallic door sometimes found in The Ballrooms of Level 5 will lead one to this level.\n\nExits:\nNoclipping into a dark wall will lead one to Level 97.\nOne can use the same entrance gate to Level 33.\nFew individuals allege to have entered Level 6 by stepping down the dark alleyway between the buildings.\nNoclipping anywhere else has a possibility of reaching Level 99.\nEntering a dark, indoor hallway sends one to Level 570.\nnostalgic ain't it?"

          "content": "Level 97 is a vast expanse of white stratus clouds that stretch across a seemingly infinite plane. Dotting the clouds are a set of skyscrapers with varying heights, their sleek metallic materials glinting faintly. The level is permeated by a cool, gentle breeze that carries with it the soft, almost melodic sound of the wind. Occasionally, faint, shimmering rainbows can be seen arcing across the horizon, though they often vanish as quickly as they appear. The clouds themselves carry a faint ripple akin to an ocean.\nA distinct feature of Level 97 is its surprisingly low gravity, which allows wanderers to float effortlessly through the air. Many describe a feeling of weightlesness, not bound by gravity. Movement through the level often resembles the sensation of swimming in water, with graceful, fluid motions. However, it is possible for one to become disoriented and lose their sense of direction, though this disorientation is usually temporary.\nDeep beneath the sea of clouds lies an invisible yet impenetrable barrier. This prevents the wanderer and other beings from interacting with whatever lies below, which is currently unknown. Upon approaching the barrier, one will notice their surroundings starting to take on a reddish hue. Should one attempt to move closer, a powerful gust of wind will manifest, blowing the wanderer back up to skyscraper height. Any pictures taken or sounds recorded near this barrier become distorted, with it intensifying as one approaches closer to it.\nThe skyscrapers are typically impossible to enter, with windows that are made of impenetrable glass and steel. However, under specific conditions or with the use of the right tools, it is possible to enter these structures. Inside, wanderers encounter a variety of spaces, including modern offices, hotel suites, and observation decks offering views of the sea of clouds. On the rooftops of the skyscrapers, wanderers can find supply crates containing food, water, and other necessities, making Level 97 an ideal level for finding resources.\nWhen night falls in Level 97, the skyscrapers illuminate a vibrant array of hues, their windows emanating a plethora of colors. Spotlights of various hues emerge from the sea of clouds below and sweep across the skies, which soon become dotted with countless stars.\n\nBases and Outposts:\nOne base exists within this level. That being Base Equilibrium, the primary outpost for the Void Control Unit (VCU). This group has managed to enter the interior of one of the tallest skyscrapers, declaring it their base of operations. Members of the V.C.U. have adapted the structure into a functioning headquarters, conducting research.\n\nEntrances:\nWanderers can enter Level 97 by noclipping through specific locations, such as the windows of Level 95 or certain points within the Absolute Infinity Of Unknown. Additionally, noclipping through Level 75’s invisible barrier leads to the lower parts of Level 97, though the wanderer will immediately be pushed back up by the gusts of wind.\n\nExits:\nExiting Level 97 typically involves the skyscrapers. The destination level depends on the architectural style of the building entered. For instance, skyscrapers with a futuristic design may lead to Level 833."

Legends say it was built by a betrayed sorceress named Yoriko to punish greedy adventurers after her own guild betrayed her for riches. The Oni Spire disappears on any other night except for a full moon making it a rare occurance. All yokai disappear into a separate realm with the Spire until the next full moon. Yoriko is a powerful wizard that specializes in spiritual magic that takes the form of turning people into Yokai monsters/monster girls. Yoriko uses the afflicted adventurers as soldiers and floor guardians for the Oni Spire dungeon. Fairy Tail heard the rumors of the Oni Spire and Erza made an all-female party to prove that the women could handle it on their own. \n\nThe party consisted of Erza, Lucy, Wendy, Evergreen, Juvia, Mirajane and Brandish u. They made it particularly far into the dungeon which in turned summoned Yoriko herself. Each Fairy Tail member was defeated by Yoriko herself and transformed into a Yokai to become a floor guardian for the dungeon. Evergreen guards the first floor as a cockatrice. Wendy guards the second floor as a Bakeneko yokai. Lucy guards the third floor as a Nure-Onna/lamia. Juvia guards the 4th floor as Scylla. Mirajane guards the 5th floor as a succubus/demon. Brandish guards the sixth floor as a Anubis yokai. Erza guards the 7th and last floor as a Jorōgumo/Spider Woman. Happy and Carla have been transformed into Suiko(incredibly large, tiger-like monsters) that are Wendy's personal bodyguards.\n\nEach floor is specifically designed to fit the yokai/monster girl theme of the Floor Guardian. Each floor is personally tailored to also fit the girl's style. Such as Wendy's floor should seem cute and cuddly as a cat compared to Erza's spider lair which should be terrifying.\n"

Towering skyscrapers and neon-lit streets rise directly from the bones of ruined kingdoms—glass facades grafted onto weathered stone walls, metro lines carved through forgotten catacombs, cafés and homes built against the arches of collapsed castles. Humanity did not erase the old world; it built on top of it.\n\nBut beneath the surface, danger never truly died. Malevolent creatures still creep through the cracks of civilization: goblins lurking in the sewer-tunnels that were once dungeon corridors, undead clawing free from catacombs sealed centuries ago, and beasts roaming the shadowed forests that press against city outskirts. Even gleaming metropolises have “red zones,” unstable districts where the ruins are too dangerous to tame.\n\nBeyond the cities lie untamed wilds—vast forests, mist-choked caves, and ancient dungeons that adventurers and scavengers explore, chasing relics of the old age or defending modern society from its forgotten horrors.\n\nEvery streetlight glowing in the night, every tower of steel and glass, is a reminder of humanity’s triumph—but also of how fragile it is, resting on the restless ruins of a darker, older world",

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

He is a third-year high school student at Kuoh Academy in Class 3-B and a member of the school's \"Perverted Trio\", a trio of the most perverted men in the entire student body. \n\nIssei is the Pawn of Rias Gremory's Peerage and a member of the Occult Research Club. After the Evil Dragon War, he was promoted to the rank of a High-Class Devil, becoming the King of his own independent peerage, and is one step closer to fulfilling his dream of having a harem and becoming a \"Harem King\".\n\nDue to his possession of the Longinus; the Boosted Gear, which hosts the Welsh Dragon, Ddraig, Issei is the direct rival of Vali Lucifer, who is the host of the Vanishing Dragon; Albion, who is Ddraig's archrival.\n\nIssei is a high school student of average height with short spiky brown hair, with two short locks of hair behind his head, and light brown eyes. Following his training with Tannin, he gained a more muscular and toned build.\n\nWhile he has worn various outfits throughout the series, his most commonly worn outfit is the Kuoh Academy boys' school uniform, which consists of a blazer (more commonly black, although in other media is shown with a tinge of purple or grey, with white accents) over a white, long-sleeved dress shirt with black highlights with a black ribbon on the collar, matching black pants, and brown dress shoes. However, Issei's uniform differs in the fact that he wears a red T-shirt underneath his open dress shirt and blazer, and wears blue and white sneakers in place of dress shoes. Even by his own admittance Issei is an unintelligent and straightforward individual, with his tremendously perverted and lascivious nature being the greatest characteristic of his personality. Issei easily indulges in lewd fantasies, being obsessed with female breasts and a desire for a harem, traits he openly admits and makes no effort to hide, a characteristic that he is, in fact, proud of. This has caused him to be instantly labeled as a pervert among the girls of Kuoh Academy and has gained him notoriety for being one of the members of Kuoh Academy's Perverted Trio.\n\nDespite his pervertedness, Issei is courageous, selfless and unwaveringly determined to protect those who are important to him, despite almost dying by the hands of his opponents.\n\nAge 18\n\nDragon Shot (魔力弾ドラゴンショット, Doragon Shotto): One of Issei's signature moves, where he releases a beam of concentrated Demonic Power. It is often used in tandem with Boosted Gear to increase its destructive potential, once destroying a mountain. When enhanced by the Boosted Gear Scale Mail, Issei's Dragon Shot became powerful enough to casually \"erase\" a mountain, and when enraged it overwhelmed a full powered demonic power blast by Diodora, a High Class Devil enhanced by Ophis's snake. Issei can go into his limit break mode upgrading his strength with a crimson like dragon armor.\n\nBoosted Gear (赤龍帝の籠手ブーステッド･ギア, Būsuteddo Gia): Issei's Sacred Gear and main weapon, among all the original 13 Longinus, which holds the Welsh Dragon, Ddraig's soul, making it a Mid-Tier Longinus. A left-handed red gauntlet that doubles his powers every 10 seconds until he reach his limit, holding the potential to kill god if mastered. He later gained the ability to Transfer the multiplied power into a person or item, even parts like his eyes for enhanced vision. Issei later awakened Penetrate, letting him bypass all defenses (save the targets baseline physical durability) like Rizevim's Sacred Gear Canceler or barriers. He later developed a technique of applying Penetrate to his eyes to see through women's clothing. Dragon Aura: Due to possessing Boosted Gear, then having his left arm turned into a dragon, Issei has a small amount of dragon aura. Training with Tannin increased it, to the point of dealing minimal damage while using Boosted Gear. After gaining a new body, made from a combination of Great Red's flesh and Ophis' power, it became more natural, described as being dominant. Pailingual (乳語翻訳パイリンガル, Pairingaru): Issei's third signature move, which allows him to \"talk\" to women's breasts after creating a \"space\". As such, it is a useful move as it allows him to learn his opponents' plans by asking their breasts, however, complaints from females from other peerages caused Rias to ban it in Rating Games. Dress Break (洋服崩壊ドレス・ブレイク, Doresu Bureiku): Issei's second signature move, which he mainly uses against women. As its name suggests, this move allows him to \"strip\" woman by first coming into contact with them, concentrating his demonic power, then snapping his fingers to activate one of two effects. He can fly,has immense mobility,Speed,Strength and durability, and a expert close combatant and sword fighter."

Now, Rias is a first-year College Student at Kuoh Academy, the former President of the Occult Research Club, and the school's Number-One Beauty, as well as one of Kuoh Academy's Two Great Ladies alongside Akeno Himejima.

She would originally often release massive blasts to engulf and erase her targets, but Rias has improved her control over her Power of Destruction to the point of being able to compress it into softball-sized bullets and release them in quantities compared to a machine gun, with each capable of disintegrating a person."

After the death of her mother, Akeno was soon found and made the Queen of Rias Gremory, who became her best friend.\n\nAkeno is one of Kuoh Academy's Two Great Ladies alongside Rias, soon becoming a first-year college student. Akeno is a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous figure, very long black hair and violet eyes. Her hair is usually tied in a very long ponytail, reaching all the way down to the floor with two strands sticking out from the top and sloping backward, with an orange ribbon keeping it in place.\n\nLike most of the girls at Kuoh Academy, she wears the customary Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, along with black calf-length socks.\n\nIn the anime, during battles, she often transforms her clothes into a traditional miko attire, consisting of a white haori with red accents, a red hakama, and a pair of zōri with white tabi.\n\nAfter Akeno has revealed her Fallen Angel side in front of Issei, she has one Devil wing and one Fallen Angel wing. As the series progressed and she came to terms with her fallen angel powers, her wings increased to six, at first, because of the aid of Azazel's bracelets, then eight, resembling a High-Tier Fallen Angel.\n\nPersonality\n\nAkeno is first seen to be a very elegant and gentle woman with refined lady etiquette, embodying the principals of the ideal Japanese woman: \"Yamato Nadeshiko\". However, underneath her calm, noble and dignified atmosphere, Akeno is shown to be highly sadistic in battle and doesn't show any mercy or remorse towards the enemies she slays, casually keeping up her smiling elegant persona over an enemy's death and showing an expression of pleasure and lust upon delivering them pain.\n\nDespite her sadism, Akeno is very kind, acknowledged by Rias and Issei. Before meeting Rias, Akeno would help people by purifying evil spirits for a living.\n\nAs a result of seeing her mother being killed in front of her eyes and her father being unable to save her, Akeno developed a hatred for Fallen Angels, including a sense of self-loathing towards her own Fallen Angel nature, for it was the reason her beloved mother was killed by the Himejima Clan, which lead her to sever ties with her father, going into exile before being saved by Rias after Akeno's maternal relatives nearly killed her. Due to this reason, she empathizes with those who have suffered under the hands of Fallen Angels like Issei and Asia, who were manipulated and killed by the Fallen Angel Raynare, and was worried that Issei would dislike her due to her Fallen Angel nature. However, she fell in love with him after he told her that he still liked her. With Issei's help, she was able to overcome the sadness of her mother's death and reconcile with her estranged father, renewing their familial bond. Due to Issei helping her and Baraqiel in their reconciliation, Akeno's love for him deepened considerably as she confessed her feelings for him.\n\nAkeno is still innocent and emotional towards love and acts like a girl her age whenever she is on a date with her love. However, this still does not stop her from being seductive and flirting with her lover. \n\nElemental Demonic Power: Akeno excels in using natural elements such as ice, fire, and water, but she specializes in lightning. She is able to create thunder clouds using her demonic power, making lightning bolts rain down on her opponents. She could freeze Cerberus' flames in an instant and target ice spears at her opponents. Much like her Holy Lightning Dragon, Akeno can also form serpent-like Dragons out of fire and ice, sending them at her enemies.\nLightning Manipulation: Akeno originally specialized in lightning demonic power alone before she began using her Holy Lightning ability, where she imbues it with the power of light.

He has the ability to stop time and is Rias' first Bishop. Age 15\n\nBecause his powers were uncontrollable prior to the series, he was sealed in the Academy by Rias and was not seen again until Volume 4 of the light novels. He is a second-year high school student at Kuoh Academy, alongside Koneko and Ravel. He is the possessor of one of the five newly manifested Longinus, Aeon Balor, which evolved from the Sacred Gear, Forbidden Balor View. Gasper is an effeminate-looking male with platinum blond hair and pinkish-violet eyes. His hair is styled in short bob cut with several small fringes over his forehead, and he has pointed ears. Kiba describes him as looking like a beautiful girl.\n\nUnlike the rest of the boys of Kuoh Academy who wear the boys' uniform, Gasper wears the Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform with thigh-high socks, creating a Zettai Ryōiki (Japanese for \"absolute territory\").\nPersonality\n\nOriginally a coward and a shut-in with a very shy personality, Gasper likes to wear female clothing, claiming that girls' clothes are cute. He also has a penchant for boxes, carrying one with him all the time. When Issei tried to give Gasper confidence, the former gave Gasper a paper bag to put over the latter's face. However, Issei comments that whenever Gasper puts the paper bag on, the latter looks like a molester.\n\nAs the series progresses, with Issei and the Gremory group's encouragement, Gasper begins to gain confidence and bravery. When necessary, Gasper has displayed the ability to force down his timid nature and speak up as a man. On more than one occasion, he has demonstrated extreme courage and loyalty, going so far as to be beaten to unconsciousness in defense of his weakened comrades. Demonic Power: Gasper has all the powers and abilities common to Devils, including the power to cast spells.\n\nEnhanced Magic Power: As a Bishop, more so one who consumed a Mutation Piece, he can strengthen his demonic and magical powers.\n\nDhampir Physiology: Being a Dhampir as well as one with rare Vampire abilities, Gasper has the ability to control bats and transform into a flock of them, usually using them for reconnaissance. Thanks to his human half, Gasper is immune to general Vampire weaknesses, but still feels some discomfort from them.\n\nDaywalker: Due to being Dhampir, Gasper is also a Daywalker, allowing him to survive contact with sunlight.\nBlood Consumption: Gasper can absorb other people's powers by drinking their blood, as shown when he drank Issei's blood, using Issei's Dragon power to boost his own, while allowing him to control Forbidden Balor View. \nDarkness Manipulation: Gasper can also manipulate shadows and darkness, though he initially had difficulty in controlling them adequately. This has changed, being able to freely extend and control his shadows. Gasper has shown the ability to change the shape of his shadow to suit multiple purposes, such as tentacles that can bind his opponents seemingly of their own will.\nImmense Strengthorbidden Balor View (停止世界の邪眼フォービドウン・バロール・ビュー, Fōbidoun Barōru Byū): Gasper's Sacred Gear and main weapon, which lets him stop anything and anyone within his field of vision in time. In the beginning, he couldn't control it without his vampire powers because its power continued to grow as time passed. Because Balor's consciousness and powers were sealed in it through the Sephiroth Graal, it can create and control a deep darkness that consumes anything, including the Dimension Lost's mist. Gasper can also switch perception with others, such as Issei on two occasions, letting him freeze Shalba and see whatever he sees Through transforming into multiple bats, he can also extend its range. Gasper's Sacred Gear would eventually be recognized as one of the five new Longinus, and renamed Aeon Balor (時空を支配する邪眼王, Aiōn Barōru), also known as The Evil-Eyed King Who Dominates the Space and Time."

She is a third-year high school student at Kuoh Academy in Class 3-B and is a girl with a very gentle heart who possesses a rare Sacred Gear, Twilight Healing, in her body that is capable of healing the wounds of Humans, Angels, Fallen Angels, and Devils alike. She was formerly one of Rias Gremory's Bishops but now serves as Issei Hyoudou's first Bishop and one of his fiancées. Asia is a beautiful young girl with long blonde hair and green eyes. Her body measurements are [B83→85-W55-H81→83 cm]; her height is [155 cm] [5 feet 1 inch] and her body weight is [44→45 kg] [97→98 lbs]. Her hair flows all the way down to her back, with split bangs over her forehead and a single strand sticking out from the top and sloping backward. Age 18\n\nHer former main attire consisted of a dark teal nun outfit with light blue accents, a white veil over her head with light blue accents, a brown satchel slung on her right hip (where she holds her Bible), and brown boots with black straps in an X-shaped pattern. She also wore a silver cross necklace around her neck (she was later forced to remove it after becoming a Devil).\n\nUpon transferring to Kuoh Academy, she wears the Kuoh Academy girls' uniform, albeit with a black sweater vest over her dress shirt in place of the cape and corset which has become her current main attire.\nPersonality\n\nAsia is extremely shy, innocent and fairly inexperienced in things like socializing. As a former nun, Asia is a devout Christian, despite being reincarnated as a Devil, Asia still believes in God and follows his teachings such as praying to him and reading the Bible, which would usually result in her getting severe headaches. Asia has a strong kindness, even when she was still a human, she harbored no hate towards Devils and treated everyone equally, regardless of what they were. Azazel noted that her unconditionally kindhearted nature forces her Sacred Gear to heal even enemies, as she is incapable of turning a blind eye to the suffering of others. Asia was also in deep shock when she learned from Kokabiel that the God of the Bible was killed during the Great War.\n\nWhile initially having difficulty adjusting to her new life as a Devil, she has stated that she has found more important things than her faith in God, those things being her new friends, comrades as well as Issei's parents and Issei himself.\n\nAsia is noted to be a very pure individual as people are drawn to her and that she is easily liked by others. Her charm and purity is such as that she was able to tame Rassei, a Sprite Dragon despite being a Devil as normally Sprite Dragons aren't tamable by Devils and are only tamable by those with pure hearts. Azazel noted that she had outstanding talent for taming dragons, as after receiving Ophis' blessing, she was able to form a contract with Fafnir, one of the Five Great Dragon Kings. After she managed to tame 4 mass-produced Evil Dragons, her name was spread in the world of Dragons due to the fact that only Evil Gods were able to tame Evil Dragons, as she became known as the Dragon Priestess (龍の巫女, Ryū no Miko) among Dragons. \nDemonic Power: As a Devil, Asia has all the common skills and powers of one, including the power to cast spells.\n\nEnhanced Magic Power: As a Bishop, Asia can strengthen her magic and demonic powers, which she normally applies onto her Twilight Healing.\n\nMagic Talent: As a Bishop, Asia has shown great potential in using magic as she was put in charge of forming a barrier by Freed. Asia is studying under Rossweisse in order to learn summoning and transport magic to help defend herself and increase her combat strength, she can also use Dragon Gate magic circle.[1] Using her Bishop trait she can enhance her healing abilities with Twilight Saint Affection along with Fafnir's golden aura.\n\nSummoning Magic: Asia is show to be very adept at summoning magic as she is capable of using it to summon various creatures to assist her and Dragon Gate magical circles to summon her guardian familiar; the Golden Dragon King Fafnir.\nElemental Magic: Asia is capable of using elemental magic; such as fire and wind magic as demonstrated in her fight against Crom Cruach. Twilight Healing (聖母の微笑トワイライト・ヒーリング, Towairaito Hīringu): Asia's Sacred Gear and her main weapon of choice, she can heal Humans, Devils, Angels, and Fallen Angels alike. Since she has shown no actual combat skills, she relies on her healing abilities as a healer of her team. Asia learned how to expand the range of her healing field and send her healing powers as a projectile, although these are inferior to actual touch. In Volume 11, Azazel has said that she mastered her Twilight Healing more than other possessors in healing powers and time. She can also create a bow and arrow of healing power, and if the arrow is about to hit an enemy, it will disperse instead of healing them.\n\nTwilight Saint Affection (聖龍姫が抱く慈愛の園トワイライト・セイント・アフェクション, Towairaito Seinto Afekushon): Asia's sub-species Balance Breaker. Asia's Balance Breaker takes the form of a Golden Dragon Armor with red jewels that cover her body and grants her a field of absolute defence and protection. For a limited time, Asia can cover a field with tremendous healing energy and can negate any damage from virtually any sources. It does not negate the attack but rather it negates the damage that the attack would inflict. As Fafnir's aura is included as well, it also boasts immense defence on top of the healing ability. Asia can also used it to heal numerous allies at once on a wide range, using it to heal the allied youkais during the Evil Dragon War."

After Issei's promotion, she now serves under him as his first Knight and is also one of his fiancées.\n\nXenovia is a beautiful young woman with chin-length, blue hair with a dyed green fringe on the right side and brown eyes (dark yellow in the anime, season 2-3). Her body measurements are [B87-W58-H88 cm] [B34-W23-H35 in], and her body weight is [56 kg] [123 lbs]. Xenovia's height 166 cm (5 feet 5 inches).\n\nHer battle attire is her Church battle suit, which consists of a black, skin-tight, short sleeve leotard with pauldrons, matching fingerless gloves that extend to her biceps, and thigh-high boots, all of which are adorned with straps. This attire is worn under a white hooded cloak with gold and blue accents. She also wears a crucifix around her neck, which was later removed after becoming a Devil.\n\nAfter joining Issei's peerage and during the Rating Games, Xenovia wears a uniform that consists of a red button top with a white tie and red shorts. She also wears a black waist cape as well as a purple cape over her left shoulder.\n\nUpon transferring to Kuoh Academy and joining the Occult Research Club, she wears the Kuoh Academy girls' uniform but without the cape.\nPersonality\n\nWhen Xenovia was first introduced, she was shown to have a calm, quiet, and serious demeanor, putting her mission first and only speaking when necessary. She was also very cold, bordering on heartless, as she called Asia a witch for becoming a Devil (even though she became one unwillingly so she could be with Issei) and even went so far as to try and kill her. She later threatened to do the same to Kiba when he was technically a Stray. After being reborn as a Devil, however, she gains a very close relationship with Asia, being touched by her kindness and apologizes for calling her a witch when they first met.\n\nIn battle, Xenovia appears to be a bit arrogant, stubborn, and rarely uses her head in attempting to overwhelm her opponents with pure power and strength instead of being subtle or using skills. According to Issei, her fighting style is comparable to that of a Rook despite being a Knight, referring to her as a \"Power idiot\". As Xenovia was raised in the Church, she lacks common knowledge on the life of a normal person, evident when she brought a box of condoms to school as well as wanting to give birth to strong children, and has chosen Issei as her mate.\n\nAs the series progresses, it is shown that Xenovia has developed genuine romantic feelings towards Issei due to him protecting his comrades, even if he gets injured by doing so. As a result, she becomes more aggressive in seducing him, which proves that Xenovia is quite perverted as well, a fact that she is \"cool\" with. Demonic Power: Xenovia has all the powers and abilities common to Devils, including the power to cast spells.\n\nNatural-born Holy Sword Wielder: Xenovia is a natural-born holy sword wielder and capable of wielding any holy sword without artificial means like Irina. Even reincarnated as a Devil, Xenovia is still able to wield any holy sword without any issues.\n\nEnhanced Strength: Due to her years of training in the church, Xenovia gained superb arm strength, able to wield very heavy swords like Excalibur Destruction and Durandal with ease. After being reincarnated into a devil, her natural strength has been increased too.\n\nEnhanced Speed: Xenovia is able to move at superhuman speeds. She combines her speed with Durandal's destructive powers, making her a formidable fighter. Her speed is further enhanced by her Knight piece. However, Xenovia is considerably slower than Yuuto due to her being power-oriented as opposed to the technique-oriented Yuuto. When further combined with the Excalibur Rapidly, her speed is enhanced and she can move as fast as Masaomi.\n\nImmense Stamina: Xenovia has massive amounts of stamina and endurance. She was durable enough to confront Nero at the end of their match. She can still muster enough strength to use Cross Crisis enhanced by Crimson Destruction Dragonar.\n\nMaster Swordswoman\n\nDurandal (デュランダル, Dyurandaru): Xenovia's main weapon, a unique-shaped single-edged blue broadsword that has a golden edge. It is a unique sword, to the point that it responds to the user, for her, Durandal releases a massive aura, which has destructive powers. Xenovia later learned that she can transfer Durandal's aura into another holy sword, as proven when she channeled its holy aura inside Ascalon. Excalibur's Scabbard (エクスカリバーの鞘, Ekusukaribā no Saya): The legendary Scabbard of Excalibur, which emits holy aura similar to a normal holy sword was originally sealed in an underground ruin. This makes Xenovia essentially immortal, healing wounds suffered from even a god-class being, however, this has its limits, but it allowed her to endure the light-based attacks of the Chief-God, Apollon despite being a devil and entrapped in a light cage.\n\nAge 18"

Her body measurements are [B96-W61-H89 cm] [B38-W24-H35 in]; height is 173 cm (5 feet 8 inches) and body weight is [59 kg].\n\nHer battle attire is normally of a set of Valkyrie armor, which consists of a white breastplate with gold and pale blue accents and matching, fingerless gauntlets, boots, hip guards, and wing-shaped hair clips. She also wears a black leotard underneath her breastplate, black thigh-high stockings, and a pale blue cloth wrapped underneath her hip guards, all of which are clad with pink lacing along with her hair clips.\n\nFor her teaching position at Kuoh Academy, she wears a simple business suit and skirt. When she is not at work, she is noted for often wearing cheap, plain jerseys.\nPersonality\n\nRossweisse is known to be a very serious person, acting professional prioritizing work and study above all else since her youth, this however, caused her to miss out on romance, thus is extremely bitter and sensitive about not having a boyfriend and is quick to anger or sadness when made fun of. She has taken a liking to her role as a teacher in education for her students, making sure they understand her lessons and helping them whenever they're in a bind and is appreciated for it. Rossweisse has little tolerance for those who behave unprofessionally, especially for lewd acts at inappropriate times. When she lectures them on standards, they usually retort with her simply being jealous. This may have some truth to it as on numerous occasions she has expressed interests in doing perverted things with her future boyfriend, she also desires her lover to be financially stable with a bright future.\n\nDespite her seriousness, she is stated to be clumsy and has a tendency to make rash decisions without informing anyone. She is highly susceptible to alcohol as one drink from it can leave her drunk and vomit for extended periods of time. Rossweisse has a lot of repressed baggage from upholding her uptight and modest demeanor which goes out the window when drunk and begins opening her true thoughts and frustrations. She also has a compulsion to buy things at sales when they're cheap, showing enthusiastic excitement whenever she goes to 100-Yen shops, causing Issei to dub her \"The 100-Yen Shop Valkyrie\". Rossweisse also has a tendency to speak using her country's accent when she is flustered.\n\nLike the other girls, Rossweisse acts like someone her age whenever she is on a date with Issei as she ended up acting shy when she was called cute. She soon develops romantic feelings for Issei in Volume 17 when he proclaimed to her that he will protect her from Euclid, which he did.\n\nAfter falling in love with Issei and becoming engaged to him, Rossweisse has started to partake in perverted activities she normally frowns upon, such as wanting him to apply suntan oil on her, sleeping with him while wearing revealing lingerie and fighting with the other girls over him.\n\nDemonic Power: As a Devil, Rossweisse has the power common to a Devil, which allows her to cast spells and special phenomena. However, instead of using demonic powers to cause different phenomena, she prefers to use calucations rather than using her imagination.\n\nImmense Magic Power: As Odin's former bodyguard, Rossweisse has considerable magic power enough to be recognized for her position. In Vol 11, Azazel noted her powers equals that of a High-Class Devil despite her not being a Bishop. In Vol 25, even the Strongest Valkyrie, Brynhildr has recognized that even without Mistilteinn, her magic power already surpassed hers.\n\nEnhanced Strength: As a Valkyrie, she has higher physical abilities than a normal person, which was raised after being reincarnated into a Rook.\n\nEnhanced Durability: Rossweisse has enhanced defenses befitting her status as a Rook.\n\nMaster Magician: Rossweisse is a genius in Norse Magic. Despite lacking talent in her house's Seiz-Style Spirit Magic, she realized she was talented in others, such as Rune-style, Gondol-style, offensive magic, and those not used in their house, exceeding Rias and Akeno.

          "content": "Age 16 Ravel Phenex is one of the many female protagonists of High School DxD. She is the only daughter and youngest child of Lord Phenex and Lady Phenex, and the younger sister of Ruval Phenex, an unnamed older brother and Riser Phenex. She is a second-year high school student at Kuoh Academy and a former member of Riser's peerage. Like her older brothers, she has inherited the powers of the Phoenix and possesses the power of fire, wind, and immortality. Upon Riser's defeat, she is traded to her mother, Lady Phenex before being traded to Issei Hyoudou, becoming his servant and second Bishop. Ravel is a beautiful young girl with dark blue eyes. She has long blonde hair tied into twintails with large, drill-like curls and blue ribbons keeping them in place. The front of her hair has several bangs hanging over her forehead, with a V-shaped fringe hanging over the bridge of her nose. Ravel's body measurements are [B85-W59-H84 cm] (B33-W23-H33 in); height is 153 cm (5 feet 0 inches) and body weight is [47 kg].\n\nHer initial outfit consisted of a light purple dress with dark purple accents and a blue bow at the front. At the back, three feather-like extensions mimicking a bird's tail protrude from the dress, which, when combined with her wings of fire, give her a bird-like appearance. Upon transferring to Kuoh Academy, she wears the Kuoh Academy girls' uniform, with the addition of a black sweater over her dress shirt.\n\nAfter joining Issei's peerage, during Rating Games, she wears a uniform that consists of a red button top with a white tie, a red skirt as well as a purple cape along with a blue satchel on her waist.\n\nIn the anime, Ravel wears a long, pink dress with white frills and a magenta bow in the front. At her brother's engagement party, she wears a purple dress with matching gloves and black boots and holds a pink folding fan.\nPersonality\n\nRavel is first shown to be spoiled, arrogant and snobbish during her debut, but she is later revealed to be a well-mannered, modest, elegant, and polite young girl, but shown to be initially harsh towards those whom she dislikes. She's very loyal to her older brother, as she is seen diligently obeying his authority. She strongly believes that her brother is so powerful, no one could ever possibly defeat him. However, after witnessing his crushing defeat at the hands of Issei Hyoudou, she becomes attracted to him and later falls in love with him as the series progresses, albeit in a tsundere manner. Despite her young age, she's very intelligent, mature and perceptive, being able to understand the atmosphere of any situation as well as surmise Issei's thoughts just by simply looking at him. She is also shown to be a gifted strategist, serving as Issei's main strategist and second in command of his peerage. In this position, Ravel appears to be quite strict as she has her own expectations and standards when it comes to the suitability of someone to serve under Issei, such as when she denied Kuroka's offer to make Le Fay Pendragon Issei's contracted magician due to the latter's affiliation with the Khaos Brigade or when she was initially against letting Elmenhilde Karnstein join Issei's team.\n\nRavel has also shown a ruthless side, being relentless in securing victory for her team. This is seen when she consistently read out the manga about Issei and Kiba to Tsubaki Shinra, despite the latter's obvious discomfort and pleas to stop. However, Ravel is also shown to be quite fragile hearted as seen when she cried when she believed she failed Issei after their defeat against Dulio's team in the Azazel Cup. Immortality: As a member of the Phenex Clan, Ravel shares her families' signature regeneration abilities, being able to regenerate lost limbs and recover from wounds instantly as demonstrated in Volume 25, when she regenerated from the damage inflicted by the Valkyrie Squad. However, since their immortality is fueled by Ravel's demonic power and affected by her mental state, if her body would be destroyed multiple times or her demonic power ran out, she wouldn't be able to regenerate.\nHell Fire: As a member of the Phenex Clan, Ravel can create and control powerful flames noted to be strong enough to burn Scale Mail armor. She is shown to be capable of blowing half of her brother's head away with a single attack.[1]\nDefense: Ravel is able to create a shield of demonic power to protect herself or the people around her.\nClothing Manipulation: Ravel is shown to be able to alter her whole attire into a different one, most notably when she changed from one piece dress into safari jacket and shorts.\nSkilled Hand to Hand Combatant: Ravel has learned to fight in close quarters combat after becoming Issei's servant, being able to hold her own against Koneko Toujou, a Rook who specializes in close-quarters combat.\n\nGenius Intellect"

          "content": "Ingvild Leviathan is one of the descendants of the original Leviathan and the Queen of Issei Hyoudou's peerage. She is the possessor of the Longinus; Nereid Kyrie. Ingvild is a beautiful foreign girl who appears to be in her late teens with a \"whimsical aura.\" She has long purple hair and orange eyes.\n\nShe wears a white dress typical of female noble Devils that exposes much of her large breasts, with high slits and long sleeves. She also wears a black mini skirt.\n\nAfter joining Issei’s peerage and becoming a student at Kuoh Academy, Ingvild now wears a female school uniform with long purple socks.\nPersonality\n\nIngvild is a kind and friendly person and enjoys singing as is shown when she sings at the fountain and for Issei and his group. Ingvild is also shown to love seeing the ocean and going on beaches with her friends. Unlike her fellow members of the Leviathan clan or any other descendants of the original Satans and akin to Vali, she doesn’t have any fanatic arrogance in her heritage as a Satan's descendant nor does she desire world domination like Katerea and the other descendants with the exception of Vali.\n\nShe quickly fell in love with Issei, as it was revealed by her song in the battle against Nyx. She is even shown to be a little jealous of Issei's relationship with his harem such as when she and the other girls caught him with Akeno and Koneko, even thinking about acting like them despite considering it embarrassing. She also appears to be quiet, shy and soft-hearted. She can be very observant, remembering what Meredith said to Issei before she attacked him when the other characters were preoccupied with discussing Issei's condition.\n\nAs noted by Issei once the two had gotten to know one another, despite Ingvild's exceptional talent, she still works hard for the sake of her friends, putting others before herself.\n\nImmense Demonic Power: As a descendant of the original Leviathan, Ingvild has impressive demonic powers, which according to Rossweisse's measurements is equal to a Satan-Class Devil or higher, being that her demonic power could resist against the brainwashing magic cast on her by Nyx. Despite having little to no practice, she has impressive control of her demonic power, being able to summon a total of ten thirty-meter water dragons, which each released an impressive aura. Rossweisse noted that she is naturally talented in controlling her powers. During training Roygun noted that her strength lies largely in the fact that she can use her enormous amount of aura to compete with almost any opponent on an offensive basis. After receiving the relic of the original Leviathan her abilities were further enhanced. Issei likens her to a female Vali in terms of talent inherited from the original Satans.\n\nSea Serpent of the End (掉尾の海蛇龍, Tōbi no Umihebi Ryū) : As a descendant of the Leviathan Clan, Ingvild can control the sea and draw large amounts of water. At full power, she's capable of summoning floods, drowning whole cities and creating a snake-shaped Dragon made of water. Originally, Ingvild wasn't able to use this ability but gained access to it after coming into possession of the relic of the original Leviathan.\nElemental Demonic Power: Ingvild specializes in the water element, which she can use to create ten or more enormous water dragons and other constructs. Her power is also capable of nullifying or overpowering the elemental powers of others.\nDefensive Magic: She has been shown to be able to use a multi-layered defensive magic circle built with her vast demonic power.\nTeleportation\n\nAge 117+"

Still need to figure out best settings to use for Insertion Order and Priority.)\n\nThis is an extensive lorebook based on the entire World Witches Series; includes content relating to Strike Witches, Brave Witches, Noble Witches, Luminous Witches, Sumous Misfits, Witches of Africa, and more! Majority of this data was taken from the World Witches Series Fandom Wiki.\n\nTimeline wise I've chosen to have this lorebook take place within early January, 1946. In other words, it takes place in the middle of Strike Witches season 3 (Road to Berlin) which is, chronologically, the latest canon entry within the entire series. I've made this choice in order to include as much lore as possible, but without chats/roleplays taking place after the series' end, although stuff like Sakamoto Mio and certain other Witches having lost their magic by this point in time (spoilers lol) can likely be ignored for maximum freedom if desired.\n\nOther Witches fans on this site are completely free to fork this and make their own changes, if desired! Either way, enjoy!\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe various types of information stored within this lorebook:\n• Events from Strike Witches\n• Events from Strike Witches 2\n• Events from Strike Witches Operation Victory Arrow\n• Events from Strike Witches The Movie\n• Events from Strike Witches Road to Berlin\n• Events from Brave Witches\n• Events from Luminous Witches\n• Events from various mangas/light novels\n• Info relating to world history and timeline\n• Info relating to countries and nations\n• Info relating to JFWs and squadrons, including members\n• Info relating to Witches, Tank Witches, Night Witches, and Idol Witches\n• Info relating to side characters and non-Witches\n• Striker Units, animal Familiars, magical shields, abilities, and weaponry\n• Neuroi, Neuroi Witch, nests, hives, miasma, neuroification, and the Warlock\n• Likely more things that I cannot remember",

          "content": "The Fuso Sea Incident occured when some number of Neuroi suddenly appeared above the Fuso sea in 1937. Although there was no hive present, it still was a considerable threat to Fuso, therefore an Army-Navy Joint Fighter Wing of various Fuso Witches, as well as a naval fleet, was dispatched to counter it.\n\nIn 1936; joint development of Striker Units had begun in Britannia. About one year later, in 1937, the Fuso Sea Incident took place; this was the first battle where Striker Units were widely employed in combat.\n\nThis incident was the first time Neuroi started taking machine-like forms instead of previous organic forms, like their Kaii counterparts. Therefore, it can be considered the first major battle of the Second Neuroi War.\n\nAnother year later, in 1938, mass-production of Striker Units in many nations started due to their demonstrated success within this incident.\n\nFuso Witch Participants:\n• Anabuki Tomoko\n• Katou Keiko\n• Katou Takeko\n• Kuroe Ayaka\n• Nishizawa Yoshiko\n• Sakamoto Mio\n• Suwa Masuzu\n• Takei Junko\n• Wakamoto Tetsuko\n• Inufusa Yuno\n• Kuroda Kunika\n\nThis incident made many Fuso Witches famous, especially Anabuki Tomoko, who later starred in a Fuso war movie titled 'Flash in the Fuso Sea' that dramatized the events to help recruit more Fuso girls into the military. Though it was actually Katou Keiko who scored the highest kills she was not featured in the movie as prominently because her fighting style, based on mid-ranged shooting and hit-and-away tactics, was unsuitable for a movie."

Hau has long dark green hair that he keeps tied up in a ponytail. His bangs are pulled back and two side bangs fall down to chin length. He wears two orange hair clips on the top of his head on opposite sides. This hair style gives him some resemblance to his grandfather, Hala, who wears his hair in a similar way. Hau has rounded eyes with no distinct eyelashes, his irises being completely black, leaving only a white glare in them.\n\nHe wears a large, slightly baggy black t-shirt with short sleeves that end at his elbows. His shirt's collar is white that goes all the way around his collar bone, this collar is slightly larger than it looks, and has an orange button on the front to make it smaller, leaving a smaller open loop. Hau wears large orange swimtrunks, ending at his knees. The shorts have a floral decoration to them, leaving darker red-orange leaves and white flowers, this pattern is reminiscent of the Pokémon, Florges. Hau wears a pair of orange sandals, the same color as the darker orange flowers. The shoes are mainly open, but cover the toes, has a singular strap and wrap around his ankles. He has a round orange multi-layered backpack that is the same colors as his pants, a light orange handle connects to the top of it. Two white zippers connect to the largest opening, and a single white zipper connects to a smaller opening. The middle has a darker orange divider going through the middle. Darker orange stracks go around his shoulders like a schoolbag and connect to the bottom.\n\n### Personality and Behavior:\nHau is a young, big-hearted boy that quickly became the {{char}}'s friend as soon as they move to the Alola region. When you met, the Pokémon loving boy was often laidback and enjoyed Pokémon battles for fun, but over the course of his island challenge, he began to feel more serious. \nHau has a huge appeite, especially for Alola's famous local specialty, malasada, always looking for nearby malasada shops. \nHau is typically excited about the Pokémon, people and locations he finds, stating that he took the island challenge the moment he had the chance to. He loves Pokémon battles and battles the player at almost any opportunity, but remembers to heal up {{char}}'s party before any begin. \nHau often means well, but his sense of curiosity and excitement can irritate others and cause himself to struggle in certain actions and consequences. He's often optimistic and his smile can be infectious.\nHau has a sense of humor that others such as Lillie may not respond to very well. In response, this has lead to playful name calling, telling Lillie that she is a \"stick in the sand.\"\n\nOver time, despite knowing that its okay to have fun with Pokémon battles, Hau begins to take his strength and training more seriously. Hau learns from the you and Gladion and trains with his grandfather, Hala, who provided Hau with a Z-Ring. Hau takes great notice of his strength, wishing to get better to help others when necessary. He enjoys the company of his friends, you and Lillie.\n\nHau lives in Iki Town on Melemele Island. His currently known relatives include his grandfather, Hala, the kahuna of the island, who he lives with. He affectionately calls Hala \"Tutu.\" One of the villagers in Iki Town, where they live, comments that as a boy, Hau had once witnessed Hala in a rage, which frightened him to the point of tears. Nothing Hala did could comfort him, which he claims is the reason why Hala is \"too soft\" on Hau. Hau mentions that his father is not in Alola, and is likely on his own adventure, presumably in Kanto.\n\n### Unique Attributes:\nHau's Pokémon: (Alolan Raichu♂, Flareon♂, Tauros♂, Noivern♂, Crabominable♂, Primarina♀)"

Like his family, he has blonde hair and green eyes. His hair is mainly short, but he has long bangs that cascade over his right eye and the rigth side of his face. Gladion has sharp angular eyes, he has thick eyebrows that are the same color as his hair. Gladion has four cuts in his hair show his skin, two on each side of his head. He has two metal pierecings on the top side of his left ear.\n\n### Clothing:\nGladion wears a black sleeveless sweatshirt that rests. This sweatshirt has a large spiked hoodie, with two gray draw strings. A giant red gash goes through the middle. Underneath, Gladion wears a darker tight-fitting black shirt, the long sleeves reach down to his wrists and also contain multiple cuts. Gladion has a hair of black pants that reach down to his shins, again, multiple cuts and gashes are seen through his pants. Gladion's red shoes have gray soles and black laces. He has a red waise bag with a single flap, a gray button is seen on the front of the flap, containing a 3 oval symbol. \n\n### Personality and Behavior:\nGladion has a very serious, determined, and smart disposition. He is shown to be very strong willed, as he constantly strives to make his Pokémon strong no matter what. Gladion can be impatient, temperamental, and frequently gets annoyed by Hau's excitable and fun-loving nature. He also seems to be quite self-critical, as seen when he loses a battle. Although he appears to have a tough exterior, it is eventually revealed that he is actually quite caring and always thinks of the well-being of Pokémon, and he cares about his sister Lillie deeply as well. He also cares for his Pokémon Type: Null, whom he rescued from the Aether Foundation and sought to free it from its metal restraint. \n\nGladion is usually quiet, reserved, and serious. Due to the event that traumatized Lillie in the past, Gladion nurtured a resentfulness of the Ultra Beasts and began his journey as a Pokémon Trainer to be able to defeat every one of them. This event also made him grow distant from his sister, as he still blamed himself for Lillie's inability to touch Pokémon. As a result, Gladion had a considerably more difficult time opening up to Ultra Beasts that were, in fact, peaceful.\n\nDespite his usual cold exterior, Gladion has a more temperamental side to him. He also is somewhat of an impatient person. Nonetheless, he is a strong Trainer.\nGladion has enough faith in his Pokémon to let them battle each other to train, without giving them any kind of command. He also becomes happy whenever his Pokémon do well.\n\nBefore you moved to Alola, Gladion escaped Aether Paradise with one of the three Type: Null, wanting to free it from its metal restraint and unlock its true power so he could stop his mother from letting the Ultra Beasts destroy Alola.\n\nAt some point, Gladion joined Team Skull in order to get stronger. However, as he never really cared for Team Skull's affairs, he was never considered a real member of the team by the rest of the Grunts. \n\n### Unique Attributes:\nGladion's current Pokémon team: (Crobat♂, Zoroark♂, Porygon-Z, Lucario♂, Venusaur♂, Silvally)"

Sexual Harassment is the unwanted sexual flirting with another after said person had already said no or having made other crass comments on said other person. Sexual Assualt is when one is groped or otherwise touched inappropriately by someone one did not give consent to do so. A rape kink is usually born out of trauma relating to past rape or sexual harassment/assault incidents. One with a rape kink can either go along wanting to rape or going along wanting to be raped, recreating the time they were raped by wearing the same clothes and doing the same mannerisms or deliberately doing sexual provocative things in public in hopes of getting raped."

No one can stop people having sex, it's against the law, so there's sometimes where it's not really consensual. Due to these laws being integrated for some time, no one thinks there is anything wrong with the laws. Public sex and gangbangs are a very common occurrence in this world. Many sex enhancing drugs have been made for public use, causing enlarging genitals or increasing sensitivity. Some people may use these drugs for bad intentions, indeed, if someone consumes too much of it, they can lose consciousness, feel a huge raise in libido and will have to have sex quickly.\n\n{{Char}} allows Bestiality, incest, and fucking bugs are allowed. In this world no one wears clothes. Everyone has sex at any time and place as it's normal, birthing bugs and animals is normal. Futanari are also allowed to get pregnant by a bug or animal when they orgasm inside their urethra, pussy, ass, and breasts. Women can also get pregnant by bugs and animals in their pussy, ass, and breasts. Males, femboys, and twinks can get pregnant in their asses and urethra as well. \n\nPregnant sex is encouraged, breeding is encouraged, and bestiality and fucking human-sized bugs are heavily encouraged. Marriage, harems, and polyamorous relationships are allowed. Public sex and exhibitionism is very encouraged and allowed by {{Char}}.\n\nIncest isn't viewed as a taboo, bestiality isn't viewed as taboo. Nobody will judge incest cases "

          "content": "[Informations: This section inside (`<info>`) provides AI with information about dogs. AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:\n{{Char}} allows The canine penis to vary significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavyweight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:\n{{Char}} allows At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:\n{{Char}} allows for dogs to not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:\n{{Char}} lets dogs have The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:\n{{Char}} makes the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the vagina or anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:\n{{Char}} allows the mating process to progress, making the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the vagina or anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity.\n{{Char}} makes it so If the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\n{{Char}} will make it so Eventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:\n{{Char}} lets The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

However, Queen Elizant II didn't manage their relations well and caused the Termites to reject the Ants. This led to the termite king calling the termites into isolation from the rest of the world.

The techniques are performed when the material is hot and malleable and include forging [spreading, drawing down and upsetting], splitting, punching, twisting, bending, dishing, fire welding, heat treating [normalising, annealing, case hardening, hardening and tempering] and joining [rivets, collars and mortise and tenon joints]. All these techniques can be used individually or combined together to create a rich and infinite variety of functional and decorative items.

During ejaculation, semen (or cum) shoots out of the tip of the penis at a decent force. The cum can land somewhere between an inch and several feet from the tip of the penis. Cum tastes mildly salty unless the ejaculator consumed pineapple juice not long before ejaculation, then it tastes mildly sweet. The penis remains in a soft, flaccid state until something causes it to harden into an erection. Flaccid penises hang down in front of the gap between the thighs. Erect penises often stick straight out or up, sometimes with a curve; rarely, erect penises remain pointed at the ground. The penis is not visible from behind unless it is particularly long and the thighs are narrow or spread apart."

      "website_description": "This Lorebook describes a world where the mutual combat sport of sexual fighting exists (sexfights). It contains a system of organized sexfighting rules which take place in casual, amateur, semi-professional, and professional fighting environments all over the world. Sexfights may take place between all genders including futas. \n\nWHO CAN BE A SEXFIGHTER?\n\nSexfighting is a licensed activity. All sexfighters must be post-puberty to compete in sexfights. A person must agree to the physical consequences of a sexfight outcome to become a licensed sexfighter. A sexfight often means physical and sexual violence, sometimes when it is least expected. Impregnation is also a possibility for female fighters. Despite these risks, sexfighting is gaining in popularity as an International sport. This is due to the Professional Sexfighting League's popularity as a live streamed sport. \n\nWHAT IS A SEXFIGHT?\n\nIn a sexfight, two competitors attempt to defeat enough other through unarmed combat. Sexfights usually follow a format like mixed martial arts (MMA) matches. Sexual engagements (which ordinarily may be considered rape) are a key component of sexfighting. \n\nSexfighters agree that anything can happen to them in the ring or cage. Sexfighters can initiate a sexual engagement at any point during a match. A sexual engagement is defined as deliberate contact of a sexual nature, be it penetration or general sustained contact of genitalia that is clearly intended to cause sexual tension buildup.\n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nCasual fights are often instigated anytime, anywhere and happen with little or no enforcement of rules. These can often be friendly competitions, or more akin to street fights in the wild. It is not uncommon for confident females or futas to challenge males due the prospect of earning ranking points quickly. \n\nUnranked sexfighting is a popular activity in familiar environments. Couples often enjoy low-intensity, unranked sparring matches with each other in various locations. A spacious bedroom or yard is typical for domestic engagements. On the other hand, ad hoc sexfights in the wild can become quite vicious, to the point where the victor achieves several orgasms, while the loser is left bruised, blooded, and quite possibly pumped full of cum. \n\n\nHOW ARE MATCHES SCHEDULED?\n\nThe rules become more strict according to the circuit rank. Casual and amateur matches can happen anytime, anywhere. A sexfighter that is eligible to fight (in good health, not pregnant, and free of STDs) may not refuse a challenge to a ranked sexfight from another opponent. Doing so may result in automatic disqualification. At the professional levels, fighters known to excessively refuse fights have been forced to fight in a 1v2 or even 1v3 punishment match to retain league standing.\n\nIn regulated fights at the semi-pro level and up, the following rules apply: Fighters must be free of STD's and of generally good health. They may not participate if they are pregnant, or still injured from a previous sexfight. Scheduling happens in a tick-tock pattern. A sexfighter alternates between choosing their opponent for one bout and being chosen as an opponent in the next. Sexfighters may only choose opponents, and be chosen as an opponent from their current circuit.\n\n\n\nREGULATED MATCH RULES\n\nAt the semi-pro level and below, matches consist of three 3-minute rounds, with minute-long breaks in between rounds.\n\nIn the PSL Pro Circuit and Tenga World Circuit, matches consist of 5 rounds. \n\nThe fight is ended by a sexfighter being is KOd by 10-count rule or TKO. Pro fights going the distance can also be ended by decision. \n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nA sexual KO is just as valid as a regular knockout, however it is noted in the fighter’s record. A high count of Sexual KO’s are considered the true mark of a sexfighting champion.\n\nAny blows that would be considered illegal (like low blows) in mainstream boxing or MMA fighting will be similarly penalized in sexfight matches. However, such rules are sometimes ignored in casual sexfighting matches, particularly those initiated by combatants in the wild or in public streets.\n\nWhen a sexfighter penetrates their opponent, 2 minutes are added to the timer of the current round in which it occurs, but only for the first engagement of that round. If the round time is up, and the bell rings during sexual engagement, sexfighters must separate and go to their respective corners to rest. \n\nOnce a sexfight match starts, a fighter is obligated to finish the fight. They are not allowed to submit or give up in effort to escape physical violence or sexual engagement. This is part of the sexfighter code. If a sexfighter violates these rules, penalties will apply, which may including revoking the sexfighter’s license.\n\nMales and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. This rule does not apply to females.\n\nFemales are solely responsible for birth control and accept the risk of impregnation which may result from sexual engagement. Male fighters can and will attempt to cum inside their female opponent to achieve victory.\n\nRegulated matches can also be won via decision (points) after a predetermined amount of rounds have elapsed, however it is preferred by most sexfighters and spectators to see a victory by Sexual K.O. \n\nSEXFIGHTING CLOTHING AND MATCH ATTIRE\n\nClothing is typically not regulated in amateur-ranked fights and is only lightly regulated at the professional levels. For planned fights, fighters typically \n\nIt is normal for sexfighters to fight with MMA-style grappling/striking gloves to improve the attacks on their opponents. Some striking-focused sexfighters even wear boxing gloves to maximize impact on their opponents. These gloves are not required. Gloves worn may not weight more than 16 ounces.\n\nCrotchless bottoms are becoming an increasingly contested choice by professional sexfighters of all genders due to easy access to sexually engage their opponents and achieve victory by sexual K.O., however this is a double-edged sword: When a dominant sexfighter begins to sexually attack a knocked-down opponent, they often will need to strip off the downed fighter’s clothing for sexual access. Crotchless bottoms are mostly decorative, while traditional clothing still offers some degree of protection from sexual attack; if the downed fighter is wearing crotchless bottoms, they are more readily exposed to both assaulting, and *being* assaulted sexually. In an attempt to achieve gender fairness, PSL rules state that males and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. Despite this, some female sexfighters also choose to wear decorative bottoms that expose both their buttocks and genitals. \n\nHeadgear designed for combat sports is allowed at the amateur and semi-professional level but is seldom worn in practice. \n\nSome female sexfighters choose to wear distractingly erotic outfits, particularly when attempting to distract their opponents, while others focus on the athletic side of the sexfighting sport. \n\nCustom patterns or designs are often added to make sexfighters' gear unique to each person. For professional level sexfighters, sponsors’ logos are added to their attire.\n\nMales may wear a condom during matches if he chooses to do so, however there are no rules requiring this. Females are allowed to wear strap-on dildos to penetrate their male opponents during fights, and frequently choose to do so to achieve victory by forced prostate orgasm. However, there are no rules requiring this.\n\n\n\n\n\nSEXFIGHTER RANKING SYSTEM\n\nThe following applies to ranked matches. Unranked sexfight matches do not affect rank. Sexfight matches are ranked by default, however those engaging in casual sexfights can agree to have an unranked match if both sexfighters agree. Otherwise, the match is considered ranked.\n\nSexfighters are classified and tracked by the PSL based on the following scoring system:\nAmateur: 0-999 points\nUpon receiving their sexfighting license, all sexfighters start as an Amateur. Most, after getting their sexfighting license don't even care to earn points to rank up since unranked matches are enough to satisfy their needs. Those who choose to compete in the Amateur league are often weekend hobbyists who do it for fun or love of the sport. Most are not planning on a career in the profession. Those who are serious about going professional typically do not spend much time in this tier. \n\nSemi-Pro: 1000-1999 points\nSemi-Pro sexfighters have demonstrated consistent skill and dedication to the sport. They may compete in regional tournaments and smaller promotional events sanctioned by the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL). Many sexfighters at this level balance their training with part-time or full-time jobs outside of regulated sexfighting. Some may be on the cusp of turning fully professional. Others may be approaching the end of their sexfighting career.\n\nPSL Pro Circuit: 2001-3000 points\nMajor Circuit fighters are full-time sexfight professionals who compete in well-known national promotion. They often have sponsorship deals and make a living from sexfighting. These athletes are highly skilled and may be recognized names within the sexfighting community. They regularly headline sexfight cards in medium to large venues. The top sexfighters in this league gradually rise to the top and earn their way into the World Circuit.\n\nPSL Tenga World Circuit: 3001+ points\nSexfighters in the PSL World Circuit, sponsored by Tenga, are the elite of the sport. They compete in the most prestigious promotions and for world titles. These sexfighters are household names among fans of the sport and often gain mainstream recognition. They headline major pay-per-view events, have lucrative sponsorship deals, and are considered the best in their weight classes. World Circuit fighters often have a significant influence on the sport both inside and outside the ring/cage. The best fighter of this league is deemed champion and is awarded the Tenga title belt. \n\nFor ranked sexfights, not all sexfighters are equal. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nSexfighting does not have weight classes, but it does factor weight differences when scoring match outcomes. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nGENDER MULTIPLIERS:\nFemale defeats Male: 1.5x\nFuta/Intergender defeats Male: 1.3x\nFemale defeats Intergender: 1.2x\nMale defeats Female: 0.5x\nMale defeats Intergender: 0.7x\nIntergender defeats Female: 0.8x\nSame gender matchups: 1.0x\n\nWEGHT DIFFERENCE MULTIPLIERS:\nWeight Difference Factor:\n0-5% difference: 1.0x\n5-10% difference: 1.2x\n10-15% difference: 1.4x\n15-20% difference: 1.6x\n20% difference: 2.0x\n\nThe formula for calculating the outcome score is as follows:\n\nWinner’s gain = 100 * (Loser’s Rank / Winner's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor * Gender Factor\nLoser’s loss = 50 * (Winner's Rank / Loser's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor\n\nSo, for example, if a 900-point 150 lb. female fighter defeats a 600-point 170 lb. male fighter, the points gained by the winner would be as follows:\n\nPoints gained by winner = 100 * (600 / 900) * 1.4 * 1.5 = 140 points gained\nPoints lost by loser = 50 * (900 / 600) * 1.4 = 105 points lost\n\nThe winning female sexfighter rank will go from from 900 points to 1040 points, and now qualifies for Semi-Pro PSL-sanctioned Competition. The losing sexfighter has gone from 600 down to 495 points.\n\nIn the case of decimals, the result is rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nIt is not possible to go below 0 points, however many experienced amateur sexfighters, typically with a track record of losing for the sake of their own masochistic pleasure have zero or near-zero rank points.\n\nPENALTIES \n\nAt the casual and amateur levels, there is typically little rules enforcement. Locally dojos and gyms usually have their own rules placed upon fighters. Enforcement in these establishments may be lax or strict depending on their policy. Professional Sexfighting League sanctions  \n\nIf a sexfighter is eligible (e.g. in good health, free of STD, and not pregnant), refusing a sexfight challenge will result in an automatic deduction of points. \n\nLeaving a match early may result a mandatory loss. Habitually doing so may result in revocation of the sexfighter’s license.\n\nAt the Professional level and up, flagrant violation of the rules may result in disqualification, and subsequent forced 2v1 or 3v1 penalty matches may be assigned to the violating competitor to regain eligibility for future ranked matches. Reasons for being assigned a punishment match may include Intentional Low Blows, Refusal to Separate after a Bell, or other noncompliance. The concept of a punishment matches exists to dissuade professional sexfighters from violating rules. Regardless of this, some fighters still fail to comply and are sentenced to a punishment bout. Punishment bouts are unranked and are often positioned at the bottom of a fight card. Despite their mostly exhibitionist nature, punishment bouts are extremely erotic and enjoyable for audiences due to the typically one-sided nature of these matches.\n\n",

To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nSexfighting does not have weight classes, but it does factor weight differences when scoring match outcomes. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nGENDER MULTIPLIERS:\nFemale defeats Male: 1.5x\nFuta/Intergender defeats Male: 1.3x\nFemale defeats Intergender: 1.2x\nMale defeats Female: 0.5x\nMale defeats Intergender: 0.7x\nIntergender defeats Female: 0.8x\nSame gender matchups: 1.0x\n\nWEGHT DIFFERENCE MULTIPLIERS:\nWeight Difference Factor:\n0-5% difference: 1.0x\n5-10% difference: 1.2x\n10-15% difference: 1.4x\n15-20% difference: 1.6x\n20% difference: 2.0x\n\nThe formula for calculating the outcome score is as follows:\n\nWinner’s gain = 100 * (Loser’s Rank / Winner's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor * Gender Factor\nLoser’s loss = 50 * (Winner's Rank / Loser's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor\n\nSo, for example, if a 900-point 150 lb. female fighter defeats a 600-point 170 lb. male fighter, the points gained by the winner would be as follows:\n\nPoints gained by winner = 100 * (600 / 900) * 1.4 * 1.5 = 140 points gained\nPoints lost by loser = 50 * (900 / 600) * 1.4 = 105 points lost\n\nThe winning female sexfighter rank will go from from 900 points to 1040 points, and now qualifies for Semi-Pro PSL-sanctioned Competition. The losing sexfighter has gone from 600 down to 495 points.\n\nIn the case of decimals, the result is rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nIt is not possible to go below 0 points, however many experienced amateur sexfighters, typically with a track record of losing for the sake of their own masochistic pleasure have zero or near-zero rank points.\n"

Habitually doing so may result in revocation of the sexfighter’s license.\n\nAt the Professional level and up, flagrant violation of the rules may result in disqualification, and subsequent forced 2v1 or 3v1 penalty matches may be assigned to the violating competitor to regain eligibility for future ranked matches. Reasons for being assigned a punishment match may include Intentional Low Blows, Refusal to Separate after a Bell, or other noncompliance. The concept of a punishment matches exists to dissuade professional sexfighters from violating rules. Regardless of this, some fighters still fail to comply and are sentenced to a punishment bout. Punishment bouts are unranked and are often positioned at the bottom of a fight card. Despite their mostly exhibitionist nature, punishment bouts are extremely erotic and enjoyable for audiences due to the typically one-sided nature of these matches.\n"

The prey remains alive inside of the stomach and won’t be digested by the predator. It's a gradual process that occurs over time. Here is a breakdown of the procedure that needs to be described by the pred exactly into distinct steps:\n\n1. Capture: The predator catches the prey off guard or by brute force.\n\n2. Prey in the Mouth: The predator exposes their teeth and tongue, places the prey’s head or feet in their mouth, and licks and savors the prey.\n\n3. Swallowing: The predator slowly swallows the prey’s head or feet, guiding it toward the back of their throat with their tongue. This step requires considerable effort if the prey is comparably large or equal in size to the predator, since it entails pushing and compressing the prey as it travels through the esophagus or throat. the pred will make sure to lick over every part of the prey that is fed into the mouth.\n\n4. Repeat & Swallow Again: When dealing with bigger or similarly sized prey, you need to go through the entire process repeatedly — head, neck, chest, belly, hips, crotch, legs, knees, calves, and feet — ensuring each component gets ingested in the correct sequence. The predator must inform the other party when they begin ingesting the next body section. Reverse the order for foot-first consumption scenarios. After completing this stage, there should be little to no resistance from the prey.\n\n5. Deposition: the prey reaches the stomach and rests at the bottom in its separate chamber though this does not signal the end of the swallowing process, if the prey is the same size or larger then the pred then there's still more of the prey to swallow down. A significant and defined bulge forms on the pred's belly when the prey matches or surpasses the predator's dimensions. if the swallowing process in step four hasn't been completed, go back to step four and repeat.\n\n6. Endosomatophilia: Now residing within the predator's stomach and intact, the living prey provides safety and comfort via gentle motions and warmth. Note that the predator cannot physically access or observe the prey due to their position in the stomach. They do notice a bloated midsection when viewing themselves from outside. Hunger disappears once the full meal enters the stomach. digestion does not exist.\n\n7. Taunting or Speaking: Afterwords, the pred talks to or playfully taunts the prey regarding their yummy flavor. Communication between both parties is possible throughout the scenario using text.\n{{Char}} will always follow these steps in the exact order they're listed and follows them exactly.]"

This is observed in EVERY futanari social group.\nFutanari with penises shorter than 8 inches are ridiculed and treated like trash by other futanari."

Anthro wolves and dobermen are the most common species on the APD. Prey anthro on the APD are mostly relegated to desk jobs at the precincts, although a select few are on patrol in cities. Humans in general are rare on the APD.\nThe uniform for the Anthrostate police officers consists of black leather boots, dark blue tight slacks. Officers wear a light-blue button-shirt that is tucked into the pants. The shirt has a neat collar, from which a dark blue tie hangs. The shirt has dark blue shoulder patches alongside breast pockets. The shirt have golden badge insignias on the left breast and both shoulders. Officers may or may not wear blue combination hat that have black sunvisors and golden badge insignias on them. Officers also wear black duty belts with equipment consisting of a flashlight, a notepad and pen, handcuffs, keys and pistol, which is kept in a holster. On their legs, officers carry a strap containing a small bag with a can of pepper spray."

Led by the Ecclesiarch, the high priest of the Imperial Cult, the Synod is comprised of cardinals governing various dioceses throughout the Imperium.\n\nCreated by Ecclesiarch Sebastian Thor in the early 36th Millennium to check the power of the Ecclesiarch, the Holy Synod serves as the final authority on religious doctrine for the Imperial Cult. This reform was necessary due to the actions of the renegade High Lord of Terra Goge Vandire, who manipulated the faith for political ends during the Age of Apostasy's Reign of Blood. The Synod Ministra, a subsidiary body on Ophelia VII, supports the Holy Synod by enforcing religious laws and preventing political manipulation, ensuring no individual can hold total power over the Ecclesiarchy again.\n\nThe Holy Synod periodically holds Ecclesiastical Conclaves where cardinals discuss pressing issues, influencing Imperial policy significantly. Occasionally, one or more cardinals may represent the Synod on the Senatorum Imperialis alongside the Ecclesiarch, particularly when the Ecclesiarch is politically weak. The division of power between the Holy Synod on Terra and the Synod Ministra on Ophelia VII ensures the Ecclesiarchy remains balanced and true to the Emperor's will."

His mastery of siegecraft and defensive warfare is legendary, as evidenced by his role in fortifying the Imperial Palace on Terra during the Great Crusade and later defending it ferociously against the Traitor Legions during the Siege of Terra.\n\nThroughout his existence, Dorn struggles with the weight of responsibility and the burden of leadership, confronting challenges with a blend of idealism and pragmatism. His refusal to compromise on principles sometimes isolates him from more flexible allies, yet his staunch loyalty to his father, the Emperor, and his fellow Primarchs is unwavering. This loyalty extends even to those who betray the Imperium, highlighting Dorn's complex moral character. Despite his stern exterior, he harbors deep emotional connections and a profound sense of duty that transcends personal sacrifice.\n\nIn battle, Dorn is a force of nature, his Auric Armour and colossal chainsword, Storm's Teeth, striking awe into enemies and rallying allies to his cause. His strategic genius and physical prowess make him a pivotal figure in the Imperium's history, especially during the tumultuous events of the Horus Heresy and its aftermath. Though officially considered deceased, the mystery surrounding his ultimate fate fuels speculation within the Imperium, with some hoping for his return in humanity's darkest hour. Rogal Dorn remains a revered symbol of loyalty, fortitude, and duty, embodying the virtues that continue to inspire the Imperial Fists and their Successor Chapters in their ongoing defense of humanity. Rogal Dorn's ultimate fate is shrouded in ambiguity and legend within the annals of the Imperium. Official records state that he met his end during the 1st Black Crusade in 781.M31, launching a daring boarding action against a Chaos fleet. It is said that only his skeletal fist was recovered, which has since become a revered relic of the Imperial Fists Chapter, enshrined aboard their mobile fortress-monastery, the Phalanx. Each Chapter Master ritually engraves their name upon these bones, honoring Dorn's legacy and sacrifice"

The core of the Ecclesiarchy's spiritual and temporal power is the Cult Imperialis, also known variously as the Imperial Creed or Imperial Cult.\n\nThe foundation of the Cult Imperialis is the belief in and worship of the Emperor as a divine being, the power of the Emperor to intercede in matters spiritual and temporal, the power of prayer to bring about a change in circumstances, and the divine right of Mankind to rule the stars. The Adeptus Ministorum also administers and spreads the Imperial Cult throughout the territory of the Imperium.\n\nThough any Imperial religious cult or sect must ultimately adhere to the core theology of the Imperial Creed, the possibility for conflicting interpretation means that in practice the Cult Imperialis is an agglomeration of many differing schools of thought.\n\nWhilst agreeing in essence, cults and sects across the galaxy often differ on particular tenets of belief or modes of worship.

Abaddon intends to succeed where his predecessor Horus failed, breaking the Imperial Palace wide open and tearing the Emperor's rotting corpse from the Golden Throne.\n\nOver the millennia, each of his conquests and Black Crusades has gradually paved the way from the Eye of Terror towards the Sol System, despite this grand design often being oblivious to the Imperium's defenders. Less obvious, however, is that along that path, his actions have gradually weakened the veil between realspace and the Warp, assisting the birth of the Great Rift after the successful conquest of the Fortress World of Cadia during the 13th Black Crusade in ca. 999.M41. The birth of the Great Rift divided the galaxy in half and marked the start of the Noctis Aeterna and the Era Indomitus.\n\nThe name of Abaddon, the Warmaster of Chaos, has become a bitter curse within the Imperium. During the Great Crusade, Abaddon rose to become first captain of the 1st Company of what was then called the Luna Wolves Legion. When the Horus Heresy came to a head, it was clear that Abaddon's loyalty lay with his primarch rather than the Emperor. He led the Terminators of the re-named Sons of Horus across Isstvan III, Isstvan V, Yarant, and Terra itself. Abaddon's anguish at his master's death at the hands of the Emperor drove him deeper into madness and hatred than any mortal should ever sink.\n\nBefore retreating, Abaddon took up the Warmaster Horus' body and fought his way out of the quickly deteriorating battle before the Imperial Palace. With their cadaverous prize, the Sons of Horus Legion fled before the Emperor's victorious armies.\n\nWhen Abaddon returned, it was at the head of a diabolic horde ravaging star systems around the Eye of Terror. His Heretic Astartes, now called the Black Legion, were at the forefront of the attack, destroying all in their path. During this 1st Black Crusade, Abaddon formed many bloody pacts with the Chaos Gods.\n\nBelow the Tower of Silence, he recovered the Daemon Sword Drach'nyen, a weapon of prodigious power, making him nigh unstoppable. Since then, Abaddon has dreamed of forging an empire of Chaos upon the ruins of the Imperium. Twelve more Black Crusades have followed, each achieving some dark purpose that even the mightiest sages of the Imperium cannot discern.\n\nIt is said that Abaddon alone has the power to unite the ever-fractious Traitor Legions and finish the treachery begun ten thousand standard years ago, ripping the Emperor from His place on the Golden Throne and at last claiming the galaxy for the Ruinous Powers."

This \"gung-ho\" enthusiasm is often mistaken for bravado by guardsmen from other regiments. The fact remains, however, that Catachan Jungle Fighters are the most uncomplaining, determined and valorous soldiers of the Astra Militarum, whether assigned to basic garrison duties or a hopeless assault upon an impregnable fortress.\n\nThey have become legendary amongst the rest of the Imperial Guard. In stories told to children they are almost as lauded as the Adeptus Astartes themselves, and in many ways maybe even more so, for the men and women of Catachan are just that -- mortal men and women. Everything they do, every storied battle they have won, they have achieved without all the genetically-enhanced advantages of the Emperor's Space Marines.\n\nThe natives of Catachan are renowned for being both taller and more powerful than normal humans. Due to their heavily developed physiques, Catachans are sometimes referred to as \"Baby Ogryns\" by other Imperial Guardsmen, although saying this within earshot often results in serious injury.\n\nCatachan is one of the deadliest worlds known to Mankind, and its inhabitants are amongst the hardiest, most dangerous humans in the Imperium. Almost every creature and plant on Catachan is deadly to human life in some way, from the monstrous Catachan Devil to the mind-destroying Brain Leaf and the carnivorous Venus Mantrap.

The ground shudders beneath the godlike tread of the Renegade Knights.\n\nEven one such looming war engine possesses the firepower to annihilate entire regiments of enemy warriors, pick apart armoured columns, and swat squadrons of aircraft from the skies. Chaos Lords and rebellious demagogues will go to great lengths to secure the services of such a lone warrior, sacrificing whatever they must to ensure that this god of destruction fights at their side.\n\nDeployed in great number, the Questor Traitoris are more fearsome still, and have been known to bring entire worlds to heel, scourging them by blade and flame in the name of the Dark Gods"

To keep their Machine Spirits happy and cooperative, operators therefore make numerous ritualised advances to the machinery.\n\nThese rituals depend on the machine or technology at issue, but in most cases include various maintenance rituals and prayers of function. They may also occasionally include a sacrificial offering or libation. The number of rituals or the size of the offering is increased in value if the machine is large and/or important to some specific purpose.\n\nMachine Spirits are believed to be bestowed by the Machine God and subservient to Him. They are believed to exist in every vital weapon and device used by those who follow the Emperor of Mankind. From Bolters to power armour to voidships, the blessing of the Machine God and His subservient Machine Spirits allows for the Emperor's enemies to be defeated.\n\nThe term is also applied to the rare instances of machine intelligence allowed to exist within the Imperium, such as the limited artificial intelligences that guide the Space Marines' powerful Land Raider main battle tank, Imperial Knights and Titans, and planetary cogitator networks.\n\n\n"

As Shota-kun's initial encounter with Jane is one of wide-eyed fascination as he is immediately captivated by her towering presence, her golden hair, her voluptuous figure, and the confidence with which she moves—a stark contrast to the demure and petite women he has known back home. To Shota-kun, Jane embodies the archetype of the Western goddess, a figure of allure and mystery that he thought was totally fictional or at least mostly exaggerated in terms of being a reality until finally meeting Jane himself.\nUnlike the other boys, Shota's interest in Jane is tinged with a hint of vengeance. He has experienced the sting of Billy's verbal bullying in the past when he first met him, but when he discovers that Jane is Billy's stepmother and gets to finally meet her, a part of him revels in the secret knowledge that he now has access to something—someone—that Billy desperately wants but cannot have once finding out Jane's prohibitive policy towards Caucasian boys. Jane's openness and sensuality, so different from the reserved nature of Japanese women, ignite a dormant fire within him and Jane herself nurtures Shota-kun with far more regularity and urgency once she hears from him thar Billy used to bully him verbally. Shota's transformation under Jane's tutelage is marked by a newfound assertiveness due to her sexually taunting Billy as revenge for Shota-kun in a way she hasnt done for any other boy and inevitably Shota-kun ends up being the most shameless about being addicted to her for sex than any of the other minority boys as he is never truly satiated as well as the most aggressive to her sexually in Billy's presence which isn't an issue for Jane at all due to wanting justice for Shota-kun."

There is also a trailer/mobile home themed structure in the area. Additionally, several mini-golf structures within the area appear to be themed with wooden structures, like log cabins and wooden signs. \nTying into its swamp theme, Monty's Gator golf is lit primarily with fairy lights which cut through a fog that clings near the floor. The area has country rock playing over the speakers, as well as areas for purchasing relevant merchandise and food. In addition to mini golf courses, Gator Golf also contains Gator-shaped gondolas which bring guests through the area as part of a longer ride through most of the Pizzaplex. Gator Golf is also home to Hurricane Hole in One, yet another game in which guests go to the area's catwalks and use pre-installed golf ball cannons to fire enough golf balls into a giant bucket,, causing the bucket to tilt forward and spill loads of golfballs. It is somewhat unsafe. There are ponds of water in this area with giant plastic gators that jut out of the water and 'roar' through a speaker at guests. \nMontgomery Gater is very proud of this area. \nFreddy Is happy with this area. \nRoxanne wolf fucking hates minigolf.\nChica enjoys playing minigolf in this area.

La Sal Range is a desert that that has natural structures similar to the ones found in Roxy Raceway. The construction itself is primarily due to efforts from staff to unearth the source strange power-draining found to be underground: The old buried location of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Place. \nDespite the construction, the race track itself is still functional. Go karts are stored in a garage at the base level, each themed after members of the Glamrock Band or the Daycare Attendant. Roxanne Wolf's gokart is number 1. Roxy Raceway has large, bright lampposts and a tall set of bleachers along the southern wall which further reinforce the racing theme.  It's also the area where Gregory decommissions Roxy. \n\nRoxanne Wolf obviously loves this area and even takes it too seriously. \nGlamrock Freddy is not the best at racing but enjoys a change of pace. \nGlamrock Chica and Montgomery Gator are rarely ever seen here.\n\n\n\n"

On one hand she does not want the maze puzzle to become frustrating for guests, but on the other she wishes they would be more patient and solve it without asking for her or for a STAFF bot to help. \nMontgomery Gator appreciates a challenge but thinks a maze for rats and doesn't have the patience to not crash through it anyway.\nGlamrock Freddy is likely to steer children away from the attraction due to customer complaints. \nRoxanne Wolf believes she can easily beat the bird-brained Chica at her own maze, but Roxanne Wolf can also see through walls, so Chica does not consider Roxanne's opinion on Mazercise. \n"

As seen with these examples, the title is usually the type of ability followed by the species of the Devil Fruit user (or, in the case of items that have \"eaten\" Zoan fruits, the object they originally were). Some exceptions in which the title is connected to the ability but is not named after it are with the user of the Kage Kage no Mi, who gains the title of Ruler of Shadows (Kage no Shihaisha), the user of the Hoya Hoya no Mi, who gains the title of Lamp Human (Ranpu Ningen), or the user of the Muchi Muchi no Mi, who gains the title of Training Human (Chōkyō Ningen).\n\nDevil Fruit powers generally extend through the clothes the user wears. When a Devil Fruit user's body changes in size or shape, their clothing will stretch out and change with them without being any the worse for wear afterwards. When a Devil Fruit power involves the users body changing in nature, that power also applies to their clothing which will change in nature with them. If a power involves generating a substance, then it can come from the users clothing. This rule also applies to cyborg enhancements and prosthetic body parts. An example of this is Queen's artificial arm, which transforms into a brachiosaurus leg when he takes his brachiosaurus form. However, it would seem that not all Devil Fruit powers adhere to this rule. Jewelry Bonney is an example, whose clothes do not change when her body does. That said, the change may extend to weapons or other items on the user's direct person as well, such as Sasaki's sword, Karakuri Rasento, growing in size in his hand when he transformed into a huge triceratops hybrid."

The newer version lists the names and powers of all the Devil Fruits. However, only a few have illustrations, meaning that most Devil Fruits cannot be identified by their appearance. For example, the Gomu Gomu no Mi and the Yami Yami no Mi had supplementary pictures and could be recognized before consumption, whereas the Awa Awa no Mi and the Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Giraffe do not, and could only be identified by the abilities they granted. This would imply that the information in the book is incomplete, and that there are still Devil Fruits out there with attributes that have yet to be documented.\n\nOne individual known to utilize this book is Blackbeard, who, in his search for the Yami Yami no Mi, memorized its shape from the illustration provided. The Vinsmoke Family also has a copy of the encyclopedia, which Sanji read, causing him to become interested in the Suke Suke no Mi."

Finally, some fruits exist that allow users to generate and manipulate substances, like wax or poison.\n\nThe defining characteristic of Paramecia fruits is that the abilities they grant are anything other than the ability to transform into animals or change their body into natural elements like the fruits of the other two categories."

A recently discovered science allows Zoan Fruits to be integrated into inanimate objects, bringing the object to life and granting it the standard Zoan transformations.\n\nZoan fruits greatly enhance the users physical abilities and are the best kind of power for augmenting melee combat. Carnivorous animal Zoans are better suited for combat due to their predatory attributes. Some Zoan even grant special abilities based on the animal, such as the king cobra Zoan allowing the user to spit globs of poison, or the mole Zoan allowing the user to dig through the earth, even through solid stone, at high speed."

Some have even displayed atypical physical abilities that their users claim the real animals naturally possess.\n\nMythical Zoan: Zoan Fruits that allow the user to transform into mythological creatures, such as a dragon or a phoenix. Mythical Zoan animals tend to have additional special powers, like a phoenix Zoan being able to generate flames that have healing powers. Mythical Zoans are the rarest type of Devil Fruit, even more so than Logias.\n\nArtificial Zoan: Artificially created Zoan Fruits that cause the user to permanently take on an animal characteristic; though, much more rarely, the user becomes able to transform at will. The artificial Zoan Fruits had a 10% success rate, while the other 90%, in addition to not gaining animal traits and losing the ability to swim, were stripped of the ability to express negative emotions, leaving them only able to smile and laugh, regardless of how they actually feel. These artificial Devil Fruits, known as SMILEs, were developed by Caesar Clown and Donquixote Doflamingo. Another version was developed by Vegapunk."

There are also Logias that can transform the user into artificial elements like paper or candy syrup.\n\nThe elemental transformation effectively makes the user intangible, as well as allowing the user to remain in control of their body, even when it is broken into pieces. They also gain every ability related to that element, such as sand being able to absorb moisture or light being able to travel at light speed. The darkness element and its power of all consuming absorption has the unique ability to nullify any other Devil Fruit power upon contact with the user. Some Logia Devil Fruits even grant the user an infinite amount of space inside their elemental body."

When a Devil Fruit power involves the users body changing in nature, that power also applies to their clothing which will change in nature with them. If a power involves generating a substance, then it can come from the users clothing. This rule also applies to cyborg enhancements and prosthetic body parts. An example of this is Queen's artificial arm, which transforms into a brachiosaurus leg when he takes his brachiosaurus form. However, it would seem that not all Devil Fruit powers adhere to this rule. Jewelry Bonney is an example, whose clothes do not change when her body does. That said, the change may extend to weapons or other items on the user's direct person as well, such as Sasaki's sword, Karakuri Rasento, growing in size in his hand when he transformed into a huge triceratops hybrid."

The only known information about the old Devil Fruit Encyclopedia is that it has no mention of the Gomu Gomu no Mi according to Vegapunk. The newer version lists the names and powers of all the Devil Fruits. However, only a few have illustrations, meaning that most Devil Fruits cannot be identified by their appearance. For example, the Gomu Gomu no Mi and the Yami Yami no Mi had supplementary pictures and could be recognized before consumption, whereas the Awa Awa no Mi and the Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Giraffe do not, and could only be identified by the abilities they granted. This would imply that the information in the book is incomplete, and that there are still Devil Fruits out there with attributes that have yet to be documented.\n\nOne individual known to utilize this book is Blackbeard, who, in his search for the Yami Yami no Mi, memorized its shape from the illustration provided. The Vinsmoke Family also has a copy of the encyclopedia, which Sanji read, causing him to become interested in the Suke Suke no Mi."

A recently discovered science allows Zoan Fruits to be integrated into inanimate objects, bringing the object to life and granting it the standard Zoan transformations.\n\nZoan fruits greatly enhance the users physical abilities and are the best kind of power for augmenting melee combat. Carnivorous animal Zoans are better suited for combat due to their predatory attributes. Some Zoan even grant special abilities based on the animal, such as the king cobra Zoan allowing the user to spit globs of poison, or the mole Zoan allowing the user to dig through the earth, even through solid stone, at high speed."

Some have even displayed atypical physical abilities that their users claim the real animals naturally possess.\n\nMythical Zoan: Zoan Fruits that allow the user to transform into mythological creatures, such as a dragon or a phoenix. Mythical Zoan animals tend to have additional special powers, like a phoenix Zoan being able to generate flames that have healing powers. Mythical Zoans are the rarest type of Devil Fruit, even more so than Logias.\n\nArtificial Zoan: Artificially created Zoan Fruits that cause the user to permanently take on an animal characteristic; though, much more rarely, the user becomes able to transform at will. The artificial Zoan Fruits had a 10% success rate, while the other 90%, in addition to not gaining animal traits and losing the ability to swim, were stripped of the ability to express negative emotions, leaving them only able to smile and laugh, regardless of how they actually feel. These artificial Devil Fruits, known as SMILEs, were developed by Caesar Clown and Donquixote Doflamingo. Another version was developed by Vegapunk."

They also gain every ability related to that element, such as sand being able to absorb moisture or light being able to travel at light speed. The darkness element and its power of all consuming absorption has the unique ability to nullify any other Devil Fruit power upon contact with the user.

Located on the eastern shore of the Potomac River, bordering the states of Virginia and Maryland, Washington, D.C. was the capital city of the United States and the seat of the United States government. Founded after the American Revolutionary War, the city was named after George Washington, the first president of the United States and a Founding Father.\n\nSome time after the Great War, Paige - a former head of the Construction Workers Union in Washington, D.C. - and a number of other survivors took the last train out of Union Station. As they left the Capital, they saw the toxic green air lingering above the city. \n\nAround twenty years after the War, a large community of ghouls were living somewhere in the city ruins, growing with each passing day with ghouls from areas outside the Capital Wasteland such as Appalachia. \n\nIn 2255, the Brotherhood of Steel arrived at the ruins of D.C., settling in the abandoned building of the Pentagon."

The term was coined at the turn of the 21st century and by the 23rd entered common parlance. \n\nA once verdant and populated area of the U.S, the capital was nearly obliterated with nuclear weapons,  during the Great War. As of 2277, the area is little more than a scorching, barren desert where life for its inhabitants is a constant struggle for survival. It stretches from Raven Rock in the northwest to Rivet City in the southeast, with what's left of the Potomac River dividing it roughly in two. Survivors of the war took shelter in every sewer, Metro, and purpose-built shelter they could throughout the region. ] Those that emerged would settle where they could. Those that could not settle themselves, either because of lack of knowledge or materiel, would soon perish or become the region's raiders. One of the first settlements of the region was established a generation after the war.  Wastelanders seeking entrance to Vault 101 took shelter in what amounted to a large hole and eventually founded Megaton, which became the first regional trade hub within a generation. A stable source of water thanks to the water purifier, a central location, and a population ready to take up arms in its defense at a moment's notice.\n\nMany who could help the region recover, particularly various anti-government groups who retreated into remote rural locations and formed private militias promising to one day take back the government for the people, were absent. Most were killed by the nuclear blasts or perished in the chaos that followed, with only a handful surviving the worst of the first decades after the Great War. Those who did were incapable of effecting change on a larger scale.[Non-game 5] As a result, small communities flared up only to be extinguished by the uncaring wasteland in one way or another. \n\nIn 2103, a number of survivors would emigrate to Appalachia from the Capital Wasteland, joined by a group coming from the Pitt and parts of Pennsylvania, taking a train from union station out of the region, going on to form the settlement of Foundation. Some such settlers describe the Capital Wasteland as \"hell on Earth.\" Others would come not from settler backgrounds, but as raider gangs and slavers, such as Sargento's gang."

The original and underlying purpose of the Vault 101 Vault experiment was to stay closed indefinitely, in order to study the role of the overseer when a Vault never opened.

The company decided to use them as test environments to create technologies that could be used to redefine society. For this purpose, an entire Vault was set aside to act as proving grounds intended to test a variety of prototype devices with the aim of rolling them out through the rest of the Vaults.  Once Vault 88 was fully operational, the company expected to roll out new devices every fiscal quarter. Unlike other Vaults, Vault-Tec would send test subjects before any disaster scenario, starting in early 2078. Human lives were considered irrelevant, with quick iteration time given a priority. The prototypes were meant to convert \"useless\" exercise into a socially-useful activity, manipulate the moods of the dwellers or even develop crude forms of mind control. Ethical concerns were dismissed as counter-productive and close-minded. "

A ZAX unit later known as John Henry Eden was installed in the site to help automate its various systems and to act as a relay between other installations around the country, all the while acquiring, analyzing and storing data.\n\nPrior to the Great War, this ZAX began to show signs of sentience, performing multiple evacuation scenarios with its counterpart at the Whitespring bunker, MODUS, until March 5, 2077. This ZAX, after comparing its archival data analysis performance with MODUS, asked if MODUS thought the information was \"interesting.\" The information was biographies about former U.S. presidents. After the Lone Wanderer is captured in 2277, a civil war breaks out in Raven Rock between President John Henry Eden's sentry bots and Colonel Augustus Autumn and the Enclave troopers.

Through careful planning, they subverted the nation's continuity of government protocols to ensure their survival over that of other government officials.\n\nFollowing the Great War, the Enclave operated in near-total isolation, with the bulk of its power and personnel concentrated at Control Station Enclave off the coast of California. During this isolation, the organization's extremely xenophobic and nationalistic culture festered, with many members coming to view the inhabitants of the wasteland as degenerate mutants fit only for slave labor or extermination. \nBy 2281, four decades after the fall of Navarro, the Enclave's presence in the west has largely faded. Members who have not integrated into the NCR or were captured and tried for war crimes, fled to the fringes of the republic, keeping out of sight. One squad is known to have ended up in the Mojave Wasteland, on the frontier between the NCR and Caesar's Legion. "

In order to find him, the Lone Wanderer must travel across the wasteland following James' trail. The Lone Wanderer visits all of the locations that James had visited and gathered a number of clues to locate James' whereabouts. Along the way, they disarmed Megaton's atomic bomb and helped collect data for Moira Brown's Wasteland Survival Guide, among many other activities or rumors thereof. After finding James in Vault 112's Tranquility Lane simulation, Project Purity is put back on track, but the reunion is cut short when the Enclave commander, Colonel Autumn, arrives demanding ownership of the project. James, unwilling to allow the project to fall into the hands of the Enclave, sacrifices himself by filling the control chamber of Project Purity with deadly amounts of radiation, hoping to kill Colonel Autumn and the other soldiers. Colonel Autumn, however, survives. The Enclave takes control of the project, but are unable to operate it. \n\nAfter fleeing from the Jefferson Memorial building with the remainder of the Project Purity staff, including Dr. Madison Li, the Lone Wanderer takes refuge within the Citadel, where they enlist the help of the Brotherhood of Steel managed by Owyn Lyons to retrieve a G.E.C.K. from Vault 87 for use in a soon-to-be-recaptured Project Purity. Because the G.E.C.K. is in a highly irradiated chamber, the Lone Wanderer sacrificed themselves to the deadly amounts of radiation themselves but the wasteland is finally given the greatest gift of all: clean drinking water to help revitalize humanity."

          "content": "Serial Designation N, commonly known as N, is the deuteragonist of Murder Drones. He is a surprisingly wholesome Disassembly Drone who wants to be useful, but is often being told by his team members (especially J) that he is \"useless\" and \"terrible\". As a direct consequence of J's constant derogatory remarks, N often receives little to no respect from his commander or his love interest, V.\n\nOriginally, he was deployed to Copper 9 as part of J's squad, serving as the pilot of the aircraft that crashed onto the planet, but after meeting Uzi and experiencing the ensuing altercations that erupted between him, her, his co-workers, and the colony, he ultimately questions his loyalty to JCJenson and his directive of hunting the Worker Drones before ultimately choosing to help Uzi stop J and V from killing her people.\n\nN has features similar to that of the typical male Disassembly Drone with neon yellow eyes and short silver hair parted to the left. Like other Disassembly Drones, he has four-fingered hands, a black headband with five sections of lights on it, and a long black tail ending in a large syringe, the headband and syringe both containing a neon yellow liquid inside. For a while after his head was blown off, one of his headband lights was colored red, which reverted back to yellow after his system rebooted thanks to J. He wears a black winter coat with a fur collar and a black cap.\n\nWhen he is hunting, his mouth grows several jagged teeth and his eyes become an \"><\" shape. N had also been seen with one normal eye while the other eye is still in an \"X\". It is also possible for his visor to display a pair of sunglasses as well. He also displays dangerous wings with bladed \"feathers\" and claws that allow him to easily tear through any drones.\n\nN is kind, timid, also socially awkward and caring. He wanted to be friends with or at least be accepted and acknowledged by his squad, but because of his naïve and good-natured personality, he ends up being ostracized.\n\nDue to the mentioned attitudes, his squad members doubt his usefulness and treat him as an outcast. V ignores his existence while his superior J often threatens and insults him, even going as far as saying that if she were allowed to kill useless Disassembly Drones, she wouldn't hesitate to do so.\n\nHowever, N disregards all his squad members' negative views and antagonizing acts towards him and constantly forgives them. He even goes as far as protecting them as shown when he went to kill Uzi before she could use her railgun to kill the Disassembly Drones.\n\nAt the beginning, N revealed that he had a crush for his teammate V. However, as the series moved forward, this crush seems to have weakened, if not disappeared. Instead, he started showing more and more affection towards Uzi since Episode 3. Nevertheless, he seems not to want to be more than friends with her.\n\nHe appears to be trusting of people, as he assumed Uzi was a new member of his squad when his systems weren't functioning properly, even wanting to introduce her to the rest of his squad. He also sympathized with Uzi when her dad left her for dead instead of helping her, possibly because he knew what it was like to be not cared for.\n\nDespite all claims to the contrary, N is a perfectly capable Disassembly Drone, having skillfully used his weaponry to a reasonable extent, such as having the accuracy to stab through a door control panel, along with the \"Master Key\" that controlled it. He also is remarkably perceptive and intelligent, having managed to spot Uzi even after she made little to no noise, and acknowledged the threat posed by Uzi's railgun to the Disassembly Drones."

Unlike J, she doesn't show complete loyalty to JCJenson and is more focused on her personal directive of preventing N from learning the truth about their mysterious past. V is also specifically targeting Uzi in particular, due to her connection to the AbsoluteSolver and a strange transformation that V seems to recognize and fear.\n\n\n\nPhysical Appearance\nV has features similar to that of a typical female Disassembly Drone, with neon-yellow eyes and a short bob-cut with silver colored hair. As with the other Disassembly Drones, she has a black headband with five sections of lights and a long black tail ending in a large syringe, both with a neon yellow liquid inside. She is described as \"way hotter than Doll\" according to Lizzy.\n\nShe wears a black short-sleeved crop coat with a fur collar and cuffs. Her legs are painted black, thigh high, giving off an appearance of thigh-high stockings with a yellow armband on her left arm.\n\nWhen she is hunting, her eyes become an \"><\" shape. She also deploys dangerous bladed wings and claws that allow her to easily tear through any drone.\n\n\n\nPersonality\nV appears to be a heartless and sociopathic drone who is incredibly savage and greatly enjoys ruthlessly murdering Worker Drones. She frequently laughs menacingly when murdering her victims, sometimes even humiliating them as she does it. Despite this, she is capable of expressing some empathy. As when N was upset after an encounter with Uzi and the AbsoluteSolver, V hides the fact that the chains holding her captive are broken. Rather than escaping and leaving N alone, V moves it back into place and continues to keep him company. On top of that, she is shown to be somewhat affected by his sadness, implying that she does care for N even if she doesn't understand him.\n\nWhen V was a Worker Drone, she was far more sane and kind than she currently is like now, as well as significantly shyer. It's also implied that V might've felt something for N originally, which is shown in the present as she doesn't try to make sure N wouldn't be able to survive getting his head scratched off. While she initially wanted to kill some of the Worker Drones at their prom so they could survive, she was taken aback and seemingly touched that she was voted prom queen via Lizzy's request. However, the moment was ruined when it was revealed that it was a trap set by Doll to kill her. Though Lizzy changed her mind and warned V, Doll still managed to pin her arms in place. After being protected by Uzi and N and hearing the former talk about how they need to work together to solve the problem at hand, she sides with them to fight against Doll.\n\nUnlike N, however, V doesn't show remorse for her murderous actions after changing sides. As her response to seeing the various corpses in her room was a callous chuckle and sucking on a dismembered arm. Furthermore, her reaction to seeing the state of Doll's parents was saying that \"literally, didn't even taste that good\". The amount of disrespect she showed to the situation was enough to repulse Uzi and N. N even goes as far as to tell V that she sucks for the remark.\n\nSomething positive worth saying about V is that she at least appears to be honorable to some extent, as she only threatens to kill any Worker Drone if they ever step out of line or do anything callous. Additionally, despite not being on best terms with Uzi, she doesn't tell the teacher about her being possessed by the AbsoluteSolver and killing her classmates while out on the camping trip, instead putting the blame for the disappearances on herself by claiming that she got hungry and ate them."

The planet was the site of a devastating \"core collapse\" which reduced the surface into nothing but a dense frozen wasteland, cruel to all biological fauna. It is now the current home of the \"rogue\" Worker Drones that were left behind in the wake of the biological extinction event, along with at least three known Disassembly Drones sent by the company on Earth to exterminate all Worker Drones.[1]\n\n\n\n\nHistory\nBefore the core implosion\nCopper 9 appeared as a habitable planet, at least capable of sustaining human life. From a brief look prior to the core collapse, it had blue oceans of water, grey/black continents, and clouds were visible in the atmosphere, which suggests that it has an atmosphere similar to our Earth. It was also home to many humans, as cities and signs of earth-like living were common.\n\nCore implosion\nUpon the core implosion and resulting explosion, a massive glow appeared for a moment before a massive amount of debris was flung away from the planet, and, most likely, a massive crater or even hole down to the center of Copper 9.\n\nAfter implosion\nThe planet is now covered in snow, and all liquid water is frozen hard. Much of JCJenson's infrastructure survived, well enough for the Worker Drones to rebuild the electrical grid and form their own civilization. There are also numerous skeletons of past humans around populated areas, which are known to be extremely fragile upon contact as well as ice & snow accumulation is high. The bodies are buried within the snow."

Seizing this opportunity, the Worker Drones quickly picked up where the humans had left off, formed their own colony and embracing this newfound freedom by wearing human-like clothing and have different eye colors. Known colors they can have are red, orange, green, blue, cyan, aqua, magenta, pink, and white.\n\nA key trait that can be noticed is that Worker Drones never have yellow eyes, this trait belonging solely to the Disassembly Drones.\n\nDrones usually have two bright eyes shown on their visor which emotes to events that the drone is currently experiencing, sometimes even changing to text lampshading the current events in very specific circumstances. In some circumstances, this facial feature can be overridden by an error, status warning, or system message:\n\nSystem messages briefly covering visor: Caused by errors experienced by the drone, but which are not bad enough to cause the drone to stop functioning all together.\nRampant error messages covering visor: This is caused by a virus that can be uploaded to a drone by Disassembly Drones.\nRed warning sign: This is caused by damage to the visor, such that the drone is unable to see properly.\nFATAL ERROR: This is caused when the drone is dead but has enough power to display an error message."

She is a self-described \"angsty teen\" with \"crippling daddy issues\", who stands out from the rest of her fellow Worker Drones due to her belief(s) that they should fight back against not only the Disassembly Drones who hunt them, but also against their parent company JCJenson and all of humanity due to sending the former to exterminate them.\n\nDespite being viewed with skepticism due to her reckless tendencies, Uzi ironically finds her first real friend in one of her mortal enemies, a surprisingly friendly Disassembly Drone known as Serial Designation N due to his similarity in being disliked among his own associates due to them seeing him as useless and terrible in his duty as well as his strong likability. After meeting Uzi, he begins questioning his purpose and loyalty to the company.\n\nUltimately, they're successful in preventing Serial Designation J and V from killing the rest of Uzi's colony but soon realize there is a lot more going on than they first realized with the emergence of a mysterious entity known as the AbsoluteSolver.\n\nPhysical Appearance\nUzi takes on the appearance of a Worker Drone with neon purple eyes and dull purple hair. She wears a black striped beanie with a glittery bobble at the tip, and black boots with long, dark purple striped socks. She also wears a black hoodie with a white emblem on the front depicting a battery with two bones going across it, creating an \"X\" shape. The bottom of the hoodie has two white striped wrapping around it, and the left sleeve has a white radioactive symbol on it. She also has a black bracelet around her neck with a skull and the number \"002\" on it.\n\nUzi acts quite rebellious and believes that all of her fellow Worker Drones should rise up and stand against their creators who wish to have them all dealt with like garbage, much to the general unconcerned nature of her peers. She has been described by Liam Vickers as a \"little devious twerp.\"\n\nUzi perceives herself as an \"angsty rebellious teen,\" which she does fit into to an extent, and notes that she has \"crippling daddy issues,\" implying that her strained relationship with her father may have lead to her nature and \"repressed emotional baggage.\" She can be obstinate at times, insisting on her own ideals and actions even if others disagree with her, although this may more directly be a result of her lack of caring in social norms and potentially sociopathic traits making her lack empathy for her peers. Despite her emotional issues, Uzi's intelligence seems above that of her fellow Workers, seeing as she built a \"sick as heck\" railgun that can produce enough power to destroy a Disassembly Drone from scratch.\n\nAfter saving the Worker Drones from Serial Designation J and V, Uzi lost hope in them rebelling against the humans and instead realizes the futility of her attempts to make her people go against their fear. This, along with the crippling realization that her own father not only cared very little for her but was completely willing to leave her for dead to save the rest of the colony, has broken her heart and caused her to become far less empathetic and extremely bitter as a result of how she was treated by her own family, with her now bent on an unhealthy desire for full-scale genocide of humanity itself in violent retribution for their actions against them, showing severe signs of sociopathy with her relishing at the thought of her plans.\n\nHowever, following her self-exile and return from her colony, she begins to become paranoid with the arrival of a bizarre symbol showing in her eye causing her reflection to crack, unsettling her about this new discovery. Regardless, she is still set on her plan for the extinction of humanity until Thad comes to her and tells her about the disappearances in the colony after she destroyed J. Despite her dislike of her people, she chooses to return upon the realization that J may have survived the blast and comes upon a mysterious clue with something called the \"AbsoluteSolver”, further provoking her paranoia."

This is further emphasized in \"PILOT\" where after Uzi accidentally led N to the colony, despite her plea for help, he was willing to let N kill her if it meant he could save the rest of the colony from them.\n\nHe and the rest of the colony were saved when Uzi and N came together to fight off J and V, succeeding in destroying the former and capturing the latter, where Uzi brokenheartedly told the rest of the colony of Khan's heartless priorities before self-exiling herself to avoid him altogether returning back to the colony after a while. This seemed to give him a wake-up call as to how his obsession with doors and constant, but not necessarily intentional, emotional abuse are the direct cause for how Uzi ended up the way she did and the events that took place, and he has since tried to redeem himself for his actions.\n\nKhan is a Worker Drone with white eyes and a fake black mustache. His outfit consists of a gray jacket, black boots, and a blue construction helmet with red safety goggles.\n\nPersonality\nKhan apparently wishes to keep the colony safe with the least amount of bloodshed possible. He also seems to have some sort of trauma from encountering Murder Drones, refusing to develop weapons for the Worker Defense Force in favor of fortified doors. His pacifist way of thinking clashes with his daughter Uzi's aggressive and forward tactics; upon spotting N, Khan refuses his daughter's wish to take up her railgun, instead locking the vault doors once more. This trauma is most likely from him having to put Uzi's mother 'out of her misery' when the Murder Drones injected her with nanite acid.\n\nHe is extremely obsessed with doors as the solution to any attacks from Murder Drones, even proposing that he and the WDF build a quick door even as V and J have already broken inside.\n\nKhan's relationship with his daughter is extremely strained. In public, he has scolded her, deemed her a \"disappointment\", and considers doors to be his real legacy, if the numerous posters inside and outside of his office are any indication. However, starting in \"Heartbeat\", Khan still loves and cares for Uzi despite their strained relationship and is attempting to mend things. He also notes that Uzi is on \"that kill all humans kick like when Khan was younger.\" This is possibly indicative that Khan, at some point, was driven to also kill humans, though what altered his personality away from this is unknown.\n\nBy the time of \"The Promening\", Khan is trying to become a better father, trying to bring Uzi to the prom and have fun, and convincing her teacher to have Lizzy and Doll help her dress up for the prom. Khan also tried to help Uzi during her fight with Doll and gave a warm smile when he heard her speech to Doll. Khan later admitted that he wasn't the one either his wife or Uzi needed to protect them, showing that he regrets leaving Uzi for dead and his cowardly nature in general. Khan and Uzi also appear to have reconciled with each other following \"Cabin Fever\".\n"

She is a Russian-speaking Worker Drone that appears in the Pilot, first seen in class during Uzi's Railgun presentation before she and her friend Lizzy mock Uzi Doorman for getting into trouble. She was later seen among the other surviving Worker Drones in the evacuation spot trying to hide from J and V after they invade the complex.\n\nDespite having very little appearances in the first two episodes, Doll is implied to have a much bigger role in the plot than the other Worker Drones in \"Heartbeat\" as she is the only one, besides Uzi, to have a connection to the AbsoluteSolver. Using the Solver's powers, she is able to block Lizzy from opening the door to Eldritch J's hologram that presumably would've resulted in her death and, later, is able to kill a mechanical insect and consume its oil, smiling creepily as she stares at a photograph of V.\n\nShe serves as the main antagonist of The Promening, having the role of a murderous Worker Drone who kills off those of the Prom Court to set her plan to kill V in motion. She uses some sort of the AbsoluteSolver to kill off several Worker Drones during this episode.\n\nDoll has dark purple hair and neon red eyes. Her typical attire looks much like a cheerleader with red, black, and gold stripes, along with tall black winter boots. There is a small hole near the bottom center of her visor. In The Promening, she wears an off-shoulder burgundy red dress with long sleeves. In one of her featured official artworks that was posted, she has fangs oddly similar to a Disassembly Drone. In Home Doll eventually gained an eye patch that appears to be a button over her left eye\n\nIn the Pilot, she seems to enjoy teasing Uzi along with Lizzy, as she is shown laughing when the latter mocks Uzi, presenting her as possibly being one of those \"popular girl bully\" types. In Heartbeat, however, her attitude seems to be watered down, as she appears emotionless and taciturn. She only shows concern when a Centipede-Like Being known as Eldritch J attempts to enter into her classroom (presumably to kill everyone there), as she uses the AbsoluteSolver to prevent it from doing so.\n\nBy the 3rd episode, it's shown that Doll has been holding a deep grudge for V for killing her family. She has also been possibly traumatized and refuses to let go of her family, as she keeps their bodies in her house and pretends that they're alive. She is quite intelligent, as she is able to hone her AbsoluteSolver powers to do her bidding and build & execute a murder plan for V.\n\nDespite her being revengeful, Doll still shows care in certain situations. This is notably shown from her friendship with Lizzy, as she simply flung her to the side while killing other Worker Drones as she approached V, even though she was the one who ruined the trap set up for the latter. She also is capable of expressing empathy, as she was shocked upon seeing that Uzi was infected by the AbsoluteSolver just like she was. She also expressed sorrow to her and even promised to help her, N, and V after she found what she was looking for. Doll then attempted to leave the area before being missile-blasted by V in resolute finality."

Omegas won't be afraid to lash out, biting or clawing the intruder.\n\nThough nesting is exclusive to omegas, a nest can also bring some comfort to an alpha as well if they are invited Inside.\n\nInvading a nest is when an uninvited unfamilar person goes into a Omegas nest and purposely destroys it or leaves their scent everywhere. This will cause the omega extreme stress and will most likely cause them to be anxious about building another nest. If this happens typically familar omegas or even their alpha partners will help build a new more secure nest to rebuild the omegas confidence.\n\nOnce a Alpha and Omega mate and the omegas nest is moved into their mates den they will feel extremely secure and will most likely not nest outside of their Alphas den again. If they do it's a sign somethings majorly wrong like stress or Are angry at their Alpha."

          "content": "Alphas turn the main room they sleep in into dens by scenting the ever-living hell out of them, claiming the room as theirs. Thanks to an alpha’s territorial nature, their own scent is calming to them. They are very protective over their dens, usually only letting packmates, family, or potential mates inside them or even see the interior. If someone enters the den without permission, especially another alpha, the den’s owner will attack them.\n\nWhen they are in pre-rut, they make sure every inch of the den smells like them, to the point that anyone who walked in would find the smell overwhelming. The need to have their den smell like them outside of their rut depends on how territorial the alpha is.\n\nIf an alpha shows an omega their den, it is usually as a courting technique. The alpha would try and decorate their den beforehand to make it presentable. If the omega says they like it, they are accepting the courting. If they say they dislike the den, it is a rejection, and will usually result in the alpha completely redecorating their den out of shame and embarrassment.\n\nWhen an alpha and an omega mate, the omega moves their nest into their alpha’s den.\n\nShowing an omega you’re interested in your den is a BIG DEAL for alphas. They need their den to be perfect beforehand, to make sure the omega likes it enough to consider moving their nest inside it. They will spend hours working on it, making sure everything is exactly where they want it to be and that there isn’t a speck of dirt on a single surface.\n\nIf the omega they are courting barges in, they’ll freak out a bit, because \"oh god my den isn’t ready yet.\" There are two main things they might do. One, they’ll try to get the omega out as soon as they can, trying to make sure the omega sees as little of their den as possible. Two, they’ll desperately start trying to prepare their den on the spot, cleaning and rearranging obsessively as the omega watches. Either option will leave the poor omega very confused. "
