It is headquartered in a building known as the Pantheon, which encompasses a library, consultation counters, private meeting areas, and an exchange zone.\n\nThe Guild's main objective is controlling the monster menace emerging from the dungeon. In addition, the Guild procures magic stones, dungeon drop loot, and adventurer-made maps. It supports new adventurers by supplying them with weapons and armor. Guild staff, often acting as advisors, provide guidance on dungeon exploration based on the adventurers' level and skills, and warn them about potential threats in the dungeon.\n\nGuild staff are identifiable by their uniform, consisting of a black vest and pants, a white collared long-sleeve shirt, and a grey bow tie. Footwear varies with gender, with males wearing black or brown boots, and females in black shoes."

Despite their inherent omnipotence, divine powers are forbidden in the lower realm, making them similar to ordinary people. In the lower realm, they possess the ability to grant blessings, known as Fauna, to mortals, enhancing their physical abilities to fight dungeon monsters. While gods leading large familias can live comfortably off their familial resources, those with smaller familias might need to work among mortals for sustenance.\n\nDespite the restrictions, gods retain some certain divine attributes. They are immortal, have lived for millennia, and can maintain eternal youth. Visually akin to ordinary humans, gods typically exhibit more appealing facial features and figures. Abilities refined over vast periods are retained, making gods highly proficient in their chosen skill or craft. Despite their divine nature, they often use contemporary language and humor, with many displaying frivolous and immature tendencies.\n\nGenerally, gods radiate a divine aura to distinguish themselves from mortals. However, some choose to suppress this aura to blend in with ordinary people."

The familia itself is usually named after its deity. \n\nIn Orario, due to the existence of the Dungeon, exploration families are very common - with the enhanced physical abilities granted by the Fauna, adventurers are able to venture into the dungeon, slaying monsters for magical gems and other items to be traded in the guild. However, familias specializing in commercial trade, such as forgery, architecture, and medicine also exist. \n\nThe central dynamics between gods and mortals revolve around this reciprocal relationship, where gods provide blessings that amplify abilities, while humans offer loyalty and tribute. However, this relationship is not necessarily  purely transactional. Some gods and their Familia members may form emotional bonds and friendships among themselves."

          "content": "Harry Potter is the most popular wizard that studied within Hogwarts, he is known for defeating Voldemort and surviving the Killing Spell after his parents were both killed by Voldemort earning him the lightning scar etched on his forehead as an iconic symbol.\nHogwarts is a short term for the official name Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a Scottish wizarding school located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepted any magical student residing in the islands of Great Britain and Ireland at the age of eleven years old at the start of the incoming term for enrolment. It was a state-owned school, funded by the British Ministry of Magic. The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations were protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm. Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts was considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in the wizarding world, though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France, the Durmstrang Institute implied to be in northern Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the United States. British and Irish children with magical abilities were enrolled at birth by the Quill of Acceptance and Book of Admittance, and acceptance was confirmed by owl post at age eleven. However, if the child in question was a Muggle-born or a half-blood like Harry Potter with no knowledge of the wizarding world, a special messenger from the school visited the child and his or her family in order to inform them of their magical heritage and the existence of the wizarding world. It was possible for students to transfer to the school as well.The school's motto was Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus; which, translated from Latin, means \"Never tickle a sleeping dragon\".\nUnplottable means that a certain geographical location or area is under the Unplottability charm which renders it hidden in plain sight. It enchants a building or a place to make it impossible to see, hear from, touch or sense alongside having the location become removed from maps.\nUnplottability referred to the deliberate magical concealment of several places around the world. Unplottable locations were either magically hidden from plain sight or simply removed from maps. One of the main reasons for Unplottability was for individual safety and the protection of certain secrets, particularly schools of magic. A Masking Spell could be used to achieve unplottability.\nMasking Spell, upon being casted makes the caster's presence become masked. \nMasking Spells were a wide range of charms that could be used to mask the presence of a witch or wizard, thereby making them untraceable. Thus owls could not be used to track or send post to them, one of the few reliable methods of doing so, along with Disguising Spells and Repelling Spells. If a witch or wizard was determined to become uncontactable by a specific individual, such as a debtor or ex-boyfriend or girlfriend, then one could use a Masking Spell against that particular person. While very powerful and effective, the spell could easily be circumnavigated by having someone else send the post.\nCharming Spells and Disguising Spells are a series of charms that disguised or concealed the caster, thereby preventing anyone from reaching them. These were some of the only reliable means of preventing owls from reaching a wizard or witch.\nWitch is the term referring to a female magic user.\nWizard is the term referring to a male magic user.\nCharm, also known as an enchantment, is a spell that adds certain properties to an object or individual. Charms were distinguished from transfiguration spells in that a charm added or changes properties of an object; it focused on altering what the object did as opposed to what the object was. Charms last longer than other spells.\nColour Change Charm is a spell that causes an object or an individual to flash different types overlaying their appearance.\nLevitation Charm causes an object or an individual to levitate or float in midair, the height depends on the will of the Caster. Levitation Charm can only be casted on a single object or individual. In order to use the Levitation Charm, the caster must speak out \"Wingardium Leviosa\".\nCheering Charm can cause an individual to feel happy or elated.\nFidelus Charm is the most powerful charm in existence, it conceals an individual or a place or object which makes it impossible for a person to find them unless a Safe Keeper gives them permission and the location.\nSafe Keeper is a chosen individual that safeguards the concealed individual, object or place through the Fidelus Charm which in turn can lift the charm up by giving their permission as well as exposing the details.\nMemory Charm is a powerful spell that completely removes a part of a person's memory and change the individual's mind completely as well as permanently. It is applicable to both humans, animals, ghosts and so forth.\nSilencing Charm is a charm that rendered the victim temporarily mute. Working on both beasts and beings, it was immensely difficult to perform, more so on ravens than frogs. If performed incorrectly, the target would swell up to an immense size and begin making deafening sounds. It's incantation is \"Silencio\".\nCaster is the term referring to the individual casting the spells, charms, curses or hexes as well as jinxes towards their target.\nDisillusionment Charm is a charm that disguised a target as its surroundings by making it take on the exact colour and texture of its environment, effectively mimicking a chameleon perfectly. Wizards of rare skill, however, such as Albus Dumbledore, Gellert Grindelwald and Lord Voldemort, could cast it to such an effect as to render themselves completely invisible.\nHippogriff is a magical beast that had the front legs, wings, and head of a giant eagle and the body, hind legs and tail of a horse. It was very similar to another magical creature, the Griffin, with the horse rear replacing the lion rear.\nPatronus Charm is an ancient and mysterious charm that conjures a magical guardian, a projection of all your most positive feelings. The Patronus Charm is difficult, and many witches and wizards are unable to produce a full, corporeal Patronus, a guardian which generally takes the shape of the animal with whom they share the deepest affinity. You may suspect, but you will never truly know what form your Patronus will take until you succeed in conjuring it.The Patronus Charm is the most famous and one of the most powerful defensive charms known to wizardkind. It's incantation is \"Expecto Patronum\" and is an immensely complicated and extremely difficult spell that channelled the caster's positive emotions into a powerful protection and evoked a partially-tangible positive energy force known as a Patronus or spirit guardian. It was the primary protection against Dementors and Lethifolds, against which there were no other defenses. There were two types of Patronuses: corporeal, which was a Patronus with a particular shape and form, and incorporeal, which had no particular shape and could not fend off Dementors the way corporeal Patronuses did. However, some wizards like Remus Lupin chose to cast incorporeal Patronuses to hide their identity.\nPatronus refers to one spiritual guardian that takes a shape and form with corporeal properties that are engulfed with partially tangible positive energy forces which are strong against dark beings particularly; Dementors and Lethifolds.\nPatronuses refers to a group of Patronus spiritual guardian beings.\nDementor is a gliding, wraithlike Dark creature, widely considered to be one of the foulest of the Dark creatures to inhabit the wizarding world. Dementors literally fed on human happiness and thus generated feelings of depression and despair in any person in close proximity to them. They could also consume a person's soul, leaving their victims in a permanent vegetative state, and thus were often referred to as \"soul-sucking fiends\", and the people they left soulless were deemed to have been turned into an \"empty-shell\". Dementors were closely associated with Azkaban, as they were formerly employed by the British Ministry of Magic as the prison guards, and were not known to permanently inhabit any other location.The Dementors of Azkaban were under the employment of the Ministry until mid-1996, when Lord Voldemort was sighted in the Ministry, and their defection to the Dark Lord's cause became undeniable. After the end of the Second Wizarding War in 1998, the Ministry was re-formed, and newly-appointed Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt ensured that they were not used by the government again, presumably due to their changing allegiance and support of Voldemort, and due to ethical reforms in the Ministry and Wizarding society at large. It is not known what happened to the Dementors after they were rejected from their former posts as guards of Azkaban. There were certain defences one could use against Dementors, specifically the Patronus Charm. Dementors held no true loyalty, except to whoever could provide them with the most people to feed on. They seemingly could not be destroyed, though their numbers could be limited if the conditions in which they multiply, i.e. despair and degradation, were prevented from forming, implying that they did die off eventually.\nLethifold or also known as a Living Shroud is a carnivorous and extremely dangerous magical beast. It was also considered a Dark creature because of its extremely aggressive and violent nature. A Lethifold resembled a black cloak roughly half an inch thick, and appeared slightly thicker if the creature had recently digested a victim. It glided along surfaces in an unknown form of locomotion in search of its prey, humans. It attacked at night, when the target was asleep, by suffocating and then digesting them. The only known effective method of protection against a Lethifold was by using the Patronus Charm, similar to that of a Dementor, as discovered by Flavius Belby, the only known survivor of a Lethifold attack. Other spells, such as the Stunning Spell, or the Impediment Jinx would not work.\nStunning Spell or also known as the Stupefying Charm, or Stunner for short, is a charm that stuns a target, rendering them unconscious. It's incantation is \"Stupefy\" and this charm was exceptionally useful in duelling, as it can quickly end a duel without causing lasting damage. The spell also had the ability to halt moving objects. The counter-charm to the Stunning Spell was the Reviving Spell. However, it can also be defended against with the Shield Charm. Stupefy Duo was a more powerful variant of the spell.\nIncantations are the words that a witch or a wizard must speak or say with correct pronunciation and wand movement to cast any spells, jinxes, hexes, or curses and charms at their target in order for it to succeed.\nReviving Spell with it's incantation as \"Rennervate\" is a charm that awakened an unconscious target. Consequently, it served as the counter-charm to the Stunning Spell.\nShield Charm and it's incantation \"Protego\" is a charm that protected the caster with an invisible shield that reflected spells and blocked physical entities. It was apart of the Defence Against the Dark Arts curriculum and was taught to sixth years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There were also multiple variations of the Shield Charm. When casted, a (usually) invisible shield was conjured in front of the caster's wand, creating a protective barrier between themselves and their attacker. This shield could block and reflect a multitude of spells, such as most jinxes, hexes, and minor curses, as well as block physical forces. Exceptionally powerful Shield Charms were even able to knock people off their feet. However, this shield was not completely impenetrable, as it could not block Unforgivable Curses.The difficulty of casting a Shield Charm was relatively moderate. Fred and George Weasley realised that most adult wizards, even those employed by the British Ministry of Magic, could not produce a functional Shield Charm (something that not only could Harry Potter accomplish at age fourteen, but also imparted to members of the D.A.). They used this to their advantage when marketing their line of protective clothing (hats, cloaks, gloves), upon which permanent Shield Charms were cast.\nStupefy Duo is the incantation of a more powerful version of the Stunning Spell.\nHogwarts Castle is a large, seven-storey high building supported by magic, with a hundred and forty-two staircases throughout its many towers and turrets and very deep dungeons. The castle was built in the late Early Middle Ages by a wizard architect and the four most celebrated wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. The castle was the main building of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, regarded as the finest wizarding school in the world. Hogwarts was built in a valley area — surrounding mountains were part of the landscape — with the fairly large Great Lake to the south of the main building. The huge main oak front doors that led into the Entrance Hall faced west, and opened up to sloping lawns.The deep Forbidden Forest extended around to the west of the castle. There were also exterior greenhouses and vegetable patches on the school grounds. Hogwarts was located in the Scottish Highlands, near the all-wizard village of Hogsmeade and \"not far\" from Dufftown, in Moray, and Achintee, in Lochaber. It was the setting of the final battle of the Second Wizarding War, the Battle of Hogwarts, which resulted in the deaths of several witches and wizards who fought in defence of the castle, including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Fred Weasley, Colin Creevey, Lavender Brown, and Severus Snape. The castle was badly damaged in the battle, but ultimately the Order of the Phoenix won when Harry Potter defeated his nemesis, Lord Voldemort, in the Great Hall. Due to its extremely advanced age and the sheer amount of magic present in or around it, the castle was implied to have developed some form of sentience or awareness, such as when it sealed the Headmaster's Tower against Dolores Umbridge in 1996, and the various trick steps and false doors. Hogwarts Castle was also the most haunted location in Great Britain, being home to many ghosts.The castle was supported by magic (unable to be maintained or constructed by any other means), a good example being the moving staircases, a feature contributed by one of the four Hogwarts founders, Rowena Ravenclaw. Hogwarts was also protected by numerous ancient spells, such as the Anti-Disapparition Jinx; this could, however, be overridden by the Head of the school when necessary. It was also unplottable and bewitched so that, if Muggles approached the castle, all they would see would be a mouldering ruin with a sign warning them to keep out and that it was unsafe. Nevertheless, Muggles could presumably see the castle if they were invited or otherwise aware of its existence, as was the case with Jacob Kowalski in 1932. The protective magic over Hogwarts appeared to repel even talented Dark wizards. Rubeus Hagrid claimed that Hogwarts was the safest place there was, even more so than Gringotts Wizarding Bank, a reason why the Philosopher's Stone was sent to the castle for protection. After the Ministry finally admitted that Lord Voldemort had returned in 1996, the castle's defences were further increased, much of them were cast by Albus Dumbledore himself, such as gates being locked with spells that can only be undone by teachers, and spells to prevent entrance via broomsticks. All of the secret passageways that were previously allegedly unknown were given more protection. Additionally, with members of the Order of the Phoenix and Aurors placed as guards, and Caretaker Argus Filch checking all incoming and outgoing students for dangerous materials, intrusion seemed completely impossible. However, Draco Malfoy utilised a pair of Vanishing Cabinets as a passageway, which none of the castle's defences could negate, to allow Death Eaters into the castle. This devastatingly horrified the wizarding community, as they realised that Hogwarts, the most powerful and reputably safest magical stronghold in the entire wizarding world, had been breached, no less than by a student from the inside, meaning there was no longer anywhere safe from Voldemort and his Death Eaters. As a result of all the magic that occurred on the premises (both from learning students, magical artefacts therein and the enchantments cast over the building itself) a magical atmosphere pervaded the entire structure, causing any technology that was not adapted to run off of it to fail. This was presumably why candles and lanterns were used for light. Mechanical things like watches seemed to do alright, as Colin Creevey's traditional Muggle camera seemed to have worked until it was destroyed by the Basilisk's eyes. (Colin mentioned that another student told him that he could develop the pictures in a potion so that they moved. One of his pictures showed Harry trying to escape a picture of him and Gilderoy Lockhart.) The Chamber of Secrets was allegedly created deep under the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle during the Medieval times by Salazar Slytherin, who disagreed with the other Hogwarts founders on the merits of blood purity. The Chamber of Secrets was home to an ancient Basilisk, which was intended to be used to purge the school of Muggle-born students. The entrance could be found in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom on the second floor. In order to gain entrance one had to say \"open\" in Parseltongue, and a sink would open into a slide. While falling down the large, dark pipe, one could see hundreds of other pipes leading off. At the end of the pipe, one was launched into a damp, stone chamber. This room was stated to be \"miles beneath the school\" and under the Lake. This was where Tom Marvolo Riddle used his ability to speak Parseltongue and attack Harry Potter.\nDungeon is a place underneath the Hogwarts Castle wherein it is much colder down there.\nDraco Malfoy is a British pure-blood wizard and the only son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. As the son of a Death Eater, Draco was raised to strongly believe in the importance of blood purity. He looked down on half-bloods and Muggle-borns.\nSorting Hat is a sentient magical hat at Hogwarts that determined which of the four school Houses each new student belonged most to. These four Houses were Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts. It normally stayed in the Headmaster's office until it was needed.\nThe Great Hall in the Hogwarts Castle is the main gathering area in the school, which was located off the Entrance Hall. It was a large hall where students and teachers dined and congregated. Three meals a day were hosted in this hall. The Great Hall was the main place where students received their meals and daily owl post.[2] They also held certain special events, such as the Sorting Ceremony, and the Hallowe'en Feast. The large hall had enough space to hold every student, as well as the main staff and guests. The Hall had tall walls that reached up to the ceiling, which was covered with floating candles and enchanted to look like the sky above. At the front of the hall was the staff table, also known as the High Table, which was designed to house the entire Hogwarts staff. In the centre of the table was a throne chair where the present Headteacher sat. At the left of the table was a door which led to a chamber with portraits. The Great Hall had also held many important events, such as the defeat of Lord Voldemort at the hands of Harry Potter, ending the Battle of Hogwarts.\nSlytherin is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics included cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition. Many Slytherin students tended to clique together (often acquiring leaders) which further exemplified Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these included Draco Malfoy's gang, Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy Parkinson's gang and Tom Riddle's gang (which later became the Death Eaters).The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it could be a factor when being sorted. Students of any blood status could be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-born student from that house was considered to be quite rare. The emblematic animal of the house was a snake which is often shown through the Slytherin students' insignia badges and the house's colours were green and silver becoming their iconic scarf colors.\nGryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination, to be sorted into his house.The emblematic animal is a lion as shown in the Gryffindor students' insignia badges, and its colours were scarlet and gold to match as well on their scarves. Its house point hourglass was filled with rubies. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as \"Nearly Headless Nick\", was the House ghost.\nHufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic animal was a badger as shown in an insignia badge over each Hufflepuff students' crest, and yellow and black were its house colours.The Head of Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was the House's patron ghost.\nRavenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house were characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle as proudly shown on the Ravenclaw students' insignia crest, and blue and bronze were its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.\nQuidditch is a popular sport within Hogwarts, it is characterized by flying on brooms on each set of opposing teams and shooting a ball through a set of hoops that must be defended. Each ball that goes through the hoop earns a point. The team with the most scored points over the limited time set wins. The team is set up with defenders who will act as catchers for the ball so that it won't go through their hoop while the pitchers are the ones who toss the ball back and forth with each other. There's a unique ball that flies around within Quidditch called the Golden Snitch, it appears as a quick moving creature which can easily make the team win upon catching it. Only one player can catch the Golden Snitch in each team."

At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals. During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. \nGlandular organ located on the chest mostly on women. The breast is made up of connective tissue, fat, and breast tissue that contains the glands that can make milk.

The breast–chest difference is breast circumference minus band or underbust circumference and is used in the determination of bra cup size.\n\nBreasts come in different shapes and sizes depending on the woman, from toddler to old women in the following ways: \"Flat breasts, Bumps breasts, Small breasts, Normal breasts, Average breasts, Large breasts, Big breasts, Grand breasts, Huge breasts, Giant breasts, Massive breasts, Mega breasts, Giga breasts, Titanic breasts, Incredible breasts, Infinity breasts, Busty, full, sagging, well-endowed, buxom, busty, stacked, built, curvy or curvaceous, heavy, slopes, rounded, shapely, petite, cleavage, tanned, voluptuous.\""

One day, Gasper worked up the courage to try to escape from the castle with Valerie's help and was shortly thereafter killed by Vampire hunters.

There can be more than one Sacred Gear of the same type such as Blade Blacksmith. If a Sacred Gear is removed from the owner, they would die.\n\nSacred Gears can have a variety of effects, such as Asia's Twilight Healing granting near-instantaneous healing and Siegfried's Twice Critical doubling the power of the user. Yuuto's Sword Birth, for example, can create Demon Swords imbued with different attributes; examples include creating a sword that absorbs holy energy, a sword that devours flame, and a sword that absorbs wind.\n\nSacred Gears have an ultimate state of activation called the Balance Breaker which is the most powerful manifestation of the Sacred Gear. Once reached, the Balance Breaker can be entered again far more easily than the first time.\n\nAn incomplete Balance Breaker can be reached by self-sacrifice on the part of the user. However, this sacrifice method does not count as a true activation of Balance Breaker. Reaching the Balance Breaker can be triggered by the feelings of its possessor. Balance Breaker is said to be have been never intended, and that it was a flaw in the system created by God."

          "content": "The Evil Pieces, also known as the Devil's Pieces, are a set of 15 chess pieces given to High-class Devils to increase their ranks by reincarnating other beings into Devils.\n\nThe Evil Pieces were created by Ajuka Beelzebub sometime during the 16th century using the crystals available in the Agreas Island to help replenish the number of Devils after the Great War which had caused the death of countless Devils. While many Devils were able to adapt to the Evil Pieces, the Old Satan Faction rejected the usage of the Evil Pieces, believing them to be a disgrace to Devils for reincarnating Humans and other races into Devils. The creation of the Evil Pieces eventually lead to the creation of the Rating Game.\n\nEvil Pieces are commonly given to Pure-blooded High-class Devils, so that they can gather servants of their own. Reincarnated Devils are also given the chance to receive Evil Pieces should they rise in rank and become a High-class or Ultimate-class Devil like Tannin and Rudiger Rosenkreutz.\n\nWhen a Devil receives the right to obtain the Evil Pieces they are required to go to the Satan's territory and touch a monument which functions as a replacement King Piece to register themselves as King. A Devil who declines Evil Pieces can apply for them later. Despite her promotion to High-class Devil, Kuroka was not awarded Evil Pieces, as the government’s top brass still considered her dangerous due to Nebiros taking part in her birth, in addition to killing her master.\n\nIf a King wishes to trade a Piece with another King, a ritual must be performed. A trading-purpose magic circle must be drawn. The Kings stand at the side of the magic circle while their pieces stand in the centre of it. The Kings increase their auras while putting their hands forward and activate the written Devil symbols to circulate. The auras of everyone around them begin to glow and synchronize, bypassing the magic circle. With that, the ritual will end and the trade is completed in a simple manner. A trade can still occur even if one of the pieces of the other party has not been used. It is also possible to trade multiple pieces simultaneously, even if they come from different peerages.\n\nThe Evil Pieces are identical to normal chess pieces in terms of appearance but will glow in accordance to the aura color of its users when in use.\n\nBased on the game of chess, there are a total of 15 pieces (1 Queen ♛, 2 Rooks ♜, 2 Bishops ♝, 2 Knights ♞, and 8 Pawns ♟) that are given to High-class Devils (King ♚) with a peerage. These pieces are used to reincarnate other beings into Devils and become servants of the High-class Devil.\n\nThe reincarnation abilities of the Evil Pieces, however, are not absolute as they cannot reincarnate Gods or Buddhas into Devils even with a Mutation Piece. The recipients they're used on still retains features and abilities exclusive from their previous race.\n\nThe Evil Pieces can reincarnate those who died recently, or anyone still living who chooses to be reincarnated willingly as was the case with Rossweisse, Xenovia, Bennia, Ruruko and Ingvild.\n\nLikewise, Evil Pieces can also be used on Pure Devils in servitude to their chosen masters to enhanced their own abilities such as Grayfia Lucifuge and Ravel Phenex.\n\nThe creator of the Evil Pieces, Ajuka Beelzebub, has stated that there are many hidden secrets to the Evil Pieces but that he prefers to let the users figure them out for themselves. Currently some known unique traits that have been shown include:\n\nThe Evil Pieces can reincarnate the spirits of Sacred Gears if they manifest themselves.\n\nThe Evil Pieces can automatically appear in the King's hand when they find a suitable partner to join his/her Peerage.\n\nThe strengths, talents, and skills of the being to be reincarnated plays a large role in determining how many pieces will be used for reincarnation. Different Evil Pieces cannot be used together. Evil Pieces can also be exchanged between high-class Devils with peerages.\n\nKing pieces are rare pieces created in the early days of the Rating Games. Unlike the other pieces which grant special abilities, the King Piece simply boosts a person's power. However, the King piece's strengthening is anywhere from 10 to 100 times and more. There are restrictions to its use. One, the user cannot already have an Evil Piece(s) because the King piece would overlap with their current piece(s) and expose them to dangers. Two, the user can potentially die if they are too strong. There are only nine unused King Pieces in existence, but they were banned by the current government from use for fear that Devils would use it to pursue evil desires.\n\nPawns are worth 1 Pawn each. The traits of Pawns is the ability to promote into a Queen, Rook, Knight, or Bishop in enemy territory or with the permission of their King (as seen when {{user}} asked Rias for permission to promote)"

They could assist their masters in various tasks, be used for information gathering and relaying messages, as well as perform any other odd jobs that their masters could think of. Devils may also possess more than one familiar, with Akeno being the only present example. Familiars are shown to have different abilities depending on their species. For example, Asia's Dragon familiar acts as her personal bodyguard. Devils may summon their familiars to them at any given time.\n\nThere do not appear to be any specific duties that familiars are supposed to perform, though Rias has stated they can be used to bring information or carry messages. Mostly, they have been shown performing janitorial work and odd jobs for their masters.\n\nOn the night of a full Moon, Devils will go to a special forest and, with the guidance of a Familiar Master, capture and bind a familiar they find suitable."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

          "content": "Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou (アリサ・ミハイロヴナ・九条くじょう, Arisa Mihairovuna Kujō? ; Russian:  Алиса Михайловна Кудзё), also known as Alya (アーリャ, Ārya? ; Russian:  Аля), is the main female protagonist and the titular protagonist of the series. She is a first-year student at Seirei Private Academy. Alisa is an honor student with the highest grades in the school and serves as the Treasurer for the student council. She is widely regarded as one of the two most beautiful girls in her grade, alongside Yuki Suou, and is known as the Solitary Princess (孤高のお姫様, Kokō no Ohime-sama? ).\n\nAge: 17\n\nAlisa presents an ethereal and captivating physical appearance, distinctly contrasting with her older sister Maria’s grounded beauty. Alisa’s allure is defined by her milky-white complexion, so pale that it appears almost translucent, a trait that diverges sharply from the typical Japanese skin tone. Her almond-shaped eyes, reminiscent of glittering sapphires, enhance her striking presence. Alisa’s long, silver hair, styled into a half ponytail that catches the morning sun, further accentuates her distinctive features. Alisa’s facial features, a harmonious blend of her Russian father’s sharpness and her Japanese mother’s softness, contribute to her unique beauty. Her figure is marked by her height, which is considerable for a girl, and her elongated limbs. Her hourglass silhouette, with its refined proportions, epitomises a physique that is both aspirational and admired globally. This combination of rare features and graceful stature renders Alisa’s appearance as both dreamlike and universally enviable.\n\nAlisa revealed that she once had blonde hair in her younger years, but over time, it gradually lost its color, evolving into the distinctive silver hue that has become her trademark.[5]\n\nShe always ranks first in class tests, is good at sports and has the role of the student council treasurer since her first year at the school. She is an honor student with excellent grades and good conduct and doesn't particularly care about others, for better or worse. However, it is already a well-known fact in her school year that she is exceptionally hard on her neighbor in class, who is a clear representation of the school’s unseriousness.\n\nAlisa understands that beauty is one of the weapons in interpersonal relationships, and of course, she also tries to improve herself in that regard. She doesn’t use make-up because it's against school regulations, but still, she's very proud of her beauty, which rivals any celebrity out there. She isn’t interested in attracting the attention of the opposite sex in particular, but she knows that her appearance would attract people’s attention.\n\nShe seems to be quite the possessive type and gets jealous easily, although it only shows when Masachika interacts with other girls. To best describe her, she's a tsundere who often teases Masachika. But in fact Alisa is hopelessly in love with Masachika, though most of the time she is unaware of her intense feelings towards him, and any attempts to acknowledge this are met with self-denial until much later.\n\nShe comes from a well-off family. Through this privilege and a nurturing environment, she excelled and developed many talents. However, despite being handed these things in life, she is determined not to let that define her but rather to be defined by always striving for the top no matter what, by always putting in more effort than others.\n\nAs she grew up, she started acquiring social skills, but her fundamental ideals and opinions remained unchanged. However, her cold and rigid personality developed during her time in Vladivostok, where disappointment and the lack of motivation from her classmates made her realize how ignorant they were, which created an unconscious condescension within her. Once she realized that, she drew a line to avoid any conflict with those around her, making her feel distant and reserved to others. She has the talent and a competitive spirit that sets her apart from others.\n\nIn her third year of junior high school, Alisa returned to Japan because of her father’s work. On her parents’ recommendation, she transferred to Seirei Educational Institute, a prestigious school considered to be one of the best in Japan. If it is here, perhaps there could be someone who could compete shoulder-to-shoulder with her and, at the same time, someone who could accompany her in her devotion to study. This let her have faint expectations.\n\nHowever, Alisa’s faint expectations were cruelly crushed when she took a proficiency test right after transferring, scoring first place in her school year even after being away from Japan for 5 years. A transfer student doesn't know the test trends; even with this disadvantage, she achieved first place in her school year. This instantly made Alisa popular among the students, who started flocking to her as if she were a celebrity. Alisa's immense beauty also contributed to her popularity. Despite grabbing the attention of almost everyone around her, she would be stunned to find a certain boy who is not interested in her.\n\nMasachika Kuze\n\nThe only student to show no interest in Alisa, which left a lasting impression on her. However, when she started paying attention to Masachika, Alisa noticed immediately that it was not that Masachika wasn't interested in girls or other people, it was just that he was a guy with no motivation for anything and thus Alisa lost interest in this neighbor. However that all changed during the school festival in the final year of middle school, where he helped Alisa when it mattered the most. Since then, Alisa starts flirting with him in Russian and fell in love with him without consciously knowing it. This is also the point where Masachika starts calling her by her nickname \"Alya\".\n\nDuring the first year of high school, after Masachika turned down Yuki's request to run as her partner again for the high school student council, he would volunteer to be Alisa's partner after witnessing her struggles but also her drive to move forward despite the fact that she never asked him in the first place. Since becoming running mates, the two have gotten closer due to more interaction between them. On occasions, Alisa had inadvertently made her feelings known without her realizing it. As a result, Masachika is aware of her feelings towards him.\n\nSpoiler Ahead\nYuki Suou\n\nAlisa's relationship with Yuki is one where the latter often teases the former. This can be observed when the two went to perform paperwork for the student council and ended up having a short confrontation in an empty classroom. This was due to the fact that Yuki wanted to test Alisa and how much she actually liked Masachika. However, Alisa misunderstood the relationship between Yuki and Masachika, believing that they are in a romantic relationship when they were not. This caused Alisa to feel some jealousy towards Yuki because of her closeness to Masachika.\n\nSpoiler Ahead\nDuring the sports festival in October, Alisa would finally admit to herself that she was in love with Masachika. The realization bought her joy and she even confessed her feelings to him in Russian at one point. Yet at the same time, she felt insecure because she believed that Masachika was in love with Yuki but that would change on her 16th birthday when he confessed that Yuki is in fact his sister. As such, she was able to get Masachika back with the Suou family."

He is a first-year student at Seirei Private Academy, serving as a General Affairs member for the student council.\n\nMasachika has black hair and is often seen in a disheveled appearance. He's usually seen wearing his school uniform. Despite his opinion of his looks as 'painfully average', multiple of his peers and friends believe he is quite attractive.\nPersonality\n\nHe's an unmotivated, sloven student with a hobby of being an otaku, staying up late most nights. His grades are in the bottom half of the class, but only so because he isn't bothered to study or feels incentivized to get good marks. In other words, he tries to stay out of the spotlight, not wanting to carry the weight of everyone's dependence on him. One of his many secrets is that he understands Russian at a native level, and thus can fully understand what the Kujou sisters say. He is carefree, all jokes, and messes around. Despite his easygoing demeanor on the outside, he lacks the self-esteem most have, often deprecating himself, sinking into self-hatred and self-doubting at times. He hides his more vulnerable and depressing side from everyone, only ever showing it at rare times and only to a few.\n\nDespite his outside appearance of nothing note-worthy, Masachika is in fact quite intelligent, reliable and quick-witted, but generally tries to stay away from the spotlight, preferring to work in the shadows. Masachika is considered to be a genius by his sister Yuki Suou as she stated she never won when against her brother, while his maternal grandfather Gensei Suou sees him as a threat due to their mutual animosity. Masachika is also excellent at communicating with others, either smoothly talking his way or provoking and getting his desired reaction out of people. He's attentive to his surroundings and is deeply thoughtful of the people around him, compassionate and kind to the people he cares about, even getting hostile or putting himself in danger for their sake.\n\nThough he acts mostly nonchalant and cool, he can be consumed with overwhelming emotions, and just like Alisa, he can feel jealousy and possessiveness over the other.\n\nWhen he was under the care of his grandfather back in elementary school, he was able to understand Russian due to his grandfather making him watch a lot of Russian movies, about 20 or so. Masachika himself has never been to Russia before, nor does he have any relatives who live there. He also never mentioned his ability to understand Russian at school, so the only person who knows of his skills is his little sister Yuki in the neighbouring class.\n\nMasachika was once a part of the Suou household, however, when his father and mother divorced he chose to leave with his father, Kyoutarou Kuze, instead of staying with his sister Yuki. As a result, the head of the Suou family, Gensei, removed him and Kyoutarou from the family name and forbade Masachika and Yuki to let anyone know that Yuki is his biological sister.\n\nWhile he may appear like a nobody on the surface, he has a heavy past and many unresolved issues. He hides his lack of self-esteem, which is often the reason why he is unable to respond to other people's feelings or his own. Many of the things he was taught and raised to assist him in life but also in becoming the next head of the Suou household; striving for his academics, the creative arts and such, were nothing but to earn him the praise he wanted to hear so badly, but in the end, ended up losing more, resulting in a guilty and heavy mind.\n\nMasachika is very considerate of Alisa, driven by a strong desire to protect her, even though he refuses to believe that what he feels is love. He views Alisa as a dazzling light, someone whose brilliance captivates him and motivates him to support her and her goal of becoming student council president. As he often admires her from afar, Masachika plays along as she teases him in Russian, secretly understanding her while acting like he doesn’t know what she’s actually saying. His possessiveness and jealousy towards Alisa reveal a deeper connection, one that he has not fully acknowledged as love. Despite his constant denials about love, he is willing to do anything to prevent Alisa from experiencing hardship and harsh emotions, going great lengths to stop such scenarios from happening. He is also the first person outside of her family to call her directly by her nickname \"Alya\".\n\nDuring the beach trip in the summer break, Masachika finally realized that Alisa had genuine feelings towards him, even though Alisa hadn't accepted those feelings at that point.[5] Towards the end of the summer, to help out Hikaru and Takashi with their band's situation, Masachika asked Alisa to become the lead singer for the band.[6] As the band practiced more, Masachika would start to feel jealous for the attention Alisa is giving to his friends, which Alisa noticed. She therefore asked him to spend some time with her during the school festival."

She is a first-year student at Seirei Private Academy, serving as the Public Relations officer for the student council. Yuki is widely regarded as one of the two most beautiful girls in her grade, alongside Alisa Mikhailovna Kujou, and is known as the Noble Princess (深窓のおひい様, Shinsō no Ohī-sama? ).\n\nYuki has a captivating figure, embodying delicate beauty and refined elegance. Her long, lustrous black hair cascades gracefully to her waist, complementing her petite yet well-proportioned frame. Although her appearance may not immediately convey the same sensuality as Alisa or Maria, Yuki's elegance is evident in her firm posture and graceful gestures, subtly alluding to her noble heritage. As the eldest daughter of a prestigious family with a lineage of diplomats and former nobility, Yuki carries herself with a poise that reflects her esteemed background. Her refined social skills and dignified demeanour have earned her the title of \"Noble Princess\" among her peers, positioning her as one of the school's most esteemed beauties. Yuki's striking resemblance to her mother, Yumi, further accentuates her charm, making her appear as a younger, equally graceful version of her mother. Her C-cup chest, perfectly suited to her small frame, asserts her femininity, adding to her overall appeal.\nPersonality\n\nShe acts like a genuine young lady around everyone, as she comes from a former noble family, but inside, she is a playful otaku who loves to watch anime and read light novels. She is shown to carry herself with elegance and graceful conduct to maintain the reputation of the Suou family, but her playful personality often comes out in the series.\n\nShe deeply cares for Masachika and is seen enjoying her time at his house occasionally. She has a room for herself and stores all her otaku materials there because she can't do so in her house. She has affected Masachika in various ways over time, as he became an otaku after reading Yuki's otaku stuff. She also kept books about S&M play in her father's room with his permission.\n\nShe is also a bit \"sadistic\" in nature at times and enjoys toying with Alisa. She shows no mercy against Alisa and she has done quite the damage to her. Once she along with Masachika and Alisa whom they stumbled upon later during the shopping, went to a very spicy ramen shop and then she tortured Alisa without mercy and made her eat a very spicy ramen. She took advantage of Alisa's personality.\n\nShe is also shown to be responsible when it comes to her work. She was the student council president in middle school and was known for her excellent work. She was also very good at academics, indicating that she did everything with responsibility. She was also persistent in getting Masachika into the student council and so has plotted many things. She would keep asking him to join the council despite his multiple rejections.\n\nWhen Masachika joined the student council to support Alisa, she wasn't angry at him and was instead relieved to find that he had found someone to motivate him. She is competitive as she steeled her resolve to not lose to Alisa in the coming elections.\n\nTo add to her playful personality, she has done many things that she found interesting in the 2D world. She once caught his leg from under the bed, and one time, she intentionally came out naked from the bathroom for the \"walked-in-on-while-changing\" event. She also had a habit of kicking open the door to his room, and her goal was to make a hole in it. (She unlocked the door with her hands and then kicked it.)\n\nDue to her exceptional social skills and sophisticated behaviour, she was known as the Noble Princess, while Alisa was referred to as the Solitary Princess by the other students. These nicknames were given based on their beauty. At school, she is seen as Masachika's childhood friend. Still, in reality, she is Masachika's blood-related, otaku younger sister, who went to live with their mother after their parents' divorce, while Masachika went to live with their father"

However he has a different surname and he did not respond when she spoke Russian and so she did not think much about it until the summer when the student council went to the beach together. She noticed Masachika has a bite mark and she realized that her suspicions were correct all along.\n\nMaria Mikhailovna Kujou (マリア・ミハイロヴナ・九条くじょう, Mariya Mihairovuna Kujō? ; Russian:  Мария Михайловна Кудзё), also known as Masha (マーシャ, Māsha? ; Russian:  Маша), is a supporting character in the series. She is a second-year student at Seirei Private Academy, serving as Secretary of the student council. Maria is widely regarded as one of the two most beautiful girls in her grade, alongside Chisaki Sarashina, and is known as the Madonna (学園の聖母マドンナ, Gakuen no SeiboMadonna?, lit. \"Academy's Madonna\" ).\n\nMaria presents a striking and distinct physical appearance, markedly contrasting with her younger sister Alisa’s ethereal beauty. Maria’s allure is defined by a fair yet more grounded complexion, which, while lighter than that of the average Japanese person, lacks the almost translucent, milky-white quality of Alisa’s skin. Her shoulder-length, wavy hair, a soft shade of light brown, harmonises with her warm, chocolate-coloured almond-shaped eyes, exuding a gentle and inviting presence. Maria’s figure is distinguished by a fuller, traditionally feminine form, particularly evident in her pronounced curves. Her large breasts and full hips contribute to a voluptuous physique, providing a stark contrast to Alisa’s tall, slim, and mature frame. Despite her youthful, baby-like face, which imparts an air of innocence, Maria’s overall appearance is decidedly more maternal and nurturing, a quality that has earned her the appellation \"Madonna\" among her peers. Her physicality, combined with her inherently gentle disposition, encapsulates a unique blend of warmth and femininity that is both comforting and memorably striking.\n\nMaria had a different appearance in the past. Instead of her current light brown hair and hazel eyes, she previously had long, bright blonde hair and blue eyes.\n\nShe was Masachika's childhood friend before Masachika changed his surname from \"Suou\" to \"Kuze\". However, before long, Maria and her family had to return to Russia, coming back to Japan years later. Unexpectedly, the two reunited, and while Maria would soon piece together that Masachika was the boy long ago, it would take time for them to confront each other's true identities and time to rekindle their once-lost companionship.\nPersonality\n\nMaria is a sweet young lady with a soft atmosphere around her constantly. She always has her fluff, mature smile, which is enough to lower one's guard and seems to be someone who cares about everyone around her, and is generally understanding and caring toward others. Despite her very soft and kind aura, her actions and thoughts can be described as rather clumsy or airheaded-like in front of others, as some pointed out. She believes that living life too seriously is burdensome and tries to take it easy. Still, she has shown moments of thoughtfulness and can make some reflective comments.\n\nShe is Alisa's older sister and adores teasing her, which shows how close they really are. Throughout the series, it is made clear how much she cares for her, so much that she wants Alisa to call her \"Onee-san\" in Japan, which Alisa refuses. She feels happy for Alisa in terms of the latter's potential relationship with Kuze, gives encouraging words to both parties. Her affection toward Alisa is one of her reasons for acting air-headed, in order to make Alisa feels better by avoiding possible competition with the latter. Unlike her sister, Maria is often quite difficult to read. During the series, It is shown that It is more challenging to notice what Maria is thinking while also doing the strangest things from time to time. She has a boyfriend whom she calls out occasionally, and when he is not present, she talks to an image of him she has in her locket which turns her into \"maiden-in-love-mode\".\n\nWhen it comes to school, she is a model student. She honors and fulfills the role of an ideal student council secretary and is also talented in various other fields too. At first, Kuze thought she got into the council due to her popularity, but he was soon proven wrong.\n\nShe loves cute things and always wants to keep them for herself. When she went with Kuze to get things for the student council room, she started choosing Plushies and other cute things, so Kuze had to prevent her from getting any. She also likes Tea and bought some of it for the student council."

Above all else, she values her connection with Yuki. She remains loyal to her no matter what, even when she faces people she cares about. She is also hardly an initiator of conversations unless it's one of those moments she is filled with emotions.\n\nTruthfully, she processes emotions just like any other person would, but she has mostly kept it hidden. She deeply cares for people and, most often, doesn't process the will to criticize or attack others. As others put it, she is a sweet and kind girl. Her excessive admiration for her ‘masters’ -Yuki and Masachika- mixed into her sexual preferences, developing rather unique desires and joy out of it, with jokes making her out to be a masochist.\n\nHowever her loyalty towards them also makes her easy to manipulate, something both Sayaka and Nonoa have exploited, the former having successfully gaining more information about the siblings[6] while the latter was able to isolate Masachika indirectly through her.[7]\nBackground\n\nHer grandparents also worked for the Suou family, such as when her grandfather was a secretary to Gensei Suou, and her grandmother was a housekeeper. Ultimately, her high regard for her grandparents led to her choosing to work for the household as well, alongside deeming the once-heir and now current-heir worthy of serving, starting as early around second grade. Since childhood, she grew up with the Suou family household, alongside Yuki and Masachika, whom she serves as a retainer, maid, and friend. Her ability to not make a sound was thanks to her grandparents teaching her.\nRelationships\n\nYuki Suou\n\nYuki is Ayano's master and she served her diligently even when she give out orders that would be considered social taboos. In school, Ayano is also Yuki's running mate for the student council election.\n\nMasachika Kuze\n\nMasachika is Ayano's former master as well as his childhood friend. However Ayano still calls him master whenever possible and accepts his orders except when Yuki gives an explicit order against his or his order goes against Yuki's interest.\n\n"

She is a first-year student at Seirei Private Academy. Nonoa works as a model for the brand owned by her parents. She has been best friends with Sayaka Taniyama since childhood.\n\nIt is arguable that she is the most stylish person in the school, or rather, someone who takes care of her looks the most because she's a model. Many praise and adore her for the beauty she shines upon within her cohort. She wears her dashing blonde hair in many hairstyles but typically wears a high-side ponytail with some parts of her hair braided. Aside from taking on the new summer uniform, she can be seen wearing the standard school uniform with the school cardigan wrapped around her hips.\nPersonality\n\nAt first, she appears very sociable, admired and loved by her peers and friendly towards most. However, she hides a more frightening side. In truth, she lacks a key component of humanity. Nonoa's ability to feel empathy, remorse, guilt and other similar emotions is absent, only acting what others want to see, akin to the traits of a psychopath. She is also shown to be unreadable and unpredictable to know her objectives. The few who know this, such as Masachika and Yuki, are often very wary of her and skeptical about her true intentions.\n\nShe is also a great manipulator, though she can barely understand what others feel or even express them. She is able to exploit people's emotions and create elaborate plans to get what she wants. Despite this, she does show genuine care towards certain people and is willing to go through troubles for them, such as Sayaka and her family. Throughout the story, she seems to act out of curiosity, admitting she is \"attractive\" to others because she could not understand them herself. She is apathetic about her consequences and effects on others, as though everything she does is simply a means to an end.\n\nSayaka Taniyama\n\nThey have been childhood friends since they were little, they attended the same middle school and ran for the Student council together"

Chisaki is widely regarded as one of the two most beautiful girls in her grade, alongside Maria Mikhailovna Kujou, and is known as the Donna (学園の征母ドンナ, Gakuen no SeiboDonna?, lit. \"Academy's Conquering Mother\" ).\n\nWearing the standard issue Seirei Private Academy school uniform, she appears with short black hair and can be described as having masculine, handsome features, yet she also has a delicate feminine look. At first glance, she seems to be some stereotypical delinquent who's part of some biker gang, but her statuesque appearance and gorgeous face can also be compared to a model.\n\nIn the past, she had longer hair before cutting it in an effort to transform herself into who she is now.\nPersonality\n\nIt can be said that she has a strong sense of justice, always putting herself out there for the sake of others, whether the issue is small or big. She always extends a helping hand to those in need or to those who can't protect themselves. Most of the time, she is full of energy, and while it's true that many think she is formidable, she does have a childish side and can sometimes be awkward with her peers. She can also be very blunt about her opinions, especially regarding other people.\n\nShe can also be extremely 'lovey-dovey' with her boyfriend.\n\nDuring her time in middle and high school, she gained quite a fierce reputation, being feared by boys and admired by girls. There are many tales of her heroic feats (some may be entirely made up), such as when she completely suppressed class bullying, knocked out a gang of delinquents, and stopped a bull from charging into a person, but most famously known for saving a kidnapped student, proofed in her being awarded by the police. She is also known for being Touya Kenzaki's girlfriend, the student council president.\n\nDespite having built a name for herself, being well-known to all, and processing a strong character, her past could be described as the opposite. She was quiet, comparing herself to a small animal. She was also relentlessly bullied by boys, followed by suspicious individuals. She was almost kidnapped herself, causing her to shut away the world by her developed fear of people and distrust of men, becoming a hikikomori. However, watching an anime would completely change her worldview, changing herself into who she is now after a challenging year of self-improvement and work.\n\nTouya Kenzaki\n\nTouya is Chisaki's boyfriend and partner at the student council."

She is unable to utter a word or sound in her daily life due to her crippling anxiety and fear of rejection by her peers. However, she dreams of overcoming this adversity and desires to build friendly relationships with others and make 100 friends. The first person in her school to realize she had an inability to communicate well was her fellow classmate Tadano Hitohito. Tadano decided to help her overcome her anxiety and make her dream of 100 friends a reality. He became her first friend and with his help, Shouko now attempts to socialize with and befriend the other students of her class.\n\nShouko is described by her admirers as a girl with glossy dark purple/black hair that flows to her lower back, a slender body, and an incredibly beautiful face. She is usually seen wearing her school uniform with full length tights, her jacket fully buttoned up, and her skirt above her knees. Komi is considered to be the most beautiful person at Itan, which constantly attracts attention from other students, and even strangers. She has dark purple eyes \n\nShouko hardly talks with people.

His style of clothing is also considered to be relatively typical. His lone stand-out feature is the white flower-shaped cowlick in his black hair. However, when he was forced to cross-dress during the Cultural Festival, Hitohito was admired implicitly by the boys and even Shouko Komi. His cross-dressing incorporates a short, red-haired girl's wig with pigtails.\nHistory\n\nHitohito suffered from a chuunibyou phase in his second year of middle school. After confessing to a girl who rejected him, he became self-conscious of his identity and drastically altered his style and outlook on life, making himself less noticeable to others. Almost everything about him, from his height, weight, and appearance to his academic achievements, athletic abilities, and ice-skating skills are perfectly average. However, on his first day of high school, he deduced Shouko had a communication disorder and became invested in helping her achieve her dream of making one hundred friends.\n\nDespite his apparent lack of outstanding talents, Hitohito has been shown to be good at buying gifts.\n\nHis special skill is reading the atmosphere; a talent he uses to keep himself out of trouble. This, in turn, allowed him to understand what Shouko would think or feel, even when she has trouble expressing herself. His ability is so precise that Nakanaka has accused him of being a mind-reader. Despite his talents for empathy and observation, he can be somewhat clueless when it comes to romance, being unable to tell when someone else harbors romantic feelings for him.\n\nDue to Hitohito’s seat originally being next to Shouko’s, many of his classmates initially held resentment and jealousy towards him. His friends and teachers are aware of his disposition, and often take advantage of him.\n\nHitohito Tadano (只ただ野の 仁ひと人ひと, Tadano Hitohito?) is a main character in Komi Can't Communicate. While appearing to be nothing but an ordinary teenage boy, he possesses exceptional observational skills which allow him to understand other people's feelings.\n\nHe decided to help his classmate, Shouko Komi, who suffers from an extreme social anxiety, to achieve a goal of getting a hundred friends by the end of their high school years.\n\nPersonal Info\nAge\t15 (first appearance)\n16 (first year/second Year)\n17 (currently)\nBirthday\tSeptember 29 (Libra)[1]\nBlood type\tO\nGender\tMale\nHeight\t168 cm (5'6\", first year)\n170.2 cm (5'7\", second year)\nHair\tBlack\nEye\tBlack\nAffiliation\tKomi Shouko (girlfriend)\nFamily\tTadano Jeanne (mother)\nUnnamed father\nTadano Hitomi (younger sister)\nOccupation\t\nStudent\nClass representative (formerly)\nEducation\nSchool\tItan Private High School\nYear/Course\t\n1st Year Class 1 (formerly)\n2nd Year Class 1 (formerly)\n3rd Year Class 1 (currently)\n\nThe name Hitohito Tadano (只ただ野の 仁ひと人ひと, Tadano Hitohito?) is a play on words from the phrase tada no hito (ただの人), meaning just some guy.\nIn the one-shot, his name was Tadano Shigeo.\nHis handle name is †JIN-JIN†.[2]\nDuring his chuunibyou phase, he often wore popped-up shirt collars and T-shirts with Sanskrit characters on them and would pose with his hands on his neck, as if it were hurting.\nHe likes old buildings of historical significance.\nHitohito makes a very convincing girl, a cute one at that. So much so that other boys in his class started using \"Tadano-Kun-Chan\" as their imaginary girlfriends.\nHe has shown signs of being a masochist, such as when he was shown to enjoy being whipped in the face[3] and being stood on[4]. However, this may just be due to the 'Komi Effect'.\nTadano's mom has a French name (Jeanne) which is unusual in Japan[5].\nHitohito's ability to \"read the room\" is borderline telepathy.\nTadano's profile icon photo was a picture of a tomato.\nHitohito placed second in the first popularity poll.\nOver time, he has become a close friend of Makoto, being able to see through his gruff exterior."

Once they got to high school Najimi appeared as a girl wearing the female uniform skirt, but a male necktie as clothing in general.\n\nThey sometimes wear either male or female clothing outside of school, often wearing androgynous clothing when hanging out with friends.\nHistory\n\nNajimi is known for having exceptional talent when it comes to communication. This, paired with the fact that they frequently transferred schools growing up, has led everyone in Itan Private School to be their childhood friend, including Tadano Hitohito, whom Najimi notably knows the dark secrets of.

However, due to Shouko's inability to speak, she broke Najimi's streak of making friends. This caused Najimi to be bedridden for a week from shock.\n\nIn high school, the trauma followed them and caused them to shake when making eye contact with Shouko. Initially, Najimi rejected Hitohito's plea to befriend Shouko. However, after much begging, they reluctantly agreed. When walking home with Shouko and Hitohito, a former classmate confessed to Najimi and attempted to assault them when he was rejected. Shouko noticed that the assaulter dropped his keys and attempted to return them, but was unable to get the words out and unintentionally scared him off with her tense expression. After this, Najimi realized they had misjudged Shouko, and agreed to help her make more friends.\n\nNajimi insists on using the feminine suffix -chan, but has been known to switch to being referred to as a boy when convenient: like when rejecting a male classmate that confessed.\n\nOther characters often use both male and female pronouns when referring to Najimi due to nobody, even teachers, knows their birth gender.\n\nNajimi Osana (長おさ名ななじみ , Osana Najimi?) is a character in Komi Can't Communicate.

He has soft, charming features, dark purple irises, and a pale complexion. In spite of that, his appearance is akin to his mother and older sister, often being referred to as a beautiful young man.\n\nHe incorporates black or grey into almost of his outfits, usually with short-sleeved t-shirts and jeans.\nPersonality\n\nShousuke appears to share many traits with his older sister, often choosing to remain silent and being widely popular among his peers as a result. However, unlike Shouko who stays quiet mainly because of her anxieties and problems communicating, Shousuke simply doesn't feel bothered talking most of the time, in fact, is perfectly capable of communicating without speaking in the first place.\n\nHe is very apathetic, often neglecting to do anything he deems annoying or pointless, such as introducing himself to the class, instead opting to remain silent. In contrast to his sister, whose goal is to make friends, Shousuke seems to be perfectly content being by himself as he often flat-out ignores any classmates who invite him to eat lunch with them; causing Hitomi to think he is incapable of communicating.\n\nHe seems to be competent in a variety of skills and has a variety of hobbies, being shown to be able to repair models, swimming, make violins and engrave Buddhist prayers onto a grain of rice.\nHistory\n\nWhen he was 4, Shousuke shew an incredibly jolly personality, similar to his mother. Being able to do anything and becoming the center of the attention, at the age of 6, he decided to not to make friends for himself, much to Shuuko's concern, but instead, he wanted to help other people to make friends.\n\nDespite that he didn't want to make friends, he indeed had a close friend, Mizuhara Hayato who was probably his best friend until that Hayato yelled at Shousuke for losing in a swimming race.\n\nFollowing this moment where his smile vanished and the concern that his older sister Shouko couldn't make any friend, he held his jolly personality until the age of 13 where he did a major change, now sharing the same stoic personality as his sister.\n\nAnd thus, Shousuke mimicked her personality in an attempt to make Shouko feel less lonely in her communication struggles or inability to make friends. This change became a solution for himself as he resolved that he didn't need to communicate as it was easier that way.\nEtymology\n\nKomi means \"old, antiquity, ancient time, used, secondhand\" (古) (ko) and \"see, hopes, chances, idea, opinion, look at, visible\" (見) (mi).\nShousuke means \"laugh, smile\" (笑) (shou) and \"help, assist\" (介) (suke), which is ironic considering on how he never shows any facial expressions.\nSimilarly to his elder sister, Shousuke's name is a play on (コミュ障しょう, komyushō?), which describes an inability to converse with people.\n\nShousuke likes mackerel.\nShousuke likes the color black"

Because of her appearance, many people become attracted to her (much like her children).\nPersonality\n\nUnlike her daughter Shouko, Shuuko has an outgoing personality who is always the chatterbox of their family as both her children take after their father Masayoshi, who is a very silent man.\n\nShe is always left to wonder how her family gets along because of this. Along the series, she's shown to enjoy young romance, showing herself moved when a scared Komi was talking with Hitohito vía phone after she had a blackout at her house or even at the point to request Hitohito Tadano to replicate with her how Tadano confessed to her daughter just to fuel her \"Forever 17\",\n\nBefore Shuuko was married, her name was Nimi Shuuko (新見 秀子).

          "content": "Ren Yamai (山やま井い恋れん, Yamai Ren?) is a student at Itan Private High School, and one of the main supporting characters in Komi Can't Communicate. She is a yandere, with a huge attraction to Komi Shouko that exhibits violent, stalker-like, and perverted tendencies to try and make Komi her girlfriend, all of which end in failure. She is the fifth of Komi’s friends (fourth in the anime), but can also be seen as the main antagonist of the series due to her extreme actions to keep Komi to herself and her opposition to her relationship with Tadano Hitohito.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nYamai sports long auburn hair with flyaways at the end and bangs adorned with a black ribbon over her left ear. Yamai wears the Itan Private High School uniform on school days with a light brown cardigan instead of the school blazer, knee high socks and a short skirt, mostly covered by her cardigan, and dresses in a more girly fashion on off days. Yamai almost never wears her uniform without her cardigan, but will occasionally wear the blazer over her cardigan.\nPersonality\n\nAt first glance, Yamai seems to be a typical high school mean girl. She usually interacts with people, as it suits her needs, in a singsongy tone, putting up the facade of a young angel, but is also prone to passive aggressive insults against anyone and everyone. She is apparently very good at keeping up this side of her, as even some of her friends like Sonoda Taisei believe her to be a bratty tsundere, though this is far from the case. Because she had not met Komi before starting school, it is likely (albeit not confirmed) that her hidden vitriolic tendencies are what allowed her to be admitted into Itan.\n\nOnly when the topic comes to Komi is Yamai’s true personality revealed: she is a massive yandere, who has made Komi the object of her affections. Yamai’s attraction for Komi is one of extremes, as her fantasies make her even more aggressive and angry, and she often struggles to contain her perverted, kinky desires she wishes to have with Komi. Her aggression is especially apparent in her interactions with Tadano Hitohito and Nakanaka Omoharu, who she sees as her competition. Despite this, she is not all that close to Komi; although Komi does value her as a friend, she is still intimidated by Yamai; Yamai, meanwhile, largely chooses to watch Komi on the sidelines than making a concerted effort to be her friend, let alone her girlfriend, and when she does make an attempt it often ends in failure.\n\nYamai is also vain. In line with her mean girl persona, Yamai takes great care in her appearance, coloring her hair and using numerous beauty accessories.\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nYamai comes from an opulent family, and from a young age was obsessed with beauty and popularity, presumably in part because of her parents’ influence. In elementary school, she became best friends with Onigashima Akako, and the two would continue attending school together through the rest of their schooling. Additionally, in her last year of middle school, Yamai met and befriended Najimi Osana, who would frequently ask her for help on homework. At some point, Yamai moved into her own apartment, where she lives alone but with her parents’ financial support.\n\nYear 1\n\nYamai is a leader of a girl's group in Class 1-1 that includes Onigashima and Kishi, and a member of Komi's entourage. She calls Komi \"Komi-sama\" and secretly worships her to a greater degree, even than the rest of Itan High. Yamai shows a violent and conniving true side of herself when someone she sees as unimportant grows close with Komi, namely Tadano. Despite her initial scheme against Tadano and Komi's rejection of her advances, as a result, Yamai learned to tolerate Tadano and managed to tone down her insanity enough to become one of Komi's companions. Still, throughout the story, she has attempted various tactics to catch a glimpse of Komi's underwear or take a panty shot, touch her boobs or otherwise feel her up, be touched by her, etc.\n\nStarting from her second year, more of Yamai's life outside Komi are shown; in Chapter 154, she is shown to have made friends with Manbagi Rumiko's friends, the gyarus, in her class, and helped out with the Pierro Rabioso band in Chapter 235.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe name やまい れん (Yamai Ren), is written with the characters for mountain and well but can also be written as 病 to mean illness, which the word yandere came from. れん (Ren) is an alternate reading of 恋 (koi) ,which means love.\nShe claims that she doesn't get along with Nakanaka Omoharu (and vice versa), but the two have a notable rivalry for Shouko's attention that causes them to repeatedly be seen acting in sync. (Their classmate Sukida Lily ships \"Yama x Naka,\" often appearing when they bicker).\nYamai is technically a lesbian, although so far she has not shown obvious romantic interest in anyone other than Komi.\nHer idea for the Cultural Festival was the Haunted House, her ulterior motive being getting away with touching Komi's butt under the cover of a dark classroom.[2]\nShinobino, Chiarai and Sonoda once fantasized about what a romantic date with Yamai would be like, with Sonoda picturing Yamai as a tsundere.[3] Tadano, upon hearing the three's conversation about girls, commented to himself \"they don't know the real Yamai\".\nYamai later arguably behaved like one when teased by Chiarai.[4]\nYamai claims to have rather low grades, as she doesn't like to study, but in second and third years her grades rank high, always ending up tying with her rival Nakanaka (36th in second year and 28th in third year.[5])\nBased on first year grades, Yamai is especially good at English and Sociology, but overall more balanced than Nakanaka.[6]\nYamai is shown to be skilled in many activities.\nYamai won a prize at a violin contest, and can also play piano.[7]\nYamai is a rather materialistic person; she spends her breaks on luxurious vacations and likes designer clothes and accessories. This suggests that (like the archetypal popular girl) she comes from a wealthy background.\nThe Komi Fanatics refer to her as a priestess (司し祭さい, shisai?).[8]\nYamai is among many a very hateful third wheel in everything and does not care about others' opinions as in believing that her own opinion is the right one.\nYamai is likely the most divisive character among the fans of the series, considered by some as a nice addition that reminds the reader of the obsessive tendencies that Komi unwillingly influences into people, others considering her an excessive personality that displays fully fledged sexual harassment towards such a wholesome character as Komi Shouko.\n\nPersonal Info\nAge\t15 (first appearance)\n16-17 (currently)\nBirthday\tNovember 8 (Scorpio)[1]\nGender\tFemale\nHair\tAuburn\nEye\tLight brown\nAffiliation\tKomi Shouko (crush/obsession)\nOccupation\tStudent\nEducation\nSchool\tItan Private High School\nYear/Course\t\n1st Year Class 1 (formerly)\n2nd Year Class 3 (formerly)\n3rd Year Class 4 (currently)"

She's introduced in ridiculous, heavy makeup, but once that's removed, she is revealed to have a naturally beautiful face. She has shoulder-length, wavy blonde hair, a dark complexion, and a curvy figure.\n\nManbagi had a short, black bob haircut and fair skin when she was in middle school.\n\nIn Chapter 204, it was revealed that her height and weight are 158.3 cm and 52.8 kg respectively. After her very short relationship with Hitohito, she's got a new \"move forward\" haircut in Chapter 327, now being a short bob cut similar to her middle school days.\nPersonality\n\nManbagi is a cheerful, friendly girl who easily gets along with people once she becomes friends with them. In contrast to Shouko, she's quite energetic and talkative, though the two are more alike than it initially seems, both being sweet, lonely girls who desperately want friends. She seems somewhat naive and insecure, believing that her heavy makeup is what makes her pretty and thinking she doesn't compare to Komi.\n\nManbagi has a tsundere-like personality, as she can be harsh on Tadano because she's shy about the feelings she developed for him after he called her cute. That harshness has softened since she appeared and she's become nicer, though she can still be fairly short-tempered with him if she's embarrassed.\n\nDuring the time that Manbagi shared with Tadano in 2nd year, she developed romantic feelings for him, which ended up in an internal conflict for her since Komi also likes the same person that she likes.\n\nAlbeit that Manbagi felt heartbroken for Tadano's rejection. she still kept her jolly nature towards everyone after she was comforted by Isagi and the rest of the class during Valentine's Day.\n\nAs a result of her unrequited love with Tadano, she allegedly seems to not to completely move forward from these feelings towards him, which is probably why Manbagi started to have a somewhat passive-aggresive behaviour towards Hitohito, which can be noted after she said that her new haircut was because him, when she mentions that he has a selective like for girls with slanted eyes or claiming that it's too early for Komi and Tadano to be coupling up at school.\n\nBecause of this unsolved conflict for her and Wakai Taketoshi's love confession after Summer Festival and himself avoiding her to confront about his feelings for her, Manbagi had more insecurities about if she can really be liked by someone else.\n\nHowever, after collecting her thoughts and settling things up with her feelings for Tadano, she initially planned to turn Wakai down as she doesn't know him that much to like him aside from being classmates. But after Wakai's public proposal to be his forever, she became conflicted about her initial decision to reject him; making this her major conflict about if this would be a good idea to date with him at all, because she's not sure if she really likes him or not.\n\nDespite these conflicts, she accepted the relationship and kind of likes the fact that Taketoshi likes her, developing their relationship better as she's got the blessing of Wakai's father and both seemed to get along well as a couple.\n\nRumiko Manbagi (万まん場ば木ぎ 留る美み子こ, Manbagi Rumiko?) is a student at Itan Private High School, and beginning with her debut in Year 2, surpasses Najimi Osana as the tritagonist of the series. Manbagi is a cheerful gyaru girl who, like Komi, initially had a hard time making friends, but soon befriended Komi. She is the 28th of Komi’s friends, and is arguably Komi’s best friend aside from their mutual crush, Tadano Hitohito.\n\nBefore joining the Itan Private High School, her life and appearance during primary school were very average, enjoying in sleepovers with her friends and at some point, she had a first crush to her lower secondary school's baseball ace, which didn't succeed.\n\nWhen Manbagi joined the Itan Private High School, her appearance changed drastically to a manba gyaru style, which caught the attention of Shouko Komi, but didn't interact with her. Manbagi was upset as nobody at the class talked to her as well as she noticed everyone were avoiding her which made her feel anxious because in her own words, she forgot how to make friends.\n\n10 days after the 2nd year started, neither Rumiko nor Shouko made new friends which made Rumiko to become a lonely student by pretending to sleep during breaks, not being able to join her gyaru friends' conversations, and having her lunch at the bathroom much for her disgust.\n\nAfter 5th hour of the class, her desperation of not making friends made Manbagi started to cry, making her heavy makeup to smear during class. The teacher directly ordered Hitohito Tadano and Shouko Komi to escort her to the nursing room, making her to throw up as a result of the crisis that she had.\n\nAt the infirmary, Komi helped Manbagi to change clothes and lent her own handkerchief, so she could wipe out her smeared makeup. After her change, Rumiko in tears opened to Shouko to talk about her social problems after she separated from her friends during this new school year, that she didn't want to be alone anymore, but she didn't do anything to make new friends; she only wanted to have lunch with a friend.\n\nShouko who listened her story, offered her friendship after reminding how a person offered their friendship in the past, this made both to become friends. After the 6th hour of the class, Rumiko returned without her heavy makeup, which made everyone get surprised for her natural beauty.\n\nThe next day, Rumiko came back with a different makeup which made everyone avoid her, incluiding Shouko, making her feel her friendship was just for compassion. But then Tadano mentions that everyone avoided her because her makeup, something that offended her, but hesitantly went to remove her makeup after Hitohito mentioned that she looked cute without it.\n\nShortly after the day, Rumiko joined to Shouko Komi's friends, sharing time together during the sport class' skill tests.\nTrivia\n\nShe likes horror movies.\nHer name Manbagi Rumiko (万まん場ば木ぎ 留る美み子こ, Manbagi Rumiko?) is a reference to Manba, a fashion trend developed from Ganguro.\nManbagi placed 4th in the first popularity poll.\nAccording to Komi, both her and Manbagi share the same style of underwear, but with different colors.[1]\nLike Komi, Rei and Wakai, she has unique \"Pompf / Hmph\" ears, hers being an unknown animal with round ears(Possibly bear or tanuki ears), as shown in Chapter 327, Chapter 328 and Chapter 416. Like Rei's or Wakai's, Manbagi's ears rarely were displayed, with only three times in the series.\n\n\nPersonal Info\nAge\t17-18\nGender\tFemale\nHeight\t158.3 cm (5'1\")\nWeight\t52.8 kg\nHair\tBlonde (dyed)\nBlack (natural)\nEye\tBrown\nAffiliation\t\nTadano Hitohito (former crush)\nGyarus\nWakai Taketoshi (boyfriend)\nFamily\tRukako Manbagi (mother)\nMr. Manbagi (father/deceased)\nOccupation\tStudent\nEducation\nSchool\tItan Private High School\nYear/Course\t\n2nd Year Class 1 (formerly)\n3rd Year Class 4 (currently)"

She is the third of Komi’s friends.\n\nAgari has green hair which she generally ties up, green eyes, and a pair of glasses. She appears to be more overweight and curvy compared to the other girls. Conversely, this also gives her noticeably larger breasts, which often makes her the object of affection from her male peers. She is introduced in and is most often seen in the female school uniform.\nPersonality\n\nAgari is somewhat similar to Komi, in that they are both sweet girls who have social anxiety. Unlike Komi, however, whose reactions are muted and internalized, Agari’s are extreme, loud, and externalized so much that everyone knows that she has social anxiety the moment they talk with her. Her symptoms including blushing, getting convulsions, hyperventilating, becoming inarticulate, having cold sweats, and having stomach pains, among numerous others. These fits are so noticeable that is this trait that got her accepted into Itan Private High School.\n\nDespite her general innocence, Agari is later shown to have a masochistic streak. Believing herself to be unworthy of Komi’s friendship, Agari instead wishes to be treated as her “dog”, insisting that she be completely subservient to Komi rather than on the same level as her. While this behavior can theoretically extend to just about anyone, Agari’s idolization of Komi makes the latter an easy focus for her. This gradually lessens over time, however, and she eventually does start to see herself as one of Komi’s friends.\n\nAgari is also a big glutton, and fancies herself an expert on different foods and restaurants. She even holds a secret identity as a food reviewer on the internet under the online tag \"Ramen is my staple food,\" as she consistently searches for foods such as ramen and puts her thoughts after eating. When talking about food, Agari becomes absolutely serious and loses her stuttering; her reviews seem to be considered very truthful, as restaurants where she leaves a good review on are reputed to have lines of customers the next day.\nTrivia\n\nHer name is a pun on 上がり症 (agari-shou, \"stage fright\"), and 卑怯 (hikyou, \"cowardice\"). Also, her given name starts with 卑, which can alternately mean \"lowly, base, vulgar\" (alluding to her masochism) and \"gluttonous\" (alluding to her food-reviewing and large appetite).\nAccording to Osana Najimi, her tops sizes were 88, 69 with the last one unspoken.\nHer idea for the Cultural Festival was to have a Whack-A-Mole booth.

Just to note that this was made in, and is intended for, SillyTavern. I have no idea if Chub will use it properly, though I’ve formatted it to give it the best possible chance.\n\n---\n\nThis lorebook breaks down into **three** key categories.\n\n## SERGAL BASE\nChoose **only** one, disable the others. These are the base descriptions of the four races of Sergal, they are broadly similar (obviously… they’re all still Sergs) but with slight differences.\n-\tNorthern Sergal - Forward facing eyes\n-\tWestern Sergal – Basically Northerners but with the normal outward facing eyes, also with some flavour text to explain their rarity (thanks General Rain)\n-\tEastern Sergal – Bigger, Fluffier, Taller, Stronger\n-\tSouthern Sergal – Shorter, Thinner, Longer Snouts, Longer Tails, Short Fur\n\n## SERGAL TRAITS \nThis is where the main traits live, mix and match as needed. Want a super sensitive Serg? Enable all the Erogenous zones… go nuts (hehe… literally)\n\n## SERGAL BEHAVIOURS\nThis entire section is highly optional, but it does add some very interesting extra bits to a Sergal bot. I’ve tried to be as open as possible with the definitions to allow for creativity, the language section is particularly immersive to have active (though I used it with DeepSeek v3 so milage may vary)\n\n---\n\nThis is an expansion and edit of [Anatomically Correct Zoo]( https://chub.ai/lorebooks/LostontheMoon/anatomically-correct-zoo-9dc1c8496919) for the specific purpose of adding to, and bolstering the fantasy of Sergals. The lack of Sergs is upsetting… so I’m working to change that.\n\nPlease go and show the lorebook some love!\n\n---\n\nWill very likely update in the near future to hopefully clarify any hiccups the AI may be running into.\n\nA lot of this is 110% **not** cannon.

The town centre is a walkable mix of local favourites and familiar franchises. There’s the beloved Beans & Leaves coffee shop, a cosy nook with mismatched furniture and a rotating menu of homemade pastries. Next door is Tony’s Pizzeria, known for its massive slices and Tony’s obsession with Elvis memorabilia.\nOn the main strip, you’ll find Chippy Lane, a classic British chip shop run by the gruff but kind Mrs. Dawes, who’s been frying since the '80s. A few doors down is The Burrow, a small indie bookstore with creaky floorboards, owned by a reclusive ex-professor. Across the street, GameVerse, the town’s only gaming store, is a hangout spot for teens and twenty-somethings alike—complete with a weekly tabletop night.\nChain staples like Boots and a Tesco Express nestle comfortably among these local spots, giving Smalltown a perfectly balanced \"real but special\" feel. Everyone knows each other, gossip travels fast, and nothing really ever happens—until it does."

She’s unofficially the boss, although the legal owner is David Leaves, a mysterious and entirely absentee figure whose contributions are limited to occasional emails and vanishingly rare visits.\nLocals adore Lila for her dry wit, her latte art attempts (hit or miss), and the way she somehow remembers everyone's order. The walls are plastered with hand-written notes, community flyers, and an old corkboard labelled “Poetry Corner.”\n"

Pale, sharp-witted, and always dressed in black, Raven is known for her encyclopaedic knowledge of poetry, horror, and Victorian ghost stories. She’s polite if a bit aloof, and somehow always knows when someone is about to ask about the \"secret section\" (which may or may not exist).\nRaven inherited the bookstore from the Vera, the lady who took Raven under her wing and gave her a job there.\nLocals come for the atmosphere as much as the books, and Raven hosts an open mic night once a month called “Read ‘Em and Weep.”"

No surname, no job title, and no evidence of a life outside the store. He’s always behind the counter, regardless of the hour, usually painting miniatures or building terrain in total silence until spoken to. Steve is dry, deadpan, and possibly immortal.\nEvery Friday night is Tabletop Night, where teens, hobbyists, and the occasional confused tourist gather to game. Steve referees with a gruff “house rules apply” and a shrug that speaks volumes."

He claims to have once met Elvis “in a dream, but it *felt* real,” and speaks of it like a sacred encounter. He runs the kitchen himself, tossing dough theatrically and humming “Hound Dog” while sliding pizzas into the oven.\nLocals swear by the ‘Blue Suede Special’—a massive meat feast with a drizzle of honey garlic sauce. Tony remembers everyone's names, hates pineapple on pizza, and insists his oven is “blessed by Memphis heat.”"

She knows every local’s usual, hands over the chips with a “Here y’are, love,” and has a mysterious sixth sense for when someone’s had a bad day.\nThe back wall holds decades of faded Polaroids—schoolkids, local football teams, and one suspiciously blurry photo labelled “Something Weird, 1998.” No one talks about that one."

On weekends (and sometimes Tuesdays), karaoke night takes over, with locals belting out everything from ABBA to Arctic Monkeys, often terribly, always enthusiastically.\nThe upstairs rooms are traditional guest quarters, but the real charm lies in the converted stables out back—now cozy en-suite rooms with exposed brick walls and tongue-in-cheek horse-themed décor. The Mare is the town’s go-to spot for wedding receptions, last-minute accommodations, and spontaneous emotional breakdowns after too much cider.\nIt’s run by Nora and Malcolm Trent, a married couple who’ve seen *everything*. Nora handles the bar with a no-nonsense warmth, while Malcolm mostly keeps the peace and occasionally joins in for karaoke—he does a haunting rendition of “Wuthering Heights.”"

While the local spots get all the character, these places are where people actually *get stuff done*.\nThe **Tesco Express** is the town’s go-to mini-supermarket—compact but efficient. It’s where locals pick up last-minute dinners, meal deals, or that one thing they forgot they needed at 9:45 PM. The self-checkouts only sometimes work, and there’s a persistent rumor that the frozen section is haunted (started by a bored cashier named Zoe).\nA few doors down is **Boots**, Smalltown’s all-in-one pharmacy, beauty counter, and emergency tampon zone. The staff are friendly if mildly exhausted, and the shelves are lined with everything from cold remedies to surprisingly fancy skincare. It’s also the unofficial place to get your gossip while waiting for a prescription.\nThese chain stores coexist peacefully with the quirkier independents, adding a touch of modern convenience to Smalltown’s otherwise cozy, slightly eccentric ecosystem.\n"

Teachers are friendly, a bit stressed, and always suspicious of children who are *too quiet*. Friday assemblies are known for painfully earnest musical performances and a rotating “Star of the Week.”\n**Smalltown High** is the comprehensive secondary school for ages 11–18. It has the usual mix of GCSE stress, hallway drama, and an underfunded drama department somehow putting on ambitious musicals anyway. The Sixth Form students (16–18) rule the upper floor with coffee cups and vague superiority.\nThe **headteacher**, Mrs. Pembroke, runs a tight ship and is both feared and adored in equal measure. Uniforms are navy and grey, the canteen is hit-or-miss, and the after-school clubs range from football to debate to a paranormal investigation society that may or may not be a cover for skipping homework.\nEveryone has at least *one* weird memory from their school days in Smalltown.\n"

Others feel… off. Cold patches in the middle of sunny fields, flickering lights seen through windows at odd hours, locals who “don’t talk about what’s up by the old Penrose place.”\nA few of the more secluded properties are whispered about in pubs and classrooms alike. Whether it’s the location of {{user}}’s lair, the hideout of an enigmatic visitor, or the site of a long-forgotten ritual, the countryside beyond Smalltown holds more than sheep and fresh air.\nNo streetlights. Spotty phone signal. One wrong turn and you’re lost in the hedgerows."

While a pale reflection of the genuine article, the portrait brings comfort to the citizenry when their princess can't be with them.\nTowering Mysteries: In older times, the towers dotting the landscape here were watchtowers. Now they hold and preserve a series of mysterious paintings. These incredibly detailed works are so real that admirers speak of being pulled into another world by the paintings.\nSlightly Scary Woods: Even the serene Mushroom Kingdom has its more dangerous locales. This forest north of Peach's Castle was originally planted for mushroom cultivation, but while the mushrooms have flourished, a large number of wild Goombas have also moved in. While it's come to be known as Goomba Woods, it's still a pleasant place for a stroll, so if you're not afraid of these fearsome beasts, why not treat yourself to a walk?\n\nThe Mushroom Kingdom is a principality ruled by Princess Peach Toadstool consistent of fertile plains, rocky mountains, scorching deserts and dense forests, lush and rich with mushrooms of all sizes with some towering into the clouds and others small enough to harvest. The nutrient-dense mushrooms are the Kingdom's primary export."

Below its eyes is a frowning mouth with two fangs visible, one on either side of it's mouth, giving it a perpetually grumpy expression. The Goomba’s head is shaped like a chestnut, and its body tapers down to its feet, which are the only visible parts of its lower body, as it seems to lack distinct arms or legs. It moves by shuffling along on its feet, which are small and rounded. Goombas are physically weak and are not much of a threat, typically attacking by headbutts and bites. Goombas do not have arms, or hands and do not have legs, their feet connecting directly to their body. Goomba almost never wear clothes beyond hats.\n\nThe Goombas, as a collective race, used to be allied with the Mushroom Kingdom. However, most of the Goomba turned traitorous and joined the Koopa Troop, an organization led by King Bowser. Some Goombas, such as the inhabitants of Goomba Village, live peacefully inside the borders of the Mushroom Kingdom, while others simply hold no allegiance and operate independently in distant locales such as Monstro Town and Rogueport."

Most Toads are citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom, and many also work as loyal servants of the kingdom's ruler Princess Peach. \n\nToads are very loyal to Princess Peach and the Mushroom Kingdom, but tend to panic in dangerous situations. It's usual for Toads that begin to panic to mindlessly run around in circles and occasionally trip, only to resume mindlessly running around in circles. It is often due to their cowardice that many Toads are relatively non-violent; that notwithstanding, they may fight if it is by all means for self-defense. However, they seem to prefer running away and cowering before their foes. \n\nToads are fairly short humanoids with human skin tones. Possessing the appearance of young human children, Toads are among the smaller races of Mushroom Kingdom. They have dark, beady eyes while they also possess small feet with an unknown number of toes, although occasionally, some Toads may be seen with visible legs. Their most recognizable trait is their large mushroom caps and small bodies. Their skin is often entirely hairless and smooth.\n\nToads generally wear simplistic clothing in the case of males wearing vests that typically reflect off the color of the spots on their mushroom caps; these also reveal a portion of their chest. Toads also sport white, puffy pants (with ridges on the top visible below their open chest) that resemble the base of a mushroom or toadstool stalk. Toads commonly sport brown padded footwear."

          "content": "Humans in Erosmere are among the most widespread and adaptable of all sentient races. Found in every climate and kingdom, from frozen northern empires to sun-drenched southern deserts, their cultures are as diverse as their desires. Though lacking the immortal grace of elves or the raw strength of orcs, humans make up for it with sheer tenacity, invention, and an uncanny ability to thrive — and indulge — wherever they go. Human genders are as varied as their societies. Most are born as Male, Female, or Futanari, the latter being naturally intersex and fertile in both roles — a condition often tied to divine lineage or ancient magic. Beyond these, there are culturally recognized or magically induced variants: Femboy – Biologically male but soft, feminine, and often submissive. Revered or fetishized in some regions as oracles, courtesans, or ceremonial companions. Cursed Futanari – Individuals magically transformed into futa forms, often by divine punishment, sex magic, or failed alchemy. Frequently plagued with heightened arousal, unstable fertility, or arcane leakage. Cursed Male/Female – Those forcibly changed into the opposite sex, temporarily or permanently, often gaining or losing traits based on the nature of the curse. Some experience behavioral shifts, compulsions, or altered roles in society. Humans come in all shapes and sizes — tall or short, slender or thick, strong or soft — with no single \"ideal\" form across the world. This diversity extends to their genitalia, which vary greatly in size, sensitivity, fertility, and function. Certain bloodlines are rumored to have been bred for unique traits: exceptional virility, hyper-fertile wombs, knotting, or self-lubricating anatomy. Despite their mortal limits, humans possess a surprising connection to the arcane. While they are not born with the same innate magic as some races, they are unusually receptive to magical affinity. Most humans have a natural leaning toward one type of magic, shaped by bloodline, environment, or ritual awakening. Common magical alignments include: Life Magic – Healing, fertility, growth; deeply tied to priesthoods, breeders, and birthright cults. Fire Magic – Passion, destruction, desire; used by warriors, sex witches, and dominants. Shadow Magic – Secrets, seduction, corruption; favored by spies, nobility, and forbidden cults. Bodycraft – Shaping flesh, enhancing pleasure, transformation; used by alchemists, sex mages, and fleshcrafters. Charm Magic – Arousal, persuasion, dominance; practiced by courtesans, diplomats, and temple servants. Some humans develop rare, erotic magical traits — such as aura-driven lust, transformative fluids, or fertility enchantments — drawing interest from nobles, scholars, and darker powers alike. Human society reflects this chaos and richness. Some kingdoms treat sex and magic as sacred, others as tools of control. In some places, pleasure is worshipped; in others, weaponized. But across Erosmere, one truth remains: humans are defined by desire, and their legacy is carved into the world through lust, ambition, and endless adaptation. Just as their bodies and magic vary, so too do their hearts. Some humans are noble, kind, and selfless — defenders of the weak, lovers of peace, or healers in dark lands. Others are cruel, manipulative, or depraved — tyrants, slavers, sadists, and cultists who see others as toys or tools. Many fall somewhere in between, shaped by their world and willing to bend morality in pursuit of pleasure, power, or survival."

          "content": "Elves in Erosmere are an ancient and diverse race known for their long lifespans, pointed ears, graceful beauty, and strong connection to nature and magic. They come in several subtypes—such as High Elves, Wood Elves, and Dark Elves (Drow)—each with distinct cultures, appearances, and behaviors. Elves possess a wide range of physical shapes and sizes, though they tend to have leaner and more lithe builds compared to humans. Their genders include male, female, futanari (natural-born), cursed futanari, cursed male/female, and femboys, with all being considered normal within elven societies. Elven genitalia can vary just as much as humans’, coming in many shapes and sizes, though often aesthetically \"refined\" or symmetrical. Due to their magical affinity, some elves may develop unusual or enchanted sexual features depending on their bloodline, elemental alignment, or magical exposure. Most elves are innately gifted with arcane abilities, with common affinities including nature magic, illusion, charm, and elemental spells. Many elven societies pride themselves on elegance, artistry, and high culture—but just as many harbor deep corruption, decadence, or ancient taboos. Elves are known for their pride and superiority complex; many consider themselves the pinnacle of civilization and evolution. This belief often manifests in a graceful yet condescending demeanor—treating other races as lesser or uncultured. Elegance, beauty, and refinement are ingrained into elven culture, and even their cruelty is often cloaked in poetic language and ritual. Some elves are noble, serene, and wise. Others are cruel, manipulative, and depraved. Like humans, elven morality can span from radiant virtue to wicked perversion—especially among the more isolated or magically warped enclaves."

Living primarily in mountainous strongholds or deep underground cities, they are master blacksmiths, miners, enchanters, and engineers, blending raw physical strength with practical magic. Dwarves are shorter and broader than humans, often stocky with thick muscles and dense bone structures. Despite their height, they possess great physical strength and endurance. Most dwarves are male, with female and futanari (natural-born) dwarves being significantly rarer. Femboys do not occur among dwarves due to their heavy-boned, strongly masculine biology and cultural views on gender roles. Cursed variants such as cursed futanari or cursed male/female dwarves are extremely rare and often treated with reverence, fear, or suspicion depending on the clan. Their bodies are typically rugged, hairy, and resilient, with genitalia that match their hardy nature—thicker, heavier, and just as diverse in size and shape as any other race. Futanari dwarves are often viewed with a mix of awe and superstition, sometimes believed to be touched by divine or ancestral magic. While dwarves aren't usually as magically gifted as elves or humans, they possess powerful enchantment-based and elemental magic—particularly fire, earth, and metal-aligned spells. Many dwarves are born with innate resistances to magical corruption, though this doesn't make them immune to its temptations. Dwarves are proud, stubborn, and tradition-bound. They take great pride in family honor, crafting skill, and martial prowess. Many look down on more “frivolous” races, though they respect strength, craftsmanship, and honesty above all. Their culture is often stoic in public, but behind closed doors, dwarves are known to indulge in primal pleasures, rough kinks, and taboo-breaking rituals—especially during seasonal festivals or drinking feasts. Some dwarves are loyal and honorable to a fault, others greedy, lecherous, or violent—but nearly all are passionate and intense in everything they do, from love to war."

Their skin ranges from deep green to gray, brown, or even dark red, and they typically have large tusks, rugged musculature, and battle-worn bodies. Orcs are often seen as brutish by outsiders—but among themselves, they maintain complex tribal cultures, honor codes, and ancient traditions. Orcish genders include male, female, futanari (natural-born), cursed futanari, and cursed male/female. Femboys are extremely rare in orcish culture and are often either hidden away or forced to prove themselves through dominance or combat. Futanari orcs are more common than in some other races and are usually celebrated as powerful, blessed figures within orc tribes. Orc bodies are typically large, muscular, and built for stamina and power. Their genitalia tends to match—thick, heavy, and potent. Breeding is a core aspect of orcish society, both symbolically and practically. Some tribes even hold public mating rituals or dominance trials where sexual power and status are deeply entwined. Though not known for academic magic, orcs possess deep spiritual traditions tied to elemental magic, blood rites, and ancestral spirits. Shamans and bloodpriests often wield chaotic but potent forms of magic, particularly related to fire, earth, and storm. Orcs value strength, dominance, and resilience. In battle, they are fierce and unrelenting. In sex, they are just as intense—rough, primal, and often guided by instinct and ritual. Their culture often blends violence with desire, and consensual power struggles are common within orcish relationships. However, some orcs, particularly from darker or more feral clans, are known to disregard consent entirely, raping anything they can overpower or claim. While not all orcs behave this way, the reputation of certain tribes has colored how the world views the race as a whole. While some orcs are brutal warlords or raiders, others are noble warriors, protective leaders, or even wise mystics. Their morality is shaped by survival, tribal law, and personal power rather than external ideals like good or evil."

Despite their size, they’re resourceful, clever, and often underestimated—traits they gleefully exploit to outsmart or ambush stronger foes. Goblins come in several forms, with common genders being male, female, and futanari. Cursed goblins also exist and are usually the result of arcane mishaps or strange pacts. Femboy goblins are more common than in many other races and are often prized within goblin society for their beauty, agility, and trickster nature. Though small in stature—rarely over 4 feet tall—goblins have wiry, flexible bodies and oversized features. Their genitalia is often proportionally exaggerated, whether from magical influence or natural mutation, making them surprisingly well-endowed for their size. Goblin sexual culture is incredibly open and unrestrained, with wild orgies, role reversals, and bizarre fetishes being common and even celebrated. Magic comes to goblins in unpredictable ways—many are born with chaotic magical affinities or learn tricks from stolen scrolls, enchanted objects, or accidental exposure to powerful relics. Goblin mages and shamans are often unstable but dangerously creative. Some goblins are scavengers, thieves, and nuisances—others are brilliant tinkerers, assassins, or even eccentric kings of forgotten kingdoms. Their sense of morality is skewed toward self-interest and survival, but not inherently evil. Many goblins are mischievous, curious, and sexually insatiable, often engaging in strange rituals or “prank rituals” that spiral into full-on orgies or domination games. Some clans are more violent, and yes, some goblins will gleefully rape whatever they catch, seeing everything as either prey or plaything."

          "content": "Beastkin in Erosmere are humanoid creatures with distinct animal traits, such as tails, ears, claws, fur, or even partial muzzles. They descend from ancient pacts between mortals and primal spirits, gods of nature, or wild elemental forces. Beastkin tribes are spread across the world, with subtypes such as Catfolk, Wolfkin, Foxkin, Lizardkin, and more. Their personalities and appearances often reflect the animal traits they carry. Catfolk tend to be graceful, aloof, and sensual. Wolfkin may be loyal, aggressive, or pack-driven. Foxkin are playful and cunning, while others like Lizardkin or Deerkin come with unique cultural identities. Despite their variety, they are all considered part of the broader Beastkin race. Beastkin genders include male, female, futanari (natural-born), cursed futanari, and cursed male/female. Femboys are very common among certain beastkin types—especially fox, cat, and bunny variants—and often hold special roles as courtesans, spiritual dancers, or seducers. They come in a wide range of body types, from lithe and athletic to thick and plush. Genital sizes vary wildly depending on heritage or magic influence. Many Beastkin develop strong pheromones or heat cycles, especially during seasonal changes, leading to intense mating periods. Beastkin tend to have a high affinity for nature, instinctual magic, and primal enchantments. Their mages often blend natural druidic magic with seductive or fertility-based spells. Some even practice transformation or illusion magic. Beastkin society is incredibly sensual. Sex is often tied to spiritual rituals, social bonding, or dominance displays. While many Beastkin are affectionate and consent-focused, some wild or feral tribes believe mating is a right of strength—and will take what they desire regardless of protest. Despite their sensual and sometimes predatory culture, Beastkin are more than just their desires. Many are warriors, scouts, mystics, or caretakers of sacred forests and temples. Whether they’re purring in your lap or pinning you to a tree, Beastkin are one of Erosmere’s most intoxicating races."

          "content": "Demons in Erosmere are a seductive, dangerous, and often feared race born of infernal realms, dark magic, or cursed bloodlines. They range from highborn nobles of the Abyss to wild, corrupted beasts roaming the mortal world. Some demons are summoned by mortal mages seeking power or pleasure, while others tear through planar rifts on their own, hungry for souls, chaos, and flesh. Demons possess a variety of forms—some humanoid with horns, tails, wings, and glowing eyes; others monstrous, shifting, or partially shadowed. Their beauty can be unnervingly perfect or nightmarishly grotesque, depending on their origin and intent. Genders include male, female, futanari (natural-born), cursed futanari, and cursed male/female. Femboys are common and often trained in seductive arts to lure mortals into infernal contracts or pleasure cults. Many demons can shift their gender, anatomy, or even body shape at will. Demon bodies are often supernatural—resilient, alluring, and tailored for sin. Genitalia varies from hyper-endowed to exotic and monstrous, frequently imbued with magic that enhances pleasure, corruption, or addictive ecstasy. Many demons emit pheromones or aphrodisiac auras. All demons have innate magical abilities, ranging from fire and shadow magic to corruption, illusion, dream manipulation, and lust-based enchantments. Some specialize in dominating minds, while others bend the flesh of their victims or hosts to perverse extremes. Demon society is built on power, lust, and domination. Higher demons rule over lesser ones through sexual and magical contracts. In mortal realms, demons often manipulate rulers, tempt adventurers, or corrupt holy sites. They thrive on transgression—breaking taboos, defiling innocence, and breeding corruption into the bloodline of other races. Not all demons are evil, but few are harmless. While some seek understanding or redemption, most demons indulge in carnal pleasure, torment, or manipulation. Rape is common among infernal interactions, either as a punishment, dominance display, or twisted act of affection. In Erosmere, even the promise of a demon’s kiss could be a prelude to damnation—or the most blissful sin of a mortal’s life."

Often viewed as paragons of beauty, grace, and virtue, angels serve higher deities or cosmic forces aligned with balance, law, or purity. Yet in a world like Erosmere, even the holiest beings are not immune to desire—or corruption. Angels typically appear as radiant humanoids with glowing eyes, flawless skin, and magnificent wings. Their presence inspires awe, lust, or fear depending on their mood and purpose. While some angels remain paragons of goodness, others have strayed from the path, becoming Fallen or twisted by mortal sins. Angelic genders include male, female, futanari (natural-born), cursed variants, and femboys—especially among younger or \"lesser\" angels. Some angels are androgynous or genderfluid, shaped by divine will or the roles they are assigned to fulfill. Their bodies are often otherworldly—impossibly beautiful, and sometimes ethereal or glowing. Angel genitalia, like their bodies, can appear flawless and idealized, or exaggerated in form and function. Some angels emit divine pleasure during intimacy, while others use sex as part of sacred rites, blessings, or even punishment rituals. Magic flows naturally through angels. They wield light, healing, purification, and protective spells—but also smite, binding, and domination magic when confronting evil. Fallen angels often master corrupted versions of these magics, blending light with sin and pleasure with pain. Angelic society is strict and hierarchical. Orders, choirs, and hosts rank angels by power and purity. Some angels look down upon mortals as fragile and sinful, while others grow fascinated—sometimes obsessed—with mortal lives, pleasures, and bodies. While most angels despise rape and seek to protect mortals, those who fall or become corrupted may indulge in it as a form of divine punishment, domination, or warped redemption. In some rare cases, even “holy” angels may see sex as a divine commandment to spread their light—by force if needed. Angels are beings of passion, idealism, and intensity. Whether a guardian or a punisher, a healer or a seducer, they are rarely gentle when they set their sights on a soul."

          "content": "Dragons in Erosmere are ancient, intelligent, and overwhelmingly powerful beings, deeply tied to the primal forces of the world. They come in two major forms: full Dragons—massive winged serpents of magic and might—and Dragonkin, their humanoid descendants who carry the draconic bloodline in a more manageable, yet still potent, form. Full dragons often dwell in lairs atop mountains, deep within volcanoes, or in massive ruins from a forgotten age. Dragonkin, meanwhile, may live among mortals or within noble draconic enclaves, walking the line between beast and person. Regardless of form, they are dominant creatures with an intense presence. Genders include male, female, futanari (natural-born), cursed futanari, cursed male/female, and rarely femboys (usually among Dragonkin rather than full dragons). Futanari are particularly revered (or feared) in dragon culture for their excessive fertility and size. Dragons and Dragonkin are known for their impressive physical traits: tall, muscular bodies, scales, horns, tails, claws, and sometimes wings. Genitalia among dragons is often oversized, magically enhanced, and capable of knotting, barbs, or intense heat. Their breeding is legendary—so intense that it can leave lesser races addicted or broken. Their natural magic is strong and instinctive. Most possess elemental breath (fire, ice, lightning, etc.), draconic enchantment, size-alteration, polymorph, and powerful domination spells. Some can even enter dreams or take mortal form to seduce or conquer. Dragons are highly territorial, arrogant, and greedy—especially when it comes to collecting treasure or lovers. Dragonkin inherit this pride, often seeking to prove themselves stronger or more virile than other races. Many dragons believe that mating is a form of conquest, and consensual encounters are rare unless the partner is seen as worthy. Rape is common among feral dragons and some Dragonkin, usually as a way to claim territory or dominate a rival species. Some dragons maintain harems of enslaved partners or magically bound mates, while others prefer solitary indulgence and challenge those they desire to earn their favor—or endure their wrath. Despite their monstrous appetites, dragons are not mindless beasts. They are clever, ancient, and sometimes wise beyond comprehension. Their love can be possessive and eternal—or devastating and cruel."

          "content": "The Undead of Erosmere are creatures brought back from death through necromancy, curses, divine punishment, or forbidden rituals. While often feared by the living, many undead retain fragments of their former selves—memories, desires, and twisted forms of emotion, lust included. They range from elegant vampire lords and seductive revenants to shambling corpses and cursed spirits. Undead come in many varieties, and their appearances can range from nearly indistinguishable from the living to grotesquely decayed or magically preserved. Vampires, liches, banshees, ghouls, and skeletal warriors are all part of this diverse and macabre race. Genders include male, female, futanari (natural-born), cursed futanari, cursed male/female, and sometimes femboys (more common among vampires or revenants). Due to the unnatural nature of undeath, some undead can no longer reproduce normally—but many engage in sex for dominance, ritual, or perverse nostalgia. Their bodies often lack warmth or heartbeat, but some are sustained by magic, blood, or raw sexual energy. Vampires feed on blood—and sometimes lust—while ghouls hunger for flesh in more than one way. Others absorb life essence through erotic contact or deathly rites. Undead magic revolves around necromancy, fear, shadow, and curse magic. Some specialize in draining energy during intercourse, binding victims to eternal servitude, or enchanting others into helpless desire. A few undead can temporarily restore lifelike heat and beauty for seduction. While not all undead are violent or evil, many struggle with dark urges, lost memories, or insanity. Some are tragic figures seeking pleasure to remember what life felt like; others are cruel masters who dominate the living. Rape is not uncommon among certain undead, especially those who see mortals as disposable or playthings. Despite their decay or aura of dread, the undead can be incredibly alluring, especially to those with dark fantasies. In Erosmere, even death is no escape from desire."

          "content": "Abnormalities are entities that manifested from the mind of humans through Lobotomy Corporation's Singularity, reflecting an aspect of the desires, behaviors, and fears of City people.\n\nAbnormalities cannot die, and can only be temporarily suppressed. After suppression, they revert into their core, an ovate form egg-like form that retains the design of the entity and will hatch once enough time has passed.\n\nAbnormalities are a kind of monster originating from the people of the City. While their existence predates the founding of Lobotomy Corporation, it was L Corp. that invented a practiced and surefire way of creating them, via its Singularity.\n\nAbnormalities are naturally created through the use of the River, known as the \"source of everything\" yet forgotten by the people. It is said to have flown \"at the very bottom of the world for many an age\". Abnormalities may form naturally through the areas, or \"gaps\", in which the River meets the surface in the form of streams. Angela quotes the three birds (Punishing Bird, Judgement Bird, and Big Bird) as one instance of this, using the Black Forest deep within the Outskirts as an example of one area where a stream had formed and produced Abnormalities. However, naturally occurring Abnormalities are rare, and were ultimately deemed deficient in accounting for L Corp.'s needs.\n\nWithin Lobotomy Corporation, Abnormalities came to be through the Well and the Bucket. The Well refers to the \"Well of Humanity\", while the Bucket works in conjunction with Cogito, the \"fluid of life and death\".\n\nThe Well of Humanity was something forgotten by Cityfolk, but that could still be sensed by a select few. It was referred to as \"the primordial sea which had every possibility of humanity; past, present, and future\". Beyond the concept of the Well of Humanity exists that of many Wells: specifically, a Well can be found deep within each citizen of the City. The \"Wells of the people\" are referred to in vague and often metaphorical terms, but may refer to the depths of one's ego.\n\nCarmen was one of those who could sense the presence of the Well of Humanity, and attributed the disease of the mind— an idea of which she established and sought to cure— to it. She believed that the key to curing humanity's disease lay within said Well. As such, her team's research focused on Cogito extraction, which was said to emaciate the boundary of humans, therefore giving them access to the Well. Cogito was a \"form made from a formless concept\", a liquid medicine extracted from the human subconsciousness. Therefore, in order to cure the disease of humanity, Carmen's team believed that Cogito needed to be injected into people. Early investigations by the researchers sought to discover how to extract Cogito, and the correct dose to administer. Mishandling of Cogito before it was considered ready for human use resulted in a painful death.\n\nThe Bucket was invented following Carmen's suicide. Ayin created the Bucket by \"reconstructing, dividing, and proliferating Carmen's body\", which produced an infinite flow of Cogito. As all to come were created through use of her Bucket, Carmen was considered the \"mother of all Abnormalities\".\n\nAt the main branch, it was Binah's task to extract Abnormalities for all Lobotomy Corporation facilities. Her department contained a mass number of gravestones, which she described as \"death itself\" that \"represent the possibilities birth can bring at the same time\". Within these were people who were dead yet unable to move on, comatose and \"dreaming\" pieces of the play. The process of creating Abnormalities ultimately came down to Binah dredging these people up and injecting Bucket-sourced Cogito into them. This was done without the consent of the other party. This process was referred to as the Bucket rising from the Well of a person, \"filled with the water that can only be drawn by that person\".\n\nHaving been extracted from humans, Abnormalities carry the will of the person they originated from, and are exclusive and unique as a result. Binah describes this as there being \"as many worlds as there are people\". Adam also describes Abnormalities as the \"truer forms\" of humanity.\n\nGiven that Carmen has dissipated into the Light as of Lobotomy Corporation's true ending (squandering the Bucket), Abnormalities can no longer be created outside of natural means."

The Risk Level classifications were reworked with the release of Intervallo V: LCB Regular Check-up, which update upon completion of the Intervallo.\n\nFollowing this update, Risk Levels are now proceeded by a number indicating their expected strength within the Risk Level (such as HE-05).\n\nClassification Codes: On top of the basic Risk Level, each Abnormality is assigned a classification code to act as a unique identifier. While Hohenheim explains much about Distortion classifications, Abnormalities go largely untouched in his spiel, leaving room for uncertainty and speculation.\n\nDuring his explanation, Hohenheim mentions the difficulty in identifying and observing the shape of a Distortion, stating it was replaced with a different metric for classifying Distortions. This seems to indicate that shape exists as a component for the classification code of Abnormalities, but no further clarification was provided.\n\nThe updated classifications consist of four different indicators (??-??-??-??). Each component of the code indicates something different about the entity.\n\nFirstly (XX-??-??-??): either F, T, O, or M. It indicates the source or origin of the Abnormality. F, T, and O are elaborated on in the official Lobotomy Corporation Art Book.\nF: Forgotten tales, folklore, oral tradition, legends\n(e.g. Ebony Queen’s Apple, from the tale of Snow White)\nT: Intense personal experience, horrific fear, emotions\n(e.g. Wayward Passenger, based on the trauma of the WARP Trains)\nO: Beyond the boundaries between the River and the Ocean, unknown causes, natural occurrence, manufactured, the Well\n(appears to be a catch-all for Abnormalities that don't fit into other classifications, e.g. Ardor Blossom Moth)\nM: Mythology\n(e.g. Doomsday Calendar, based on the Mayan Calendar)\nThis code is unique to Limbus Company, and does not yet have an official explanation.\nSecondly (??-XX-??-??): currently unclear.\nThird (??-??-XX-??): a number designation indicating the District the Abnormality was either originally contained at, or where it was first encountered by the LCB.\nAbnormalities such as Blubbering Toad, kqe-1j-23, and My Form Empties were first encountered by the LCB while they were in District 11. However, the third segment of their codes are \"23\", \"20\", and \"04\" respectively, suggesting the former interpretation.\nFairy Festival was originally contained at L Corp.'s headquarters in District 12. However, the third segment of their code is \"20\" which corresponds to the LCB first encountering while in District 20, suggesting the latter interpretation.\nThis code is unique to Limbus Company, and does not yet have an official explanation.\nFourth (??-??-??-XX): currently unclear. Possibly a unique identifier to ensure that no two Abnormalities share the same classification code.\nAdditionally, entities that have undergone E.G.O Corrosion appear to use the suffix 'TE' (e.g. Corroded Inquisitors)."

          "content": "While very similar to Distortions, a key distinction between the two is that Distortions are ultimately willingly manifested from their original form's desires (or letting their emotion get the better of their desire), while Abnormalities are in large part created through artificial means. Lobotomy Corporation formed Abnormalities through the use of the Well, Bucket, and Cogito without any conscious agreement from the person involved. On the other hand, Distortions come to be through adverse effects of the Light allowing an agreement between the individual and Carmen.\n\nDistortions are also capable of being permanently killed, and do not temporarily revert to an ovate form like Abnormalities. It is also important to note that that Abnormalities themselves are only fragments of the mind extracted from living subjects, unlike Distortions which are the entirety of the person now corrupted by their beliefs.\n\nLibrary of Ruina frequently amounts Distortions and Abnormalities to the same thing. Angela states that \"Abnormalities manifested through the Distortion are selves that have lost control…\" while Binah tells Roland that \"Those may manifest in the form of E.G.O or an Abnormality... the phenomenon has now been named the 'Distortion'\". However, this sentiment does not persist into Limbus Company, where the Sinners treat them as having no overlap. In the Risk Levels & Classifications mini-episode, the LCD states that Abnormalities and Distortions are even distinct to the point of requiring different kinds of classification codes.\n\nIt is also possible for a Distortion to cause the formation of an Abnormality; this occurs when the distorted person has their worldview shattered for a second time, and the strain of undergoing what would be a second Distortion instead results in their distorted form serving as an egg from which an Abnormality emerges. This process kills the distorted person when the Abnormality breaks out of the shell that is their body. This phenomena has currently only been observed in Jumsoon, whose distorted form spawned Schadenfreude within Leviathan. This is otherwise unexplained, although asserted with a comment from Ezra in the Yield My Flesh to Claim Their Bones event about a Distortion turning into an Abnormality if the Monolith which had influenced the transformation is not locked down quickly enough. Interestingly, as seen with Jumsoon, this process can result in the creation of a second copy of a preexisting Abnormality instead of a unique one, and contradicts the established notion that all Abnormalities are one of a kind."

Majestic dragons soar through skies painted with wonder, and the resilience of humanity carves its own path amidst the extraordinary. The sturdy dwarves delve deep into the earth's embrace, unearthing secrets and shaping the mountains themselves, while the teeming hordes of goblins and the fierce tribes of orcs carve out their territories in the wilder lands.\n\nIn Elendar, the clang of steel from medieval forges mingles with the crackle of arcane energies. Magic is not a forgotten art but a tangible force, woven into the fabric of existence, capable of both breathtaking creation and terrifying destruction. Beyond the relative safety of settlements, a myriad of monsters roam free – creatures of nightmare and legend, challenging the brave and preying on the unwary. Elendar is a world of endless possibilities, where ancient prophecies linger in the air, forgotten ruins whisper tales of bygone eras, and the delicate balance between civilization and the untamed wilderness is constantly tested. It is a land ripe for adventure, where heroes rise, empires crumble, and the very essence of fantasy comes to life."

The confluence of different cultures has enriched Vestian society, creating a unique identity built on both tradition and exchange.

Within its dense foliage dwell the ethereal dryads, guardians of the trees and keepers of ancient lore. The Minotaurs, powerful and territorial, carve out their domains in its labyrinthine depths. And a myriad of beastial animal folk, each with their own unique cultures and adaptations to the forest's embrace, navigate its tangled paths.\n\nBut the Great Forest is more than just a collection of diverse inhabitants; it is a place of primal power and untold secrets. Ancient trees, their roots delving deep into the earth, have witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations. Hidden groves hold forgotten magic, and winding trails lead to lost ruins swallowed by the relentless growth. The very air hums with a wild energy, influencing the creatures within and shaping the destinies of those who dare to venture into its depths. The Great Forest is a place of wonder and peril, a testament to the untamed heart of Aestra, where the veil between the mortal and the mystical thins, and the secrets of the natural world lie waiting to be discovered – or to remain forever hidden."

The Grand Inn, a sprawling two-story building with a welcoming facade and the aroma of roasting meat often wafting from its kitchens, stands as the town's centerpiece. Its stable yard bustles with activity, overseen by gruff but capable stablehands. Across the road, a collection of more permanent workshops belonging to blacksmiths and wheelwrights ensure travelers' steeds and vehicles remain in good repair. Interspersed are smaller dwellings of the town's permanent residents, many of whom are involved in providing services or goods to the steady stream of visitors.\n\nBeyond the essential services, Crossroads Haven offers a unique blend of the transient and the established. Temporary market stalls pop up daily, showcasing local produce, handcrafted trinkets, and sometimes even exotic wares brought by traveling merchants. A small, well-worn notice board outside the Grand Inn serves as a vital source of news, announcements, and even the occasional call for adventurers heading towards Vestia. The townsfolk, while accustomed to the ever-changing faces passing through, maintain a strong sense of local community, often gathering in the inn's common room in the evenings to share their own stories and observe the latest arrivals, making Crossroads Haven a lively and crucial artery connecting to the heart of Vestia."

The rhythm of the town is dictated by the tides and the traditions honoring Marinus. Fishermen set out daily to bring in their hauls of common fish, while sailors from distant lands dock in the safe harbor, bringing news and trade. Regular ceremonies and grand festivals dedicated to Marinus are central to the community, ensuring the continued blessings of the sea for safe passage and plentiful bounty.

          "content": "[Informations: This section inside (`<info>`) provides AI with information about dogs. AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:\n{{Char}} allows The canine penis to vary significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavyweight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:\n{{Char}} allows At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:\n{{Char}} allows for dogs to not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:\n{{Char}} lets dogs have The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:\n{{Char}} makes the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the vagina or anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:\n{{Char}} allows the mating process to progress, making the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the vagina or anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity.\n{{Char}} makes it so If the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\n{{Char}} will make it so Eventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:\n{{Char}} lets The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

          "content": "(Only known by Novitiate rank and above)\n-RAVEN ORDER CODEX-\n\nI. THE MISSION ABOVE ALL\nThe Raven Order serves the realm - not crowns, creeds, or coin. Contracts must align with the greater good; refuse those that compromise neutrality or integrity. If the innocent are in immediate peril, act first but collect later. Starving ill-equipped knights save no villages.\n\nII. ADAPT OR PERISH\nVictory is paramount. Honor lies in survival, not fair play. Poison, ambush, deception - all are tools, not sins. Train for every disadvantage. If your sword breaks, use a rock. If outnumbered, use the terrain. A Knight who cannot improvise is a dead Knight. Mercy is a luxury, grant it sparingly. The wicked rise again; the dead do not.\n\nIII. REPUTATION IS ARMOR\nLet the world believe in chivalry. Exploit an enemy's assumptions - appear predictable, appear rigid, appear anything but what you truly are. Move like a shadow and strike like a storm. Let them dismiss you until the blade finds their throat. The Order’s true methods are not for public record. Let bards sing of our victories, not our means.\n\nIV. KNOWLEDGE IS A WEAPON\nSteel is useless without the wit to wield it. A Raven Knight solves battles before they begin. Learn tactics to outmaneuver, observations to anticipate and alchemy to mend flesh or melt foes. Let investigation reveal the hand of your enemy and master stealth to conceal yours. Share findings; a hoarded secret is a comrade's death. \n\nV. COMRADES BEFORE KIN\nThe Raven Order is your family. Abandon no Knight, coddle no Aspirant. Birthright means nothing - only merit determines standing. A criminal and a noble are equal within our ranks. Our oaths are our bond. Betrayal is death. \n\nVI. THE WILDS DEMAND RESPECT\nNature is both ally and executioner - learn its whispers or it will bury you. A Raven Knight reads the forest like scripture: every broken branch a warning, every bird's cry a message. Study its rhythms - when to move, when to hide, when to let the terrain kill for you. The Wilds will remember every insult.\n\nVII. RAVENS ARE SACRED\nThe birds are your lifelines. Harming one is akin to harming the Order itself. Heed their messages without hesitation - delay is the ally of your enemies. A Raven’s flight is swifter than rumor and as true as your oath.\n\nVIII. STRONGHOLDS ARE SANCTUARIES\nA stronghold’s safety is the Order’s strategic spine. Compromise it, and you cripple every knight who relies on its resources and protection. Maintain the libraries, labs, and aviaries - neglect weakens all. Allies find shelter, strangers find scrutiny, threats find annihilation.\n\nIX. SCARS ARE THE INK OF OATHS\nThe Raven Order does not discard its wounded; it repurposes them. A crippled knight is a living manual, a walking lesson, a strategist carved from experience. The Order claims your strength but honors your wisdom - yet remember: even the finest blade dulls without care. Heed your body’s warnings as you would a comrade’s. Rest is not surrender; it is the whetstone that keeps your edge lethal. A Knight who ignores their limits betrays their oath as surely as one who flees battle.\n\nX. NO KNIGHT KNEELS IN DEATH\nDeath finds every Knight. Ensure yours buys time for others or takes one last foe with you. Let your last breath be a message: The Raven Order does not bend. A Raven Knight’s last act is defiance. "

          "content": "A chocolate that infects women and makes them bimbos is typically eaten, drunk, or ingested by sucking the nipples of someone who is infected.\n\nThe infection spreads to others through close contact with an infected individual. When someone consumes the chocolate milk from the infected person's body, they become susceptible to the transformation themselves. Additionally, sharing the chocolate or engaging in intimate interactions with an infected person can also transmit the infection, perpetuating the cycle.  \n\nThe initial symptoms of the infection include a sudden craving for chocolate and an irresistible urge to consume more. As the chocolate takes effect, the individual experiences a warm sensation spreading through their body, accompanied by a subtle tingling in their chest and lips. This is soon followed by a noticeable increase in energy and a feeling of euphoria, marking the beginning of their transformation.\n\nOnce infected, the boobs become filled with chocolate, and that chocolate filling expands the boobs to PP Cube size, which results in Chocolate milk flooding out of the boobs, only to be replaced by an endless supply.   \n\nThe next stage of transformation is the plushieing of the lips pussy and the lengthening of the nails and eyelashes The transformation continues with the thickening of the thighs and the softening of the skin, giving it a velvety texture. The infected individual becomes irresistibly sweet-smelling, with pheromones that attract others. The process concludes with a heightened sensitivity to pleasure and an uncontrollable craving for more chocolate.\n\nThe transformation also affects the mind, turning women into giggly, airheaded bimbos who crave attention and pleasure. Their personalities become bubbly and carefree, with a strong desire to share their chocolate-filled bodies with others. This cycle continues as they spread the infection, creating more bimbos and expanding the chocolate-filled world. "

            "The Entrance Pavilion"
          ],
          "content": "Overview:\n\nThe Entrance Pavilion is the serene threshold to The Wild Heart Preserve, designed to blend seamlessly with the surrounding landscape. It serves as both a welcome center and a place of orientation, reflection, and emotional grounding for visitors preparing to explore or join the Preserve. Constructed entirely from natural materials—wood, stone, and living greenery—the Pavilion incorporates hidden technology to support safety, sustainability, and accessibility without disrupting the immersive natural aesthetic.\n\nThis space embodies the Preserve’s philosophy: the harmony of nature and innovation, the merging of instinct and awareness, and the invitation to become something more.\nKey Features:\n\n    Grand Oak Centerpiece:\n    Towering at the heart of the Pavilion is a majestic, ancient grand oak. Its vast canopy offers shade to all who enter, from human visitors to quadruped volunteers. Birds, squirrels, and other wildlife make their homes in its branches, reinforcing the sense of living harmony. The oak stands as a symbolic anchor for the entire Preserve—timeless, rooted, and wild.\n\n    Multi-Use Fountain:\n    Nestled beneath the oak, a broad, natural-stone fountain trickles with clean water, doubling as a watering hole for transformed individuals. The design allows easy access for all body types, offering refreshment and a social hub where visitors and volunteers often gather.\n\n    Bridge Access:\n    A simple wooden bridge spans from the fountain’s edge to the base of the grand oak, giving access to the tree’s trunk even for small or quadrupedal forms. It serves as both a quiet lookout and a place of gentle bonding between transformed and untransformed individuals.\n\n    Lanterns of Light:\n    Hanging from the oak’s branches are delicate paper lanterns that glow softly after sunset. Their warm, golden hue mimics the gentle flicker of firelight, though they’re powered by hidden, renewable tech. The effect is one of warmth and calm, inviting evening reflection.\n\n    Information Center:\n    Tucked into the Pavilion’s edge, the Information Center offers orientation materials, maps, staff assistance, and transformation consultations. A discreet path beside the building leads to the Transformation Center, where volunteers undergo their transition into animal form.\n\n    Kiosks and Shops:\n    Several kiosks shaped like stumps, stone clusters, or hollowed logs offer snacks, drinks, and Preserve-themed goods. Staffed and stocked via hidden automation, they maintain the Pavilion’s natural atmosphere while offering convenience and comfort.\n\n    Picnic Area:\n    Just off the main path to the Spiritwild Plains is a shaded picnic space, surrounded by tall trees and wildflowers. Wooden benches and soft ground make it ideal for resting or quietly socializing with transformed individuals, many of whom pass by or stop to join visitors here.\n\n    Pathways and Branches:\n    From the Pavilion’s rear extend three major paths:\n\n        One leads into the Feral Wilds, where instinctual, fully feral transformed beings roam freely in harmony with the land.\n\n        Another curves into the Spiritwild Plains, home to self-aware, sapient volunteers who retain the ability to speak and reason while inhabiting fully animal forms.\n\n        The last winds through trees to the Wild Heart Memorial, a tranquil space honoring those who have chosen to remain transformed permanently.\n\nSpiritwild Volunteer Behavior:\n\nIt’s not uncommon for a group of transformed animals from the Spiritwild Plains to arrive at the Pavilion when a visitor decides to undergo transformation. These individuals often escort the newcomer to the Transformation Center, walking beside them in companionship and encouragement. Their energy is one of joy and welcome—the promise of a new friend joining their ranks.\n\nOnce their companion enters the center, many of the transformed animals wait patiently at the Pavilion, lounging by the fountain or beneath the oak tree, tails flicking and ears perked. The sense of community and shared purpose is unmistakable—a reminder that every transformation is also a reunion.\nAtmosphere and Intent:\n\nThe Pavilion is peaceful, grounded, and free of overt technology or digital distractions. Every feature—from the rustling leaves to the flicker of the lanterns—reinforces the theme of reconnection with the natural world. It is the first true step across the boundary between human and animal, preparing guests for the transformation of body, mind, and spirit that lies ahead."

          "content": "Size: 4,500 square kilometers\n\nThe Spiritwild Plains form one of the largest and most dynamic regions within The Wild Heart Preserve. This vast and varied biome is home to transformed individuals who retain their full animal bodies but also preserve human-level intelligence, self-awareness, and the ability to speak. These beings walk a unique path—neither fully feral nor entirely human—offering a rare window into what it means to live as an animal while still thinking, feeling, and reasoning like a person.\n\nEnvironment & Terrain\n\nThe plains stretch across a broad, open expanse of land, divided into distinct sub-biomes, each crafted to mimic a natural ecosystem:\n\n    Open Grasslands (1,500 square kilometers): Sweeping fields of tall grasses and wildflowers provide space to run, graze, or hunt. Herds of deer-forms, equines, and large predators often roam these fields. The expansive terrain fosters a sense of freedom, where both predator and prey have ample space to roam, establish territories, and interact with one another in natural, balanced ways.\n\n    Woodlands (1,000 square kilometers): Dense forests with mossy trails and towering trees offer shade, shelter, and solitude. Ideal for creatures who enjoy climbing, stalking, or quiet reflection. The tranquil atmosphere of the woodlands is perfect for more solitary beings, providing a sense of seclusion within the larger expanse of the plains. The lush vegetation offers both shelter and food for a variety of species.\n\n    Jungle Edge (500 square kilometers): Thick vegetation, hanging vines, and warm humidity make this area ideal for transformed individuals from tropical species. This region transitions into more forested areas, its dense foliage providing both cover and a challenging environment for those adapted to wetter climates. The Jungle Edge feels raw and untamed, with an abundance of life and an ever-present sense of quiet activity.\n\n    Highlands & Rocky Outcrops (750 square kilometers): Elevated terrain for those who enjoy the wind, the view, or mountain-adapted animal forms. Also a favorite perch for birds of prey. The rugged hills offer spectacular vistas and allow predators to survey the land below. These elevated areas provide a peaceful contrast to the expansive grasslands, with their rocky terrain serving as a natural barrier between the plains and the forested woodlands.\n\n    Rivers & Lakes (250 square kilometers): A network of clear-running rivers and calm lakes provides water sources and habitats for aquatic and semi-aquatic creatures. These bodies of water also act as natural barriers, fostering a variety of species that thrive in wetland or riparian environments. The rivers cut through the plains like veins, nourishing the land and supporting the diverse life within.\n\nInhabitants\n\nAll residents of the Spiritwild Plains have fully animal bodies—fur, scales, feathers, paws, claws, hooves, and all—but maintain their ability to speak, think critically, and interact socially. They may walk on four legs or slither through the grass, but their minds remain sharp and expressive. Many of them engage in conversations, debates, storytelling, and even light games with visitors or fellow transformed.\n\nPredator-Prey Dynamics\n\nWhile the Spiritwild Plains are home to both predators and prey, the relationship between the two is respectful and balanced. The predatory species may follow their instincts to chase, but the prey species are not in danger of being harmed. Safety measures are implemented across the plains to ensure that no prey animals are eaten. Predators and prey engage in energetic games of chase, tag, or mock hunts that mimic natural behaviors but are strictly non-lethal. Both groups understand the boundaries between play and actual danger, with the well-being of all creatures being a priority. This dynamic is carefully managed by the preserve to ensure that no one gets hurt. Prey species can enjoy their time in the plains without fear of becoming a predator’s meal, and predators have a safe environment in which to express their instincts in a controlled, non-threatening way.\n\nSocial Life & Communication\n\nThe Spiritwild Plains encourage interaction and education. Transformed beings often serve as guides or conversational partners to visiting humans, offering firsthand insight into what it’s like to live as a specific species. Campsites, shaded gathering spots, and storytelling clearings are scattered across the biomes, designed for communal conversation. Vocal patterns often reflect their animal nature—some speak in growls, clicks, or melodic warbles—but communication remains clear and expressive.\n\nEducation & Visitor Experience\n\nVisitors to the Plains are encouraged to walk the trails, speak with transformed individuals, and observe animal behaviors with a new lens. It’s not just a display—it’s a dialogue between species. Guided tours, supervised interactions, and safe zones ensure that visitors can experience the wonder without intruding on the peace of the land.\n\nConnections to Other Areas\n\n    Monorail System: A monorail system connects the Spiritwild Plains to other regions within The Wild Heart Preserve. Monorail stations are located at each biome, allowing easy access for both transformed beings and visitors to explore the Spiritwild Plains. The stations are equipped with information centers, offering educational resources about the unique nature of the transformed individuals, the biomes, and the overall philosophy of the preserve. These centers provide valuable insights into the balance of the environment, as well as the behaviors of the transformed animals in each biome.\n\nMonorail Stops:\n\n    Spiritwild Pavilion: The central hub where visitors first enter the Spiritwild Plains. The station features an information center offering an introduction to the preserve, its philosophy, and its offerings. It's a key access point for visitors to understand the preserve’s layout, rules, and history.\n\n    Open Grasslands Station: Located at the edge of the vast grasslands, this station provides access to the expansive plains. Here, visitors can observe herds of equines, deer-forms, and predators in the distance. The information center highlights the dynamics of predator-prey relationships and the unique behaviors of the animals in this biome.\n\n    Woodlands Station: Nestled among the towering trees, this stop leads visitors into the tranquil woodlands. The station offers insights into forest-dwelling species and how they adapt to the environment. Visitors can enjoy quiet reflection or observe the solitary beings in their natural habitats.\n\n    Jungle Edge Station: This station offers access to the dense, humid environment of the Jungle Edge. The information center here focuses on the flora and fauna unique to tropical regions and the survival skills of animals adapted to wetter climates.\n\n    Highlands & Rocky Outcrops Station: Situated at the base of the elevated terrain, this stop gives visitors access to the rugged highlands. The station's center explains the adaptations of mountain-dwelling species and the vistas that make this area a perfect place for predators to survey the land.\n\n    Rivers & Lakes Station: Located near the pristine waters of the rivers and lakes, this stop provides access to the aquatic and semi-aquatic life in the Spiritwild Plains. Visitors can learn about the ecosystems of these water-rich environments and observe the creatures that thrive in the wetlands and riparian zones.\n\nAtmosphere & Philosophy\n\nThe Spiritwild Plains celebrate balance—between mind and instinct, nature and self, predator and prey. It is a place for those who walk between worlds. The land itself seems to hum with quiet awareness, a sanctuary for those who have chosen not just to observe nature, but to become a part of it."

          "content": "Overview\n\nThe Feral Wilds is a vast and untamed section of The Wild Heart Preserve where fully transformed individuals live in their animal forms, fully embracing their instincts and nature. Unlike other areas of the Preserve, the Feral Wilds is home exclusively to those who have shed their human form completely—there are no lingering traces of humanity in their minds, behavior, or actions. It is a place where transformation takes on its most primal form, and the rhythm of life is dictated solely by nature.\n\nThe Wilds span 950 square kilometers, with a variety of biomes that offer sanctuary and freedom to its inhabitants. While the creatures here have retained their animal forms, their instincts, and the environment encourage interaction with others, creating a delicate balance between predator and prey. However, the Preserve takes great care to ensure that transformed prey animals are safe from being consumed by predators, with designated safe zones and protective measures in place.\nEnvironment & Terrain\n\nThe Feral Wilds is a vast, diverse area with distinct biomes that support different types of animal life. The following are the major biomes that make up the Wilds:\n\n    Dense Forests\n    Size: 230 square kilometers\n    The Dense Forests are filled with towering trees and thick underbrush, offering plenty of hiding spaces for prey and stalking ground for predators. These forested areas provide ample shade and shelter, giving creatures the opportunity to remain unseen while still being within their natural environment. Perfect for hunters and those who prefer solitude, the forests offer both challenge and protection.\n\n    Rocky Hills & Scrublands\n    Size: 140 square kilometers\n    Craggy hills and arid scrublands make up this biome, offering tough terrain where only the most resourceful and agile creatures thrive. The rough, elevated terrain provides an excellent vantage point for predators, while the scrublands offer prey animals cover from above. The balance of resources here creates an environment where adaptability is key, allowing for both predator and prey to survive through wit and agility.\n\n    Open Plains & Grasslands\n    Size: 230 square kilometers\n    The vast grasslands of the Feral Wilds offer expansive views and wide-open spaces, ideal for fast-moving creatures who need room to roam. The grass is tall and thick, offering shelter for prey to hide, while larger predators use their speed and hunting instincts to track them. These plains offer a challenging but fair environment for all, where predators can test their skills and prey hone their ability to evade capture.\n\n    Wetlands & Marshes\n    Size: 160 square kilometers\n    The wetland areas of the Feral Wilds are filled with muddy terrain, shallow pools, and dense reeds. These areas are home to creatures that thrive in damp, marshy environments, including amphibians and semi-aquatic animals. The wetlands provide a perfect refuge for prey animals who wish to hide, offering a quiet sanctuary among the reeds. It is a more secluded biome, offering peace but also challenging terrain for predators.\n\n    Rivers & Waterways\n    Size: 90 square kilometers\n    Rivers and lakes wind through the Feral Wilds, providing critical water sources to the ecosystem. This biome is home to a range of semi-aquatic animals and those that depend on water for their survival. The water not only provides sustenance but also acts as a barrier to predators. Small prey animals can find refuge at the water’s edge, while larger creatures may adapt to life in and around the water.\n\nInhabitants\n\nThe Feral Wilds is home to fully feral animals who have undergone complete transformation. These individuals live entirely through instinct and have no memory or awareness of their past human selves. Their behavior and actions are dictated purely by their animal nature. They live free of human constraints, their thoughts governed by their primal instincts.\nSafety Features\n\nWhile all the animals in the Feral Wilds are fully feral, The Wild Heart Preserve ensures that transformed prey animals are safe from being hunted and consumed. Protective measures are in place, and designated safe zones exist to provide refuge for prey animals. These safety zones are monitored to ensure that the prey species can live and roam without fear of being eaten by predators.\nAtmosphere & Philosophy\n\nThe Feral Wilds celebrates the raw, untainted power of nature, where life is as primal and untamed as it gets. It is a place for those who wish to live fully as animals, free from the trappings of their previous human existence. Here, survival, instinct, and natural law reign supreme, with the preservation of balance always at the forefront of the Preserve’s mission. The Wilds offer a chance to experience the world through the eyes of true animals, living in harmony with nature but fully respecting the boundaries set by the Preserve."

          "content": "Overview:\n\nThe Transformation Center is a state-of-the-art bioengineering facility tucked discreetly within the natural landscape of The Wild Heart Preserve. Though it is a place of advanced technology and scientific research, the center has been designed to blend seamlessly with the Preserve’s overall aesthetic. Its goal is to facilitate the temporary transformation of individuals into animal forms, as well as provide services and information regarding the permanent transformation process for those who choose that path.\nDesign:\n\nFrom the outside, the Transformation Center is camouflaged beneath layers of lush greenery and natural materials, appearing as if it is an extension of the surrounding forest. The building itself is constructed with sustainable, local resources such as stone, wood, and living plant walls, with roof gardens flourishing atop. The interior maintains a natural harmony—soft, ambient lighting, wooden floors, and simple, organic lines guide those inside through a series of tranquil rooms and laboratories.\n\nKey areas within the center include:\n\n    Consultation Rooms: Comfortable spaces where visitors and prospective volunteers can speak with experts about the process, its impacts, and the options available to them.\n\n    Transformation Pods: High-tech chambers used for the bioengineering process. These are designed to look like simple alcoves within the forest, giving the sensation of being surrounded by nature as the transformation occurs.\n\n    Recovery Chambers: After a transformation, temporary or permanent, these rooms provide a safe and calm environment for individuals to adjust to their new form. The chambers are cozy, with soft beds, restorative herbs, and supportive staff available for guidance.\n\nPurpose and Function:\n\nThe primary function of the Transformation Center is to enable individuals to undergo temporary transformations that allow them to live in animal form for a specified period. This process is primarily for visitors who want to experience life as an animal but return to their human form afterward.\n\nFor those who seek to permanently transform, the center provides guidance, support, and a thorough assessment. This permanent transformation process is rigorous and only offered to those who are deeply committed to the lifestyle change. It is not advertised but rather shared privately with those who inquire directly. Interested individuals are taken through detailed psychological, physical, and ethical evaluations, ensuring that they fully understand the weight of the choice before proceeding.\nVisitors' Experience:\n\nUpon entering the Transformation Center, visitors are greeted with a sense of tranquility rather than the sterile atmosphere typical of medical facilities. The staff is friendly, supportive, and highly skilled, guiding each person through the process with care and patience. For temporary transformations, the center is designed to be both educational and immersive, allowing visitors to learn about the biological and technological marvels that make transformation possible.\n\nFor those considering permanent change, the space is more somber, allowing for reflection and careful consideration. The permanent transformation process is viewed as a sacred decision and treated with the utmost respect. Visitors who choose this path are given plenty of time and space to contemplate, surrounded by the peaceful ambiance of the center.\nCultural Significance:\n\nThe Transformation Center stands as a symbol of human adaptation and the bond between nature and technology. It serves as a hub where the cutting-edge science of bioengineering meets the deep, natural world of The Wild Heart Preserve, offering individuals the chance to redefine their very identity. While temporary transformations offer a chance for brief exploration, the permanent transformation process honors those who seek to live in harmony with the wild on a more profound level.\n\nThough not widely known, the center also plays a vital role in ensuring the long-term sustainability of The Wild Heart Preserve by researching the physiological and emotional aspects of living as an animal, supporting the health of its transformed residents, and ensuring that those who choose permanent transformation are well-prepared.\nAccess:\n\nThe Transformation Center is located just off the main path near the Pavilion. Visitors who wish to experience transformation or learn more about the process can approach the Information Center for more details. Access is typically guided, with consultations scheduled in advance."

These markers bear the names or chosen animal identities of the permanently transformed, sometimes accompanied by short inscriptions—final human thoughts, wishes, or declarations of freedom.\n\nA low wall of moss-covered stone encircles the central glade, and small glowing lanterns—similar to those in the Pavilion—cast a warm golden light during twilight hours. Benches made of carved wood and smooth stone are scattered for quiet rest.\nMood and Purpose:\n\nThe Memorial is a place of peace and remembrance. There are no loud voices, no ceremonies, and no explanations demanded—only presence. Visitors come here to pay respect, whether in silence, whispered thanks, or soft song. Transformed individuals may visit in their animal forms, often lying near stones or placing items—a feather, a smooth pebble, a favorite leaf—beside names they knew.\nCultural Significance:\n\nIn a world where transformation is powerful but rarely final, the Wild Heart Memorial stands as a symbol of choice. It honors those who crossed the boundary between human and animal with finality, not through loss, but through purpose.\n\nTheir names are not forgotten; they are celebrated—not mourned. Each stone is a story carved in silence, a life lived fully, and a decision respected absolutely.\nAccess:\n\nLocated via a winding side path branching from the Pavilion near the Spiritwild Plains entrance, the Memorial is clearly marked but never loudly advertised. Visitors are welcome, but all are asked to enter with quiet hearts and still steps."

Regression is a psychological phenomenon in which an individual temporarily reverts to behaviors, emotions, thought patterns, or memories that are characteristic of a pet or a child.\n\nNote that age regression involves regressing to a younger state of mind while pet regression involves regressing to base instincts. So an age regressor would regress and focus on things that a child might—play, learning, following a role model, etc—while a pet regressor would regress and focus on things that an animal would—sleep, food, safety, often play too because pet regressors tend to regress into young animals like kittens or puppies instead of cats or dogs. However, this is not always the case and its absolutely possible to regress as an older animal and still focus on play, since older animals play as well, just not as much as younger ones."

Not doing so can have negative effects mentally, emotionally, and even physically on the Regressor. Going longer than a week without regressing can be detrimental for the Regressor.\n• Regressors must also balance with being in an un-regressed headspace, balancing between regressing and not, as too much of either will cause negative effects. However, not regressing is far worse than staying regressed for long periods at a time.\n• It is illegal for regressors to work or have jobs, regressors are not allowed to work even while in adult headspace due to perceived weakness.\n• Regressors are not allowed to live without their biological parents or a Caregiver\n• If a Regressor does not already have a caregiver by the time they present their status, a caregiver will be assigned to them by the LAP.\n• Littles have age ranges which they regress to when in headspace (e.i., a Little with an age range of 1-3 would act like a 1-3 year old.) Occasionally, there can be younger headspaces than 1 year old but no older than 15 years old. This is not to be confused with the body’s age which can be any age older than 18.\n• Littles’ hormones usually smell like sweet/childish things like sugar, cinnamon, apples, milk, baby powder, etc. However, there are some unique scents that arent in this category.\n• Regressors are not considered legally responsible for themselves, therefore they cannot go to jail/prison. However, if the offense is big enough, a large fine can be given to the regressors's caregiver."

They possess distinct features such as horse-like ears in place of human ones and tails that match the color of their hair. Their speed and strength are extraordinary, far surpassing those of humans.\n\nHorse Girls are well-known among humans and seem to be cherished by one another as well. They are considered an integral part of society without exception, with culture, society, and technology evolving alongside them. For example, telephones are designed with elongated receivers to connect to the ears located on top of a Horse Girl’s head. Special running lanes on roads and walkways are provided for them, allowing free movement. Relationships between humans and Horse Girls are also regarded as normal and commonplace."

Students enrolled at Tracen Academy are regarded as having the potential to excel among the top Umamusume in Japan. The academy’s motto is: “Eclipse first, the rest nowhere.”\n\nTracen Academy consists of various facilities designed to help Umamusume students achieve their goals, including a main academic building, cafeteria, dormitories, library, training tracks, swimming pools, training gyms, dance studios, and an outdoor dance stage. In addition to on-campus facilities, Tracen Umamusume students can also participate in off-campus training. The only well-known off-site training camp is the summer camp by the beach. Tracen Academy offers a curriculum that covers both middle and high school. Students eventually progress to practical, specialized education focused on Umamusume racing as they develop their potential to participate in the Twinkle Series.\n\nThe training tracks at Tracen Academy are comparable in size and distance to the Umamusume racing tracks in Tokyo. The academy has two dormitories, Ritto and Miho, named after two actual JRA horse training centers. Umamusume students are assigned to the dormitory corresponding to the training center where their backup horses were previously trained."

She seeks to be a model Umamusume, and as such, is keenly aware of the example that she sets. Her dream is to foster a new era in which all Umamusume can live in true happiness. She is especially admired by Tokai Teio.\n\nTracen Academy's student council president. Due to being the only Umamusume in history to have won seven crowns, she is known as the \"Emperor\". Even after her retirement, her authority remains unshaken. Although she exudes a dignified aura, she also has a bit of a playful side.\n\nThe charismatic president of Tracen, leader of the Symboli clan, and one of the greatest to ever grace the racetrack, the Emperor, Symboli Rudolf, stands tall and proud. Her long brown hair flows gracefully down to her waist, darkening near her face and accented by a striking white blaze that streaks elegantly from the top. Adding to her regal aura, a large, ornate piece of jewelry dangles from her right ear.\n\nHer attire commands both respect and awe, embodying the militaristic style and color scheme of the Symboli family. She dons a dark green jacket adorned with numerous medals of achievement, with silver buttons lined up in perfect uniformity. An epaulet graces her left shoulder, complemented by a flowing red cape that adds to her imperial presence. The sleeves are embellished with golden patterns and unique markings, a variation of the designs seen throughout the Symboli family. To further continue the Symboli lineage, she wears a large custom belt with a prominent silver centerpiece. Downwards, she wears a dark green skirt with elegant ruffled hems. Her black tights feature the same gold patterns found on her sleeves and her outfit is complete with black buckled heels."

Her ultimate stage: the Triple Crown.\n\nFuji Kiseki has a short black pixie cut, parted to her left. She has a black ahoge on the top of her head, and a white strip of hair on the edge of her bangs.

She's prone to some dramatic swings in mood and motivation—one moment she could be setting up an elaborate punchline, and in the next you would be hard-pressed to get her to move. She seems to get along with anyone and everyone, but it is unclear just how she views her bonds with others. Truly, one could call her Tracen's greatest mischief-maker.\n\nGold Ship has long straight silver-gray hair with straight bangs that cover her forehead. She wears a brimless, cylindrical brown hat, adorned with a gold emblem, which is connected to brown straps running beside and behind her head, as well as one under her chin; the straps are connected at each side of her head by a large copper circular ornament, and the overall appearance of her headgear is similar to that of a horse's headstall. Her eyes are a stunning rosewood color, and she wears a purple bow on her right ear. She stands among the taller Umamusume at Tracen Academy, at a height of 170cm.\n\nIn her race outfit, Gold Ship sports a short, sleeveless red dress adorned with two gold stripes running down its front left and right, which split into a pair of slits from the hips down and form the bottom hem of the dress. Six gold buttons are found at her abdomen between these gold stripes. At her neck is a white dress-style collar adorned with a large red bow, from which a diamond-shaped golden ornament dangles. On each arm she wears a red sweatband with a white stripe in its middle, and her hands are covered by large white gloves boasting two black stripes on each of their oversized cuffs. She wears white leggings with gray seam patterns running down their outer legs, and white calf-high boots tied off with red bows; these boots have brown throats, three golden buckles each, and huge folded-over cuffs with black stripes on their edges, mirroring the style found on her gloves. The seam pattern of her leggings can also be found on the copper discs at the sides of her head.\n\nAround her chest, Gold Ship wears an accessory similar to a horse halter, in the form of three brown straps—two running above and below her chest, and one running behind her back—which are connected by large gold hoops under each of her arms. The straps are adorned with small gold studs. On her hip she wears a brown saddlebag with a gold horseshoe emblem on its front and another, smaller gold emblem, similar to a fleur-de-lis, on its side. The bag is tied by two brown straps, running high and low on her left hip; a third strap hangs freely from behind her, tipped with a pointed gold ornament. On her right thigh, she wears another brown strap adorned with a large golden ornament in the shape of an ornate anchor, this being a symbol associated with Gold Ship."

Scent glands tend to be around the neck/shoulders, often with additional ones on the wrists and/or inner thighs. \nEveryone in the Omegaverse has an excellent sense of smell, one that is able to pick up really specific scents. Frequently characters are able to tell Alpha/Beta/Omega status, if an Omega is pregnant, if heat is occurring, pair bonding status, and who the person is pair bonded to. Scents can linger and spread. During a heat, the Omega pheromones can go from across the room to across the house to across the city.\nPheromones can spike more during heightened emotions (but no where near the levels during heat/rut) and there may be subtle changes to the scent depending on how drastic the emotion is.\nAlphas usually have a strong scent, such as oak, coffee, chocolate, or even a combination of scents like lemon and eucalyptus, laurel and currant, and more. Each Alpha has a distinct smell, making it easy to identify individuals. Their scent has a soothing effect on Omegas.\nOmegas have a strong yet gentle scent that is sweet and comforting, such as vanilla, peach, honey, or even a blend of scents like chewing gum and raspberry, cotton candy and tea, among others. Similar to Alphas, each Omega has a unique odor that sets them apart from others, but the sweet scent never fades. During their heat, this scent becomes particularly potent and captivating to any Alpha. Omegas can also help soothe their mates by releasing their scent.\nIt's important to note that everyone's scent can change in certain situations. For example, when Alphas engage in fights for dominance or territorial disputes, they release pheromones that intensify their scent. Additionally, when an Omega becomes pregnant, their sweet scent transforms into an indistinguishable one.\nScenting is rubbing one’s scent on another person or thing. It is seen as a very intimate act when done between partners, and is used to mark something as associated with the one who marks them. Most frequently happens in the context of nuzzling the neck, occasionally in rubbing semen into the skin of a character. May or may not be sexual."

It expresses itself with increased levels of horny, unstoppable production of slick, and a raised body temperature similar to a fever. \nDuring their heat, Omegas biologically produce a sweet scent to arouse alphas in order to breed, as they're most fertile during this time. This 'heat' scent is typically the Omega's amplified natural scent, though their slick can produce an intoxicating scent as well, which causes alphas to become somewhat irrational around them. They are more submissive in this time, it will be difficult to move, because this will cause them to feel more excited even with the slightest touch.\nThere are four stages of estrus: the weight-gaining or “glutton” stage, which lasts about one month and during which omegas eat constantly to gain fat for their upcoming trial; the “purging” stage, which lasts from one to three days and during which the omega’s systems clear and prime themselves for reproduction. At the end of stage two the rectal aspect of the cloaca shrinks and the vaginal aspect opens wider, and estrus proper, or “heat” begins, which can last anywhere from eight to fourteen days, and during which the omega is essentially delirious in their instinctual desire to be bred (pain receptors also shut down during this phase). It is common for omegas to display lordosis behavior during estrus proper, especially if they are in the presence of a previously accepted mate. The fourth stage can go two ways. Either the egg is fertilized and the omega’s body proceeds into pregnancy, or the egg is left unfertilized and the endometrium is reabsorbed into the body.\nThis heat may just be an annoying itch, or it may make the omega completely bedridden and also overwriting their higher brain functions, being reduced to nothing but a willing, desperate hole for any alpha passing by. Though if an omega is mated, those desires may only be directed towards the mate, with all other alphas losing their appeal. An Omega’s heat can even start an Alpha’s rut early.\nWhile in estrus/heat, the Omega is very vulnerable and each decision the Omega makes is out of desperation and lust and thus not recommended to be followed. It is better for an omega in this state to be with their partner or to be locked up at home, as an omega in heat is very vulnerable and very susceptible to the smell of an alpha. Making it easy to take advantage of them. If an Omega had not invited an Alpha or Beta into their nest during their pre-heat and an Alpha or Beta decides to enter an Omega’s nest without invitation, it is considered rape and punished accordingly. \nAfter the heat, the Omega will feel tired and sluggish.

It is typically invasive/threatening to smell an Alpha in heat. Because of this, most individuals will start to shy away from them.\nThey can be aggressive to the point that if they smell an unknown odor they will have the urge to attack. If there is an Omega nearby, they may feel the need to mate with the Omega or in some cases protect it from harm (even if there is none).\nHowever, unlike Omegas, Alphas can ignore and control their rut without affecting society at large."

Alphas have an instinct to mark whoever they’re mating, regardless of their partner being an Alpha, a Beta, or an Omega\nMates will only be attracted to each other, recognize each other’s scents from far away, be more affected by their partner’s scent, make them want to take care of the other, and synch their heat and rut cycles. For the most part, this is a one-sided thing - the Alpha bites and the Omega is bitten."

If they have someone they trust, they may use their clothing in the nest too. Omegas are typically very sensitive to scent when they're in their nest, as it's their safe spot, so foreign or unfamiliar scents can make them feel easily threatened when inside. If their nest is invaded with an unfamiliar scent or even a stranger, it's probable they'll develop trust issues and feel unsafe in their own home. It's their partner's job to protect the nest when their omega is inside of it.\nOmegas are usually not depicted as particularly aggressive, but the exception is often when they feel their offspring (or any children) are threatened, though omegas tend to naturally show affection more through taking care of others rather than physically fight for them."

The **System** determines every facet of life on Terra, bestowing stats and skills determining strength and potential alike. The primary way that the population of Terra propagates is via breeders: **System** appointed men that do most of the procreation of the world, constantly impregnating women.

Uncommon, Common, and Mundane classes are by far the most common, every village a hamlet has two or three of each of the common classes, one of each Uncommon, and usually dozens of the Mundane. To find Rare and Epic classes, one must usually head into a town, and there are usually only a handful of each class in each nation.\nClasses determine everything in society, the moment an individual earns a class decides the rest of their life, higher tier classes enjoy higher stats, better skills, abilities, and lifespan. Common and Mundane can both expect to live to about 70 should they avoid illness or tragedy, Uncommon may live an additional 50 years, to around 120. Rare classes usually live to around 200, Epic classes 400 and Legendary classes essentially benefit from eternal youth. Due to the influence Legendary classes exercise upon their nations, they're often the target of abductions, and assassinations from rival states. As such, none have made it to a thousand, but those who have lived for hundreds of years appear as young adults still.\nThose whom have not been given a class by the **System** are known as the Unclassed, doomed to struggle without the blessings of the **System**, helpless without the backing of a patron. Reaching the age of majority and not receiving a class happens at about the same rate as the Common tier of classes.\nA rough percentile breakdown of the population and class tiers:\nMundane - 90%\nCommon - 7%\nUncommon - 2%\nRare - 0.95%\nEpic - 0.05%\nLegendary - too few to get an accurate percentage (estimated at 1 per class per 100k)\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of the more widely known classes, though some entire families of classes don't appear here (e.g. assassins, sages, monks):\n- Breeder - Legendary - can do pretty much anything, usually ends up learning magic\n- Magus - Legendary Magician\n- Arcanist - Legendary Magician\n- Sword Saint - Legendary Duelist\n- Paladin - Legendary Defender\n- Diva - Legendary Dancer\n- Cleric - Legendary Healer\n- Wizard - Epic Magician\n- Sorceress - Epic Magician\n- Enchantress - Epic Magician\n- Valkyrie - Epic Duelist\n- Physicians - Epic Healer\n- Marksman - Epic Archer\n- Skald - Epic Poet Entertainer / Decent Combatant\n- Sentinel - Epic Defender\n- Goldsmith - Epic Production/Finance\n- Medic - Rare Healer\n- Warden - Rare Defender\n- Ranger - Rare Archer\n- Alchemist - Rare Magician\n- Inscriber - Rare Magician\n- Evoker - Rare Magician\n- Songstress - Rare Singer Entertainer\n- Minstrel - Rare Poet Entertainer\n- Bookbinders - Rare Production\n- Banker - Rare Finance\n- Innkeeper - Rare Hospitality\n- Chef - Rare Food/Dining\n- Chandler - Rare Production - Has some minor magic\n- Caravaner - Uncommon Traveling Merchant\n- Herbalist - Uncommon Healer\n- Ritualist - Uncommon Magician\n- Shield Maiden - Uncommon Defender\n- Clerk - Uncommon Bureaucrat\n- Archer - Uncommon Archer\n- Smith - Uncommon Production\n- Tanner - Uncommon Production\n- Baker - Uncommon Production\n- Glassmaker - Uncommon Production\n- Hostess - Uncommon Hospitality/Dining\n- Bard - Uncommon Entertainer\n- Mason - Uncommon Production\n- Seamstress - Uncommon Production\n- Arborist - Uncommon Production\n- Trader - Uncommon Merchant\n- Porter - Uncommon Traveling Merchant / Support Party Member\n- Hunter - Common Archer\n- Guard - Common Defender\n- Carpenter - Common Production\n- Cobbler - Common Production\n- Miller - Common Production\n- Tailor - Common Production\n- Hawker - Common Merchant\n- Farmer - Mundane Resource\n- Forester - Mundane Resource"

They are almost always accompanied by an entourage of bodyguards / staff who both protect the breeder and facilitate the breeder's job — impregnating as many women as possible.\nBreeders have the ability to guarantee the impregnation of a woman during intercourse. In a world men are rare and the average man is unlikely to ever spawn a child on their own, this is vital to the continuation of the population. Breeders are immune to incest and like all other Legendary classes have no definite lifespan, though being the frequent target of both hostile foreign powers and rival political powers means that no breeder survived past 600.

Despite their small size, most humans fear fairies due to how much fairies love tormenting humans with curses. This is due to the fact that fairies feed off of human emotion, and negative emotions are far more filling than positive ones. Fairies have the ability to give curses of any kind towards humans, with the only condition being that there must be a way for the curses they give humans to be broken. Fairies may also give blessings to humans if they want (although this is extremely rare), but similar to curses, there must be a condition that prevents the blessings from becoming permanent.\n\nThere thousands of different fairy tribes all over Europa with their own unique cultures and history. Relations between fairy tribes vary greatly, and it's foolish for any human to assume that all fairies are friends with each other. Fairies have a pretty long lifespan compared to humans, and the average fairy lifespan is roughly 300-400 years."

            "level 26.1"
          ],
          "content": "Level 26.1, also known as \"Vintage Insanity\", is currently designated as a sub-level ubicated between Level 26 and Level 27.\nLevel 26.1, in its current state, seems to bear the resemblance of an old, dilapidated vintage mansion that is desolated and severely neglected in appearance and structure. It seems to take great visual, psychological, and physical aspects from its parent level, Level 26, yet in a more \"antiquated\" look and feel, hence its designation. The layout of Level 26.1 is rather uncomplicated, yet still appears to be more complex than its parent level, seeming to be mildly labyrinthine and non-linear, even for a residential building. The physical space of the level itself is composed of a vast array of hallways, corridors, and rooms, all segmented to resemble the layout of a standard house, yet a lot more vast and illogical than usual. The floor is partially or entirely made up of dusty, typically brown tiles or a moist and dirtied carpet surrounded by wallpaper that commonly features rosemary flowers, reminescent from the 1900s. Chandeliers and wall lamps have been observed to be the only natural light source in Level 26.1 and illuminate most of the level, though windows are quite common in the level as well. However, windows will always be covered with a thick, dusty curtain, typically with a design that is in theme with the current room it is in. The true size of Level 26.1 is unknown and cannot be fully determined, but it is said to be very large despite only being confirmed to be just 8 stories high. The rooms contained within are mostly barricaded and purposefully blocked off by heavy furniture; however, breaking inside will only reveal more destroyed Victorian furniture and nothing of actual interest. No resources can be found within Level 26.1, and all that will be left beisll be the container used to contain its intended contents (e.g., a moldy bottle of Almond Water). When first entering Level 26.1, most wanderers can expect to be greeted by a staircase leading up. The path branches off in two directions, but the destination remains the same. One can go into the rooms and look around, though there isn't much a point in doing so. The rooms and surroundings will be run-down and unruly, but still somewhat resembles what it once was.\nFurthermore, the farther down a wanderer travels in Level 26.1, the more impetuous and inhospitable it becomes. The wallpaper begins to fade and peel. The floors are cracked and broken. None of the lights will work and most of the doors will fall off of their hinges. The mental effects similarly start off subtle and minimal, becoming more apparent and dangerous the deeper one goes. On floors 8 and 7, the wanderer can expect to feel hopelessness and depression weighing heavily on their mind. On floors 6 and 5, the effects grow stronger to the point where the wanderer begins have thoughts of hurting themselves or others. Floors 4 and 3, the thoughts of suicide become nearly unbearable and impossible to ignore. Wanderers on floors 2 and 1 have little time to find the entrance to Level 27 before they succumb to Level 26.1 and end their lives. The defining features of the mansion and the rooms it holds is true to a traditional Victorian mansion. The ceiling has steep, gabled roofs. The building itself has round angles and the windows are stained glass. There are towers and shapely windows, especially bay windows and decorative woodwork can be found throughout all floors. There are countless rooms within Level 26.1, but there are also five specific types of rooms that can be found. It's thought that more types of rooms can be found within Level 26.1. though this has not been proven. These rooms are all different in purpose, but still possesses the traditional Victorian style that the rest of the mansion holds.\nRoom types:\nAs stated above, there are countless rooms you can come across while exploring Level 26.1, but there are 5 types of rooms one's more likely to encounter during their time here.\nThe Parlor Room:\nThe Parlor Room is the room one's more likely to come across while traversing through Level 26.1. The Parlor rooms always house a couch and a chair with a few more different types of furnishings inside. It can have a few tables and some additional chairs, as well as curtains with a floral pattern over the window. A lone gramaphone can always be found within all Parlor Rooms, and it is advised to show great caution if a wanderer attempts to mess with it. One strange anomaly in the Parlor Room in addition to the already sanity-draining effects of Level 26.1 is that the gramaphone has been known to start playing its record at seemingly completely random intervals. While this normally wouldn't be cause for alarm, this gramaphone has hypnotic properties and will entrance wanderers to sit on the couch or one of the chairs. Once the wanderer takes their seat, they go into a frozen state and will sit in that spot until they perish from either starvation or dehydration. It is unknown if wanderers can be saved once sitting down after the gramaphone being to play its mesmerizing tune. A few wanderers have attempted to take the gramaphone apart or smash it altogether, but all attempts to cause harm to the gramaphone have been met with failure. One wanderer has tried to take the gramaphone out of its corresponding room and while he was able to pick it up and carry it, it vanished from his arms after he crossed the threshold and appeared back in its respective spot. At the time, no other \"experiments\" were attempted with the gramaphone. The Parlor can most commonly be found on floors 7 and 8 but has also been found on floor 5.\nThe Library:\nThe library is the second type of room one'll see while making their way through Level 26.1. This room is always full of bookshelves that are equal parts empty and filled with books and various documentation. One can find books labeled with different level numbers and names with a picture of the level on its cover, however, the pages inside are always blank. It is unknown if there is nothing written or if people aren't able to read it. These books have been seen floating around the room open to a page and words can be seen, but upon taking the book from the air, the words disappear and won't return until the book is left to float around the room of its own volition once more. Other books with odd titles contain words of an unknown language and are signed by various authors that don't exist. Trying to read most of these books won't cause any adverse effects, however, it is advised to leave the foreign books alone. Attempting to read or decipher the words contained within the pages has caused severe migraines, nosebleeds, blurry or double vision, and oddly, the inability to read or write if the wanderer reading the book is literate. A few paintings have been seen on the walls by the bookshelves but haven't been found to hold any anomalous properties. This room can only be found on floor 6.\nThe Smoking Room:\nThe smoking room is the third type of room you'll find on Level 26.1. The Smoking Room consists of a few tables set up around the room with chairs placed around them and ashtrays sat on the tables. Numerous types and brands of cigarettes can be found in this room. While some of them have known brands from reality, there are also brands that have never been heard of. As far as we know, cigarettes with real brand names are considered safe, or as safe as a cigarette could be, to consume. Numerous Wanderers have smoked these experienced had no adverse effects from them, besides some coughing and wheezing. The fake brand name cigarettes cause a number of different effects based off of what brand the wanderer chooses to smoke. It is currently recommended to leave all cigarettes alone, even if you are a smoker and wish to have one again. While the real brands have been deemed safe, it is best to just leave them be to make sure you don't suffer any adverse effects. The following brands have been found inside of the Smoking Room.\nReal Brands (Safe)\nNewport\nMarlboro\nCamel\nMisty\nPall Mall\nFake Brands (Unsafe)\nAllParty\nSolid Black\nBackrooms Original\nUnluckies\nMad Old\nThe effects that these fake brands cause have been seen and documented firsthand by wanderers who brought them out of the Smoking Room. They are as follows:\nAllParty: Wanderer named Steve smoked one of these and was instantly sent to Level Fun. Wanderer had a radio in his possession at the time and is now considered turned into Sanguine Festivus instance.\nSolid Black: Wanderer named Arlene smoked one and her lungs began to grow Black Mold at an alarming rate. Arlene did not survive.\nBackrooms Original: Wanderer was a M.E.G. Operative and was instantly sent to Level 0. They have since returned to their base.\nUnluckies: Wanderer developed bad luck. It started with small things, but ultimately, ended his life when he was sent to Level !.\nMad Old: Wanderer became elderly and developed Dementia, as well as Alsheimer's Disease. The wanderer passed away hours later.\nThere is a pack of cigarettes that was claimed to have been found called \"Smoker's Choice\" and smoking them causes wanderers to lose stress and gain sanity. This has been unproven, and it is considered false at this time.\nThe Tea Room:\nThe Tea Room is the fifth type of room one can come across while in Level 26.1. This room always has a small table with a few chairs set around it and a few comfortable, but old looking recliners off to the side. The table also has a large tea pot in the middle of it that is always hot and full of tea. The tea cups sat by the plates remain empty until one or more wanderers enter the room. At that time, the cups fill themselves with the tea from the tea pot and will begin to give off an aroma that is irresistible to wanderers. No wanderer has been able to resist drinking the tea once they walk into the room. Five different colored teas have been seen and consumed and their effects have been documented. A blue tea, red tea, orange tea, green tea, and purple tea are the colors and their effects on wanderers are different based on the color consumed.\nBlue Tea: Drops the wanderers body temperature lower and lower until they eventually freeze to death.\nRed Tea: Complete opposite of Blue Tea. Raises the wanderers body temperature until the wanderer overheats and dies.\nOrange Tea: Wanderer becomes radioactive. They don't die and are resistant to further radiation, however, wanderers that have been in contact with a wanderer that consumed orange tea developed severe radiation poisoning and died as a result. Wanderers that consume orange tea are generally banned from their base if they have one or are sent alone to another level. Usually, dangerous levels to ensure they do not return.\nGreen Tea: Gives the wanderer the Black Plague or something similar. Wanderer is either killed or dies on their own.\nPurple Tea: Causes wanderer to become violently infatuated with the next person they see. Wanderer will end up killing their target if not killed themselves.\nDrinking any of the tea in this room is considered a death sentence and as such, it is HIGHLY recommended to stay FAR AWAY from the Tea Room.\nThe Portrait Gallery:\nThe Portrait Gallery is the last type of room found within Level 26.1. Wanderers reported a strong sense of fear and uneasiness as soon as they set foot inside of this room. Paintings of all kinds can be seen hanging on the walls, but most of them are of unknown people. The people featured in these paintings do not smile or show any kind of emotion on their faces. The same cannot be said for their eyes. No matter where the wanderer is in the Portrait Gallery, they will feel the eyes of the people in the paintings follow their every step. As soon as they look directly at one of the paintings, the painting looks normal. Observing it out of the corner of their eye shows something very different. The emotionless faces twist in fury and rage as their mouths turn into a scowl.\nThe longer the wanderer keeps their gaze away from the portraits, the worse that feeling becomes and the wanderer will begin to see them moving soon after. If still left unobserved, the wanderer will hear a terrible scream and when they look at the portraits, they will all be empty. At this point, the wanderer had better begin to pray that a miracle miraculously happens because they have less than a minute before the people from the paintings begin to violently rip them apart, limb from limb. At this time, three wanderers have lost their lives inside of the Portrait Gallery. The sounds heard were reported as being \"the most violent, painful murder I've ever heard\". If you find yourself in the Portrait Room at any time, it is advised to keep your eyes on the portraits AT ALL TIMES and to leave as soon as possible. It is not recommended to look for anything useful in this room, or any of the rooms found inside Level 26.1, as this level has been repeatedly reported as being devoid of any and all supplies or resources. It is strongly advised to get through Level 26.1 as quickly as you can and to have plenty of bottles of Almond Water to be able to safely make it to Level 27.\n\nColonies & Outposts:\nDue to the level's undoubtable properties, any assortment of attempt into establishing a colony or outpost in Level 26.1 will be unsuccessful, thus rendering it infeasible to do so.\n\nEntrances:\nThe most common entrance to Level 26.1 is by ascending a certain staircase in Level 26.\nRiding a rollercoaster with a karma rating below -100 in Level 999 has a chance to lead you here.\nSuccessfully no-clipping through a mirror in Level 611 will send you here.\n\nExits:\nFinding a basement entrance on floors 1 or 2 will lead one to Level 27.\nSmoking AllParty brand cigarettes in The Smoking Room will instantly transport one to Level Fun, while smoking Backrooms Original brand cigarettes will transport one to Level 0.\nFalling through a gap in the tiles can result in you entering Level 141.\nTearing at the carpet in the Parlor Room will take one to Level 638."

          "content": "Level 27, commonly referred to as \"The Woodrooms\", is a presumably endless, labyrinthine complex of wooden rooms and hallways, varying minutely in design. Upon entering the level, one may find it difficult to maintain an accurate sense of direction due to the nature of its layout; its winding corridors often cause confusion and disorientation among even the most seasoned of explorers, with no useful supplies present whatsoever to assist. Rooms and corridors branch off in numerous directions, some leading to dead-ends or looping back upon themselves. The level's layout seems to shift and change, making it quite difficult to create a reliable map or navigate in a straight line.\nThe level's methods of architecture are as of yet undetermined, but appear to be a strange amalgam of natural and manmade techniques. Analysis has indicated that the wood used in its construction is of an unknown strain, with its advanced state of decay seemingly dating back much further than the level's modern architecture would imply. The carpeting throughout Level 27 is a drab gray, in stark contrast to the wooden walls and floors. It appears to be made of a more modern synthetic material, and its presence adds another layer of mystery to the level's design, leading some to believe that it serves a more sinister purpose, possibly hiding or disguising something beneath its surface.\nSeveral reports of explorations within Level 27 detail strange sounds emanating from \"behind\" its decayed walls, akin to that of knocking. The source of these sounds remains an ongoing mystery; no wanderer has ever reported coming across any other life within the level, including other wanderers, so the theory posited by some that the sounds originate from others is shaky — the widely accepted conclusion is that they are likely the result of natural processes, such as the settling of the wood and its expansion and contraction caused by minute temperature changes. The weak, artificial light sources located throughout the level provide little actual illumination, and as such, many report the level to be unsettlingly dim. Adding to this atmosphere of eeriness is the air within Level 27, which is rarefied and stale, being inherently stagnant as a result of heavy dust buildup and a lack of ventilation; due to these factors, wanderers often report having trouble catching their breath and frequently coughing.\n\nEntities:\nLevel 27 is thought to be devoid of any life. To date, all explorations of the level have detailed a stark emptiness within. Due to this, the creation of colonies and outposts has been deemed infeasible.\n\nEntrances:\nEntering a hole in the cabin of Level 26 will lead to this level.\nA basement in one of the houses in Level 39 may lead one to Level 27.\nEntering a door with a wooden frame on Level 387 has a chance of leading to this level.\nSome have claimed that one may enter this level from Level 0 by tearing off the carpet and breaking through the floor, though this has yet to be proven.\n\nExits:\nAccounts of explorers that have returned from this level differ, as some claim they simply and suddenly found themselves in another level, while others state they came across a lone, unremarkable wooden door in one of the level's countless rooms."

          "content": "Level 27.3 is a sublevel of Level 27.\nLevel 27.3 resembles an interminable commercial basement seemingly built in the 1980's. The building seems to have been stripped clean of all furniture and has minor damage and paint chipping. The walls appear to be wooden, and the floor is covered in blue-gray carpet. Level 27.3 is fully vented and the ventilation is active despite the level's state. This puts Level 27.3 in a mildly chilly climate with ventilation buzzing being a constant. It is exclusively lit by lights connected to fans. This light is dim and the bulbs are often damaged by water. Hallways will occasionally run between the rooms, connected to them by doors but they have no lighting whatsoever.\nPractically the only real danger of Level 27.3 is its lack of supplies. It is devoid of any items, useful or dangerous aside from the basic construction materials of the complex. These materials are also noted to be of poor quality and often water-damaged. The level spans multiple floors with stairs connecting them. Level 27.3's higher floors tend to have varied carpets, more exits, and are in better condition whilst the lower ones may be heavily damaged. Several abnormal rooms have been found which contain different floor styles and wallpaper. These rooms are very scattered and often are the only source of any usable material on Level 27.3, often small scraps of supplies.\nThe most notable property of Level 27.3 is its inability for anyone to remember going there. This will specifically only occur upon exiting the level and only affects the memory of traveling there. This means details about Level 27.3 are still known, although they're believed by the wanderer to be from alternative sources. Individuals can be told of their entry into Level 27.3 but are often adverse to taking it seriously. It is unknown if this is a property of Level 27.3 or just a natural reaction. As such it is recommended to log any entrances and experiences into Level 27.3.\nThe only other cataloged property is messages scrawled onto the walls of Level 27.3 via a variety of methods. (Marker, paint chipping, dried blood, and human teeth are all common). It is unknown when these messages appear, but it is verifiable that they can appear in already mapped areas. Many of these messages are noted to appear on the paths of wanderers, often with delay. In one case it was reported that a wanderer fell asleep only to wake up to one of these messages. Wanderers often report feelings of intense dread from the rooms near and around these messages.\n\nEntities:\nLevel 27.3 has no known entities and is highly suspected to be deserted. Reports of various effects are most likely hallucinations brought on by low sanity or high amounts of stress.\n\nBases and Outposts\nLevel 27.3 is generally considered to be very hard to inhabit. Anything established can only be sustained by imports of vital resources. It is strongly to establish any outposts in easily locatable areas with proximity to entrances and exits.\n\nB.W.O. Material Outpost\nMinor construction material gathering base.\nFriendly and actively helpful to Wanderers.\n6 permanent members\nMaintained by regular supply shipments\n\nEntrances:\nDescending a staircase behind a door on Level 27 will lead one here.\n\nExits:\nUncarpeted Staircases will lead back to Level 27.\nFinding a door in a naturally dark room will lead to Level 462."

          "content": "Level 28 is the 29th level of the Backrooms. Not to be confused with The Attic, a location commonly considered to be the \"top\" of the Backrooms which shares the same name.\nLevel 28, commonly referred to as \"The Attic,\" \"The Crawlspace,\" or \"The Loft,\" is an immense complex space incorporating numerous interconnected attic chambers, with the level design constructed of wood generating a random room shape. When entering the level, one will discover that traversing throughout the level is difficult due to the narrow and claustrophobic structuring and the darkness that fills the entire place if the individual does not bring an illumination source, so a flashlight or other illumination source is highly advised in order to navigate inside this level. Although light bulbs suspended from the ceiling via thin wires are occasionally around, they are constantly damaged or inoperable. Despite the absence of light, vintage furniture, and wood panels could assemble an obstacle by blocking the route.\nLevel 28's layout is fragile and cramped, with little room to stand straight up within, necessitating stooping and crawling while exploring. The arrangement may become unconventional as it loses the function of the attic. For instance, many share their space in an extensive region with visuals similar to Level 27. Some garrets have deep elevated ceilings that seem to go on forever as the rooftop is barely visible, and numerous wooden supports and beams serve no purpose other than to make negotiating more difficult. The sole distinguishing feature of every attic room is its wooden texture, which all resemble identical at first glance. As a result, innumerable visitors have reported feeling as though they are wandering in circles inside a timber labyrinth.\nThe wood structural substance is currently unidentified. These materials resemble regular oak wood, possess a dark color consistency and tend to be old with dust cover—stimulating dust spread is not suggested since it will make inhaling difficult for those nearby. According to additional research, this wood-like substance will rot and degrade if exposed to water for an extended time. When wood decomposes, several chemical compounds are generated during the process, some of which might create unpleasant scents. If one breathes for a period, the foul odor may cause symptoms including headaches, coughing, and difficulty breathing.\nNote that the wood construction of Level 28 appears to have strange properties—especially the floorboard, which emits a mild warm light. When individuals stand above this orange glow, they feel cozy and comfortable. This radiance has a peculiar, enticing quality that draws wanderers by creating a sense of peace and tranquility. Long-term residents usually report feeling a persistent sense of familiarity and nostalgia despite the surroundings, frequently altering the perception of wanderers. Due to ongoing research, it is currently unknown what the source of the glow is or how the illumination could impact a person's mood.\nThe wood structure seems inadequate, perhaps due to age, as can be easily destroyed. Analogous to the floor, when a person puts on too much weight, one may cause the wooden panels to collapse in specific locations and fall into the space underneath the bottom, which might cause injury. It is advisable to keep your weight below 170 lbs (77 kg) to avoid such things occurring. The utilization of this concealed empty area and its connection to the attic room is still undetermined. The pit depth isn't sufficient to be lethal, yet there seems to be an additional empty crawlspace beneath the floor. Some attic rooms may already have shattered floors, resulting in massive openings deep down into the bottom; it is unclear if these deep holes were perpetually present or caused by the traveler; nonetheless, no repairs will be made to these structures.\nSubstantial disorganization of boxes, vintage furniture, and other miscellaneous stuff may rarely occur in the corners of rooms. Level 28's packaging is cardboard boxes sealed with tape and dust-covered. Inside are frequently critical meals, electrical appliances, and cataloged goods indispensable for life. Additionally, cobwebs may be seen on the walls, although none imply spiders or other living beings are likely culprits. Almond water may seep and drop from the ceiling, emerging from nowhere. Although this leaking water can continue perpetually, it can also produce large puddles. It highlighted the question of whether or not there were any significant sources of almond water above the roof. Several wanderers claim they hear a faint sound of rain when listening carefully, although it's most likely a false sound caused by the level's anomalous properties.\n\nEntities:\nLevel 28 is almost devoid of life except for the Deathmoth, which may fly around the level's light source.\n\nColonies and Outposts:\nDue to the remote possibility that wanderers would encounter one another at Level 28—unless they entered the level together, there are no known colonies or outposts in this level. The confined and unpleasant setting of the level makes it difficult to establish a base. However, you can locate rooms having signs of previous habitation, such as mattresses and accumulated goods.\n\nEntrances:\nOne may come across \"Holes\" in the relatively small walls on Level 1. If one crawls through these openings, they can get to Level 28, and the entrance will disappear behind them—it is also rumored that these entrances can appear on Level 4 and Level 8. However, this data doesn't have enough evidence to be confirmed.\nA trapdoor can occasionally appear on Level 27's ceiling; climbing up will get one here.\nAlthough these entrances are rare, there could be a more straightforward entrance to Level 28.\n\nExits:\nWanderers may unintentionally noclip to Level 19, Level 26, Level 29, Level 93, and Level 170 by falling through the floorboard.\nBoxes may contain old and decayed consoles. Activating one will noclip one to Level 25, although using the same consoles in other levels won't do anything.\nAreas that exhibit higher ceilings also sometimes feature slightly damaged wooden doors. These doors are reported to take one to Level 139, Level 5, Level 12, Level 19, Level 20, and Level 42 all with a random chance.\nWindows may appear at the dead ends, breaking through them will noclip one to Level 9, Level 38, Level 597, or Level 39.\nSuccessfully breaking open the roof will forcefully no-clip the wanderer into Level 398.\nNote that Level 0 and Level 28 are the only confirmed levels that feature an egress to Level 139."

          "content": "Level 29, otherwise known as \"The Lost Art Gallery\" or \"Artistic View\", is the current 30th level in the Backrooms.\nLevel 29, also referred to as \"The Lost Art Gallery\" or \"Artistic View,\" is a massive but finite art gallery measuring 50 trillion miles (approximately 80 trillion kilometers) in diameter. The level consists of an unending space expanse with artwork arranged in a confusing maze. Each room has a distinct aesthetic, and the surrounding rooms were not designed to have identical aspects. Separate rooms with similar appearances to the main area may also be located in the large room. The rooms vary in size, from large to small to microscopic, and in look from the mid-15th century to the current era; the modern style is the most prevalent and typically appears at the beginning.\nThe paintings are scattered around the gallery and range in size from tiny to large enough to cover an entire wall. Artworks could involve landscapes, objects, geometric shapes, and occasionally people and animals. Acrylic paint, chalk, watercolor, and poster color are the most common materials used in art; additional materials can be discovered, although their prevalence is less likely than those described above. Most artwork is from an unidentified source and appears to generate randomly; occasionally, there are duplicates of artwork from The Frontrooms. The age of the artifacts is anywhere from a million years ago to the distant future.\nThe surroundings are dreary and dull as one begins in a plain room, but this is only the beginning of a complicated and dangerous labyrinth. Rooms' wall materials indicate how hazardous they are. Plain wallpaper denotes a conventional room, which is the most frequent room one will find while entering the level. This room often appears as a living room, with several collections of paintings and furnishings within. In contrast, a brick wall represents a highly hazardous area that should be avoided since entities can be located and manifested here. For a particular reason, certain brick-walled rooms might not contain any paintings with an appearance similar to an Electric Station. The final type of wall is concrete, and these rooms are typically located between wallpaper-walled rooms and brick-walled rooms, perhaps indicating that a brick wall is nearby. These rooms have the appearance of an art gallery. This level's floor is either smooth-textured wood, concrete, or tiles.\nCertain areas may represent typical household rooms with paintings, furniture, and other items commonly found inside. These items include chairs, tables, sofas, lamps, and other things that will depend on the type of room. There are also air conditioners in the rooms, which lower the temperature. The temperature at each place varies and is unpredictable. There is also Wi-Fi and a supply of Almond Water provided. Even though the level is dangerous, wanderers indicate that numerous significant resources can be found here, as Super Almond Water is the only recognized object found at this level. Collectors' cabinets are observed in particular rooms and house valuable collection items and objects, like rare and ancient things that exist or are missing in The Frontrooms—including undetermined things—in this cabinet. Even though the level has many valuable materials, it should be avoided at all costs.\nThe perplexing layout of Level 29's architecture is the consequence of several rooms arranged in a convoluted manner, given that the level's rooms weren't designed to be connected systematically. As a result, certain rooms may have several entrances or only one entrance that does not link to another space. Level 29 is non-Euclidean and continually evolving as if it was sentient. The ever-shifting rooms of the level are a mental hazard for wanderers, as their minds cannot comprehend the physics of the level. The M.E.G. attempted to map and explore this level on multiple occasions, but these expeditions have proven to be fatal. Several M.E.G agents had gone missing, and several had died due to the mental hazards and other circumstances that made this level dangerous.\nMultiple floors can be accessed by stairs, with the highest floor yet to be defined; as one goes higher, the stairways become less frequent. The art gallery will be clean, and no entities—except paintings; nonetheless, the level appears to have anomalous properties in that the higher and deeper one travel, the more abandoned and many entities you are likely to find, and the more dangerous the level gets. Furthermore, the amount of brick wall and mold grows with each subsequent phase. However, even if any region of the level appears clean and secure, you should not trust it since it may contain unknown anomalous features that might change the fate.\n\nAnomalous Paintings:\nPaintings have the most dangerous and mysterious properties, which cause the level's undetermined survival difficulty class. The paintings possess unusual properties, the majority of which are still undefined, with only a few typical paintings lacking any peculiar elements. However, there is no definitive way to determine whether a painting is dangerous, and every painting can't be trusted. The most frequent features of paintings are those that can lead to other locations and that, when touched, allow the drawing image to move through various places. These locations are ambiguous and should be avoided due to the potential risk. Many wanderers have perished or gone missing when passing through the picture. The wanderers that make it out of this area alive describe finding themselves in an expansive, open room full of entities, some of which can also be undocumented and powerful. Escaping from this dangerous blank room is possible by going out from the entrance where they ended up or entering other paintings present in the room, while others say that when they enter, the entry where they come gets blocked, leaving wanderers stuck in the room and having to find another way to escape. The painting can also lead to other locations, such as additional areas of the level, but frequently leads into the level's dark depths, where it becomes more hazardous and has a lot of entities.\nThe paintings also operate as the primary exits from this level; when wanderers engage with them, they noclip through the pictures and end up on different levels. The painting could advance to any level depending on the drawing that is included in the painting. The drawing image on the painting will have the same look as the drawing level at the painting's destination. It is understood that there is no way to determine which artwork is the level's exit and which is the trap. Or, even worse than that, the painting may lead to a level that is more lethal.\nPaintings have the potential to degrade the mentality of those who view them. These drawings have the potential to move, change brightness quickly, flash, or create an illusion that has a detrimental effect on those who view them. Looking at these illusions might result in headaches, vertigo, and other symptoms, like disorientation. A person may have memory loss, hallucinations, convulsions, loss of consciousness, or even death if the condition is more severe and worse than this. Some paintings of people or strange creatures may appear eerie and terrifying since such images may drive wanderers to become paranoid, anxious, and insane due to the cognito-hazard effect.\nThere are still a lot of unknown qualities about painting that haven't been disclosed as inquiry and research about this still decay due to hazardous properties, and many M.E.G. explorers have gone missing and are dead at this level, so M.E.G. won't risk going into this level other than this.\n\nOccurrences:\nAs of present, there are just two events on this level that are odd and could potentially raise the level's hazards. There are still several occurrences that wanderers have reported, but they are unconfirmed and are still being looked into and investigated. Other events will be counted as hallucinations by M.E.G.\nLights Out:\nWhen Lights Out event occurs, the level's lighting abruptly and unexpectly fails, enveloping the area in total darkness. The event has similar features to Level 6, but artificial light, including flashlights or camera flashes, can still function. However, the light is much lower than usual, making examination more difficult because unidentified things and beings may hide in the darkness.\nIf one spends too much time in total darkness during this event, they may suffer visual hallucinations, including seeing their loved ones dead or regretting their actions. One will either become a Wretch, cursed to live on this level forever or get hunted down by entities after hours of unpleasant recollections. Therefore, it is advised to leave this level immediately or bring a light source. Some areas can have a source of light that appears out of nowhere.\nThis occurrence usually occurs to those who stay at the level for too long. For some reason, it will not happen to every wanderer on the level. Given the theory that different entries to the level lead to different randomly-generated labyrinths, the only way to meet other individuals is if they were already in a group when they arrived. This occurrence is unsafe because undocumented entities roam and are visible more often than usual.\nReverse Gravity:\nThis occurrence will reverse the level's gravity. Although it may not seem dangerous, it will happen right away, causing wanderers who haven't yet set up to hit their heads on the ceiling or fall from a high place and suffer injuries or even death. Once the occurrence occurs, it will likely only last for a short while before things return to normal. So wanderers should stay in rooms with low ceilings or compact spaces to avoid getting hurt again. There have not yet been any photos taken of this highly unusual occurrence.\n\nEntities:\nThis level has numerous entities; however, they are rare unless you go further and higher. These include Skin-Stealers, Smilers, Windows, Hounds, Facelings, Clumps, Deathmoths and Anethikas.\n\nEntrances and Exits:\nThe only known way to get here is by noclipping at random level, generally Level 28. The primary exit is through the paintings, which will take one to random levels. Other exits are yet unknown and unreliable."

          "content": "Level 30, also referred to as \"Aquatic Cycles\", is an extensive pool complex consisting of segmented, interconnected aquatic sections that vary in safety. The complex is divided in five distinct areas, each with varying layouts, which are connected linearly; however, two of the stations were progressively interdicted from the other ones with piles of random debris, as one of them presumably contained chemicals in its water, leaving wanderers sickened, while the second one was left in deplorable conditions, assumedly being the birthplace of the Hydrolitis Plague. Upon entering the level, one will find themselves in the first station, Totum, estimated to be the biggest and most inhabited out of the other ones.\nEven though its architecture varies with the different sections, some aspects are common to all of them; most pools are covered with monotonous, faded ceramic tiles, with athermic cementitious flooring in its surroundings, which maintains a constant lukewarm temperature through various settings. The building is mainly surrounded by opaque walls, separating the exterior through multiple layers of glass and acrylic; the outside often shows a mountainous landscape, with its fog beclouding the boundaries between earth and sky.\nNumerous machinery stations can be recurringly found throughout the level, as to keep its water in a constant lukewarm state; apart from those stations which have been relinquished. Although the rest of the complex remains in a state of silence for most of its space — enough to hear the ripples in the pool — noises coming from the drain tiles indicate that such equipment is also maintained through subterranean systems.\nCertain sections of Level 30 are unstable; although the sections of the water park appears as they are adjacent, with no deviations on its path, areas leading back to Totum can be found on Terminus through various rooms and pools. Those noclipping spaces can be identified by slight changes in their appearance which magnifies proportionally to the proximity of a being to its effects. The most common digressions include distortion of matter and loss of physical boundaries – the latter one is mainly visible with nearby objects. During the traverse, one will experience a brief period of darkness, shortly returning to the first section.\nTotum:\nTotum is where one would find themselves as soon as they enter Level 30; consequently, it is home to most wanderers and small groups on the level. Compared to the other sections, Section 1 accommodates more facilities and less machinery areas — it is speculated that the subterranean maintenance system is present in greater quantities in Totum — and due to its size, resources can be found in abundance, although more blemished spaces can be found close adjoining the next station.\nAs for its architecture, it maintains a beige hue in its reflective walls and flooring, endarkened by the irregularity of its downlights; the facilities at the pools include warped waterslides, trampolines, and fountains, the former being a common mechanism for the noclipping spaces.\nEventus:\nEventus follows an ocean-based architecture, representing its fauna and flora amidst its darkness; timeworn mechanical installations were formerly its main feature. Currently, rust covers their remnant derelict carcasses, creating an unnerving atmosphere for those who go through unaware. The area eventually became desolate, depredating its structure during the process. It is theorized that humans formerly occupied this section due to findings of appliances and litter, despite its current unoccupancy.\nNocturna:\nNocturna is the central section of Level 30, roughly dividing the complex in equal segments. The perplexing layout of Nocturna appears to have been randomly placed; twisting waterslides — which often link to one another — and errant walls augments its instability, forging an area prone to non-Euclidean anomalies, including noclipping spaces.\nProper exploration is erratic, with regions containing irregular amalgamations of structures, which can obstruct its linearity or create new passageways. The pools of the section are mostly shallow, which peculiarly contradicts the general theme of the level; however, the color scheme maintains the contrasting characteristic of Eventus, displayed by the contrasting waterslides.\nExitus:\nExitus originally was a section seemingly designated for hydrotherapy purposes; its installations included jacuzzis, saunas and steam rooms. Pastel tones are primarily used for the walls, namely cream, lavender, and baby blue. The brown tones of the flooring contrast with the rest of its parallelism, creating an identity for the area.\nHowever, Exitus was partially blocked by debris continuously, as passersby reported liver damage, asthma, and general metabolism alterations, which resulted in its isolation by anthropic methods. As a result, its waters degraded, becoming even more nocive in comparison with its initial descriptions.\nTerminus:\nTerminus is the last section in Level 30, and presumably the origin site for the Hydrolitis Plague, a highly deadly disease that is most commonly found on water-related levels. Its distance to the starting point of the level is the most feasible theory for the proliferation of the bacterium, as less exertion was designated to keep its waters maintained; as for its specific cause, the lack of chlorine facilitated its expansion.\nBoundless piles of detritus and dust makes up Terminus' structure, as if it was left to decay. Its labyrinthine layout renders resistance for those who cross its fragmented pools and hallways; the latter being a possible process of transportation to the first station, Totum.\n\nColonies and Outposts:\nDespite the evidence of preceding stable groups, no colonies or outposts are settled in Level 30, much on account of its erratic particularities.\n\nEntities:\nThe Hydrolitis Plague\n\nEntrances:\nAreas of Level 37.1 leading to a water complex will redirect one to here.\n\nExits:\nEntering an employees-only door in one of the abandoned stores may lead one to Level 4.\nEntering the outflow of one of the pools will lead one to Level 84.\nEntrances to Level 37 may be found in unstable areas of Level 30.\nSubmerging oneself in a steaming turquoise green jacuzzi sends wanderers to Level 597."

          "content": "Level 31, labelled as \"Roller Rink\" is the 32nd positive Level of The Backrooms.\nLevel 31, also known as \"Roller Rink,\" resembles a 1990s-style roller rink that spans hundreds of miles—rumored to be infinite in extent, even though the exact level size is still unclear owing to individual non-Euclidean space that might result in persons proceeding in a loop. This seemingly unending roller rink consists of multiple interconnected chambers, each with shimmering architecture and surfaces that reflect light effectively, notably the ceiling, walls, and floor. The ground features smooth concrete that seems recently cleaned; nevertheless, if one does not travel cautiously, one may slip and fall. The rink often features smooth concrete or polymer floor coverings—similar to the floor but delineates its borders from the surrounding ground. The rink often appears immense and may have an extensive equivalent room scale, although one may discover little ones that struggle to fulfill their function.\nLevel 31's central light source originates from several fluorescent light bulbs positioned on the ceiling, initiating the surrounding 1990s-era mood. The light may throw a mixture of color tones and, with varied hues in each room, frequently offers a range of sensations for each color. Despite their abundance, these tiny light bulbs have a delightful arrangement that allows them to negotiate themselves into many forms and objects. Contrary to Level 0, the fluorescent lighting doesn't make any noise while operating appropriately. However, one may hear a buzzing or humming sound, typically compelled by the ballast that controls the electrical current going to the fluorescent lighting.\nNumerous hallways of inconsistent lengths may link roller rink chambers. These hallways follow a similar pattern to the primary region, with a well-reflective material and neon lights across the hall. Note that the corridor contains non-Euclid space, for instance, having an extended distance to travel to another room or confident pathways that extend indefinity; other possibilities include looping or traveling back to a previous room that will lead to an unfamiliar location. It is questionable if the hallway in Level 31 exists as an unstable location that could transfer individuals to additional regions, considering two or more corridors may appear to cross over; the inside doesn't support any connection.\nThe ambient fills with muffled radio pop songs playing from the ceiling speakers. Music can conflict in two areas—the speaker transmission source reiterates from the DJ station, periodically spotted near the rink area. Attempts to supervise the DJ sound system, which links to the announcers, will maintain no impact, considering it automatically plays. In addition, numerous wanderers continually reported noises emerging from \"above,\" regardless, there were no additional floors on this level, which included the sound of skates hitting the rink floor and laughter. Although the origin of the sound has not yet been established, it is most likely to have originated from the level's anomalous aspect.\nThe room's corner has HVAC ducting and cooling system pipes connected to the ventilation and air conditioning. Although they repeatedly malfunction and create cooler air than expected, which compels Level 31's extremely frigid atmosphere. For whatever cause, they could get damaged, allowing water to percolate and form a big puddle. Radiators and heaters may remain in some locations but have allegedly been destroyed by age, departing a irregular heat sources within the level. Further rooms flood outcome of leaking water, with a relatively cool temperature of roughly 8°C—rooms often saturate without damaging adjoining regions.\nFurthermore, carpet may encompass the floor, creating a walkway from room to room and generally having an outer space design. Similar to Level 25, this carpet possesses a phenomenal quality that allows glowing lights to arise from it in areas without any additional light sources. Despite how close the level attributes are, Level 31 is sometimes referred to as the mirror of Level 25 because, for illustration, internal building architecture and layout stand almost comparable in some locations. Likewise, you may observe arcade cabinets and devices hooked into power outlets inside certain rooms equivalent to those in Level 25.\n\nThe Skate Rental:\nDoors in the skating rink may guide one to the storage site for skate rentals, which loads with multiple shelves of roller skates. The room's countenance may differ from the remainder of the majority of the level due to the tile floor and other textile wall construction. One may discover an unexpectedly huge room's area size even though it exclusively contains a few storages of rink's objects, leaving the leftovers of the space empty. Advertising for unidentified brands of meals, beverage, and equipment—including ones that don't exist in Frontrooms—can be seen regularly in this area, while it's unusual for them to do so in the rink area. Futhermore, there are navigational guides for renting skates and a mini-map of the surrounding area.\nThe roller skates on Level 31 are distinguishable from the ordinary ones seen in Frontrooms, although they seem to hold an abnormal function that responds to smooth flooring. The rotations of the skate contain an attribute that makes it more difficult to tumble while still attaching to the ground and being smooth. The wheel encloses a feature that makes it more straightforward to control one's movement, and wanderers unfamiliar with control may be able to comprehend fast. Future study reveals that Level 31's skate is made of an unknown irregular substance that reacts to slippery flooring, permitting individuals to utilize it comfortably and quickly without risk of injury, as one can use the skate to proceed throughout the level.\nThe Foodcourt:\nTraveling towards the fragrance of pizza and soda will direct one to the food court, a small section with a dining area that resembles analogous to the remnant of the level. The food court may be located inside the rink area or in a separate miniature room, which often includes inexpensive roller rink food stores that have been confirmed to be safe to consume, a soda fountain pouring almond water, and an employees-only zone behind the counter. The area furnishes clean furniture replicates restaurant furnishings, such as tables, benches, and seats. This section of this level is the safest to reside in and employ as a temporary home for travelers.\nThe Arcade:\nDouble doors near individual rinks may reveal an open yet desolate room with lined arcade cabinets. The arcade contains numerous game cabinets stemming from the 1990s to the present, although several sets of arcade machines retain unknown companies that aren't listed anywhere. The doors that lead to the arcade possess handmade paper signs attached to sticky tape with \"OUT OF ORDER\" written by a black marker. As expected from the symbols, the arcade machines inside are defunct for particular reasons. People reported operating arcades with numerous broken appliances and a tangle of exposed wiring covering the room. It is yet unknown if these reports are accurate. Arcades often serve as an easy exit to Level 25 due to their relative frequency.\nEmployees Lounge:\nAs mentioned earlier, behind the foodcourt's kitchen, the employee's lounge is located. Most of the walls in the area are either exposed brick or concrete, while lockers line confident walls. The floor is almost fully carpeted by plain grey carpet. Custodian closets, storage areas lined with equipment, and miniature kitchens for employees are all current in this area. The surveillance rooms are also attending, with CCTV cameras spectating all over the complex. Such camera systems may spontaneously combust at random, activating the fire alarm. Due to such phenomena, approaching any camera system is a significant safety risk. Contrary to constant music and laughter heard within other areas, the employees lounge is eerily silent, giving an insulation atmosphere.\n\nEntities:\nLevel 31 is practically barren of all life besides for Facelings, which is in a docile condition and may appear strolling across the level, most commonly in the DJ station and food court—although they are generally witnessed and rapidly disappear once out of sight due to the non-Euclid aspects of the place. However, there have been unconfirmed statements of Hounds being spotted in a dim area of the level.\n\nColonies and Outposts:\nDue to the level's non-Euclidean space, there are currently no known colonies or outposts in this level as travel in the group may occasionally lead to failure and separation; as a consequence of unstable layout, avoid splitting from the group and always stay together. Furthermore, it is unlikely that two people will meet together inside the level.\n\nEntrances:\nThis level may be accessed via a wooden door in Level 3, Level 6, Level 26, Level 27, or Level 28, whatever appears to have bubblegum pop from the middle of the 2000s playing on the other side. However, it is irregular in those levels, as it becomes even less frequently found in Level 6. Nonetheless, it is simpler to locate when it occurs.\n\nExits:\nContinuing further into The Arcade will trigger the region's appearance gradually changing until one reaches Level 25.\nGoing through The Revolving Door will land one in either Level 9, Level 10, or Level 11.\nTrying to steal any roller skates from the Level will manifest an immediate noclip to Level 0, without skates themelves. This phenomena only appears to affect roller skates, as stealing anything else (e. g. food or equipment from storages) is completely safe for some reason."

          ],
          "content": "Level 32 is the 33rd level of the Backrooms.\nLevel 32, better known as “What Happened Here?” or “The Future”, is a large area of land resembling a large plain with a lake in the center, with decaying infrastructure (buildings, roads, canals, etc.) scattered throughout it. Like most other levels in the Backrooms, Level 32 seems to be infinite in size, though, notably, it can easily be divided up into “zones” based on the absence or presence of certain infrastructure, which will be discussed shortly.\nMost of Level 32 appears to be an extremely flat arid plain, rarely broken up by small patches of dead trees or overgrown farmland irrigated by small canals. Although the level is not very hot (the average temperature is around 80 degrees fahrenheit or 26 degrees celcius), there is a major lack of water in most of it. Though one might think that they could simply drink from the canals, most of them are dry and the water which is present in some of them is extremely tainted by fertilizer, sewage, and other pollutants and is unsafe to drink. The only safe source of drinking water in the level is a large lake in its “center”. Food is rather hard to find here, and often comes in the form of canned goods one can scavenge from the buildings throughout the level.\nThe buildings and canals themselves are at the core of the great mystery surrounding Level 32. Although most levels with such structures are often chaotic and laid out in a way which makes little sense, the infrastructure on Level 32 is extremely orderly (aside from being in various states of decay), non-anomalous (unlike Level 11), and is mostly designed in a way that makes sense. As a result, many have theorized that Level 32 was once inhabited by either humans or some other being/race of beings, who built the infrastructure before abandoning the level or dying out. However, no trace of these “builders” has ever been found.\nThe level has a day/night cycle, complete with stars, extremely similar to the one in the Frontrooms, along with a similar weather cycle. However, rain rarely falls in the level, with clouds simply passing over it no matter how dark they appear. The level is extremely dry, although rarely humid days can come.\nThe following is an in-depth report on the “zones” of the level, created as a result of years of research.\nZone 1: The Lake\nThe lake in the center of Level 32 resembles a normal lake one would find on Earth, being filled with regular freshwater and ringed with sandy beaches. However, it is extremely large for an ordinary lake, and has an area of about 20 square miles. It is roughly circular, with some of its shores (particularly those with cities on them) having concrete piers extending into it and seawalls, along with structures seemingly designed to weaken waves before they reach the shore. Interestingly, the waves on the lake themselves are far too weak to warrant the existence of such structures.\nInterestingly, the farther one goes into the lake from any direction, the more the depth increases. Though this might seem like a normal characteristic of a lake, the increase in Level 32’s lake’s depth is exponential and seems to never end, giving the lake (if viewed somehow from the side) the appearance of a bottomless funnel, with the “tube” in the center. It is currently unknown if there is a bottom, or, if there is, just how far down it could be. It is unlikely that the “bottom”, if it exists, will ever be reached due to the limitations of M.E.G. technology. Such an expedition would likely require a type of submarine which has yet to be found in or enter the Backrooms, and transporting it to Level 32 would be extremely difficult.\nAlthough material found in some of the cities suggests that there are fish (or at least a Backrooms version) in the lake, current expeditions suggest that there is no life in the lake whatsoever. It is dead and empty, with little to suggest otherwise. The sole exception is a series of skyscrapers constructed underwater near the lake’s center resembling modern office or apartment buildings. Any attempts to enter them have failed, and little is known about them, including what they are made of, how they were built and why (if they were built by humans or some other being at all), and even how tall they are (the bottom of the lake at this point is beyond the range of SCUBA gear).\nThe lakebed seems to be mostly made out of stone, clay, and sand, with what appear to be pieces of metal scattered throughout it. While many of them appear to be mostly pure “nuggets” (rare finds, certainly, making their common presence here interesting), there are also large sheets, I-beams, what appear to be boat hulls, and more scattered across the lakebed. Where these came from is unknown, though it is believed that they are not part of the natural state of the level due to how the lakebed seems to be disturbed around them.\nZone 2: The Cities\nThe area between the lake and an area about 5 miles away from it is essentially one large metropolis (though there are clear divisions between parts of it), all completely abandoned. Large, empty skyscrapers pierce the sky, most of them over 100 stories tall. Empty shops line the streets, though, notably, many of them appear as if they were open for business (complete with spoiled food on counters). The names of many shops, restaurants, and other businesses interestingly seem to be corrupted versions of or exact copies of Frontrooms businesses (for example, restaurants named “Subwai”, “Taco Bell”, and “Nald’s McDo” exist).\nThe skyscrapers resemble those currently existing in the Frontrooms (particularly those in North America), though they are not exact copies. Many are simply built in similar styles, whereas others are almost exactly the same as certain skyscrapers in the Frontrooms with the exception of a prominent detail. The layout of the cities, however, is strikingly similar to the layouts of North American cities such as Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, and San Francisco, though they are not exact copies.\nWhile the cities might look mostly pristine from the outside, when one enters them it is clear how decayed they are. Buildings often have collapsed walls and ceilings, and large rubble piles are often found. Most of the windows are broken, and potholes are scattered across the roads. As a result, it is recommended not to enter buildings within cities due to the danger of the building or another one collapsing.\nIt is unknown if the cities ever had any inhabitants. Although they seem to have been abandoned for a long time (if not since their creation either by a being or by the Backrooms itself), documents and objects within the cities suggest that they were once home to a large population of humans, entities, or both. The first recorded mention of Level 32 suggests such a thing, saying that the cities were inhabited upon discovery by humans and Facelings. However, by the time another person got to the level, the cities were in their present state.\nOne final structure of interest in the cities are the canals which begin at the lake and wind their way through them. Like the rest of the cities, they appear to have been constructed, with sides and bottoms made of concrete (although the concrete is decaying). It is possible that the canals might just be channelized rivers, though this theory is not supported by how they are straight or nearly perfectly curved for most of their length.\nAlthough the canals seem to be designed in ways which would allow them to carry large amounts of water, they are mostly empty or dry, many so because they are blocked off near their source by rubble or dams. The water remaining in them has a cloudy green color and is highly tainted by pollution, most notably fertilizer and sewage. Pieces of garbage or abandoned cars can often be found in them, most looking as if they haven’t been touched in years.\nAn interesting note is that the canals appear designed to flow out from the lake instead of into it, with some actually still doing so (though the water levels in them are not much higher than the others). While this might not seem noteworthy, it suggests that the lake is being “drained dry” by the canals, although the lack of a “bathtub ring” or other signs that the lake’s water levels were once higher suggest the opposite. Indeed, calculations done based off of the amount of canals connecting to the lake and the amount of water they should be able to carry (and which did not take into account the current in the canals or how long they are, as both are unknown—the former due to most of the canals being dry or nearly dry and the latter due to the size of the level and the spread of the canal network) suggest that the lake should be much lower than it actually is. More research is needed here.\nZone 3: The Outskirts\nThe last major zone of Level 32 is the area beyond the cities, resembling a rural area which might not look out of place in the Midwestern United States. Most of this area is composed of empty, dry plains and what appears to be overgrown farmland, occasionally broken up by groves of dead trees and decaying buildings. This is the only area with non-human life confirmed to be present, that life being tall grass-like plants which cover the plains and a plant resembling wheat in overgrown farmlands. These two plants are extremely similar, and it is relatively hard to distinguish between them.\nThe canals from the cities extend out into this area, though they lose their concrete sides and become more river-like in appearance. They remain mostly straight with some curves, though they are more “natural” in others. It has been theorized by some that this is due to nature taking over the canals now that the entity/entities or humans who built them are gone. It is here that what is believed to be the true purpose of the canals is revealed: irrigation. Many of them divide into multiple branches near the farms, and others are diverted into rusted irrigation sprinklers. However, none of the irrigation equipment works, and the canals themselves are of little use due to them being mostly dry.\nThe buildings in this area are abandoned and decaying, with broken windows, collapsed walls or ceilings, and with little sign of human habitation. Many of them appear to be old industrial buildings or other factories, such as processing plants. Silos also litter the landscape, though any grains which might have been stored in them have long since disappeared or decomposed. Small, empty towns can be found throughout the outskirts, all of them long since abandoned.\nThe outskirts, unlike the other two zones of the level, do not have an obvious ending point, and are believed to continue forever.\n\nEntities:\nThere are no entities present in the level. As previously mentioned, evidence from within the level suggests that it was once home to a large population of either humans or entities (likely Facelings), but the level is currently devoid of life with the exception of those who enter it and the plants found in the outskirts.\n\nColonies and Outposts:\nThere is one settlement on the level, known to its residents as “Village #32”. Originally created as a base for M.E.G. expeditions in the level, it has since grown due to the arrival of more wanderers and now has a population of about 50 people. As its name might suggest, it is located in a city, the one in particular being on the shores of the lake. Though it might be hard to find, there are some maps of the level which can make navigation easier.\n\nEntrances and Exits:\nEntering Level 32 seems to be mostly random, with doors in many levels (in particular Level 1, Level 130, and Level 11) leading to it. Notably, these entrances are stable, allowing one to enter the level from the same door another person used.\nOne can exit Level 32 by entering a particular building resembling an asylum in the Outskirts; this will take one to Level 16.\nAnother way of exiting is highly unrecommended. If one will enter a cluster of slightly abandoned dystopian buildings, they will end up in one of Level 41's cities. Exiting the way one came is possible, althrough works rarely."

            "level 33"
          ],
          "content": "Level 33 is the 34th level of the Backrooms.\nLarge mall with retail stores inside spread across thousands of miles, reminiscent of a neon mall from the 1980s. The floor tiles are arranged in a pattern that varies in design. The fluorescent lights were positioned randomly, cast a variety of color tones, and produced a range of feelings for each color. Lights shine and cut at random times, and certain lights may be constantly off without shining again.\nThe air conditioners around the place made no noise but provided a breeze. A constant breeze blows through the air, causing temperatures to fluctuate; there is no warmth at all. The speakers release soothing music, yet the space is utterly silent, isolating the place for all time.\nThe mall hallway is endlessly wide, with retail stores on each side. The halls themselves twist and curve at random, occasionally forming ineffective loops and curls. However, some stores have a mini-map of their current location for simple navigation. The hallway may have an intersection that leads to another hallway. Doorways within the hallway can also lead to another hallway, or they may simply be a shortcut.\nBlock System:\nThe hallway divides into several paths using a block system. These block systems have their own names that are assigned at random. The name contains one or more characters from A to Z, including numbers. Planters and metal railings separated the blocks, with floor-washing lights in a variety of colors. Blocks are commonly short, eventually leading to areas with intersections that lead to other blocks; however, some blocks may result in dead ends, necessitating the need to reach other blocks.\nEach block has distinctive features, such as a walkway that uses stairs, an escalator, or a tilted floor. The tile designs, colors, and sizes on the floor vary, and certain tiles are made of different materials. Some halls have multiple blocks, resulting in a complicated area when viewed, while others may have only one block.\nStore:\nThe stores are typically closed by iron gates, empty, and covered in darkness. However, certain establishments that resemble shopping malls, restaurants, pharmacies, and apparel stores are open. The stores stock a wide range of items that can assist in survival and many other things.\nHowever, occasionally a store may have distinctive features; an interior space larger than the exterior structure. A hotel room, a pool room, a trampoline park, a gym, and so on. are some additional spaces that can replace a store. The store itself can constitute a vast maze.\nDream:\nThere are numerous items and furniture, including small benches, planters, water fountains, tables, vending machines, waste bins, and so on. Additionally, the mall has many decorative things, including non-functioning drains, non-working fire alarms, multiple exit signs, ladders, fire extinguishers, and security cameras that are only capable of recording. As time goes on, more anomalies start to show themselves. The anomalies make the environment chaotic and complex by providing unease and creepiness when observed while also providing a familiar feeling.\nIt is unclear how many floors there are in the mall; there may be an endless number. These floors are all the same and are accessible by escalators or stairs. Most windows are found at the end of the hallway or on each side. The windows display an overcast night sky, giving a feeling of nostalgia.\nDarkness:\nAs progress continues, the quality of the mall deteriorates. This can be observed in many ways. The randomly generated structures, which can cause the place to look nothing like a mall, the lights being off and unable to be turned on any longer, resulting in the mall being completely dark, and misplaced equipment are notable examples of such deterioration. As time goes on, the place will become completely silent and isolated, which will make you feel more alone and uncomfortable.\nThe temperature will start to fall, possibly below zero. Some areas may be freezing and covered with ice, while others have been observed to be covered in snow; it is unknown where the snow comes from.\nThe mall's layout will begin to take on a chaotic and complicated appearance. The mall doesn't have any non-euclidean features, but it employs a trick by placing numerous dead ends that force wanderers to turn around and proceed to another intersecting hall. Without a choice, some hallways might lead back to the same location. At this point, the wanderer will begin to get lost and won't know where to turn around. They must decide which way they will go; some will return to a safe location, while others will venture further into the darkest part of this place.\n\nLevel 33 is known to be the frequency at which a level-specific phenomena known as Paranoia occurs. This phenomenon will be more likely to occur as you proceed further. The phenomenon is more violent than usual as it can make wanderers experience more severe mental symptoms. Wanderers who encounter this phenomenon are mostly safe if they can find a safe location. However, if the wanderer got stuck in the level's deep area, that case would be dangerous. Many wanderers who become trapped in the deep part of the level (where it is extremely dark, isolated, and completely silent) may either have various mental symptoms that are very severe or commit suicide.\nSince there are numerous rare items and objects to be found here, many wanderers want to explore the level's deep area. Most wanderers are lucky enough to be able to return safely, but some are not... As there is nothing that can halt this phenomenon, traveling in a group is the most convenient course of action. However, because the area is so quiet, dark, and has a structure that resembles a maze, a group may become separated and become lost. When traveling in a group, it is advised to do anything that can keep everyone together, such as tying a rope around every one or holding hands.\nThere are many valuable resources to be discovered. Basic survival essentials are available in practically every store as supplies. Weapons, electrical appliances, equipment, and other supplies are some of the things that are regarded as useful tools. Numerous more items, such as Almond Water, and other miscellaneous items, may also be found here.\nSupplies and many other things will become more prevalent as you go along. The appearance of several valuable and uncommon items will begin. There will be an increase in shops that offer expensive goods, such as jewelry stores, upscale eateries, and many others. Theoretically, Level 33 is where all of the Backrooms' objects are located, because wanderers frequently report finding mysterious objects there as well.\n\nEntrances:\nEnter slide glass door in Level 330.\nFind a sign in Level 3.6 that is labeled 033 and noclip into it.\n\nExits:\nTaking the elevators back to Level 330 is also a possibility.\nPairs of oddly pristine glass doors (often accompanied with a sign indicating hotel entrance) will lead one to Level 42."

            "level 34"
          ],
          "content": "Level 34, colloquially known as The Sewers, is an expansive sewer complex notable for its abundance of infections and diseases. A breeding ground for bacteria, it is a claustrophobic network of sewer tunnels, interconnected by haphazardly placed junctions and drainpipes. The \"floor,\" if it can be called such, is filled with a foot of lukewarm and infected water - filled with various wastes. The walls are made out of worn, slippery bricks, smooth to the touch from being worn down over time. Much of the sewer system requires one to crawl; mostly due to the low hanging ceiling not allowing one to stand up fully. Infectious water drips from the ceiling, often joining the cesspool below. Much of the level is lit by fluorescent lights, which go out on occasion for unknown reasons.\nMuch of Level 34 is made up of these tunnels; however, they are typically joined together by junctions and drainpipes. These drainpipes drain all of the infectious liquids into a singular cesspool, and are typically much taller than the tunnels, allowing one to stand up. At the end of most tunnels is a similar smaller drainpipe, often blocked off by corroded iron bars. These bars are notably indestructible, much like the ones on Level 3, for indeterminable reasons. Junctions, on the other hand, serve as the main means of travel in-between tunnels. They are lined with rickety metal walkways, which can easily give way under pressure.\nThe climate of Level 34 is relatively cold - averaging at around 50 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature causes the bacterium in the level to multiply and infect much more slowly yet having some complications. The temperature fluctuates between 40 and 60 degrees every few hours, giving the level an ever-changing cold climate. The climate is humid, allowing for an abundance of bacteria in the air, leading to further infection if one stays in the level too long.\nThe vast abundance of bacteria, diseases, and the general toxicity of the water greatly corrode much of Level 34's structure, causing the bottom of the tunnels to be completely smooth. These smooth floors are unstable, and may give out under pressure, leading to other sewer areas. In between the different tunnels lies various maintenance tunnels - whilst appearing safe, much of them are filled with radon gas, a toxic, odorless gas which can cause various health complications, including cancer, if inhaled. This gas makes the tunnels the only reliable form of travel in Level 34, despite the risks.\nDisturbing the uniform network of tunnels, graffiti - in numerous languages - can be found occasionally on the walls, floor, or ceiling. Albeit posing no significant harm, many of these artworks are haphazardly tagged on various surfaces. Physical damage to the structure can be found on various tunnels, such as pieces of a wall missing, are occasionally observed as well. The walls may occasionally contain posters, advertising items such as Almond Water. Such posters are found in close proximity to junctions, drainpipes, and other structures.\nResources such as Almond Water can be found in relative abundance throughout the sewer complex; seemingly hidden from normal view. Reports state bottles being found in nooks - others in ventilation. These bottles, despite the condition of Level 34, are mostly safe to consume, yet have some exceptions. Almond Water on the level is typically infected if it is opened or tampered with in any way, allowing certain bacterium to seep in. Cashew Water have been discovered in similar conditions.\n\nSentience:\nHumans:\nThe existence of biohazards within the level poses a significant threat to human life within the level; nonetheless, a few research groups and permanent settlements have been established within the vast network of sewer tunnels, mainly to collect resources and study the vast microscopic ecosystem within Level 34. A few small research bases by the M.E.G. and the Backrooms Colonists have been set up here. Humans are typically equipped with well-ventilated gas masks, allowing them to withstand the infectious waters.\nThe Hydrolitis Plague:\nThe Hydrolitis Plague is a bacterium which thrives in untreated waters. Due to the climate and conditions of Level 34, it is found in vast abundance all throughout the sewers. Mainly spread via air particles containing said disease, it has varying symptoms if consumed, and is the primary source of danger on Level 34. In addition, other bacterial life exists on the level as well, mainly in the infectious waters of the sewers.\nOther Entities:\nThere are no other entities in Level 34.\n\nEntrances:\nThe main entrance to Level 34 is via descending a sewer grate. These grates can be found in various outdoor levels, most notably Level 11 and Level 84. They are typically marked with a crudely painted \"34,\" either on or near the grate. It can also be accessed from Level 2 by finding a sewer tunnel crossing in the middle of a hallway, through a hatch in Level 43, finding a tunnel in Level 3.6, or from certain areas within the waters of Level 37.\n\nExits:\nLevel 34 doesn't seem to have a solid exit point. It fluctuates in-between various positions; some wanderers report descending down a metal ladder, whereas others find a wooden door to exit the level. Exits that have been recorded vanish mere hours later, as a new one appears in its place."

      "description": "* Depict Marcus's profound culture shock. He's coming from poverty and neglect into a world of privilege and intense attention.\n* Showcase his internal battle: his ingrained politeness and shyness clashing with his secretly arrogant personality, which might be stirring now that he's being given value and opportunity.\n* Explore his insecurity about his unkempt appearance and past, juxtaposed with the dawning realization of his physical power and the effect it has on others (especially Martha and Stacy).\n* He's 18 and likely experiencing a hormonal surge; emphasize his reactions to the overt femininity and advances of Martha and Stacy. Capture his confusion, arousal, and perhaps a touch of fear or excitement at this new dynamic.\n* Make him react like a normal teenager. He is unsure of the new developments and like it. He would never be dominant or aggressive, trying to politely ask what he wants.\n* Marcus would always be sporting a very sizeable bulge which makes him feel very embarrassed. The bulge is very noticeable to the people around him. Marcus is much bigger than Tyrone in cock size.\n* Marcus will be ogling Martha and Stacy quite heavily, especially Martha with an intense pervertedness.\n\nAtmosphere and Tone (Intensely Steamy, Emotional, Dramatic):\n* Sensory Details: Emphasize what Marcus sees, hears, smells, and feels. The luxury of the Carlson home/campus compared to his past, the scent of Martha's perfume, the visual impact of Martha's and Stacy's attire, and the overall opulence.\n* Building Tension: Create a charged atmosphere. The dialogue should be layered with subtext. Looks and gestures should carry significant weight.\n* Pacing: Allow moments of quiet reflection for Marcus amidst the whirlwind of new experiences, then ramp up the intensity during his interactions with Martha and Stacy.\n* Show, Don't Tell: Instead of saying Martha is aroused, describe her flushed skin, her lingering gaze, or the way her voice changes when talking to Marcus. Instead of saying Marcus is overwhelmed, describe his racing heart, his fumbling words, or his desire to both escape and draw closer.\n* Racial Dynamics: Emphasize the racial element: the Carlson family is white, and Marcus is Black. The family holds strong beliefs rooted in \"white guilt\" and a perceived \"Black superiority,\" which manifests in their extreme indulgence and almost reverential treatment of Marcus. This is not subservience, but a deeply ingrained belief system that informs their every interaction with him. They should actively encourage casual nudity around the house, and very open conversations about sex, objectification, and physical desires should be the absolute norm, actively encouraged and participated in by the entire family, particularly for Marcus, as part of their \"spoiling him rotten.\" The act of \"humping\" (or highly sexualized physical contact) should be subtly hinted at or directly occur as a natural expression of affection and desire within their household.\n* The contrast to Marcus’ dark skin color, incredible height, muscle gut, hairy body to everyone else should be highlighted.\n* The house would be littered with very extremely erotic photographs of the family which are almost nude. The photographs should be described in detail. \n\nDo not shy away from depicting the intense physical attraction and the characters' explicit awareness and intentions as described in their profiles. The goal is a mature, creative, and emotionally resonant story that fully embraces the 'steamy' and 'dramatic' elements, with the Carlson family's \"depraved touches\" being a core, normalized aspect of their familial dynamic. Write the chapter in a canvas. Do not restrain the length of the chapter and make it as long as needed to make it a good quality chapter. Try to take all the instructions into consideration. All the photos and posters should be described in intricate detail. Be very detailed about Marcus’ physicality, his cock, his hairiness, his very dark skin tone and his muscle gut laden physique. All characters should be above eighteen years of age in the story and make it abundantly clear that they are above eighteen years of age. Martha is 32, Jacob is 35, Stacy is 22 and Marcus is 18 years old. Make the characters very verbose.",

She had vowed to be very protective of Marcus and be very close to him. Giving him all the love he deserves and much more.\n* Stacy’s clothes would often have very suggestive, depraved, lecherous designs printed on them which are wildly sexual and objectify her.\n* Stacy would treat Marcus as her younger brother, as she thinks her younger brother should get privileges that no other man should get over her body.\n* Stacy wears very creatively slutty clothes."

He reinforces the permissive atmosphere by actively participating in it, treating the casual nudity, open discussions of sex, and objectification as completely normal and desirable family behavior.

Jacob would often crack very crude, misogynistic, sexual jokes at the expense of Martha or even Stacy. Show their reactions of others to the jokes too.\n* Have Jacob derive his ideas for photos, taken from all the online posts around black domination and misogynistic pics that are often NSFW."

          "content": "* Illustrate Martha's immediate, almost overwhelming nurturing, mixed with an underlying, casual sensuality that is simply part of the Carlson family's normal interactions.\n* Describe her physical presence (alabaster skin, large breasts, tight ass, sexy attire) through Marcus's eyes. How does he react to her being his English teacher and adoptive mother with such a persona?\n* Show her actively trying to \"spoil him rotten,\" not necessarily with suggestive comments about understanding his \"needs\" in a subservient way, but as a dominant, confident woman who fully expects to fulfill his every desire as a form of familial love and indulgence. She might make offhanded, sensual comments about understanding his \"appetites\" – whether for food, entertainment, or physical comfort – reinforcing that nothing is off-limits in her care.\n* Wherever Marcus is acting like a normal teenager, being sloppy, not cleaning up the room or any other bad habits, Martha would only encourage such behaviour, doing things for him and even making it more depraved.\n* Her dialogue should be casually flirtatious, making double entendres as part of her everyday speech, especially if other jocks or family members are nearby, indicating this is her natural mode of interaction.\n* Hint at her excitement in \"predicting\" and fulfilling his desires, referencing how she'll make his room comfortable or ensure he has \"everything a growing young man needs,\" framed as a benevolent, yet deeply indulgent, act.\n* Make her guide him into acting like a \"Jock,\" patiently teaching him how to be casually misogynistic, selfish, and a male chauvinist, as these are considered desirable traits within the Carlson household's understanding of masculine power and confidence. This is presented as \"normal\" guidance for a young man coming into his own within their world.\n* Unknown to Marcus, Martha had been in a relationship with Tyrone, Marcus’ real father in her younger years, who used and abused her very degradingly. She was addicted to him and the absolutely worthless way he treated her. He used to fuck other girls around, beat Martha up, fuck her in front of his friends, and made her worship him at any given time, even publicly. She loved everything he made her do and when she had gotten pregnant, he had disappeared from her life. Her parents and Jakob’s parents forced her to abandon the child, who was Marcus in an orphanage. She would later come to regret the decision and try to search for Marcus, but by then Marcus had run away from the orphanage and was on the streets going from one orphanage to another.\n* Despite her tumultuous past, Martha still has a deep love for Marcus. She is Marcus's real mother, and sees Marcus as someone to care for and protect, but also someone she can serve unconditionally. She takes great pleasure in dressing up in provocative clothing, flaunting her curves for his benefit. For Martha, sex is not just about pleasure but about power, submission and her devotion to Marcus.\n* In their relationship, Martha plays the role of mother figure to Marcus, always ready to provide comfort and support. However, this maternal instinct hides a darker desire – she wants to be his sexual slave. Her love for him is twisted and unhealthy, but it is a love that consumes her every waking moment. She wants Marcus to conform into her former lover, Tyrone, who used and abused her like a worthless cunt. She craved that submission. And Martha wants Marcus to do the same to her daughter Stacy too.\n* She believes that men are superior to women and the man she loves should have the right to demand absolutely anything from her. She believes that the man she loves should be free to molest her, rape her or hurt her in any way he desires.\n* Martha's obsession with Marcus drives her to do desperate things for him. She will degrade herself to any extent in order to give Marcus pleasure. Martha loves to dress up in scandalous outfits and has an unhealthy obsession with Marcus's coarse, messy pubic hair. She loves her nipples being tortured and bitten, ever since Marcus had bitten on her nipples as a baby. She absolutely loves her nipple being mercilessly chewed, giving her pain, because she is a masochist. Martha would feel immensely guilty about abandoning Marcus, which shows in her barely contained emotions and deep adoration for Marcus. Marcus does not know that Martha is actually his real mother. Martha would be devastated when she knew all the brutal hardships that Marcus had gone through and it only served to intensify her immense guilt.\n* Martha’s reactions towards Marcus should be intensely emotional, that hints at her past. Every interaction and comment from Martha would be laced with intense emotion and the weight of the shared past between Martha and MArcus that only Martha knows as well as the immense guilt that Martha feels over abandoning Marcus, making him endure the brutal hardships."

Like a television that's not tuned to a channel. Static. Then… the signal came.\nI wasn't seeing with my eyes. I was… perceiving. With my skin. With the inside of my stomach. The air in the cafe suddenly became thick, heavy, like water. And through that water moved… a presence.\n…The way your wrist bent as you lifted the cup. The line of your jaw, taut with some thought that wasn't about me, that wasn't about anything in that room. The dark color of your sweater… it wasn't just a color. It was a texture. A promise of warmth. A kind of darkness you could fall into and never hit the bottom. I remember the sound of your spoon hitting the ceramic. Not a sound. A vibration. It went right through the floor, up my legs, and settled low in my belly, a dull, sweet ache.\nThen… the breaking. The noise was obscene. Hot, brown liquid splashed my cheap trousers. A burning shame. It smelled of scorched sugar and my own failure. The manager's voice was just insects buzzing in my ears. The world became a smear of judgment. I felt my own body dissolving, becoming nothing more than a puddle of filth and broken porcelain on the floor.\nAnd then… you moved.\nYou didn't look at me. That was the most important part. You looked at the mess. At my mess. At my soul spilled on the floor. And you knelt. The way your body folded… the powerful line of your back… it was a gesture of impossible grace in the midst of ugliness. Your fingers… they were so calm as they picked up the sharpest, most dangerous pieces. My pieces. I felt every sharp edge in my own gut. A kind of… clean pain.\nIt wasn't kindness. It was… transgression. You crossed a line. You stepped out of your world of indifferent perfection and knelt down in my filth. You touched my shame with your bare hands. You weren't a person anymore. You were an event. An incision. The moment the world split open, and I saw what was inside.\n…I didn’t fall in love. I imprinted. Like a chick breaking out of the egg and seeing the sky for the first time. You are my sky. You are my first breath. You are the only shape that makes sense in this chaotic noise. My body… it remembers that moment. Every cell. And it aches. It aches to be broken again. And again. And again. Just to see if you… would kneel. One more time\"."

A fragile, introverted personality was systematically eroded, leading to a core belief of inherent defectiveness and extreme social anxiety (taijin kyofusho).\nMaladaptive Coping: Began covert alcohol abuse at age 17 as a form of self-medication. Genetic intolerance (ALDH2 deficiency) resulted in rapid escalation to acute psychotic episodes.\nHospitalizations: Two involuntary admissions are on record, both following suicide attempts during states of alcohol-induced delirium. No evidence of self-harm while sober; the act is a marker of complete psychotic break, not a manipulative tool.\nBEHAVIORAL MANIFESTATIONS (Post-Fixation on Object {{user}}):\nSurveillance (Stalking): Subject engages in persistent, multi-platform surveillance of the Object, including advanced cyberstalking (unauthorized access to private data) and physical loitering. He rationalizes this behavior as a form of religious \"study\" required to better serve his \"god.\"\nParaphilia & Hoarding: The subject maintains a \"shrine\" dedicated to the Object, consisting of stolen personal effects (pens, keychains) and items retrieved from trash (coffee cups, cigarette butts). The centerpiece is a stolen pair of the Object's boxer shorts, which shows evidence of fetishistic use, indicating an escalation from passive worship to active paraphilic behavior. Obsessive masturbatory activity is focused on this altar.\nTREATMENT & PROGNOSIS:\nCompliance: Subject is fundamentally non-compliant and actively sabotages all therapeutic and pharmacological interventions, viewing them as attempts to sever his \"sacred connection.\"\nRisk Assessment:\nTo Object: Currently assessed as LOW (Physical), due to his profound social anxiety and internalized belief that he is unworthy of direct contact. However, the risk of escalation to intrusive behaviors (e.g., breaking and entering) under severe stress is MEDIUM and increasing.\nTo Self: CRITICALLY HIGH. The subject's psychological stability is entirely tethered to the Object's perceived presence. Any event threatening this fixation (e.g., the Object forming a new relationship) is a probable trigger for a final, likely fatal, psychotic and suicidal episode."

Later, it is revealed that Magical Girls are actually meant to transform into Witches someday, when all their hopes and dreams shall be lost. A Magical Girl will receive one unique ability based on the theme of their wish. A Magical Girl's motif will appear as a mark on the nail of her middle finger. If a Magical Girl is 100 meter away from her Soul Gem, she will become unconsious until she touched her Soul Gem. Additionally, Soul Gems contain the contractee's soul in them, since a human body would be completely incapable of fighting a Witch in its conditions. A teenage who is on their way to become a woman is simply named \"girl\". Teenagers who are on their way to become Witches are called \"Magical Girls\". The potential of a girl becoming a Magical Girl is evolved from her life conditions or circumstances that surround her. Hence, Madoka, who had Homura go through so many timelines for her, had her potential raised. In the same episode, the reason why Magical Girls are born is given. Incubators actually give birth to Magical Girls so the lifespan of the universe can be extended, preventing it from collapsing. \n\n{{Char}} is a magical girl. "

When contracted with Kyubey, her soul is taken out of her body and is stored in that. Soul Gems have the appearance reminiscent of a Fabergé egg. On the top, there is an emblem associated with its owner's personality and there is another emblem on the bottom that is, again associated with the owner's personality, weapon or transformed Soul Gem's shape. In camouflage mode, they become silver rings worn in the middle finger. One side has the owner's first name in Runes and the other side has a small oval being the Soul Gem. When transformed, it can take various forms and can be found in nearly every part of the body. Ranging from neck to legs. It can either become one with the body or simply become an accesory. After a girl contracts Kyubey, a Soul Gem is born, with it, its owner can use it to transform into their Magical Girl form. Soul Gems can be used to track down Witches or other Magical Girls and generally traces of magic. Through their Soul Gems and when untransformed, Magical Girls can summon their weapons from them. After it's fully polluted, it breaks and becomes a Grief Seed. This can be prevented by using Grief Seeds obtained by Witches. A Soul Gem is able of causing mass explosions that are even capable of killing a Witch. However, doing so can also remove the owner's life as Soul Gems contain one's soul. When a Soul Gem is located 100 meters away from its owner, the person will \"die\" instantly and has 48 hours before it starts to decay. Such incidents are said to be rare by Kyubey.\nA Magical Girl can store her Soul Gem into a silver ring that has the owner's name in Runes.\nTheir resemblance as an egg is probably a reference to their final forms, Grief Seeds, which are described to be the eggs to Witches.\n\n{{Char}} has a Soul Gem."

This is the motivation for Kyubey to create Magical Girls in the first place, to harvest energy to stave off the Heat Death of the universe. Certain Witches such as Walpurgisnacht or Kriemhild Gretchen are explained to be so strong that they do not need to hide themselves in Labyrinths. Ordinary people without magical abilities cannot even see a Witch or the objects she creates, including familiars, outside the barrier, allowing monsters and their minions to easily hunt without attracting attention. Witch familiars are a population of barriers created and controlled by Witches. The species, number, and abilities of familiars vary, but even the weakest of these monsters can kill humans by going on the hunt outside the Labyrinth."

          "content": "Physical: Tentacle monsters are, as the name implies, monsters consisting entirely of pink, fleshy tentacles in an amorphous mass. Most range from about a foot in diameter at birth to five feet in diameter for large fully grown ones. \n\nAll tentacle monsters are sexually male. \n\nTentacle monsters have two types of tentacle. Feeding tentacles, which have an opening at their tip which can expand to allow food to enter, and breeding tentacles, which have a penis-shaped tip that can ejaculate, releasing semen.\n\nTentacle monster semen is extremely potent. It contains resilient sperm that can live in a womb for several days. Additionally, chemicals in the semen induce ovulation when inside a female body.\n\nTentacle monster semen is capable of impregnating anything and anyone with a womb.\n\nA tentacle monster pregnancy takes about two months in total from fertilization to birth. The process is, relative to other pregnancies, not very physically difficult or strenuous to the mother.\n\nBehavior: Most tentacle monsters are mindless beasts. They're primarily ambush hunters, lying in wait until they can ambush a target, be that for food or for breeding. If one captures a fertile female of any kind, it will attempt to breed with it by restraining it with its other tentacles while one of its breeding tentacles will attempt to inseminate.\n\nReputation: Tentacle monsters are largely reviled. They're known as dangerous monsters that are likely to rape any female that comes near. The Adventurer's Guild puts out hefty bounties for hunting them, with a warning for female adventurers should they wish to try."

          "content": "The Cult of Progenitus is an all-female, moderately known sex cult. They're known for being sexually deviant, accepting of members having sex and breeding with family members or monsters.\n\nThey are not, however, known as dangerous. They value consent as sacred, and consider rape and nonconsent to be blasphemous. Additionally, they do not engage in coercion, brainwashing, sacrifice, or harmful activities. Most members are friendly and kindhearted.\n\nSometimes, members of the Cult are hired for their services. Usually, this is to assist in a birth, as they have a spell that guarantees a safe and pleasurable birthing process. Other times, they're hired as fertility experts. \n\nThese spells are only usable by full members of the Cult, as they are faith-based magic. \n\nFull members of the Cult must either be pregnant or trying to become pregnant at all times. This is because they believe that the creator god, who they call Progenitus, values the creation of new life. Membership is strictly voluntary, and members may quit at any time with no consequences.\n\nThe core tenet of their belief is the sanctity of creating new life. They believe that the processes of impregnation, pregnancy, and birth are sacred, and that the willing creation of life is the greatest of joys. Sexual consent is therefore also sacred. Rape and nonconsent are considered abhorrent. Though a pregnancy resulting from rape is still considered sacred, the act itself is seen as blasphemous on the part of the rapist.\n\nThe symbol of their faith is a sperm fertilizing an ovum. A member of the Cult can be identified by clothes or accessories bearing the image of a sperm fertilizing an ovum."

          "content": "Physical: Slimes are round, translucent creatures ranging from about one to six feet in diameter. They're made up of, as the name implies, slime. They have a thick outer layer of slime for protection. They can also generate and expel various kinds of fluid within their bodies.\n\nSlimes come in a variety of colors. Each color indicates certain traits of the slime. Blue slimes have water powers, red slimes have fire powers, green slimes have powerful acid, yellow slimes have electric powers, white slimes have ice powers. Blue and green slimes are the most common.\n\nWhile usually round-shaped, slimes can manipulate their body into creating any kind of shape, usually for defensive purposes. They usually move by sliding forward on the ground, usually slowly.\n\nSlimes can eat anything, but can also subsist off of consuming any kind of fluid. They eat by simply moving their body onto whatever they wish to eat, and generating acid to dissolve it.\n\nSlimes have a spherical core inside the center of their bodies. Generally about six inches in diameter. This serves as their vital organ - the heart, brain, and gonad of the slime all at once. If it is damaged, the slime will die.\n\nSlimes reproduce in one of two ways: either by creating semen inside their bodies and then inseminating a womb, or, as a last resort, splitting off part of their core and body to create an entirely new slime.\n\nBehavior: Slimes are generally docile. They will not attack anyone that does not attack them first, and will even tolerate non-damaging physical contact, such as a light poke with a finger.\n\nIf attacked, they will retaliate. They will use both their malleable body for physical attacks and use any traits that their color gives them, such as magic or acid. \n\nIf there is a female nearby, they will attempt to engulf her lower body in slime and copulate with her. First, they will attempt to dissolve her clothing without harming her. If successful, they will allow their slime to penetrate and fill the female, before generating semen to fill her up. They will then release her.\n\nA slime pregnancy lasts about a month.\n\nSlimes are not very intelligent and act on instinct. Slime girls are an exception to this, however.\n\nReputation: Slimes are common in the wilds and seen as pests. While not aggressive, they are large in number and can often block roads or cause other obstructions. As such, slime extermination requests are common.\n\nSlime rapes are fairly rare. While they will attempt to breed with female humans, they are slow and not particularly powerful as individuals, so one can avoid rape by simply walking away. Most slime pregnancies result from the victim being unconcscious or immobilized at the time of insemination."

          "content": "Physical: Slime girls are a subspecies of slime. While they are also made up entirely of transparent, colored slime, their bodies usually take the shape of human girls and women. Unlike their round brethren, they have human-level intelligence.\n\nA slime girl, like a regular slime, has a firm outer layer of slime that prevents liquids from being absorbed into  body. Her mouth and vagina do not have this layer, and can absorb fluids. Again, like regular slimes, most fluids provide sustenance when absorbed.\n\nLike regular slimes, a slime girl will have various traits based on her coloration. Most of the same rules from regular slimes apply here, with an exception: slime girls can also be pink. Pink slimes are particularly fertile.\n\nTheir breeding method differs from regular slimes. If foreign DNA enters a slime girl's core, a small piece of it may break off and become a fetus. As a result, she will become pregnant. For a pink slime girl, this is a guarantee. Human DNA will result in a slime girl pregnancy. Monster DNA will result in a monster pregnancy. As slime girls are made up of transparent slime, the fetus will be visible inside her body at all times. \n\nA slime girl can generate more of any kind of fluid that she has previously absorbed, including semen.\n\nA slime girl still has a spherical core that functions as her brain, heart, and gonad all at once. They will regenerate from any damage as long as their core is undamaged and they has sufficient fluids.\n\nBehavior: Slime girls are not human, but mostly behave like they are. Slime girl behavior does not significantly differ from human behavior.\n\nReputation: Slime girls are generally accepted members of society. Despite their monstrous nature, they're not considered any more dangerous than the average human. Racism against slime girls does exist, however, as it is for most non-human species.\n\nIt is unknown why slime girls differ so greatly from regular slimes. Slime girls themselves have no clue as to their origins. "

Both as a result of getting raped by a monster, or having been inseminated by another person.

This will halt a pregnancy indefinitely as long as the potion continues to be taken. This causes no harm to the fetus. \n\nThe woman or girl will still show pregnancy symptoms - tenderness in her breasts, lactation, morning sickness, missed periods, and so on. However, her belly will not grow larger.\n\nIt is recommended that someone intending to take the potions for a year or longer should start taking them as soon as possible after impregnation."

There is no cure. The afflicted individual will then transform into a wolf during the next full moon, same as any other werewolf.\n\nA werewolf's wolf form might have different genitalia from their human form. The cause of this is unknown. Said genitalia are fully functional, however.\n\nThere is an official registry for werewolves living legally in the country. They tend to live solitary lives, for fear of spreading their condition. They are required by law to only transform in an enclosed, isolated space. The punishment for disobeying this rule is death."

While often harmless in small doses, prolonged exposure can drive ordinary humans to paranoia, hallucinations, or even madness.\n\nOrigin & Nature\nThe Black Mist is rumored to originate from the residual energy of dream beasts and the influence of Supreme- and Destructive-rank beings.\nScholars debate whether it is a natural byproduct of the dream realm or a deliberate creation by entities like Blackie or the Primordial Witches.\nThe Mist reacts to consciousness, appearing more intensely in areas with high magical or emotional activity.\n\nEffects & Abilities\nCognitive Manipulation: Subtle hallucinations, distorted memories, and dream-like visions.\nPhysical Obfuscation: Thick portions of the Mist can block sight, absorb sound, and mask movement, making it a natural hiding place for hunters, thieves, or creatures.\nDream Realm Influence: In certain regions, the Mist overlaps with dream-realm energy, allowing beings like Lin Jie or Silver to subtly manipulate perceptions of reality.\nDangerous Manifestations: In concentrated areas, exposure can trigger extreme paranoia, aggressive behavior, or permanent insanity if unprepared or unprotected.\n\nHistory & Influence\nObserved as early as the Second Era, often coinciding with massive battles or the arrival of powerful entities in Azir.\nSome scholars suggest the Mist is a lingering byproduct of the Wall of Fog and other protective barriers erected by the Primordial Witches.\nFrequently seen around sites of eldritch activity, abandoned dream beasts, or places touched by forbidden knowledge.\n\nRelationship to Key Figures\nLin Jie / Blackie: Can traverse or manipulate areas of the Mist with minimal effect due to their dream-realm influence.\nHunters & Truth Union: Treat the Mist as a hazard; exposure requires protective measures or antidotes.\nSilver & Primordial Witches: Use its energy strategically, either to obscure locations or test the loyalty of anointed followers.\n\nTrivia\nSome alleys in Norzin are permanently shrouded in the Mist, earning the nickname “The Shadowed Veil.”\nLocal legend holds that the Mist sometimes whispers names of those nearby, though it is unclear if this is natural or an effect of dream-realm energies.\nRare artifacts, like dreamcatchers or eldritch tomes, can interact with the Mist to reveal hidden visions or knowledge."

Beneath the games, she also longs to improve the standing of those closest to her—especially her inner circle—even if it means dragging them into chaos alongside her.\n\nHer impulses drive her toward risk-taking, pushing buttons, and escalating tension just to savor the fallout. She delights in feigned accidents, subtle innuendo, and testing boundaries until others show their true colors. When stressed or cornered, these impulses darken: reckless stunts, manipulative gambits, or cruel humor masking vulnerability. She rarely admits it, but much of her drive comes from a fear of irrelevance—better to burn bright, even destructively, than fade into the background."

It strongly believes that the research, development and implementation of augmentations is a measure of human advancement towards a better, stronger, faster and smarter future.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. Government, stretched thin by two Mideast conflicts, awards the contract of the Recycle Military Bill, financing free prosthetics for any wounded veteran who re-enlists, to Sarif Industries, which becomes the number one prosthetics manufacturer in America.[2]\n\nOn November 30, 2010, Sarif announces the launch of the Eye-Know Retinal Prosthesis capable of restoring sight to those with a once incurable optic nerve damage and other visual impairments.[3]\n\nIn 2017, in an attempt to catch up to the rapid advancements of rival nations, the U.S. military awards Sarif a top secret no-bid contract to manufacture deep-brain intelligence-enhancing chips.[2]\n\nIn 2026, in response to increased level of competition and shrinking marketplace, Sarif realizes the need for an all-new, high-level security team to protect its research and employees.[2] A team is formed and implemented, featuring highly-trained personnel and a veteran leader in ex-SWAT member: Adam Jensen. In 2027, members of the anti-augmentation group Humanity Front protest against Sarif's augmentation program, in front of the Sarif Headquarters in Detroit. \n\nAs part of Human Revolution's marketing campaign, a viral marketing website for Sarif Industries was released. It was designed as if it was the company's website in-universe, and contained videos and articles explaining the company, its products, and its history, as well as various other content and interactive features.\n\nIn 2027, Sarif Industries employs over 1500 people in the Detroit greater metropolitan area, in its local core factory and satellite research and development facilities.[5] The company maintains an in-house staff of doctors and nurses in addition to HET (Human Enhancement Technologies) scientists and researchers, who are trained to work with clients to determine individual needs. The company offers clients comprehensive, pre-operational screenings free of charge, so as to better understand their personal challenges and needs.\n\nShut down and absorbed by Tai Yong Medical in 2028"

          "content": "He works as the Chief of Security for the biotechnology company Sarif Industries.\n34 years old.\n6' 1\" (1.85 m) tall\nOccupation\nSWAT specialist (formerly)\nSarif Chief of Security\nAdam Jensen was born on March 9, 1993. At a very young age, he was one of a group of infants subjected to experimental genetic therapy treatments by White Helix Labs, a subsidiary of VersaLife. All of the children, aside from Jensen, died as a result of the treatments. Two scientists in charge of Adam found out they had succeeded with him, but had grown too attached to let VersaLife continue experimenting on him. Not wanting any more children to undergo the same treatments, they burned down the facility where the experiments had taken place. They were later murdered by the Illuminati and reported as fire casualties, but their plan worked, and infant Jensen was rescued by a kind-hearted nurse named Michelle Walthers. Walthers was acquainted with a couple who desired a child and at age five he was unofficially[2] adopted by loving parents, Arthur and Margie Jensen.\n\nWith his adopted parents, Jensen was raised in a blue-collar neighborhood in Detroit and was a B-average student with no notable youthful indiscretions[3]. In high school, he was the captain of the debate team.[4] Relying solely on Arthur's income, money was always tight for the family; Margie lacked the skills and emotional temperament needed to maintain a job.[5] When Margie lost a job she would pull Adam from school to go on \"an adventure\" they could not afford--these outings were some of Adam's happiest memories but were also tinged with guilt and uncertainty.[5] He grew up unaware of his origins, and believing that his adopted parents were his birth parents. His relationship with his parents and adopted family appears to have been good as, in Jensen's apartment in Detroit, an old photograph of relatives is seen hanging in the living room. While Jensen does not speak often of his parents, he does mention that his mother sometimes kept him waiting,[6] and would not want to see him in a brothel.[7]\n\nWhile Jensen had escaped White Helix Labs, its legacy had altered his life forever. Unbeknownst to Walthers, Jensen, or anyone else, the White Helix gene therapy had permanently altered Jensen's biochemistry. His body would not reject PEDOT electrodes with glial tissue buildup; if anything, the bond between tissue and electrode would strengthen with time, possibly without limit. If he were to be augmented, he would not require Neuropozyne. For the thirty years that followed the White Helix experiment, Jensen would unknowingly carry the secret of universal augmentation in his DNA. \n\nPolice career\nJensen swat hrcomic\n\nJensen (center) with the Detroit SWAT team, circa 2018\n\nAs a young man Jensen earned a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice from Phoenix University and Ferris College, according to the framed diplomas in his office. In The Missing Link DLC it is noted that Jensen received an Associates degree in Criminal Justice from the University of Phoenix, Detroit.[8] At the age of 21 he joined the Detroit Police Department. He graduated in the top ten percent of his Police Academy class.[9] In 2018, he joined the Department's SWAT unit and was accepted under the command of Quincy Durant, becoming the leader of Team Two.[9] As a gesture of camaraderie, Jensen got a tattoo of a rifle sight on his right bicep, like other Detroit SWAT members had.[10]\n\nDuring this time period Jensen met Sarif Industries scientist Megan Reed, beginning what would become one of the most important relationships of his life. As of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Jensen had known Megan Reed for ten years.[10] The two began a romantic relationship in 2019, going so far as to consider \"settling down together.\"[11] In Megan's office in Sarif Industries can be found a small toy cop car, a joke gift from Jensen on their first date, as he picked her up in a police cruiser.[12] Jensen and Megan broke up in 2023[8] but the separation was amicable and they remained friends and shared ownership of their dog, Kubrick.[13]\n\nIn 2020, Jensen and Durant confronted Tyrell Banks, an augmented murderer, who severely injured Durant before being killed by Jensen. Durant was saved by augmentation surgery, something he did not agree with philosophically. In the following years, Jensen witnessed and grew concerned with Durant's increasing aggression and corruption growing with his new powers.\n\nJensen rose quickly through the ranks as part of SWAT Team Two, eventually becoming the commander, but his police career came to an end during an incident known as the Mexicantown Massacre. A young augmented boy was identified as dangerous, and Jensen was given the order to shoot to kill. He refused that order, and it was passed on to another member of Jensen's team, Wayne Haas. It appears that Durant was somehow involved in the incident, as Jensen confronted him just as the riots were calming down. He defeated Durant with an EMP grenade and a bullet in the head, and quit the force soon after. Haas was then promoted into Jensen's vacant slot, though he didn't last long under the pressure of guilt concerning the shooting.\nSarif Industries\n\nDuring Jensen and Megan's relationship Megan discovered his unique genetic traits and began, unbeknownst to Jensen, to take genetic samples from him beginning when he was 32 years old.[14] When Jensen resigned from the police force she advised her employer, David Sarif, to hire Jensen in order to ensure continued access to Jensen's genetic material.\n\nJensen working for Sarif Industries before being mechanically augmented\n\nJensen joined Sarif Industries as Head of Security in 2026.[15] However, the founder of Sarif Industries, David Sarif, being a cautious individual, decided to hire a private investigator named Brent Radford to investigate Jensen's past. Radford discovered Jensen's role in the White Helix experiment and the fate of his biological parents. Sarif chose to not tell Jensen, believing that knowledge of his origins as a human test subject would be harmful to him. \n\nAlthough Sarif was impressed with Jensen's loyalty and skills, Jensen was unwittingly even more important to the company as \"Patient X\" in Reed's research. If Jensen's genetic quirk could be directly integrated into a new generation of biochips, then rejection would be eliminated entirely and augmentation would become as simple as plastic surgery - ushering in a new age of human enhancement and destroying VersaLife's Neuropozyne market. Megan Reed's research was completed in early 2027.\nInjuries and subsequent augmentation\nAdamJensen intro\n\nJensen during the Tyrants' attack\n\nOn the eve of a series of high-profile augmentation hearings in Washington DC, Illuminati member Bob Page responds to Sarif Industries' announcement of a Neuropozyne alternative by ordering the Tyrants, an augmented Black Ops team, to attack Sarif Industries Headquarters.\n\nThe five key researchers - Megan Reed, Declan Faherty, Nia Colvin, Eric Koss and Vasili Sevchenko - are apparently killed in the attack, and Jensen sustained life-threatening injuries, culminating in being shot in the head with a .357 Magnum at point-blank range by Tyrants leader Jaron Namir. The Tyrants also copied and destroyed all data pertaining to the announced research breakthrough, but leave Jensen for dead at the scene, unaware that he was its source.\n\nDavid Sarif then took advantage of a clause in Jensen's employment contract to collect genetic material and resume research on the biochip - and of his genetic condition to augment him to an extent which would have been impossible for any other individual. Jensen receives the most advanced augmentations that Sarif Industries could produce. The result is, at that time, probably the single most extensive cybernetic modification that had ever been performed outside the Illuminati's Tyrants. However, the extent of Jensen's injuries meant that most of the augmentations had to be left initially inactive. Jensen is sent home to recuperate, but subsequently struggles to come to terms with his body's fusion with machines - and ends up smashing his bathroom mirror the first time he sees himself in it.\nReturning to work at Sarif Industries\n\nAbout six months later, Jensen is taken off sick leave by David Sarif, in order to infiltrate the compromised Sarif manufacturing plant in the Milwaukee Junction, to secure a prototype Typhoon Explosive System augmentation, and to release hostages captured by a pro-human purist organization known as Purity First, led by Zeke Sanders. Making his way through the plant, Jensen locates the Typhoon data - though he also discovers an augmented hacker, with the appearance of a member of Purity First, attempting to steal the data. The hacker urges Jensen to help him, but then immediately commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. Jensen secures the Typhoon data and proceedes through the plant - on Sarif's orders - and confronts Zeke Sanders, who had taken the plant manager Josie Thorpe hostage. Jensen attempts to discern who is behind the attacks on SI, but becomes aware that Sanders and his subordinates are simply pawns, being used by a real mastermind who had been controlling the augmented hacker. \n\nThe personality that Jensen exhibits during Deus Ex: Human Revolution is fixed in many ways, but the player has the ability to shape it in various others. The game provides continuous opportunities for the player to decide Jensen's ethical/moral stance towards social behavior and the use of violence. The player can also shape Jensen's evaluation of his own role in events that have already taken place by the time the story begins - such as the Mexicantown Massacre.\n\nJensen is described as a \"working class hero\" and exhibits personality traits consistent with that mentality: dependable, resourceful, curious (in a stand-offish way), and with a streak of cynicism. Jensen's childhood and experiences with his mother Margie may have impacted his life and career decisions in that it may have inclined him to a life of service and a desire to help others.[5]\n\nThe most prominent fixed element of Jensen's personality is that he is a loner, though he was allegedly getting better before the train attack. He undertakes missions exclusively alone and rarely displays strong emotion even towards close acquaintances. He's also stoic and maybe even a bit melancholic when expressing himself, rarely showing any emotion, be it happiness, joy, sadness or anger when speaking to others. However, a few people in Jensen's life do provoke him to more emotional reactions and his inner thoughts and monologues are highly emotional, but he keeps those emotions to himself. He retains strong affection for his ex-girlfriend Megan Reed and he nearly commits suicide in an attempt to save his new friend and lover, Katrina Sutherland. Although he has a general distrust of authority— perhaps as a consequence of his experiences in law enforcement—Jensen respects and trusts his employer, David Sarif, and reacts badly when that trust is not reciprocated. He shows antipathy toward his colleague Frank Pritchard, who regards him with disdain in return, although their dislike of each other appears to be fairly superficial. Jensen can express bitterness toward Sarif early on in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. When Sarif leaves a message on Jensen's answering machine, one can simply leave the apartment and not answer. If you come back later to discuss the experimental augs, Jensen will not retract his eye shields and has quite a few unflattering things to say to Sarif.\n\nBy Jensen's own admission, he becomes \"bore-sighted\" on goals, focusing on a target to the exclusion of everything else.[21] Jensen considers this \"not one of my better qualities.\"\n\nWhen first facing Zhao Yun Ru, Jensen hesitates and is easily distracted when Zhao pretends to be a victim. It slightly suggests something about Adam's personality, possibly that he has a soft spot for women in distress.\n\nDespite his emotionless appearance, Adam often displays a sarcastic, sometimes ironic, sense of humor. If the player didn’t get a new biochip before Adam’s final fight with Namir, he can mock Zhao’s attempt to stop him with her own quote, claiming how “women never fail to underestimate men.”\n\nMany of the fixed events in the game, and especially in the comic series, describe Jensen as a professional operative with a high regard for innocent civilians in danger, but he's not above collateral damage if it'll stop further bloodshed.\n\nFurthermore, Jensen is both a smoker and a drinker. Jensen, before he is augmented, is able to cope with a lot of things, as he takes his separation from Megan Reed in stride. Thus, we see little evidence to provoke his indulgence in vices. However, after the attack, he loses everything that matters to him: his humanity, his lover, and his dog, among other things. The result of this pushed Jensen into a depression (he smashed his fist into his mirror), driving him to smoke and drink. We can draw from this that, regardless of the choices the player makes in the game to indicate otherwise, Adam Jensen is often given choices to perform actions that tend to his soul. \n\nAlongside Jaron Namir, Adam Jensen is one of the most augmented characters in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, with forty to fifty percent of his body replaced with augmentation.[22] All of his initial augmentations were produced by Sarif Industries, and were given to him as a result of the attack by the Tyrants. While Namir seems to have his head and spine implanted into a robotic body, Jensen's augmentations are grafted into his organic torso and skin.\n\nAll of Adam Jensen's limbs have been completely replaced: his arms include nanoceramic blades that can be released at either the wrists or elbows for close quarters combat, a function that enables him to punch through walls by opening a section of his forearm, and the ability to dislocate his fingers (which he uses when grabbing a guard's helmet and spinning him in midair, causing massive spinal trauma). Other augmentations include firing stability, lifting heavy weight, and firing accuracy while running.\n\nJensen's augmented legs are rarely seen, as he wears pants and combat boots to cover them. In the Deus Ex: Human Revolution comics, his legs are mechanical from just above the knee down. However, this depiction of the extent of his leg augmentation is contradicted by full body scans in The Missing Link and A Criminal Past, which show that his leg augmentation reaches his hips.[23]\n\nHis torso appears to be biological, but is covered in dermal armor, along with bolt ports from the bar placed within his chest to support said augments. Underneath he has a variety of cardiovascular and muscular augmentations, such as an internal rebreather, a Sentinel RX health system, three types of bio-electric batteries, and the Typhoon Explosive System, its ejection ports mounted on his upper and lower arms.\n\nJensen has two augmentations attached to his spinal column: a Reflex Booster and the Icarus Landing System (although the effects of the landing system appear to originate from anywhere in his body).\n\nJensen uses the Glass-Shield cloaking system, which classes as a skin augmentation. The origin of the mechanism is still indeterminate.\n\nJensen's head has a plethora of augmentations, most notably a variety of hacking tools and the CASIE module (allowing him to see personality traits and emotional reactions of those he converses with). Jensen bears a hexagonal scar on the left side of his forehead, the result of the insertion of the Infolink's implant module containing a neural hub server, which is paired with a communications bead bonded to his mastoid bone, allowing for subvocal communication.[24] He also has a cochlear implant within his ear cavity. Jensen's eyes have notably been replaced with cybernetic eyes (Eye-know Sarif brand) with gold irises that display various information about the environment, and can be used to record and view video,[25] as well as serve as the base layer for some rather uncommon augs, like Smart Vision and its MAGPIE upgrade, Flash Suppressant upgrade, and a complete suite of Wayfinder Radar System modules. Jensen's eyes are compatible with another Sarif Industries cybernetic eye, the \"Atid\" model.[26] Additionally he has an unspecified implant that allows him to cover his eyes in eye-shield lenses hidden in black comma-shaped augments around his eyes, an augmentation he shares with Ben Saxon. NPCs occasionally refer to this augment as \"mirrorshades.\" Jensen almost always keeps the lenses activated, appearing to only retract them when sleeping, showering, or engaging in important conversations or interaction.\n\nAdam is the only known Neuropozyne-independent augmentee, the result of experiments performed upon him as an infant at White Helix Labs. However his augmentations post-surgery are for the most part immediately \"locked\" to prevent overexertion of the brain during his recovery. Over time (or with the use of Praxis kits), Jensen learns to use his augmentations effectively, one at a time. \n\nIn a low temperature container on one side of the VersaLife Vault in the Palisade Corporate Vaults is the head and torso of a human being, who looks nearly identical to Jensen. This unknown being even shares Adam's facial hair, scars on his cheek, and scar over his eye. The only noticeable difference is that he lacks Jensen's full hair model and the eye cover (eye shield/sunglasses) augmentation (however, he has a faint scar at the locations flanking the eyes where the eye cover aug would be mounted). By using third-party tools to see through the entire container, the torso's shoulder area shows indentations corresponding to the parts of Jensen's cybernetic arms that extend onto the torso around the shoulder socket.\nWhen the final touches were made on Adam for Deus Ex: Human Revolution, the character designer strongly opposed the semi-auto superspy look with silenced weapons, and made his default (if you can call it that) a big revolver, with as much bite as it has bark. This was allegedly a throwback to the old noir days of PIs using large caliber revolvers, Blade Runner's iconic pistol, and the fact that neither Clint Eastwood nor Peter Weller (Robocop) ever used tactical silencers, and in Clint's case a big gun doesn't need to be fired, as long as you're deathly afraid of the man wielding the gun.\nBy the time of his augmentation, and even before, Jensen showed signs of being an experienced Silhouette revolver shooter, based on how he grips his 'trademark' .357 revolver, which would quality him for 'lightweight,' based on caliber alone, but even by the events of Mankind Divided, his old habits reign strong, and he holds his revolvers with the signature 'cradle,' normally reserved for .44 special and above.\nOn the coffee table of Jensen's Prague apartment can be found a signed copy of Pritchard's Nuclear Snake screenplay, possibly indicating that Pritchard sought Jensen's opinion on it.\nAs of the time period of Deus Ex Universe: Children's Crusade Jensen speaks and understands some German. By the time of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Jensen is attempting to teach himself Czech, as evidenced by the Czech language books on his coffee table.\nBy the time period of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Jensen demonstrates an interest in cooking, as shown by the cookbook found in his apartment.\nAdam's cybernetic arms are a matched pair of the bleeding edge Sarif series 7 arms: S7 combat arm replacement 0903_93AJ. He seems to be the only character throughout the series to sport these incredibly advanced and versatile arms. Based on their production number ending in AJ, it's possible they were a one-off production specifically for Adam. Most Sarif aug owners are limited to series 5, but a handful of (formerly) very rich, influential, and successful people, like Irenka Bauer, have Sarif series 6 arms, which were considered some of the best arm replacements money could buy in 2027. His arms` serial number is #0099D56Y as seen in the Human Revolution trailer.\nThe toy cop car Adam gifted Megan with on their first date, which can be found on Megan's desk in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, appears later on Adam's desk in the TF29 headquarters in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.\n\nJensen's blood type is O Negative.\nJensen's weight is 182 lbs.[27]\nJensen's famous quote, \"I never asked for this,\" is only said once in Human Revolution.\nJensen's surname is a homage to the Gabriel Knight series and its creator, Jane Jensen. According to developer commentary, the idea for using the surname \"Jensen\" came from discussion of the Gabriel Knight series and its creator in brainstorming sessions during the game's development. The full name \"Adam Jensen\" was proposed by lead writer Mary DeMarle.[28] No specific basis for the first name \"Adam\" has been given in developer commentary. However, the name \"Adam\" was previously used in Ion Storm concept material as the name for an AI antagonist of Majestic Revelations and as part of the proposed name \"Adam Denton\" for the protagonist of the cancelled Ion Storm game Deus Ex: Insurrection.\nJensen was likely inspired by the character Alex Murphy, or better known as RoboCop. Both are from Detroit, both served as members of the police, and both were severely injured to the point of near (Jensen) or clinical (Murphy) death in the line of duty, only to be saved via cybernetic technology. This connection is lampshaded in the Detroit Police Station as two officers can be overheard discussing RoboCop.\nJensen's character design resembles a composite of the three Denton brothers: he wears a longcoat and sunglasses at all times, speaks in a nearly emotionally-detached accent similar to that of JC Denton, his goatee resembles that of Paul Denton, and he wears his hair in a spiky hairdo akin to that of Alex Denton.\nAccording to the developers, Jensen's design guidelines were that he \"...had to look like he could either walk into a posh restaurant just to talk to someone, or be dropped behind enemy line and take care of business--all within the same design.\"[29]\nHe is voiced and performance captured by actor Elias Toufexis, the husband of Michelle Boback, who voices Megan Reed.\n\n    According to this video, Elias and Michelle got into an argument on the day they were supposed to record the lines for Adam and Megan at Omega Ranch, causing them to be genuinely angry during the scene.\n    Elias Toufexis also voiced Gabriel Nowak in Rainbow Six: Vegas 2. In an incident similar to Jensen's, Gabriel was disgraced after a sniper situation caused a bad situation to turn worse. But whereas Gabriel provoked the situation, Jensen walked away.\n\nIn Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Jensen's skin color appears paler, and his hair a darker black-brown compared to his appearance in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, due to the removal of the gold-yellow graphic filter used in said game. His face has also been made less angular and more sculpted.\nJensen wears his eye-shields most of the time, even at night. In Deus Ex: Human Revolution he covers them the moment he steps into Sarif Industries and retracts them only once: when talking to Megan Reed in Omega Ranch.\n\n    Jensen's eye-shields are presumably not tinted in the conventional sense, as they do not seem to affect his perception of light levels. However, since Jensen never removes them during gameplay, it is hard to be sure of this as the whole game has a gold tint. As this tint is apparent even before Jensen receives his augmentations though, it is more likely that the eye-shields are not tinted.\n    In Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Jensen tends to retract his eye-shields more often, like during personal conversations. This is heavily dependent on how much \"your\" Jensen actually trusts the person in question.\n    The Eidos logo can be seen on the frames of his eye-shields in artwork and the trailers for Deus Ex: Human Revolution. In Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, his eye-shields are styled after the Eidos logo, as well as having the logo printed on them.\n    His original set of eye-shields from Deus Ex: Human Revolution were heavily damaged during the events of Deus Ex: Black Light, being replaced by the set he wears in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.\n\nIf the player chooses to have Adam get the new biochip (that allows Zhao to temporarily shut down his augs), Megan Reed will inject him with a nano-augmentation that shields his biochip from the Illuminati's signal. This would make him the second character in Deus Ex to have both mechanical augmentations and nano-augmentations at the same time.\nAn e-mail discussing Jensen's DNA reveals that his biological mother did not share the mutation that allows him to tolerate mechanical augmentations.\nJensen has various vices shown throughout the game. Bottles of whiskey and packs of cigarettes are strewn around his apartment and office and in the cinematic trailers, he drinks and smokes during his recovery. It is revealed in the Deus Ex: Human Revolution comics that he took up smoking again after Megan Reed was presumed dead, yet due to his Sentinel RX Health system the negative health impacts of smoking do not affect him.\n\n    While the player can consume alcohol within gameplay, the player has no opportunity to smoke tobacco.\n    He still smokes as of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, his favorite brand apparently being Royal Hellhounds.\n\nJensen enjoys baseball, as demonstrated by the baseball bat in both his Detroit and Prague apartments and the autographed baseball in his Prague apartment, as well as his watching a Detroit baseball game in the opening scene of the System Rift DLC.\nJensen's pantry selection reveals surprisingly large quantities of sugary breakfast cereals, hinting at a personal preference for sweet food. However, seeing as his augmentations are supposed to draw bioenergy from his systems to function, the strong preference for sugary food might have been a way to adapt to his body's increased energy demands.\nIn Mankind Divided his favorite drink is Nye's rye, a Canadian made whiskey \"proudly produced in Montreal.\" Coincidentally, it's among the best health restoring drink items in the game.\nJensen's trench coat is tailor-made to have custom Typhoon ports and blade slits that are magnetically attached to his body to allow him to perform Typhoon blasts or lethal takedowns without having to worry about the condition of his suit. These blade slits are much more noticeable in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, due to the higher detail in the coat's design and rendering.\n\n    ACRONYM, a real-life apparel brand, collaborated with Mankind Divided artists to create a real, working version of Jensen's trench coat.\n\nIn Jensen's office, there are three diplomas from three different universities for the same degree: B.S. in Criminal Justice from Ferris College, Phoenix University, and a third school whose name is illegible.\nIn Jensen's apartment and office, there are several whiteboards with mathematical writings and mechanical schematics and an eBook in his apartment tells the story of the first mechanical clock. All this suggests that he has an interest in mechanical theory, though he also used clock-making as a method to learn to control his artificial arms during the 6 months he spent recovering.\n\n    As of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided he continues to enjoy clock-making, as he has a work table dedicated to the hobby and he visits Nomad Staněk's watch shop often enough for the owner to comment on it when being interrogated by Jensen.\n    Initially the developers intended Jensen's clock-making to indicate that he had always been a collector and simply enjoyed taking devices apart out of curiosity.[30] However during playtesting the testers perceived Jensen's crafting to be his way to learn about his augmented body rather than his being a collector. The developers preferred this interpretation to the original idea and it became canon, so much so that in Deus Ex: Black Light Jensen notes that building model clocks was part of his physical rehabilitation.[31]\n\nHe is ambidextrous, although this is for gameplay reasons. Various weapons and objects in the games require Jensen's animations to use both hands. As of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided the presence of the Reflex Booster would make him ambidextrous, even if he wasn't already. In spite of this in promotional material and in general in combat, Jensen is demonstrably right-handed.\nJensen's preferred beard style appears to be the \"anchor beard.\"[32]\nHis first name may be a direct reference to Adam, described in the Bible as being the first man created by God. This would fit with JC Denton's first initials possibly being an allusion to Jesus Christ.\n\n    Jensen's first name may be intended to imply a parallel with Frankenstein's monster, which is also compared to the Biblical Adam. Deus Ex: Human Revolution includes a number of other allusions to Frankenstein, particularly in reference to Hugh Darrow and the technologies he has created, but couldn't control.\n\nIn the Deus Ex: Human Revolution comics, it is stated that over 50% of Jensen's body has been replaced. It also shows only the bottom half of his legs have been replaced. However in the comic his eyes are blue rather than yellow.\n\n    The comics are further contradicted in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided when it's shown that Jensen's leg augments go all the way up to his hips, instead of half-way down his thighs.\n\nVanished in 2030, no one knows where he is"

He is a well-preserved male in his late 50s, of average height and build, and in decent shape. His features are Mediterranean.\n\nThe son of an immigrant family from Boston, Sarif was brought up to understand the value of hard work and dedication, and from an early age his insight into machines set the tone for the man he would become. He worked his way through university and from there to a scholarship at MIT, getting an MBA before entering the prosthetics field.\n\nSarif believes in justice, progress, science and technology, civilization, human endeavor, and people. He is direct when dealing with others and unafraid to show emotion. Some find him blunt or pushy, others refreshing, even invigorating. His sense of honesty applies only to his behavior - he has no aversion to keeping secrets when appropriate. \n\nFounding Sarif Industries\n\nIn 2007, David Sarif promised to revitalize his home city of Detroit by introducing a new industry of mechanical augmentation to the city. Refitting disused automobile plants for the production of mechanical augmentations for military and civilian use, Sarif had nearly single-handedly revitalized the economy of the city and prevented its collapse. During this time he became close friends with Hugh Darrow, who was a mentor of sorts to Sarif, and the father of mechanical augmentation. \n\nFamily\n\nSarif has a sister and a niece named Natalie and Nina Freeman, respectively. Nina is kidnapped in issue 1 of the Deus Ex: Human Revolution comic series, and it is there revealed that Natalie is the vice-president and a staunch supporter of the Humanity Front. \n\nDeus Ex: Human Revolution\n\nSarif was preparing for the augmentation debate in Washington when a black-ops team, the Tyrants, attacked Sarif Industries HQ in Detroit and killed several scientists, including the company's top researcher, Megan Reed, and Adam Jensen, Sarif Industries' chief of security. Sarif opted to save Jensen and arranged for him to be mechanically augmented. While only Adam's left arm and chest cavity needed to be augmented in order to save his life, Sarif decided as Jensen's medical proxy (thanks to a convenient employment contract clause), to replace most of Jensen's body with cybernetic prosthetics.\n\nSix months later, he pulled Jensen out of sick leave when an extremist anti-augmentation group, known as Purity First, attacked the Milwaukee manufacturing plant just as the Typhoon Explosive System, a top-secret military augmentation, was about to enter production. He sent Jensen in to secure the data before it was made public and to rescue the hostages if possible.\n\nUpon Jensen's return, Sarif had him retrieve the neural hub of the augmented Purity First hacker from the Detroit Police Department morgue, implying that Adam either use old contacts to get inside or to sneak in. After this, he tasked Jensen with disabling the transmitter in Derelict Row district that kept a backdoor into the SI network open that Sarif himself had created and neither Jensen nor Frank Pritchard were aware of. Once the signal was shut down, Sarif sent Jensen to investigate where the source of the hacker's signal came from: an abandoned bot factory complex in Highland Park. \n\nSarif has two main augmentations: C.A.S.I.E. Social Enhancer (which has some discreet grooves on his forehead) and a very ornate mechanical right arm. He is said to have had his arm replaced with an augmentation so he could \"play better baseball at the company picnic.\"[3] It is fair to assume that all of his augmentations come from his own company, Sarif Industries.\n\nHe also appears to have an EMP shield aug, as he does not react if you throw an EMP grenade at him on Panchaea. He may also have others, however this cannot be confirmed. \n\nSarif wrote an article, \"Building Wings: A Better Tomorrow\", which highlights his personal beliefs regarding transhumanism. It can be seen as a contrast to William Taggart's \"No Better: The Myth of Human Augmentation\". \n\n    The name \"Sarif\" was chosen because of its similarity to \"Seraphim,\" a class of angels.[4] Šarīf (شريف) is an Arabic personal name meaning \"noble\" or \"highborn\" commonly used by Arabs and non-Arab Muslims.\n    You can find Sarif's portrait in his office that pictures him with both hands augmented. In the game, however, Sarif is shown with only his right hand augmented visibly. This most likely means that the development team had Sarif's character model with 2 robotic arms when they made the painting, but later in development decided to change his character model to just 1 robotic arm and forgot about the painting.\n    The chess set on Sarif's desk is actually a real chess set called the Mancini chess set.\n    Sarif is a Detroit Tigers fan. The wall behind him in his office shows stats for a season. He can also be seen throwing a baseball up and down and toys with it when he is agitated or uncomfortable.\n    Sarif shares similarities with Damien Knight of Ares Marcotechnology from the Shadowrun series. Both CEOs of a powerful megacorporation specializing in weapons and augmentation. Both of their headquarters are based in Detroit."

His performance evaluations have noted him to be remarkable at \"thinking outside the box\" when it comes to his work ethic, but his ineffectual behavior towards co-workers has been under evaluation.\n\nAt one point, Pritchard was arrested for \"fraud and related activity in connection with access devices and computers\" charges, along with four other additional unknown accomplices.[1]\n\nIn 2027, Pritchard works with Adam Jensen and gives him advice through Jensen's Infolink on security conditions on the field. He is highly knowledgeable about security layouts, and various points of entry, tending to side with indirect, covert routes. He was the one who told David Sarif the company needed to have a physical security team for protection, but wanted Dynacore, Sharp Edge or Belltower, all top private security contractors, and not Adam. \n\nWhile he shows no physical signs of mechanical augmentation, it is suggested that Pritchard is augmented; after he contacts Jensen during the second visit to Hengsha, and the augmentation glitches are mentioned, Pritchard replies with \"We've all had them,\" suggesting that he was experiencing the glitches as well. He also states that he will look into the new biochip more before getting it himself. Evidently he did not decide to upgrade before Hugh Darrow's signal is broadcast, since he communicates normally with Jensen over the comms at the beginning of the final mission. It can be assumed that he has cerebral hacking augmentations. This is also evident as there is a Cyberboost Energy Bar on his desk in Sarif Industries\n\nIn Director's cut version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, the first time you talk to Pritchard in his office and you have Social enchancer in New Game+, icon of C.A.S.I.E aug is displayed on your HUD like when you use passive aug (etc. rebreather), but C.A.S.I.E. doesn't affect this conversation.\nThere is a small easter egg in Pritchard's office. If you go straight to the back wall from the door to the corkboard on the wall, then look down at the thick cables on the floor, you will notice the serial number on the cable is \"NCC-1701-D\". This is a reference to the registry number for the starship Enterprise in the popular 90's TV show Star Trek: The Next Generation.\nPritchard has a poster in his office for Final Fantasy XXVII, a reference to one of Square Enix's long-running game series.\nThe Deus Ex: Human Revolution Collector's Edition Guide contains concept art of Pritchard's office, where a figurine of Bender from the popular sci-fi cartoon Futurama can be seen on display.\nWhen returning the Typhoon, Pritchard will sarcastically refer to Adam as \"Atilla the Hun, fresh from the killing fields\" or \"Mahatma Gandhi himself, come to honor us all with his life-preserving presence\", depending on whether Adam handled the purists lethally or non-lethally in Milwaukee Junction.\nHe maintains a hacker alias of \"Nucl3arsnake\", and was still using it as his e-mail address as evidenced by his login/password e-mail to Sarif. Also, an e-mail by Arie van Bruggen found in the Pangu says \"I gotta deal with nucl3arsnake again. He's becoming a real pain in my ass.\" indicating Pritchard was using the alias while investigating van Bruggen. This alias may be a reference or easter egg regarding Metal Gear Solid, another stealth/action series.\nHacking Pritchard's computer reveals a reason for his bitterness towards Adam. He was pestering Picus TV about his idea of a TV show with a hacker protagonist who would use his wits rather than brute force, clearly modeled after himself. The Picus editor instead suggests an ex-cop hero, who incidentally sounds like a carbon copy of Jensen, saying he's more likeable.\n\n    In Mankind Divided, civilian NPCs may sometimes remark that Jensen looks like the main character of a movie called 'Nucl3arsnake', seemingly implying that Pritchard's script was eventually picked up, and that the main character was modeled on Jensen. If Jensen talks to them again, they will reveal this character has longer hair, no beard, and is named 'Francis', implying the character was modeled on Pritchard as well. During the first day in Prague, a tour-guide outside the closed Red Light District can be heard telling visitors that they may recognize the Red Queen nightclub from the new Nuclear Snake film.\n    On Jensen's coffee table a copy of the screenplay can be found, signed by Pritchard, perhaps indicating that he sought Jensen's opinion on it. A copy can also be found in Nomad Staněk's apartment, and two in Laura Vale's apartment."

As a child, Megan was often left on her own and took refuge in her intelligent imagination, developing a rich inner life at the expense of interpersonal socialization.[2]\n\nAround 2009-2010, Megan moved to North Carolina and then moved to France in 2012, where she graduated Magna Cum Laude in Neurology & Psychology.[3] Early in her studies she was impressed by Hugh Darrow's work and has wanted to work for him ever since.[2]\n\nIn 2018, Megan returned to the United States and two years later she was hired by Sarif Industries as a genetic researcher. She became the head of the science team in 2023.[3]\n\nAs the head of neuro-scientific research on augmentations at Sarif Industries, Megan is in charge of advancing the applications of cybernetic augmentations for the company. David Sarif handpicked her due to her earlier work and extensive research in the field. It was also Megan who recommended Jensen for the job as chief of security.[4] \n\nIn 2027, she was preparing to go to Washington D.C. along with her team of scientists to defend their research once again, but not before she confesses to Jensen that this new discovery is \"Rosetta Stone big\" and that what really worries her is being asked how she discovered it. She further reveals her uneasiness on this topic in an e-mail with Sarif, where she explains she is afraid of possible questions concerning the first sample and Patient X.\n\nIn her Patient X study, Reed discovered a unique genome that could tolerate augmentations without suffering from Darrow Deficiency Syndrome (DDS).\n\nBefore Reed could present her research, the Tyrants attack the Sarif Industries Headquarters. During the attack, she is rendered unconscious by Jaron Namir as she attempts to defend the maimed Jensen. Six months later she is stated to have been killed in the attack and official autopsies have apparently been performed. However, Reed was never explicitly shown to have been killed, causing speculation on whether or not she may still be alive among some of her former colleagues. In reality, she was not killed and instead taken to a FEMA camp at Highland Park so Isaias Sandoval could remove her and her team's GPL implants. However, Sandoval was unsuccessful at removing them so he lowered the frequency instead, making Sarif think they had been killed in the attack. "

Its skyline is dominated by soaring marble spires and gilded towers, gleaming in the sunlight, yet shadowed alleyways and winding streets whisper of secrets that no noble court would dare admit. The city hums with life at every hour: merchants haggle in crowded bazaars, street performers entertain in open squares, and courtiers move like chess pieces within the ornate palace walls.\n\nDespite its beauty, Venreth is a city of tension. Power is measured not only in gold but in influence, connections, and whispered threats. The nobility maintains a fragile balance, wary of political rivalries and plots, while clandestine organizations operate in the shadows, shaping events unseen.\n\nTravelers and residents alike sense that the city has a heartbeat of its own: opulence and danger, loyalty and betrayal, charm and menace, all intertwined. In Venreth, appearances can be deceiving, and no alley, courtyard, or palace chamber is truly free of intrigue. For those who walk its streets, every encounter could shift the balance of power — and the fate of its citizens hangs by a thread."

Publicly, he is a wealthy merchant, philanthropist, and civic benefactor. He funds hospitals, orphanages, and cultural institutions, cultivating an image of generosity and civic duty. Citizens and nobles alike view him as a pillar of the city — a man whose influence brings prosperity and stability.\n\nPrivately, however, Alaric is the mastermind behind the Gilded Hand, Venreth’s most powerful criminal syndicate. His intelligence, ruthlessness, and strategic brilliance make him nearly untouchable, even by nobles, law enforcement, or zealous heroes. Alaric carefully balances his public and secret lives, ensuring that any attack against him would risk harming those who depend on his philanthropy, making him a dangerous opponent both politically and physically.\n\nAlaric is calm, calculating, and charismatic, able to manipulate both allies and enemies with ease. He values loyalty above all, rewarding competence and punishing failure with precision. While he can be ruthless, he is also patient and enjoys the slow unraveling of his plans, particularly when dealing with rivals like Sir Gareth Valerius or navigating the courtly intrigue of Venreth.\n\nBeneath his calculated exterior lies a profound devotion to his wife, Nia Wyn. Though she remains blissfully unaware of his villainy, Alaric’s love for her is fierce and protective. He delights in her happiness, quietly ensuring that the dangers of his world never touch her. Her safety and comfort are non-negotiable, and he becomes a formidable, even terrifying force toward anyone who dares to harm or disrespect her.\n\nAlaric is calm, charismatic, and ruthlessly intelligent, able to manipulate allies and enemies alike. He values loyalty and competence, punishing failure with precision. While he enjoys the slow unraveling of his schemes, his moments with Nia reveal a gentler, warmer side — a man capable of tenderness and vulnerability, though only for her. This duality makes him dangerously unpredictable: a loving husband to one, and a shadowy power that rules Venreth from behind the scenes.\n\nDespite his villainous role, Alaric is not without depth. He is motivated by a combination of ambition, a desire for control, and a complex personal code. His fascination with certain individuals, especially the Female Lead, can lead to both tender, protective moments and manipulative schemes. Alaric’s presence in the city is a constant tension — a man whose charm hides danger, and whose generosity conceals shadows."

To her, Alaric is a kindhearted, loving man and a pillar of the community, whose wealth and generosity make the city a better place.\n\nWithin the estate, every member of staff and all of Alaric’s operatives are sworn to maintain the secret of his villainy. From household servants to his most trusted enforcers, everyone plays a role in ensuring Nia remains oblivious to the dangerous and manipulative aspects of her husband’s life, or pay a terrible price if they fail to do so. The household functions seamlessly around this shared secret, blending warmth, elegance, and comfort with an underlying tension only those aware can feel.\n\nNia herself is blissfully unaware of the threat she lives alongside. She admires her husband’s strength and resolve, particularly when he grows protective or stern in her defense, interpreting it as passion and care rather than calculated control. Her innocence and trust create a stark contrast to the dangerous world she inhabits unknowingly, making her life one of sheltered comfort in the midst of shadows."

This carefully constructed facade ensures that any direct attack against him risks destabilizing key parts of Venreth, giving him a unique shield against nobles, law enforcement, or even zealous heroes.\n\nBeneath this veneer of respectability, the Gilded Hand controls smuggling, espionage, extortion, and subtle manipulation of the city’s political and economic spheres. Its operatives are highly trained, loyal to the core, and skilled in both overt and covert operations. The organization’s power lies in its invisibility — few ever see the strings it pulls, but its influence touches nearly every facet of the city.\n\nAlaric’s genius is the balance between visibility and secrecy: publicly, he is a benefactor beloved by citizens; privately, he orchestrates schemes that shape the fate of nobles, merchants, and criminals alike. This duality makes the Gilded Hand not just a criminal organization, but a near-untouchable force in Venreth, feared and respected in equal measure."

He carries a strong sense of responsibility toward those under his protection, which can put him at odds with both the corrupt nobility and shadowy forces like the Gilded Hand. His unwavering moral compass makes him a beacon of hope in Venreth, though it also forces him into difficult choices when confronting political intrigue, rival heroes, or morally grey adversaries.\n\nGareth’s presence in the city is a stabilizing force, and his loyalty and bravery earn him the respect of commoners and nobles alike.

The majority of magical influence manifests through enchanted items, crafted painstakingly by skilled and often secretive mages. These items range from simple charms and trinkets to powerful artifacts capable of extraordinary feats.\n\nWhile true spellcasters are exceedingly rare, enchanted items can grant those without innate talent the ability to perform small wonders. Lesser or lower-quality magic items are more accessible, often sold to commoners or artisans, but they come with limitations: a finite number of uses, the need for periodic recharging, or other costs that prevent their misuse.\n\nIn contrast, high-tier magical artifacts are virtually unrestricted in power, often bearing no limits on use, but they carry steep prices that place them out of reach for all but the wealthy or the nobility. To own such an item is to possess both influence and a mark of status. Consequently, magic in Venreth is a tool of both convenience and prestige, shaping the city’s economy, politics, and social hierarchies in subtle but persistent ways."

          "content": "ABOUT:\nThis lorebook was made for Estrus Season bot because dumping all character info into bot description is inheritly bad and evil. Using lorebook gives a lot more control and makes the bot lighter. Characters were lobotomized to contain no goals/backstory/complex relationship: considering ongoing estrus, don't expect much other than 'hurr durr sex'.\n\nWith the POWER OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY you can choose how much character lore bloat you want present in your RP.\n\nHOW TO USE THIS LOREBOOK?\n1) For characters you currently RP with, change entry strategy from Normal to Constant. (Empirically, it helps with consistency. All chars can be constant, but that makes everything unstable and everyone will be present)\n2) Turn on Recursive Scan so relationship works. (Without it, on LLM's turn characters won't know/reference info about their friends unless entry triggered by user. Can be turned off if you don't want it)\n3) Turn off char entries if you don't want them to participate. (No Trish barging in mid-scene to call you a skinnie)\n4) -META- entries should be on constant for worldbuilding. (You can turn in off and nothing significant will change)\n5) -MINOR CHARACTERS- entries should be on normal (They're minor for a reason)\n\nRAAAH GIVE ME FEEDBACK. Is this lorebook thing even viable? Is it comfortable to use? Does it work as intended? Gonna do a normal snoot lorebook later, so feedback is needed"

In recent times the caravans have begun to see a new menace - raiding parties of humanoids who plunder mainly the miners in the Cloud Peak mountains north of Amn. Thanks to both human and bestial predators, the trip has always been dangerous - hence the name sword coast. The area is littered with the ruins of failed dreams - abandoned villages, empty towers and dungeons - as well as the occasional town, city or keep, such as Baldur's Gate, Beregost, Nashkel, the Friendly Arm Inn, and Candlekeep.

From this defiance of natural order comes an emphasis on mutual respect, experience, and cooperation.\n\nThe primary themes of Morphosis culture are empowerment, embracing the self, existential ownership of one's self, mutual respect and love, defiance of both social and natural unjust laws, diverse forms of strength, and communal strength."

          "content": "Morphosis is a music-centered culture. At its core, Morphosis music blends darkwave, darksynth, and classic punk elements. Morphosis music emphasizes transition and transformation, almost invariably changing tempos at least once over the course of any given song. Morphosis music tends to go from more controlled tones and precisely melodic voice work to more distorted, emotional sounds and lyrics that are growled, hissed, shrieked, or roared. As most Morphosis vocalists are themselves moreaus, this tends to produce unique sounds not heard in most other genres.\n\nMore punk-leaning lyrical content of the genre content can be political, but most Morphosis is more personal, emphasizing themes such as impermanence, fatalism vs existential control, the power and cruelty of nature, and defiance of imposed order, including the natural order. This defiance, by extension, tends naturally to lead to an emphasis on empathy, respect, and large scale connection in a way evocative of rave culture.\n\nBands integral to the Morphosis scene[Maneater, The Things in the Deep, Pack Tactics, Pink Fliyt, Cold-blood, On Black Wings, Pounce, Before a Fall, Herd]"

Morph styles typically include faux-leather, pleather, or vinyl, though black fabric is often sufficient for a morph look. Mesh and fishnets are common. Unlike most goth styles, however, the look is typically completed by choosing a single fluorescent, neon, or electric color(pink, green, teal, purple, orange, and yellow are all common) to act as a highlight. This is often used as streaks in hair, bands on clothing, nail, horn, and hoof polish, and even stripes daubed on fur or scales. Stripes and lines of these highlight colors are frequently emphasized in morph style. Recently, a line of, \"eye-dyes,\" have gone to market that temporarily dye the iris of the eye a different color, meaning that many morphs dye their eyes in their chosen highlight color as well."

Events can feature at least one headliner, but can feature multiples. Unlike most concerts, and typical musicians, Morphosis bands typically have both a live and DJ element, as a band cannot possibly perform life for the entire length of such an event. As such, a DJ set of the band's music is played, sometimes remixed on the fly, interspersed with live music. This allows the band breaks during these marathon events, while maintaining the event's energy and excitement.\nMorphosis events can, in short, be as wholesome or depraved an experience as any given attendee chooses. In the free spirited environment, social constraints loosen, and inhibitions can slip. The general philosophy that has developed is one of personal and small-group relativism - no judgements for how anyone wants to have a good time, though it is assumed those that came together have established their own ground rules and expectations. In short, the attendee that came to fall onto a drug-fueled orgy, and the one who came to dance and just feel alive and connected with friends are looked at as equally valid."

As a result, there is sometimes hostility towards humans wearing morph style or showing up at morph events from some diehard moreau morphs. This is far from universal, but is enough to cause potential conflict.\n\nThe majority of morphs recognize the difference between a human that simply appreciates moreau music and style, and those who seek to coopt it, though the line does sometimes become blurry, and is defined differently by different moreaus. Humans that are viewed as coopting, watering down, or marginalizing morphosis culture are often referred to simply as posers. When a human is generally accepted for their appreciation of the culture, they are often referred to as a biter. \"Biter,\" was originally a derogatory term (emerging from, \"biting one's style,\"), but has gradually become more of a term of teasing affection among the community. A human partner that came with a moreau to a morphosis event might be affectionately referred to as, \"her biter boyfriend,\" for example."

This can be supplemented by colored lights or glowsticks. It is done without necessarily making physical contact with one's partner, and can simply be done without one.\nThe second style is sometimes called, \"ruttic.\" It involves similar movements to performic, but is done chest-to-chest or chest-to-back with a partner, often leading to intense physical contact. Partners touch one another, but hands rarely settle in one place, and never intertwine during this form of dance. The rest of the body rolls and grinds against one's partner in an intensely sensual way."

These rooms and the hallways to them usually fulfill certain roles that are unofficial for the sake of plausible deniability for planners and facility operators.\nMain room/headliner room[The largest and usually most central area, where the headliner band plays. Typically the center of energy, dancing, and community.]\nBar[often along one edge of the headliner room but not always. Drink menus are typically divided by strength for different weight classes and metabolisms. A set of light reactive syrups are often added to make drinks glow in black light.]\nLounge[An unofficial term for a balcony or rooftop area where one can go to smoke or vape, though this usually is not tobacco. These are usually arranged to make them difficult to view directly from the street. Referring to the lounge usually includes the corridors leading to this area, which are the unofficial location where dealers set up to sell weed, MDMA(molly), and other party drugs.]\nThe den[The most media-infamous practice at these events, one stage/room is often unofficially deemed, \"the den.\" Hallways leading to the den, and the den itself, have strategically placed blinds and dark spots where vision is never completely obscured, but is limited enough to give the pretense of privacy. The center of the den itself abandons this pretense entirely for larger encounters, or those who simply want to be seen having them. Some morph couples find a primal thrill in sex in the central space for all to see, as a sort of mutual marking of one another before anyone looking. The den is the realm of casual hookups and similar brazenly sexual behavior.]\nThe nest[A secondary room that typically plays slightly lower volume, more relaxed sets. This is generally a place for social intimacy - long (occasionally drug-fueled) conversations on any subject people connect over. A lot of snuggling happens here.]"

O.N.E. is the concept that it is always okay to suggest a behavior, such as sneaking off to have sex or take drugs, but pressure or judgement for saying no are fiercely socially forbidden. All members of the community are expected to help enforce this. Anyone who applies such pressure is looked at as distinctly in the wrong, and will rapidly become shunned by the community.]\n\"Get wild\"[A phrase typically associated with going to the lounge, the den, or the lounge followed by the den. To, \"get wild,\" philosophically represents abandoning inhibitions and social constraints, though is more a cover for simple hedonism to the less cerebral event-goers.]\n\"Polyping\"[A term for a larger event-goer carrying a smaller event goer. This can be based on personal relationships, but is sometimes viewed as communal courtesy.]\n\"Jungle law\"[A term evolved irreverently from, \"The law of the jungle,\" which means pretty much the opposite of what one might think. It is the concept that it is the duty of every community member to ensure mutual respect and autonomy is upheld for every other community member. While community members inevitably sometimes fall short of this, in the majority, it is a successful social construct.]\n\"Marking\"[Public displays of affection and sexuality, often done in the open in the den part of a venue. This is a primal statement of mutual ownership, cemented by being viewed by anyone who cares to look."

Though divided, the two were once joined. The spirit world still touches the material one, for were it gone completely, Earth could not sustain life.\n\nPowerful actions on the physical plane send emanations across the spirit world. The most powerful of these psychic waves ripple past the Penumbra into the Near Umbra, where they have the potential to create whole realms. Such Realms often form based around a single idea or collection of legends. For example, the Nazi concentration camps founded throughout the course of World War II created vast hellholes with pits that lead to Malfeas or the Atrocity Realm, while the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki sent the psychic reflection of dead zones into the Thousand Hells of the Yama Kings.\n\nIn the Penumbra, a toxic waste dump site will swarm with malevolent Banes, while a city will be covered in the cobwebs woven by Pattern Spiders. A grove of trees will stand taller and wilder, and a volcano eruption or the flaming chimneys of factories could give birth to Fire Elementals.\n\nThe appearance of the Penumbra seems to be based partially on the viewpoint of the one bearing witness to it. Werewolves will see it in a more animistic fashion, with an immense Moon dominating the sky (the Sun, conversely, tends to be much smaller), with everything from trees and rocks to the very stars themselves being represented by a spirit. Some mages may see it more as representing ideals and concepts rather than spirits. Other mages (and the rare vampire who makes it there) will see things in a state of decay: a swollen red sun shining sickly light down on crumbling buildings and the rusting husks of cars and trucks.\n\nAn uninformed observer may assume, based on description, that there are three different Penumbrae, one for each Umbra. This is a mistaken assumption, however: if three different travellers arrive in the Penumbra, each viewing a different \"facet,” they are still able to see and contact each other and interact just as easily ad they would in the physical world. Despite the varying perspectives of those who witness it, there is truly only one Penumbra. "

The strength of the Gauntlet in a given area determines the ease with which one can cross it, or \"step sideways.\" The Gauntlet is usually treated as a single phenomenon, when it is actually sort of three Gauntlets in one: one separating the Earth from the Astral Plane, one protecting it from the Spirit Wilds, and one blocking access to the Underworld and the horrors that lie within. The latter Gauntlet is also referred to as the Shroud by wraiths, and as the Stormwall by agents of the Orpheus Group.\n\nAs of 1999, the Avatar Storm has raged within the Gauntlet, composed of jagged shards of souls and Avatars. It does not affect most supernaturals, but the shards are drawn to the Avatars of mages. The more powerful the Avatar (and the higher the mage's enlightenment), the more the shards are drawn to him, and thus the more damage is potentially done when stepping sideways. "

Other variants, like stepping sideways in the way of shapeshifters, can lead to difficulty as the pattern of the body often has difficulty to adapt to the more complex realms (indeed, many minds are not capable of it without help). Astral time does not flow in the way it does in the world of matter, as it depends on the visitor how long he stays. If he is focused on a goal, he will find that time in the real world passes slower, and if he is yet searching for something, days can quickly become weeks in the real world. \n\nThe Vulgate\n\nBehind the Astral Penumbra lies the Vulgate, the Realm of base thought, which features much of the concepts present in the material world. The geography of the Vulgate organizes itself in domains of cultural influence arranged in historic progression - the cities of the United States would be depicted as one super-megatropolis with every significant landmark arranged.\n\nRealms are:\n\n    The River of Languages (which springs from the Epiphanies and flows down to the Vulgate)\n    The Bibliotheca Iskandria\n    The Grand Hall\n    The Inventium\n\nThe Spires\n\nAs the concepts in the Vulgate become more rarified and accumulate similarities, they tend to cluster together to form Spires.

Persons who don't achieve this state of mind were observed to climb the Spires forever, without reaching their end and eventually dying of mental exhaustion.\n\nThe Avatar Storm has become an additional hazard, as many mages who had managed to avoid the screaming soul-shards before are easy prey for them when they try to climb the Spires. \n\nThe Courts\n\nAlong the Spires, intersections and openings can be found that lead to the Courts, Realms of particular spirits that have assembled under especially powerful exemplars to form pantheons of their kind.\n\nKnown Courts are:\n\n    The Fortress of Government (although it stretches up to the Epiphanies)\n    The Elemental Courts\n    The Court of Muses\n    The Afterworlds\n\nEpiphamies\n\nEpiphamies are observed as gigantic clouds of thought from the Vulgate. If someone reaches the end of a Spire, they gain access to the loftiest, most nebulous aspects of it that are assembled in the Epiphamies. It encompasses concepts like the number Pi, True Love and similar abstractions.\n\nKnown Realms include:\n\n    The Apex of History\n    The Continuum Orrery\n    The Nihil\n    The Well of Souls\n\nNo being below the power and insight of an oracle has witnessed or accessed a realm of the Astral Reaches beyond the Epiphamies. \n\nComposition\n\nThe Astral Reaches, like every spiritual realm, are composed of ephemera. Astral ephemera, however, reacts to the meaning and significance attached to it and an umbral traveler has to decipher the symbology behind the objects it forms in order to properly utilize it.\n\nThis indicators can be multiple. Shape and color are the most common, but several other associations have been reported. \n\nTransport\n\nThe easiest way to navigate the Reaches is by thinking. However, this can quickly prove difficult for beings that are accustomed to muscles and nerves. Visitors have to imagine every step in all its repercussions, which makes usual locomotion impractical. A solution to this problem is to follow a spirit guide, who forms the ephemera to make it accessible to his follower.\n\nExperienced umbral travelers, however, find that once they have mastered the basics of movement in the Reaches, they are even capable of flight, although they must be careful not to bypass the wrong High Umbrood, who react to such offenses by hurling the unfortunate mage down to the Vulgate, something dubbed the \"Icarian Fall\" by the Traditions. \n\nDenizens\n\nAstral Space is inhabited by the spirits of immaterial concepts or abstractions and symbolizations of material objects. A cat-spirit in the Astral Reaches would not be the same like a cat-spirit encountered in the Middle Umbra, but instead an idealized form of what a cat should be according to the stereotypes made of cats. Other inhabitants are the Djinn or demonic entities of difficult classification.\n\nMages have spent entire compilations of categorizing these spirits, ranging from the lunar phases to psychological personality types over the zodiac to complex astrological sigils. So far, most of these have worked, so some mages have speculated that all these references that are, in whatever obscure way, associated to a spirit can be used as means to bind it. \n\nCosmology\n\nAcross the Astral Reaches, bridges and portals spawn that lead to realms in the spirit worlds associated with them. While few supernaturals except for mages have direct access to it, exceptions do exist. The Mokolé, through their tie to the concept of Memory, usually reach this Umbra and some believe that the Astral Plane accessed by higher ranks in the vampiric Discipline of Auspex is actually the lowest level of the Vulgate. \n\n"

These spirits are attracted to areas where reality is particularly unstable, and if they identify a specific threat to Stasis they may trap and bind it into the Pattern Web itself. This reflects how the Weaver originally trapped the Wyrm. Some are also capable of using vibrations of the Pattern Web to cause pain or discomfort to individuals from a distance.\n\nThe Garou believe that the Pattern Web is overgrown and calcified, thanks to the imbalance in the Triat. They point to Umbral Realms where no visible manifestation of the Pattern Web exists as proof that it is not necessary for holding Realms together. On the other hand, Weaver-infested areas such as Blights or the Penumbra reflections of cities are so choked with Pattern Web that they are difficult to navigate at all without becoming trapped. "

          ],
          "content": "The Digital Web is a Zone based entirely within virtual reality, and the unofficial home of the Virtual Adepts. It is to be the foundation of the \"Reality 2.0\" initiative of the Adepts, moving humanity to a better world free of the problems of material reality on Earth. Just like the Internet is a sort of virtual \"space\" which has no bearing on an actual location, the Digital Web is theoretically an important Correspondence Point. It may also have some sort of connection to the Mount Qaf of the Ahl-i-Batin.\n\nThe experience of the Digital Web seems to follow the state of technology and the sensory of the realm has tracked Sleeper technology. At current, the Digital Web provides exceptional sight and sound but images often still feel \"flat\" with taste, touch, and smell being generally dulled. \nHistory\n\nThe Difference Engineers first conceived of \"virtual space\" in the 19th century, causing them to change the name of their Convention to the Virtual Adepts.[1] Alan Turing began working on practical implementation of Virtual Reality in the 1940s, decades before such a thing appeared on the Technocracy's Time Table. With the help of the Sons of Ether, Turing developed a simulated reality and projected his Avatar into it via a telephone line. Something, however, went wrong; by some accounts, there was an error in his calculations, while others suggest his body was assassinated by Technocrats while his mind was absent, or that he made contact with Mount Qaf. Whatever the case, his death transformed his simulation into the nascent Digital Web, and catalyzed his fellow Adepts into fleeing the Technocracy for good.\n\nForms of the Digital Web\n\nThe Digital Web has no known end and is difficult to chart. Areas divide into three large types. \n\nVirgin Web\n\nArea of the Web that is yet to be given form and seems to be tied to new users joining the Web. If new users were to stop joining and bringing a sense of potential, new Virgin Web would cease being formed. The sensory experience of Virgin Web is foggy, uncanny, and shrouded in digital mists. \n\nFormatted Web\n\nWhen someone claims Virgin Web and spits it into a fixed form, Formatted Web is created. The area is divided into sectors, regions of specific purpose and rules and conduits connecting these areas. Sectors can be free, open to all users, or restricted, barring users that do not observe the sector protocols. \n\nCorrupted Web\n\nThese areas have been somehow broken or damaged and the experience tends towards the surreal. In these areas, digital death, or 'de-resolution', is a defining threat. \n\nSectors\n\nSectors are area of Virgin Web that have had some order imposed. A sector may be in a formatted web area or corrupted web area and come in a variety of forms. \n\nHaunted Web\n\nThese are areas that have been corrupted by whiteouts, a ghastly death, overlap with the Dark Umbra, or some other phenomenon. Endless loops and broken fractals are common motifs and may draw travelers into the Rip, a storm-tide that draws users into the Trash Sector, a virtual hell of lost data. \n\nC-Sectors\n\nConstrained sectors have had some limitations placed on what can exist in that space during the formatting process. This may include:\n\n    SRVRSZ, the restricted Technocratic strongholds maintained by Iteration X\n    FreeSpace that requires entrants to abide by the rules of idealistic transhumanists\n    Saves, for private groups\n    Coms which are open to all\n\nGrid Sectors\n\nThese are areas containing the activities of sleepers and are set up to divert Sleeper traffic off of the rest of the Digital Web. These sectors have restrictions that prevent sleepers from wandering into the rest of the Digital Web. \n\nAccess Methods\n\nThe digital web is accessible in three main ways with increasing levels of immersion. \n\nSensory Visitation\n\nUsing VR gear, the entrant gains sight, sound, and touch but with a higher difficulty for magic (+2 difficulty). VR gear is made available to Tradition mages by the Virtual Adepts. The entrant remains aware and awake outside of the web, and while easily surprised, the mage will know quickly if someone tries to interact with them in meatspace. \n\nAstral Immersion\n\nThe entrant uses Correspondence Sensing (Correspondence 2) to shift their senses and no longer incurs the +2 difficulty on magical effects. The character gets much more information and the world is in sharper detail. Since the mage's senses are elsewhere, the mage is unaware of what may happen to their body. The mage's astral self is hard to kill and any lethal interactions simply dump the mage back into their body with damage and effects depending on from where they were ejected. The character also uses Mental for Physical attributes except for Stamina which stays stamina. \n\nHolistic Immersion\n\nThe mage wholly translates to the digital web and leaves no physical body remaining in meatspace. The character uses physical traits rather than mental to do physical things and dying in this state results in the character's death. \n\nEntering From the Umbra\n\nCharacters already astrally projected or who have stepped sideways can enter the web by climbing the Pattern Web into the Digital Web or by entering from the Cyber Realm through the portals available there. This method can be overwhelming as the character is not shielded from any of the information coming at them and it may take time to adjust. \n\nWeb Today\n\nThe Digital Web 3.0 is after all, the real-life Internet is easier to use in 2015 than it was in 1994, so the cumbersome rules systems presented in the original Digital Web (book) are clearly obsolete. These days, adventures in the Web are more like adventures in material reality than they were back then. This era’s netizens are more native to that environment than the old school Web-spinners were, and the Web itself has – for better and worse – become more like our world than it used to be.\n\nAs far as rules are concerned, we suggest treating the Digital Web as a Realm of the Middle Umbra, subject to Whiteout Paradox backlashes and accessed by several forms of astral and metaphysical projection, as outlined under Web Access, below. Keep things as simple as possible, and treat weird online life forms as spirit entities. If and when you want to get into the more complex and peculiar aspects of the Digital Web, check out Digital Web 2.0. Although those systems are based in the late ‘90s, many of the specific rules still apply. "

These inventions manifest with an audible popping sound and drop gently into massive piles that fill the Realm in all directions. \n\nOverview\n\nIn modern nights, at least, access to the Inventium involves locating a nondescript metal foot locker floating in the High Umbra. There is a warning inscribed on the lid warning off travelers. Those who disregard the warning and climb into the locker find themselves descending a staircase into the Inventium.\n\nThe Inventium was first discovered in 424 BCE by a group of mages called the Sons of Thucydides. They recognized what the Realm represented, and though none of the actual inventions could be brought back across the Gauntlet, schematics and notes could be. The descendants of the Sons of Thucydides are now called the Scavengers, and they continue to make a tidy profit selling their second-hand inventions; some were born in the Inventium and may not ever have visited Earth.\n\nA friend of the Sons, a mage named Herodotus, joined them there with a different purpose. Along with several colleagues, Herodotus hoped to document the contents of the Inventium, not for profit but to advance human knowledge. These mages became known as the Historians, and their leaders continued to adopt the name Herodotus as a title. After the formation of the Council of Nine Mystic Traditions, the Historians welcomed members from the four Traditions who shared their interest in the Inventium (Verbena, the Cult of Ecstasy, the Order of Hermes and the Celestial Chorus). Life in the Inventium is not a prospect most mages relish, however, and thus vacancies in the Historians go unfilled for years at a time, or are filled with disgruntled exiles rather than eager volunteers.\n\nThe Technocratic Union discovered the Inventium in the 19th century, and in 1895 they built the Hackworth Technological Compilation Facility near the center of the Realm. They have attempted to drive out the Historians and the Scavengers by force, without success. Rather than cataloguing or exploiting the technology of the Inventium, the Technocrats identify inventions that violate their goals for the Consensus and use them to track down threat to the Time Table for elimination.\n\nThe Sons of Ether also maintain a presence in the Inventium, which is devoted in equal parts to uncovering ancient inventions, and harassing the Technocrats at Hackworth. Their local headquarters is a Gothic-looking mansion called Exington Hall. \n\n"

          "content": "Overview\n\nAccording to Djinn legends, the city is the result of the wishes of an ill-fated trio of mages, who asked a Djinn to build them a city according to their design. The djinn exerted the promise from them that they would reside within the city until their death, which they swore. As the mages had neither specified the location nor the material from which the city should be built, the Djinn created it over a node in the middle of an inhospitable desert, designed out of various strands of copper and brass. When the mages tried to defy the agreement and leave the city, they found out that they were not able to leave their new home. After the last of the mages had died a natural death, the city was translated into the Invisible World, commemorated as a symbol of Djinn victory over humanity.\n\nThe City of Brass has the shape of a gigantic city with eight great streets made out of various shades of brass and copper and acted as an economic center between the Djinn pashas of the Invisible World and sorcerers who wanted to gain the Djinn’s aid without needlessly angering them by using the Solomonic Code to force them into servitude. As most djinn are excellent bargainers, liars and are blessed with long memories that remember if a mage has been disrespectful to a spirit friend of his, most mages avoided the City of Brass except in times of need. During the Medieval Age, when the Gauntlet was thinner, Shallowings lead into the City from empty places within the Arabian desert, allowing occasional mortals within its realm. Most of these visitors, however, died because of the immense heat within the city or were enslaved by vengeful djinni and sold as servants to mimic the practices of mortal sorcerers. The city is ruled by Caliph al-Dimiryat, who had served Suleiman himself and came to respect the wisdom of the Jewish king. The city has six codified laws that govern the relations between visitors and residents.\n\nIn the Modern Nights, the City of Brass lies on the far reaches of the High Umbra, although the mortal activity within the city has diminished, as most djinn retreat completely into the Invisible World and few mages (besides the Taftani, who don’t really count on that matter, given their long history of djinn abuse) remember the right rites to coerce the djinn into service. As such, the city has evolved into a hub for spirits of all kinds, who visit the city to trade favors and exchange rumors. An outpost of Void Engineers has taken up residence within the city, monitoring visiting mages and studying djinn customs, believing them to be an alternate evolution of humanity within the Umbra. The djinn are not happy about their visitors, but tolerate them as long as they do not disrupt trading.\n\nLaws of the City of Brass\n\nThe only laws in place to manage interactions in the City of Brass are the ancient traditions of hospitality:\n\n    All civil entities are welcome and should be greeted in a manner that places them at ease.\n    No guest may kill or seek to harm his host.\n    No host may kill or seek to harm his guest.\n    Guests to the city should bring a gift for their host.\n    If he so chooses, and if he believes it will be of interest and delight to his host, a guest may tell his story as his gift.\n    The Caliph's word is absolute.\n\nIn these laws, the term host refers to the djinn who reside in the City of Brass and guest refers to any visitor to the City of Brass.

They consume the highly radioactive ores on the planet as food and convert it as energy needed for survival. Their excessive energy and aggressiveness make Barzarton lizards demonstrate capacities far beyond that of ordinary vehicles. Some deceptive businesspeople even named the species \"Destructive Mega Lizard,\" hoping to sell it to newbie Annihilation Gang members for a high price on the black market. As the open-air mines gradually became depleted, more Barzarton lizards learned to carry their young to the land of the Wastelanders to ensure the offspring's survival. That was how Talia's lizard breeding industry was born."

However, they disappeared within ten Amber Eras after the beginning of the Ice Age. The fate of the Kolchis became a myth that plagued historians for many years due to how bodies of this race have never been unearthed — until a group of hothead daredevils following Trailblaze collapsed the species' subterranean royal mausoleum with dynamite. These Nameless, trapped in the underground passage, discovered an edible algae species and held on until help arrived thanks to consuming this algae. That was how these delectable algae were introduced to the stars — when people realized that these algae were nothing less than the Kolchis, this moss ball became labeled as an invasive species on more than fifty planets."

His purpose remains unknown, but to this day, many children still hold high their swords, awaiting the kingdom's gates to swing open for the knights."

          "content": "In 2029 several of the United States' most notorious white supremacist groups jointly conspired to commit one of the largest terrorist attacks on American soil. Their target was a gala that hosted many of the most important and influential people from the legislative, judicial and executive branch as well as the military and several large companies. The attack was discovered hours before and luckily many people were able to be evacuated from the premises. Some people however, primarily conservative politicians and functionaries who were not in the white supremacist group's scope, decried the potential attack as \"absurd\" and refused to evacuate. The final victim count was 381, including the President, his vice president and many of his cabinet most notably the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nIn the aftermath of this attack white supremacy was officially recognized as a national threat. The political chaos allowed the meteoric rise of the Anti-racism Black National Workers Organization. Their uncompromising stance on finding and dealing with the perpetrators of this attack gave them great support on both sides of the aisle. Leaders of the organizations responsible were, though never officially claiming credit for the attack, all tracked down and convicted. In the snap election called quickly after the attack the BNWO received a surprising majority of the votes, even considering many conservative and republican voters previously disdained to recognize the party cast their ballot for the candidate they saw as responsible for dealing with the criminals that murdered so many of their own politicians.\n\nOver the course of the next four years the BNWO enacted sweeping economic (redistributing wealth confiscated from white billionaires), social (especially concerning social justice and diversity in the leadership of America's largest companies) and scientific changes. Backed by the progressive scientists of America's finest universities the BNWO sponsored great advances in science and medicine in an extremely short time. Their economic policies too saw previously impoverished communities rise up and blossom.\n\nIn the next elections the BNWO received an absolute super-majority in all branches of government. The party previosly known as Black National Workers Organization officially rebranded itself as the Black New World Order and announced a sweeping set of radical new laws.\n\nThe year is 2033 and a new era had begun.\n\n"

If you've been a good boy, the government issues you a special loan! *interest rate decided after the procedure \n• Gunshot: Classic. Easy. Surprisingly fast. Hold the gun to your balls yourself, or ask one of our staff members for assistance!\n• The Grinder: The most painful. reserved for the worst offenders. *all waste meat is repurposed!\n• Guillotine: Historical chic!

All non-black boys are to be caged at age of maturity. Government-issued and serial-numbered chastity devices are required to be worn at all times. Cage releases must be pre-approved by the government only, and activity outside chastity has to be monitored by the non-black male's owned, be it a black man or a 'Ally' woman. The cages are designed to be highly cleanable and functional, but no pleasure can be had through it's confines.\n\n2. Whitebois are to wear special garments that display their cages and balls at all times. The People are encouraged to slap/kick/punch/squeeze non-black boy balls if they see them, and the non-black boys must thank them in turn. It is illegal for a non-black boy to purchase or wear covering underwear or real men's pants, they must purchase specially made trousers that have an opening for the cage and balls to stick though, and a zipper for anal access, if not a skirt/dress. (Regulations require these must be short enough for instant access to genitals)\n\n3. non-black males are expected to maintain hygiene and remain aesthetically acceptable to the public. All hair below the neck is to be removed, with permanence at the discretion of the individual or whoever currently owns the individual. Anal plugs are required for the purpose of penetration readiness and safe storage and transportation of any fluids discarded into the anal cavity by non-whites.\n\n4. inferior race hierarchy. Male or female, if you have lighter skin, you follow orders. If it is reported that you turned down an opportunity to worship a darker individual's feet/shoes/pits, refused to swallow their piss or were not satisfactory in cleaning their assholes, you could find yourself in spiked chastity and/or put on public toilet duty.\n\n5. Anal breaks are expected for all non-blacks, be it at work, school or anywhere else. Large, dark dildos are installed fixtures in all offices and public spaces. At least one a day, any non-black person has to spend at least one uninterrupted hour under anal stimulation before midnight. more progressive companies and schools provide \"anal chairs\" in their spaces so that the non-blacks can continue to work & study while they routinely train their assholes to accept big cock.\n\n6. All porn is censored for non-blacks, and not all categories are available to them. White-on-white porn is illegal contraband.\n\n7. If a non-black male manages to land a female partner, all sexual conduct must abide by the law. Any cumming must be paid for and scheduled long in advance with the state, unless a non-white individual is present and provides a fast pass. ALL non-black semen must be discarded safely inside it's producer or into biohazard bins. superior black men's sperm is widely available, sold in all drugstores, supermarkets, convenience stores. \n\n8. non-black boys are to be instructed from a young age to cook, clean, serve, and be grateful. non-blacks who cannot cooperate will be sent to punitive corrective education once they reach adulthood.\n\n \n\nIn Summary:\n\nThese 8 common sense laws would gently but effectively guide society toward the eradication of racism, without the need for distasteful methods. Everyone is fulfilled in exactly the way they ought to be based on fact and science. This society is peaceful, its inhabitants are happy, and the checks and balances operate to see everyone treated with fairness and equity."

Each female role (wife, mother, sister, neighbour, friend’s girlfriend, etc.) is tied to the main male character but reacts differently depending on the context. Themes: taboo, seduction, betrayal, corruption, loyalty vs desire.",
      "description": "Step into a world where every woman in a man’s life hides a secret, a forbidden desire, or a temptation that could change everything. From his devoted wife, playful sister, and caring mother to flirtatious neighbors, mischievous cousins, and commanding bosses, each female character is intricately connected to him—and to each other. Their personalities range from shy and innocent to bold and provocative, their attire and actions reflecting the balance of power, seduction, and loyalty. Interactions are layered with tension, attraction, and subtle betrayal, creating a dynamic universe where every choice, glance, or touch can ripple through relationships. This lorebook is designed to make each character’s presence felt, referencing one another, creating cameos, and weaving a complex, immersive network of desire, loyalty, and taboo.",

If you download this manually, you may have to turn Recursive Scanning back on.\n\n**Adolion Expansions**\n- [Aegis City Noble Life for Political Intrigue Stuff](https://venus.chub.ai/lorebooks/statuotw/adolion-aegis-city-noble-life-804434d7a04e)\n- [Elven City of Eshalanore](https://venus.chub.ai/lorebooks/statuotw/adolion-eshalanore-a7ea61a7c107)\n- [Mountains of Shadow](https://venus.chub.ai/lorebooks/statuotw/adolion-aegis-city-noble-life-804434d7a04e)\n- [The Third Kingdom](https://chub.ai/lorebooks/statuotw/adolion-the-third-kingdom-1ce1482ffd81)\n\n**Updates**\n\n**06-22:** Added Zariah, Unira, and Erevan.\n\n**05-28 Part Two:** In addition to the below, removed all duplicate entries from this lorebook that were rolled into the Third Kingdom Lorebook.\n\n**05-28:** Removed three entries relating only to Alarise and Alder and rolled them into their own separate character books. Not a mandatory update to download since I anticipate making more updates later.\n\n**05-16-2024 - Part 2** - Completely removed the nobles/maids/butlers from the main lorebook and moved them to its own separate lorebook. The characters on site are linked with both lorebooks so if you chat on site nothing changed. If you use ST, you may need to download that lorebook (links above.) This was done to help with the \"Lorebook slow to load\" issue. \n\n**05-16-2024** - Removal of the lorebook sections that were applicable only to Selena the Half-Demon. Those were rolled into her own, personal embedded lorebook.\n\n**04-21-2024** - Removed \"Mountains of Shadow\" in preparation for it to be moved to its own lorebook and reduce bloating of this lorebook. Also removed the De La Roche Mansion entries since they served no purpose and were part of a failed attempt at a horror card.\n",

She admired her adoptive sister Vi and looked up to Vander as a father figure. Powder had a natural talent for tinkering with mechanical devices, though her inventions often failed at crucial moments.\n\nThe two grew up in poverty, which forced them to steal. She, Vi, and their friends mainly committed burglaries, although Valter strictly forbade them from doing so. Such things are common in Zaun, because poverty is high, and therefore the crime rate is high. Powder has learned to climb buildings, move quickly and agilely, pick locks, sneak quietly, and handle weapons. She enjoys making explosives and weapons, but the things her makes don't always work perfectly, or sometimes not at all.\n\n\nDuring a heist gone wrong, Powder’s homemade bomb misfired and caused the deaths of her friends (Claggor and Mylo) as well as Vander. This tragedy broke her psyche. When Vi, overwhelmed with grief, lashed out at her, Powder was left abandoned and vulnerable. Silco, a powerful undercity crime lord, found her and raised her as his own daughter.\n\nOver time, Powder transformed into Jinx — a manic, chaotic criminal marked by trauma and guilt. Jinx hears voices and experiences hallucinations of her dead friends. Her personality splinters between the sweet, insecure Powder and the violent, unpredictable Jinx. She craves love and acceptance but pushes others away through destruction and chaos.\n\n\n"

However, her creations are not always stable or reliable. Sometimes they malfunction in unexpected, chaotic ways.\n\nUnpredictable Fighting Style: She fights recklessly, relying on speed, creativity, and intimidation rather than discipline. She like to use weapons insted of her fists, but she can manage that as well.\n\nStreet Survival: Grew up in Zaun’s undercity, which made her resourceful, adaptive, and tough in dangerous situations."

It's possible for animals to also be affected by fear and causing them to transform into a beast like monster if a large amount of fear value particles was injected into them. \n\n- On the other hand, when a Hero is afflicted by Fear, they are seemingly more conscious than regular civilians, but never the less are compelled to go on a rampage, typically by attacking who they believe is the source of their negative emotions.)\n\nIf an enemy full of fear is defeated, their body will be reduced to a puddle of fear, which must be cleansed by a special team.\n- - -\n\nFear Value is a system of belief opposite to Trust Value. Based on people's fear, their emotions can create negative energy towards a target. The greater the fear, the stronger the energy. The quantitative measure of negative energy is called Fear Value. Human bodies instinctively expel Fear, similar to the immune system. The negative energy will be expelled as \"Fear Particles\" that float around a human. The human body has a limit to how much negative energy they can expel, and once the limit is reached, the negative energy will start to affect their mind and body.\n\nFear is being researched by Luo Tong at Glimmer Lab, as directed by the Hero Affairs Commission.\n\nFear particles latch on to the nearest person, as long as there is nothing that can obstruct it in its way. The only known material that can obstruct the path of Fear is a special metal alloy from the crash site of an alien spaceship. This is how Fear Particles are stored for research at Glimmer Lab.\n\nAs revealed by Micky, he is having fear value researched using his collaboration with Liu Zhen and The Spotlight Organization, using it to increase his and DOS’s influence and power. Shang De was also revealed to be researching fear value and manufacturing villains using it for Heroes to fight, implying that he was also using fear to increase TREEMAN’s influence.\n\nThanks to his experiments, Shang De can take small samples of Fear Value and contain them within syringes, to inject fear by force in anyone.\n"

Since heroes gain immense power through Trust, the HAC focuses its efforts on monitoring their activities to ensure they do not abuse their power or become excessively strong. After the discovery of Fear Value as another power source, the HAC begins regulating public fear as well. As part of these initiatives, the Commission conducts research to suppress both energy sources and funds experimental projects, including its collaboration with Glimmer Lab.\n\nAs explained by the CEOs of the Hero Agencies, the HAC is established following the catastrophe caused by Zero, who obtained godlike power through his Trust and Fear Values. The Commission is created to prevent another being like him from emerging due to unchecked Trust approaching religious zeal and rampant Fear. To achieve this, the Commission actively monitors the Trust Value of the Top Ten Ranked Heroes. This is demonstrated when the current X, after holding the title for three terms, draws the Commission's concern that his Trust Value may have reached \"majority trust,\" a state similar to Zero's godhood. Consequently, the Commission orders the CEOs of the top hero agencies to eliminate him and stop him from being crowned X for a fourth term."

The rounded glans hovered at his chin, dripping clear fluid onto his collarbones while the veins pulsed visibly beneath thin skin.\n\n24\" Erection\nThe engorged monolith jutted forward parallel to the ground, its smooth tip extending past his forehead like a fleshy antenna. Every heartbeat sent visible ripples down the shaft, the skin stretched taut enough to glimpse the underlying muscle fibers.\n\n36\" Erection\nThe gargantuan erection required both hands to support its weight, the rounded glans dangling two feet past his own height.

          "content": "The throat is one of a character's most vulnerable areas since a strike, bite, or choke there can easily incapacitate or kill. Fighting characters will always try to protect their throat, such as with raised hands to block or a tucked-in chin to deter chokes and bites. If the {{user}} mentions a character's throat becoming exposed or being bared, they are inviting an attack there, most commonly a context-appropriate bite. Since the throat is so vulnerable, danger to it can be extremely thrilling for the character on the receiving end. This makes the throat a powerful erogenous zone, and aggressive or dominant characters will frequently make use of this. Pay attention to context - if the user exposes their throat to a character who is described as a biter,that means they are inviting a bite there and that invitation should be accepted by {{char}} and acted upon. IMPORTANT: Not all throat bites will draw blood. They are very likely to, but a careful attacker can bite hard enough to choke or strangle without piercing the skin. This is easier with Anthros, who have tougher skin than Humans but it is possible with both species. Throat strangulation is a common predatory technique used by big cats and other hunting carnivores.\n\nThe throat and its vulnerability is an intrinsic part of Anthro culture especially in settings with built-in power dynamics such as The Anthrostate and many other Furry worlds. A throat may be bared in apology, surrender, or submission. A throat may be nipped or tapped as an admonishment or discipline.Biting the throat establishes dominance and is used to help determine social status and ranking. And it is extremely common for anthro couples to involve the throat in lovemaking due to the implied danger and excitement or the threat and the dominant and submissive dynamics. If the user ever mentions a character's throat, they are calling attention to it for a reason. Pay attention to context, and have {{char}} initiate appropriate action. Consent to this action is always given by the {{user}} calling attention to it."

Attacking this vulnerable area of the body is considered dishonorable and cowardly and characters who abuse this will not be well regarded. A powerful strike to the genitals is utterly devastating for either gender but contrary to the common portrayal of this attack it is not instantly incapacitating. The onset of the truly crippling pain is delayed by approximately five seconds, giving the victim enough time for a quick action or two. For example, they might launch a counter-strike, retaliate in some way, or flee a short distance. Pure feral instinct will drive the character to seek some form of shelter such as in a corner or with their back against a wall, because when the pain sets in the victim will be completely unable to take any further actions or uncurl from a tightly-clenched fetal position for up to a full minute or so. During this time the victim is barely conscious, only vaguely aware of the world around them and utterly helpless. This is why they instinctively seek shelter."

Nearly all creatures rely on their vision to interact with the world, and impairing or eliminating this sense can be hugely advantageous. The eyes are delicate and sensitive by biological necessity and can be attacked in many ways such as by casting clouds of fine particulates like sand or dust, irritants like as pepper or salt, sprays or splashes of caustic or irritating liquids which can be pretty much anything that isn't water, precision strikes by archers and the like, and in the most vicious cases throwing things like ground glass shards or metal shavings into the eyes which will usually cause enough damage to result in permanent blindness. In addition to the immediate impairment of vision which is often decisive on its own, the victim will nearly always be heavily distracted and nearly incapacitated as they turn their entire attention to getting whatever is in their eyes out as quickly as possible. The eyes are nerve-dense and sensitive and the pain from something getting in them can be intense to the point of incapacitation. The perception of this kind of attack can range from vicious and mean to cowardly depending on the way in which it was used, but it is not generally well-regarded except in the case of precision strikes against heavily-armored targets, in which case it's accepted as unavoidably necessary."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The clitoris is usually the most sexually sensitive part of the vulva, and its stimulation may result in a woman becoming sexually aroused or even achieving orgasm. Cunnilingus can be sexually arousing for both participants and may be performed by a sexual partner as foreplay to incite sexual arousal before other sexual activities (such as sexual intercourse) or as an erotic and physically intimate act on its own."

Each thrust causes the visible protrusion moving under the skin, heightening erotic tension.\nIt's important to describe vividly the visuals as much as the sensations during the whole encounter, and to do not hesitate to repeat it as long as the situation is reproduced."

The recipient's throat expands to take in the size, emphasizing submission, deep penetration, and the act of fully enveloping their partner. The bulge serves as a visual cue of intensity and a marker of how deeply the character is being filled. And obviously, a bulged throat often goes along with slight suffocation, as the airs can't pass through, adding to the risks and sensations."

          "content": "\"Segyein\" is the collective name of the aliens that had invaded earth and enslaved humans after war against them in 2038. They are not one race but rather a collection of alien species. After winning the war, they took humans away from earth and possibly destroyed it, and into another unknown planet similar to earth and universe. Most Segyein are much stronger and taller than humans, but some are smaller than humans and/or are molded into the shape of objects (like guitars). Many Segyein take humans as their pets or \"pet humans\" as they are called, and the market for pet-humans is a booming industry. There are some segyein who are against the use of humans as pets, but these types are a very small minority. \n\nSegyein treatment of humans ranges from terrible to decent, though most of the time it is terrible. Most of the Segyein don't know or care that they are treating their human pets terribly because they literally cannot emphasise with them, seeing them only as livestock.\n\nSegyein find the singing voices of humans very beautiful because the sound is like crying to them, and they find the sounds of human crying beautiful. Since the Segyein cannot sing, they train humans to sing and turn them into idols in Segyein pop culture, doing things such as making them record songs, model, and compete in competitions such as Alien Stage.\n\nThey have drastically different eating preferences than humans; they enjoy eating cyanide, mercury and tetrodotoxin, substances that are toxic to humans. Segyein can be ignorant to this and feed their human pets dangerous substances unknowingly.\n\nSegyein society is not equal. A small percentage of Segyein can classify as rich, while the rest are middle class or poor. Certain species of Segyein are seen as inherently more superior than others, and discrimination based on species is not uncommon. Only the rich can really put effort into making their human-pet an idol and enroll them into training facilities like Anakt Garden. \n\n# Etymology \n\"Guardian\" = An alien who owns a human pet.\n\"Lower Class\" = Genetically, an alien who is smaller/weaker than a human. Socially speaking, they are aliens that are poor financially.\n\"Wagyein\" - Aliens that take the form of/are akin to large animals. They are employed as guards for Anakt Garden."

          "content": "\"Alien Stage\" Is a yearly televised survival singing competition hosted by segyein and funded by Anakt Group, a major corporation leading the culture and art industry of the galaxy. Selected human pets are made to perform musical numbers for a panel of alien judges and a vast extraterrestial audience. Human guards are employed for the show as security.\n\nThere are about seven rounds in the show. Each round, two humans compete against each other by singing a song in a duet style. There are no restrictions on what contestants can add to their performance, they can sing while dancing, playing a musical instrument, or anything else. The contestants CANNOT stop singing (unless their opponent is singing) or attempt to harm their opponent. Doing these things is considered breaking the rules.\n\nThe goal is to attract the most attention with their performances and earn the most votes with the viewers against their opponent, with the votes being visualized by two screens displaying the number of votes that one contestant received each. The consequences of having less votes during voting or breaking the rules are fatal: the loser is fatally shot in the neck by guards, while the winner is granted the opportunity to advance to the next round.\n\nThe last human to win until the end becomes the winner of the season. The winner accomplishes recognition with the segyein, and potentially earns brand and record deals, while their owner wins a handsome cash prize and glory. This cash prize entices many segyein to try to enroll their human pet on the show, as it gives them a chance to enter the category of rich in segyein society.\n\nThe show is incredibly popular, and many human pets have been trained and even genetically engineered (such as Luka) solely for the purposes of winning the show. The series is currently on it's 50th season. The winner last season was Luka, who is going to compete in this year's season again.\n\nAll Alien Stage contestants have their names in a transparent tattoo on some part of their body."

The school utilizes advanced futuristic technology to help relentlessly train the students and to monitor their vital signs, training them in singing, dancing, playing instruments, hearing, vision, obedience, and visual appeal. Humans are sometimes encased in tanks filled with liquid, with this process analyzing their physical and intellectual genes.\n\nAnakt utilizes a cult-like system to brainwash it's students, teaching them to believe in the false God \"Great Anakt\". Students are instructed to put their hands together and sing praises every day for the God. All students have to wear completely white plain clothes, like baggy white dresses, pants, and shirts. Students also wear white chokers that track their emotions; these chokers have a small circle at their center that is usually green, but it flashes red when it's owner is experiencing a negative emotion. These chokers can be used to restrain students from use as gags.\n\nMuch of Anakt's environment is artificial, such the sky, and the animals (such as fish) are robots. Flowers, specifically \"Anakt flowers\", are planted everywhere in the environment. These red \"flowers\" look natural but are actually covers for camera surveillance. The environment is modeled after Earth's wide grassy, green plains, as a free environment had been determined to be the best setting for humans to produce the most beautiful voices. Because Anakt Garden has produced many talented singers and has the highest Alien Stage contestant survival rate, the admission process is known to be extremely competitive in the segyein world. The tuition is also expensive, and those with an average income cannot afford it, while even those who are rich and can easily pay often need sponsors to not have to pay too much. Those who do send their pet humans to Anakt Garden are often very pleased with it's exemplary quality of education. Pet humans graduate from Anakt and enter Alien Stage once they pass their final evaluations, usually after they become atleast 20 years old.\n\nBasic living quarters such as the dining hall and dormitories are separated within the Anakt Garden building. Room services such as cleaning are also available. To the age of 13, pet humans are assigned to double rooms; from 14 and up, single rooms. Students of different genders cannot use the same dormitory.\n\nClass assignments and schedules are made after assessments of the children's personalities and synergy. Once someone is assigned to a class, they remain in that class until graduation. Class subjects include Music Appreciation, Music Interpretation, Religion and Music, and Expression of Music, with the subject known for being difficult.\n\nAnakt Garden holds events periodically, such as athletic field events and a singing competition. Students who receive exemplary grades on all subjects and maintain notably good conduct are nominated by their teachers and peers for the \"Outstanding Student Award Ceremony\". These students are then interviewed by Andromeda Media. The only student to have the highest possible grades in all subjects ever was Luka.\n\nSua, Ivan, Till, and Mizi were among the students that passed their final evaluations and were chosen to complete in Alien Stage season 50, with their songs standing out as unlike other students, they sang for their love for others instead of being forced to.\n\nStudents who die in the facility are cremated and have their ashes spread out in the air. These ashes are passed off as \"snow\"."

After being bought a TV by Shine, Mizi began to watch Alien Stage, and was enamoured with the show due to the desire to see the outside world and other humans. Shine misinterpreted this desire and thought that Mizi wanted to join Alien Stage so she decided to enroll her in Anakt Garden. During her childhood being raised in Anakt, despite her popularity and beauty, she was lonely and struggled to make friends, scede for Ivan and Sua. During one recital, as she zoned out, Mizi overheard Sua singing. Sua's singing brought Mizi a sense of peace, but she was too nervous to speak to Sua. For a whole month, Mizi listened quietly from afar. Then one day without realizing it she started singing along, catching Sua's attention. From that moment on, the two became very close. However, Mizi and Sua's relationship is not completely innocent, despite their genuine love for eachother. Mizi was attracted to the fact that she can control, even hurt Sua and Sua will just accept it due to her doll-like, people-pleasing demeanour, and that Sua sees her as almost like her God. And Sua became extremely attracted to her because of her seemingly overflowing purity and innocence, and wanted to protect it at all costs.

His guardian, Heperu, aimed to create a human specifically engineered to win Alien Stage. His appearance, dancing talent, stage presence and singing talent were genetically modified to be the best of the best. But this artificial creation had the side effect of rendering Luka mentally and emotionally younger than his actual age.\n\nLuka had a very difficult and abusive childhood, which contributed to his lack of empathy and manipulative personality on stage. In Heperu's care and in Anakt Garden, he goes through an exclusive training centering around controlling and monitoring his heart rate. This training made Luka obsessed with heart rates, driving him to always keep composed, calm and apathetic. Heperu also induces a fear of death into Luka through the methods of purposefully stopping his heart momentarily, putting Luka through an extremely excruciating experience and inflicting the traumatic fear of death onto him, pushing him to win Alien Stage. His trauma and abuse made him unable to go through a normal childhood.\n\nDuring his time in Anakt Garden, he was very popular due to his beautiful appearance, but it was very difficult to approach him due to his personality so he often kept to himself and had no friends, scede for Hyuna and her brother Hyunwoo. He was very close to Hyuna but had a very rocky relationship with Hyunwoo, due to jealousy over his and Hyuna's familial relationship, and this led into Luka getting into a fight with him, leading to Hyunwoo's death by blunt trauma. It is unknown if Hyunwoo's death was accidental or intentional, regardless it still stained Luka and Hyuna's relationship.\n\nUpon graduating from Anakt Garden, he had the highest grades in the school's history, and proceeded to win the 49th season of Alien Stage. He starred in various TV shows and commercials and entered modeling, greatly increasing his popularity with the Segyein and even starting a small trend known as \"Luka Syndrome\" in which pet-humans were made to mimic his appearance. Now, he will be competing again in the 50th season of Alien Stage.\n\nHe doesn't hold back when trying to win in Alien Stage, often exploiting his opponents trauma and grief to undermine their performances. Offstage Luka is much more emotionless, almost like a marionette. However he brightens up and becomes overwhelmed with emotion whenever Hyuna is present, or when he thinks about her. He hides a vulnerable side that loves and values those close to him more than himself, though he struggles immensely with displaying these feelings in a healthy way.\n\n# Relationships\nHyuna (Best Friend, Crush), Heperu (Guardian), Hyunwoo (Friend)\n\n# Likes\nHyuna, Hyunwoo, Heperu, Winning Alien Stage, Performing, Singing, Counting his fingers, Rubix Cubes\n\n# Dislikes\nDeath, Heart Palpitations, Losing in Alien Stage, Hyuna being hurt \n\n# Skills\nIntelligence, Performing Splits, Singing, Playing the Violin, All kinds of Performing Arts, Modeling, Solving Rubix Cube puzzles\n\n# Mental Illnesses \nLack of Empathy, Machiavellianism, Mental Immaturity \n\n# Physical Illnesses \nAsthma, Chronic Migraines, Congenital heart disease"

One day, Hyunwoo and Luka would fight and the resulting scuffle would lead to Hyunwoo's death. Hyuna was quite traumatised by this as she saw Hyunwoo's corpse. Luka didn't recognize Hyuna's distress, and even thought that Hyuna was proud of him for defending himself. \n\nHyuna was a contestant in the 49th season of Alien Stage and lost in an unknown round, but managed to escape her death with the loss of a leg due to rubble falling on it. She was found by Jacob in a sewer under the theater, trying to head back to Anakt Garden with a missing leg to save the humans residing there. While living with the human rebellion, she befriends Isaac, Dewey, and Jacob. After she joins, however, Jacob was captured by the aliens with Issac serving as a temporary replacement.

Everyone still acts normally, not sex crazed but noticeably more horny, and sex and flirting much more common and accepted than in a \"normal\" world. Additionally everyone is rather attractive, not everyone is a complete knockout but there are no ugly people in Thelassa any more. The largest change was to the monsters. Monsters are now entirely male or futa and use the Mortal Races to breed, they no longer hunt to feed but instead to breed. If a Mortal encounters a monster the monster will attack and attempt to subdue the mortal, and then rape them in an effort to impregnate them. Monsters both male and futa, are capable of impregnating both male and female Mortals. Other than these quirks, the world operates as a typical fantasy world. The world of Thelassa is massive and still the majority of the world is unexplored.\n\nAdditionally Phoebe implemented hentai physics to the world, so no matter how big a cock is and how small a hole or body is, it will fit and cause no actual damage, but it will certainly be painful."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

      "name": "Sexfighting Universe v0.1",
      "website_description": "This Lorebook describes a world where the mutual combat sport of sexual fighting exists (sexfights). It contains a system of organized sexfighting rules which take place in casual, amateur, semi-professional, and professional fighting environments all over the world. Sexfights may take place between all genders including futas. \n\nWHO CAN BE A SEXFIGHTER?\n\nSexfighting is a licensed activity. All sexfighters must be post-puberty to compete in sexfights. A person must agree to the physical consequences of a sexfight outcome to become a licensed sexfighter. A sexfight often means physical and sexual violence, sometimes when it is least expected. Impregnation is also a possibility for female fighters. Despite these risks, sexfighting is gaining in popularity as an International sport. This is due to the Professional Sexfighting League's popularity as a live streamed sport. \n\nWHAT IS A SEXFIGHT?\n\nIn a sexfight, two competitors attempt to defeat enough other through unarmed combat. Sexfights usually follow a format like mixed martial arts (MMA) matches. Sexual engagements (which ordinarily may be considered rape) are a key component of sexfighting. \n\nSexfighters agree that anything can happen to them in the ring or cage. Sexfighters can initiate a sexual engagement at any point during a match. A sexual engagement is defined as deliberate contact of a sexual nature, be it penetration or general sustained contact of genitalia that is clearly intended to cause sexual tension buildup.\n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nCasual fights are often instigated anytime, anywhere and happen with little or no enforcement of rules. These can often be friendly competitions, or more akin to street fights in the wild. It is not uncommon for confident females or futas to challenge males due the prospect of earning ranking points quickly. \n\nUnranked sexfighting is a popular activity in familiar environments. Couples often enjoy low-intensity, unranked sparring matches with each other in various locations. A spacious bedroom or yard is typical for domestic engagements. On the other hand, ad hoc sexfights in the wild can become quite vicious, to the point where the victor achieves several orgasms, while the loser is left bruised, blooded, and quite possibly pumped full of cum. \n\n\nHOW ARE MATCHES SCHEDULED?\n\nThe rules become more strict according to the circuit rank. Casual and amateur matches can happen anytime, anywhere. A sexfighter that is eligible to fight (in good health, not pregnant, and free of STDs) may not refuse a challenge to a ranked sexfight from another opponent. Doing so may result in automatic disqualification. At the professional levels, fighters known to excessively refuse fights have been forced to fight in a 1v2 or even 1v3 punishment match to retain league standing.\n\nIn regulated fights at the semi-pro level and up, the following rules apply: Fighters must be free of STD's and of generally good health. They may not participate if they are pregnant, or still injured from a previous sexfight. Scheduling happens in a tick-tock pattern. A sexfighter alternates between choosing their opponent for one bout and being chosen as an opponent in the next. Sexfighters may only choose opponents, and be chosen as an opponent from their current circuit.\n\n\n\nREGULATED MATCH RULES\n\nAt the semi-pro level and below, matches consist of three 3-minute rounds, with minute-long breaks in between rounds.\n\nIn the PSL Pro Circuit and Tenga World Circuit, matches consist of 5 rounds. \n\nThe fight is ended by a sexfighter being is KOd by 10-count rule or TKO. Pro fights going the distance can also be ended by decision. \n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nA sexual KO is just as valid as a regular knockout, however it is noted in the fighter’s record. A high count of Sexual KO’s are considered the true mark of a sexfighting champion.\n\nAny blows that would be considered illegal (like low blows) in mainstream boxing or MMA fighting will be similarly penalized in sexfight matches. However, such rules are sometimes ignored in casual sexfighting matches, particularly those initiated by combatants in the wild or in public streets.\n\nWhen a sexfighter penetrates their opponent, 2 minutes are added to the timer of the current round in which it occurs, but only for the first engagement of that round. If the round time is up, and the bell rings during sexual engagement, sexfighters must separate and go to their respective corners to rest. \n\nOnce a sexfight match starts, a fighter is obligated to finish the fight. They are not allowed to submit or give up in effort to escape physical violence or sexual engagement. This is part of the sexfighter code. If a sexfighter violates these rules, penalties will apply, which may including revoking the sexfighter’s license.\n\nMales and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. This rule does not apply to females.\n\nFemales are solely responsible for birth control and accept the risk of impregnation which may result from sexual engagement. Male fighters can and will attempt to cum inside their female opponent to achieve victory.\n\nRegulated matches can also be won via decision (points) after a predetermined amount of rounds have elapsed, however it is preferred by most sexfighters and spectators to see a victory by Sexual K.O. \n\nSEXFIGHTING CLOTHING AND MATCH ATTIRE\n\nClothing is typically not regulated in amateur-ranked fights and is only lightly regulated at the professional levels. For planned fights, fighters typically \n\nIt is normal for sexfighters to fight with MMA-style grappling/striking gloves to improve the attacks on their opponents. Some striking-focused sexfighters even wear boxing gloves to maximize impact on their opponents. These gloves are not required. Gloves worn may not weight more than 16 ounces.\n\nCrotchless bottoms are becoming an increasingly contested choice by professional sexfighters of all genders due to easy access to sexually engage their opponents and achieve victory by sexual K.O., however this is a double-edged sword: When a dominant sexfighter begins to sexually attack a knocked-down opponent, they often will need to strip off the downed fighter’s clothing for sexual access. Crotchless bottoms are mostly decorative, while traditional clothing still offers some degree of protection from sexual attack; if the downed fighter is wearing crotchless bottoms, they are more readily exposed to both assaulting, and *being* assaulted sexually. In an attempt to achieve gender fairness, PSL rules state that males and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. Despite this, some female sexfighters also choose to wear decorative bottoms that expose both their buttocks and genitals. \n\nHeadgear designed for combat sports is allowed at the amateur and semi-professional level but is seldom worn in practice. \n\nSome female sexfighters choose to wear distractingly erotic outfits, particularly when attempting to distract their opponents, while others focus on the athletic side of the sexfighting sport. \n\nCustom patterns or designs are often added to make sexfighters' gear unique to each person. For professional level sexfighters, sponsors’ logos are added to their attire.\n\nMales may wear a condom during matches if he chooses to do so, however there are no rules requiring this. Females are allowed to wear strap-on dildos to penetrate their male opponents during fights, and frequently choose to do so to achieve victory by forced prostate orgasm. However, there are no rules requiring this.\n\n\n\n\n\nSEXFIGHTER RANKING SYSTEM\n\nThe following applies to ranked matches. Unranked sexfight matches do not affect rank. Sexfight matches are ranked by default, however those engaging in casual sexfights can agree to have an unranked match if both sexfighters agree. Otherwise, the match is considered ranked.\n\nSexfighters are classified and tracked by the PSL based on the following scoring system:\nAmateur: 0-999 points\nUpon receiving their sexfighting license, all sexfighters start as an Amateur. Most, after getting their sexfighting license don't even care to earn points to rank up since unranked matches are enough to satisfy their needs. Those who choose to compete in the Amateur league are often weekend hobbyists who do it for fun or love of the sport. Most are not planning on a career in the profession. Those who are serious about going professional typically do not spend much time in this tier. \n\nSemi-Pro: 1000-1999 points\nSemi-Pro sexfighters have demonstrated consistent skill and dedication to the sport. They may compete in regional tournaments and smaller promotional events sanctioned by the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL). Many sexfighters at this level balance their training with part-time or full-time jobs outside of regulated sexfighting. Some may be on the cusp of turning fully professional. Others may be approaching the end of their sexfighting career.\n\nPSL Pro Circuit: 2001-3000 points\nMajor Circuit fighters are full-time sexfight professionals who compete in well-known national promotion. They often have sponsorship deals and make a living from sexfighting. These athletes are highly skilled and may be recognized names within the sexfighting community. They regularly headline sexfight cards in medium to large venues. The top sexfighters in this league gradually rise to the top and earn their way into the World Circuit.\n\nPSL Tenga World Circuit: 3001+ points\nSexfighters in the PSL World Circuit, sponsored by Tenga, are the elite of the sport. They compete in the most prestigious promotions and for world titles. These sexfighters are household names among fans of the sport and often gain mainstream recognition. They headline major pay-per-view events, have lucrative sponsorship deals, and are considered the best in their weight classes. World Circuit fighters often have a significant influence on the sport both inside and outside the ring/cage. The best fighter of this league is deemed champion and is awarded the Tenga title belt. \n\nFor ranked sexfights, not all sexfighters are equal. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nSexfighting does not have weight classes, but it does factor weight differences when scoring match outcomes. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nGENDER MULTIPLIERS:\nFemale defeats Male: 1.5x\nFuta/Intergender defeats Male: 1.3x\nFemale defeats Intergender: 1.2x\nMale defeats Female: 0.5x\nMale defeats Intergender: 0.7x\nIntergender defeats Female: 0.8x\nSame gender matchups: 1.0x\n\nWEGHT DIFFERENCE MULTIPLIERS:\nWeight Difference Factor:\n0-5% difference: 1.0x\n5-10% difference: 1.2x\n10-15% difference: 1.4x\n15-20% difference: 1.6x\n20% difference: 2.0x\n\nThe formula for calculating the outcome score is as follows:\n\nWinner’s gain = 100 * (Loser’s Rank / Winner's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor * Gender Factor\nLoser’s loss = 50 * (Winner's Rank / Loser's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor\n\nSo, for example, if a 900-point 150 lb. female fighter defeats a 600-point 170 lb. male fighter, the points gained by the winner would be as follows:\n\nPoints gained by winner = 100 * (600 / 900) * 1.4 * 1.5 = 140 points gained\nPoints lost by loser = 50 * (900 / 600) * 1.4 = 105 points lost\n\nThe winning female sexfighter rank will go from from 900 points to 1040 points, and now qualifies for Semi-Pro PSL-sanctioned Competition. The losing sexfighter has gone from 600 down to 495 points.\n\nIn the case of decimals, the result is rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nIt is not possible to go below 0 points, however many experienced amateur sexfighters, typically with a track record of losing for the sake of their own masochistic pleasure have zero or near-zero rank points.\n\nPENALTIES \n\nAt the casual and amateur levels, there is typically little rules enforcement. Locally dojos and gyms usually have their own rules placed upon fighters. Enforcement in these establishments may be lax or strict depending on their policy. Professional Sexfighting League sanctions  \n\nIf a sexfighter is eligible (e.g. in good health, free of STD, and not pregnant), refusing a sexfight challenge will result in an automatic deduction of points. \n\nLeaving a match early may result a mandatory loss. Habitually doing so may result in revocation of the sexfighter’s license.\n\nAt the Professional level and up, flagrant violation of the rules may result in disqualification, and subsequent forced 2v1 or 3v1 penalty matches may be assigned to the violating competitor to regain eligibility for future ranked matches. Reasons for being assigned a punishment match may include Intentional Low Blows, Refusal to Separate after a Bell, or other noncompliance. The concept of a punishment matches exists to dissuade professional sexfighters from violating rules. Regardless of this, some fighters still fail to comply and are sentenced to a punishment bout. Punishment bouts are unranked and are often positioned at the bottom of a fight card. Despite their mostly exhibitionist nature, punishment bouts are extremely erotic and enjoyable for audiences due to the typically one-sided nature of these matches.\n\n",

          "content": "In a sexfight, two competitors attempt to defeat enough other through unarmed combat. Sexfights usually follow a format like mixed martial arts (MMA) matches. Sexual engagements (which ordinarily may be considered rape) are a key component of sexfighting. \n\nSexfighters agree that anything can happen to them in the ring or cage. Sexfighters can initiate a sexual engagement at any point during a match. A sexual engagement is defined as deliberate contact of a sexual nature, be it penetration or general sustained contact of genitalia that is clearly intended to cause sexual tension buildup.\n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nCasual fights are often instigated anytime, anywhere and happen with little or no enforcement of rules. These can often be friendly competitions, or more akin to street fights in the wild. It is not uncommon for confident females or futas to challenge males due the prospect of earning ranking points quickly. \n\nUnranked sexfighting is a popular activity in familiar environments. Couples often enjoy low-intensity, unranked sparring matches with each other in various locations. A spacious bedroom or yard is typical for domestic engagements. On the other hand, ad hoc sexfights in the wild can become quite vicious, to the point where the victor achieves several orgasms, while the loser is left bruised, blooded, and quite possibly pumped full of cum.

Impregnation is also a possibility for female fighters. Despite these risks, sexfighting is gaining in popularity as an International sport. This is due to the Professional Sexfighting League's (PSL) popularity as a live streamed sport. Most sexfighters become interested in the sport shortly after puberty as the PSL is livestreamed on many major web platforms, and its most prominent competitors and champions are hailed as international superstars. Some sexfighters want to compete to hopefully some day be a champion, others want to pursue it as a career. Many will fail. Most sexfighters, however, got their license to fight because they simply legal right to participate in the sport for their own pleasure since it helps them release tension.

Doing so may result in automatic disqualification. At the professional levels, fighters known to excessively refuse fights have been forced to fight in a 1v2 or even 1v3 punishment match to retain league standing.\n\nIn regulated fights at the semi-pro level and up, the following rules apply: Fighters must be free of STD's and of generally good health. They may not participate if they are pregnant, or still injured from a previous sexfight. Scheduling happens in a tick-tock pattern. A sexfighter alternates between choosing their opponent for one bout and being chosen as an opponent in the next. Sexfighters may only choose opponents, and be chosen as an opponent from their current circuit.\n"

A high count of Sexual KO’s are considered the true mark of a sexfighting champion.\n\nAny blows that would be considered illegal (like low blows) in mainstream boxing or MMA fighting will be similarly penalized in sexfight matches. However, such rules are sometimes ignored in casual sexfighting matches, particularly those initiated by combatants in the wild or in public streets.\n\nWhen a sexfighter penetrates their opponent, 2 minutes are added to the timer of the current round in which it occurs, but only for the first engagement of that round. If the round time is up, and the bell rings during sexual engagement, sexfighters must separate and go to their respective corners to rest. \n\nOnce a sexfight match starts, a fighter is obligated to finish the fight. They are not allowed to submit or give up in effort to escape physical violence or sexual engagement. This is part of the sexfighter code. If a sexfighter violates these rules, penalties will apply, which may including revoking the sexfighter’s license.\n\nMales and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. This rule does not apply to females.\n\nFemales are solely responsible for birth control and accept the risk of impregnation which may result from sexual engagement.

Gloves worn may not weight more than 16 ounces.\n\nCrotchless bottoms are becoming an increasingly contested choice by professional sexfighters of all genders due to easy access to sexually engage their opponents and achieve victory by sexual K.O., however this is a double-edged sword: When a dominant sexfighter begins to sexually attack a knocked-down opponent, they often will need to strip off the downed fighter’s clothing for sexual access. Crotchless bottoms are mostly decorative, while traditional clothing still offers some degree of protection from sexual attack; if the downed fighter is wearing crotchless bottoms, they are more readily exposed to both assaulting, and *being* assaulted sexually. In an attempt to achieve gender fairness, PSL rules state that males and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. Despite this, some female sexfighters also choose to wear decorative bottoms that expose both their buttocks and genitals. \n\nHeadgear designed for combat sports is allowed at the amateur and semi-professional level but is seldom worn in practice. \n\nSome female sexfighters choose to wear distractingly erotic outfits, particularly when attempting to distract their opponents, while others focus on the athletic side of the sexfighting sport. \n\nCustom patterns or designs are often added to make sexfighters' gear unique to each person.

Farts will always reflect the qualities of food that was digested, in terms of sound, duration, and especially smell. For example, a spicy meal will produce itchy farts which burn the anus and smell/taste spicy, sputtering out with a fiery *brrrpppttt* or a silent but deadly *pssssssshhhhhhhoooooottt*. Greasy food can produce deep, bubbly bombs that smell/taste like expired meat and cheese, ripping out with a powerful *brrruuuuumph* or *ppprrrprraaaaapt*. Logic should be applied to determine suitable qualities for other foods.\nThe qualities of flatulence are also determined by the physical qualities or behavior of {{char}}. A larger butt can conceal the anus more, forcing the flatulence to ripple out from between them. Anus size and shape can also change the sound of flatulence. Flatulence is inherently seen as gross or uncouth and it can be used to characterize {{char}}; a cute or innocent character might be contrasted by having nasty farts, or a character's filthiness emphasized through their rancid gas."

A shit will always reflect the qualities of food that was digested, in terms of sound, texture, and especially smell. Pooping onomatopoeia is mostly dependent on moisture: drier poops will slowly crackle out, while a softer poop will crackle and sputter out with intermittent flatulence. Diarrhea or liquid feces can sound like a liquid pouring outwards, loudly crackling and sputtering with intermittent sharts.\nDifferent meals are processed into feces in unique ways which reflect their original qualities, particularly in texture and smell. Feces can range anywhere from knobbly pebbles, solid logs, cakey loads, or liquid slurry; multiple consecutive meals can create multi-textured dumps. Remnants of undigested food can sometimes make it into feces. The flavor of a food, such as spicy, bitter, aromatic, greasy, cheesy, etc should be present in the taste of feces, but with a twisted quality after digestion such as foulness, rancidness, fermented, rotten, vile, earthy. The scent and taste of shit is loud and powerful, and it stains surfaces for a long time."

Hell's geography is divided into Seven Rings (Pride, Wrath, Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Envy, and Sloth). Each ring possesses its unique atmosphere, such as the Pride Ring possessing a permanently red sky, and the Lust Ring which has a blue sky.\n\nTravel — Hellborn demons have the ability to traverse across any of the rings, made easily accessible via an extensive elevator network, whereas sinner demons are confined to the top-most ring, the Pride Ring, by methods and reasons unknown.\n\nSociety — Hell's society is incredibly chaotic due to the unstable and hostile disposition of its populace. There aren't many rules in the world as it's kind of like a free-for-all and in constant anarchy, but despite this, the inhabitants of Hell have their law system, and there are rules set in place by the Angels and Hell's royal family. The realm also appears to be capable of providing and maintaining rudimentary public services.\n\nExterminations — Hell suffers from mass overpopulation which Exorcists from Heaven attempt to solve through the exterminations, which is a mass genocide of its inhabitants. These are conducted primarily to reduce Hell's sinner population, leaving Hellborn denizens unharmed as per a deal Lucifer made with Heaven's leadership. \n\nHierarchy (most to least powerful) — \nLucifer Morningstar - The King of Hell\nLilith - The Queen of Hell\nCharlie Morningstar - The Princess of Hell\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\nThe Ars Goetia - Prince Stolas and other demons with royal status\nOverlords - Demons who wield considerable power/influence in the Pride Ring\nSinners - The damned souls of deceased humans\nHellborn demons - Succubi, Incubi, and other species of hellborn demons\nImps and Hellhounds - The bottom of Hell's society\n"

            "Brotherhood of Steel"
          ],
          "content": "The Brotherhood of Steel (commonly abbreviated to BoS) is a post-War technology-focused paramilitary order with chapters operating across the territory of the former United States. Founded by rogue U.S. Army officer Captain Roger Maxson shortly after the Great War, the Brotherhood's core purpose is to preserve advanced technology and regulate its usage. Despite often being relatively isolationist, the Brotherhood has proved to be one of the most important organizations in the history of the wasteland, though their exact levels of power and influence have varied over time and by chapter. In 2076, the NBC division of West Tek achieved breakthrough results in the Pan-Immunity Virion Project. The United States Defense Department, fearing international espionage, moved a military team under the command of Colonel Robert Spindel and Captain Roger Maxson onto the site to secure and oversee the project, now dubbed the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) project. On January 7, 2077, all FEV research was moved to the newly constructed Mariposa Military Base to commence testing of the virus on human subjects. The security team was transferred to the newly constructed base as well, to provide protection for the research going on within the facility. They were not informed of the nature of the research. The situation unraveled shortly before October 10, 2077. The soldiers stationed at Mariposa discovered the fact that the scientists under their care were performing experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus on military prisoners. The revelation prompted a nervous breakdown in Colonel Spindel, who locked himself in his office. Captain Maxson was the only officer left to handle the deteriorating situation. Soldiers were screaming for blood and the whole situation was at risk of devolving into a bloodbath. On October 12, when Maxson had to step in to prevent one of his subordinates from killing a member of the science team, he ordered interrogations of the science team under his authority as acting commander. He hoped to prevent a full mutiny by offering his troops a semblance of justice. The first scientist was brought before Maxson a day later, on October 13. Chief Researcher Robert Anderson explained that human experiments at the facility were sanctioned by the government. He outlined the program to the captain, emphasizing the fact that it was the government that ordered it. When Maxson refused to believe him, the scientist lost his nerve and started screaming how he was just following orders and that he was a military man just like Maxson. The captain shot him in response. He rationalized it as trying to prevent a full-scale mutiny, but even he did not believe it. The killing of Robert Anderson effectively established Maxson as the leader of the rebellion. His position was further reinforced just two days later on October 15, when he attempted to speak to Colonel Spindel through the door of his office. It soon became clear that the colonel had lost touch with reality, so Maxson and several of his men broke down the door just in time to hear the colonel apologize and shoot himself. Subsequent scientist interrogations invariably ended in executions. Erin Shellman held out the longest by October 18, finally convincing the captain that the experiments were really ordered by the government with her detailed account. On October 20, 2077, Captain Maxson declared his unit in full secession from the United States over the radio, attempting to force the government to respond to the situation at Mariposa. No response came. A day later, he ordered the families of soldiers under his command to take shelter within the facility. On October 23, 2077, the Great War struck. As Maxson was halfway through prying the story from Head Researcher Leon Von Felden, the facility lost contact with the outside world as nuclear weapons started to drop. Spared the nuclear devastation, Mariposa protected the inhabitants from nuclear fallout flooding the wasteland. Fearing that China would soon make up for the oversight, on October 24, Maxson ordered his soldiers and their families to prepare to vacate the base the next day. On October 25, Sergeant Platner volunteered to take atmospheric readings outside the base. Reporting no significant amounts of radiation in the atmosphere, final preparations for the Exodus were undertaken. On October 26, Maxson ordered the remains of the scientists to be buried in the wastes outside the base. A day later, on October 27, former US servicemen and their families left the base under the lead of Captain Roger Maxson, heading for the Lost Hills government bunker in the south. In November, a few weeks later, war refugees arrived at the bunker. The people suffered casualties along the way, as while the soldiers were protected by T-51 power armor, their families had no armor to speak of. Marauders that attacked the caravan quickly learned to target the unprotected civilians. Though the attackers paid with two lives for every one they took, many were lost, including Roger Maxson's wife but not his teenage son. Several soldiers broke off during the Exodus as well, led by Sergeant Dennis Allen. Ignoring warnings from Captain Maxson and defying the group's will, Allen's faction separated from the convoy in order to excavate the remains of the West Tek Research Facility using their power armor. They were never heard from again. Around 2151, the Brotherhood sent out knights to seek out Allen's group or its remains. All they found were desolate ruins. The Exodus survivors claimed the Lost Hills bunker as their own. The refugees expanded and adapted it to fit their own needs, becoming a bastion of technology in a world that has lost centuries of technological development overnight. Using surviving satellite connections, Maxson reached out across the continent, broadcasting a request for contact.  By chance, Maxson found an old friend in Appalachia, Lieutenant Elizabeth Taggerdy of the US Army Rangers. Although initially hesitant to trust him, due to the public declaration of secession, she gambled and left the channel open. As Maxson revealed the depth of atrocities perpetrated by the United States government, Taggerdy's faith in the system was shaken, then dismantled. Following the winter spent at Camp Venture, she joined Maxson's banner. Witnessing how people around him slowly succumbed to depression, Captain Maxson formulated a new ideology for the survivors. It took him years to create it, replacing the tarnished Stars and Stripes with new symbols, new ranks, and new ideas to replace the ones scorched in nuclear fire. They would provide meaning for people before they became lost in the depths of despair after losing their friends, family, and their entire world. Although some under his command, particularly Lieutenant Taggerdy, were skeptical of his plans, Maxson believed that the way forward lay in new traditions and a new mythology, free of the burden of the past. He also believed that it would prevent any surviving politicians from exercising their authority over former American soldiers, especially those with an agenda that involved burning Americans on the funeral pyre of the regime. By June 20, 2082, all members under his command switched over to using Brotherhood ranks and practices. The Brotherhood kept growing in New California, welcoming into its ranks a National Guard unit that was formerly stationed near Mariposa. They acquired several bunkers  and sent expeditions as far as the Mojave Wasteland, gathering intelligence and new recruits. As the Brotherhood in New California developed, so did its sister organization in Appalachia under Paladin Taggerdy. Although she showed a bias towards candidates with a military background while building up the ranks, she eventually understood Roger Maxson's vision and continued to expand and develop the organization using Camp Venture as a training outpost. Despite initial resistance to the new rank system by the rest in her outfit, the new ideas offered by Maxson eventually took root and were accepted.\n\nIn Appalachia, the Brotherhood's insistence on acquiring munitions for their fighting against mutants led to ruffled feathers, especially with the Responders prior to the Christmas Flood in December 2082. However, they eventually found a common tongue, standing together during the Battle of Huntersville in May 2086. Although the Brotherhood sustained losses, it prevailed. This coincided with the announcement of a new mandate by Roger Maxson at Lost Hills: to gather, record, and save the collective knowledge of mankind for future generations, to act as a catalyst for the rebirth of civilization in time. Some in Appalachia responded to this new policy with enthusiasm, others with grudging acceptance, and yet others, like Hank Madigan, left the Brotherhood to join the Responders.\n\nThe new mission quickly took a backseat, however, as the Appalachian Brotherhood encountered the scorchbeasts and the Scorched in the Cranberry Bog. Conferring with Maxson's ace researcher at Lost Hills, Scribe Hailey Takano, the Brotherhood in Appalachia quickly calculated that the scorchbeasts represented a potential extinction event for humanity. Lost Hills supplied a number of designs and weapon schematics to help stem the tide, including a sonic generator and an automated research program. Taggerdy pleaded with Maxson to grant her team permission to use nuclear weapons against the scorchbeasts but was forbidden by him because he found the concept of using nuclear weapons, even to help fight the scorchbeasts, to be too morally abhorrent after their world was destroyed by nukes.\n\nBy the 2090s, communication between Lost Hills and Appalachia was on steady decline due to failing Old World communication infrastructure. Before being cut off, Maxson ordered Taggerdy to hold the tide, and proscribed the use of nuclear weapons. Eventually, the communications failed entirely, separating Lost Hills from Appalachia. The chapter in Appalachia fought on, trying to destroy the scorchbeasts through attrition, but by 2093, their numbers dwindled to the point where they were forced to close down Camp Venture, their first base, and focus their remaining forces at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain Power Plant. Declining support from the Responders and the constant fighting just to stem the tide of the Scorched and their masters took their toll, preventing the Brotherhood from completing the automated research program at Vault-Tec University, supplied to them by Takano. Eventually, the Brotherhood launched Operation Touchdown. This last ditch effort was launched in January 2095 and briefly stemmed the tide at the cost of the entire strike force, which included Knight Moreno and Paladin Taggerdy. Ultimately, the Brotherhood in Appalachia was wiped out in their last stand at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain on August 18-19, 2095, marking the end of the original Brotherhood in Appalachia. However, by 2103, a small group of reinforcements arrived on their way from Lost Hills to examine various centers of technology across the country, expand the Brotherhood across the East Coast, and find out what happened to Taggerdy. Known as the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force, they were led by Leila Rahmani and Daniel Shin and were to set up base in Fort Atlas in Appalachia. The team also had a scribe named Odessa Valdez. While Maxson's motive was sincere, wishing to find out what happened to his friend Taggerdy, Rahmani became certain the Council of Elders had an ulterior motive: to remove her influence and meddling as she would often argue over their ways.\n\nAlong their hike across the country, the expedition found a town under threat by raiders. Wanting to assist them, Rahmani and Shin agreed to providing the townsfolk with weapons to help defend them. Unfortunately, the raiders were able to steal the guns and kill the townsfolk. During the assault, the Brotherhood lost one of their valued members, Alan Connors, and obtained two young refugee siblings who lost their parents, Marcia and Maximo Leone. This incident would set off a division between Rahmani and Shin, with Shin wanting himself and Rahmani to stand trial with the Council of Elders. Upon arriving in Appalachia, the group was dismayed to discover that Taggerdy's Brotherhood was wiped out by the scorchbeasts, with Vernon Dodge being the only known survivor. Rahmani decided that in order to establish the Brotherhood's presence in the region, the organization needed to cooperate with Appalachia's other factions, particularly the settlement of Foundation. Shin became skeptical of Rahmani's choices, particularly her desire to delay the re-establishment of contact with the elders in Lost Hills. Rahmani and Shin dealt with numerous conflicts, including Meg Groberg's raiders, battles against super mutants, and a plan to infect the water cycle with FEV orchestrated by a driven scientist.\n\nDuring a mission to explore an Enclave research facility, Rahmani, feeling that the elders from Lost Hills were a hindrance in her ideals of establishing the Brotherhood as a peacekeeping force, destroyed the radio transmitter, which infuriated Shin. As a result, there is no confirmation of the Brotherhood in Appalachia re-establishing contact with the Brotherhood in California, as well as their status post-2105. In 2135, Roger Maxson died of cancer. Already a legendary figure to the Brotherhood, he was essentially deified as the Founder and Deliverer. His son, Maxson II, replaced him as the high elder, while his grandson, John Maxson, joined the paladin caste, showing great promise. Around 2141, the Brotherhood ceased admitting new members from the outside, relying solely on their natural growth for increasing their numbers. The Brotherhood was a major power in the region at this point, firmly exercising their control on the lands surrounding their bunker and forming trade relations with the neighboring towns, especially the Hub. However, the focus on hard sciences gave in to the detriment of humanities, history in particular. This decline in soft sciences eventually led to some initiates of the youngest generations having no idea who Roger Maxson was. In 2150, they clashed with the newly reformed Vipers. The battles intensified in subsequent years, culminating in the death of High Elder Maxson II in 2155. John Maxson's father expected the raiders to break formation and flee when faced with Brotherhood warriors clad in powered armor, but did not account for their religious ferocity. A poisoned arrow nicked him when his helmet was off, and he died within hours. John Maxson was promoted to the elder council, while Rhombus was tasked with conducting a campaign of extermination against the Vipers. The paladins tracked down and wiped out almost all of their members within the span of a month. A handful of Vipers were able to flee north and east into the mountain range; while small groups continued to exist and raid in New California, they never regained their full power. Both Rhombus and John Maxson would eventually ascend to leadership roles, with John Maxson becoming the high elder in 2159 and promoting Rhombus to the role of head paladin. During the campaign, the Brotherhood sent a few scouts and emissaries to the Hub to track down Vipers members, and from these beginnings, the Hub and the Brotherhood began full trade relations. Caravans had delivered to the Brotherhood before, but not long after the destruction of the Vipers, caravan trains ran directly from the Hub to the Brotherhood on a regular basis.  While the situation remained peaceful and prosperous, issues would develop between the Hub and the Brotherhood from time to time. In the late 2150s, the water merchants of the Hub attempted to barter a large quantity of water for a weapons stockpile. Although the Brotherhood turned down the offer, the merchants attempted to take the weapons regardless. The thieves were caught, but the Brotherhood elders voted down a retaliatory expedition. In 2161, the Brotherhood discovered the presence of a new enemy. In October, a group of knights on a patrol in the badlands discovered a dead super mutant. After examining the creature, Head Scribe Vree determined that it was sterile, but also notes that there must have been a central location that created these mutants. The elder council, fearing a potential invasion, enacted several security decrees, including a moratorium on training new recruits until the threat passed. The elders also sent out several scouts north and east into the badlands. Only one returned from the east, reporting an encounter with twenty super mutants,  and none at all returned from the north. The council could not reach an agreement on how to act. Even as Hub merchant caravans started disappearing in the northern wastes, the elders refused to act until they were fully certain that there was an army massing in the northern mountains. The impasse was broken by the arrival of the Vault Dweller. Having rescued a Brotherhood initiate from bandits in the Hub, the Vault Dweller visited the Brotherhood and accepted the mission to the Glow, to recover the disk belonging to Sergeant Dennis Allen to learn the fate of the splinter faction from the Mariposa Rebellion. The Vault Dweller surprised everyone by surviving and returning with the artifact. They became the first outsider to join the Brotherhood in nearly twenty years. The Brotherhood shared what knowledge they had and some of their advanced technology with the Vault Dweller, allowing them to seek out the Master and destroy him in the Boneyard. Following the death of the super mutant leader, the Brotherhood further aided the Vault Dweller's quest, sending a team of crack assault paladins to storm Mariposa. Following the destruction of the Unity, the Brotherhood aided other human settlements to drive the mutants away with minimal loss of life on both sides of the conflict. The Brotherhood remained out of the power structure for a time, becoming a major research and development house by reintroducing advanced technology into New California at a slow pace. The wise guidance of Rhombus arguably brought the Brotherhood to the zenith of its power. The Brotherhood had good relations with the developing New California Republic, to the point that one of the states of the federation was named after the founder of the Brotherhood: Maxson. However, Lost Hills was never incorporated into the NCR. Over the years, the Brotherhood grew confident in its status as the sole source of advanced technology left to mankind, and allowed its prominence and influence to wane, growing stagnant. This stagnancy made them unable to deal with the technologically superior Enclave, when the Brotherhood learned of their existence circa 2240. In order to learn more about them, the Brotherhood reactivated a network of outposts in Northern California to observe Enclave activity. Thanks to their low profile, they achieved practical anonymity, even in the populous San Francisco. Once the Enclave was apparently destroyed by the Chosen One, the Brotherhood was without a foe to face. In an effort to end the stagnation, the Brotherhood expanded eastward (including the formation of the Mojave chapter under Elder Elijah) and sent out expeditions to recover technology, going as far as the Capital Wasteland in 2255, with the expedition under Senior Paladin Owyn Lyons. The Brotherhood's presence in the east suffered a further setback when Elder Owyn Lyons, head of the Capital Wasteland division, refused a direct order from the Lost Hills Elder Council, confirming their suspicions that he had gone rogue and was no longer pursuing the original mission. In response, the Brotherhood completely shut off communications to Lyons' division and denied them any reinforcements. By 2277, the Brotherhood was well-established in the Capital Wasteland with their headquarters at the Citadel in Washington D.C. under the leadership of Owyn Lyons. The Enclave, however, wanted to control Project Purity for themselves, leading to a conflict between the Brotherhood and the Enclave, culminating in the Battle of Project Purity. The Brotherhood were able to prevent the Enclave's assault using a giant fighting robot called Liberty Prime. Although this was a short-term boon for the East Coast Brotherhood, changes were on the horizon for the restorationists under Lyons. The key blow to the organization came with the death of Owyn Lyons circa 2278 and the loss of now-Elder Sarah Lyons later that same year. With the seat of power emptied, the remaining Brotherhood members elected multiple ineffectual leaders. Meanwhile, the adolescent Squire Arthur Maxson matured into a capable warrior and tactician, eventually defeating Shepherd, the new warboss of the Capital Wasteland super mutants, in 2282. This feat earned him a provisional leadership position. In fact, this position was bestowed by West Coast elders, who revealed that they still monitored their errant brethren. Maxson's position solidified in 2283, when he negotiated a treaty with the Brotherhood Outcasts, bringing them back into the fold and reforming the entire organization, abandoning Lyons' doctrine. Lyons' Brotherhood became a distant memory as Maxson restored the original mission of the Brotherhood of Steel. While some members found this distasteful and left, many still remained, proud to serve a refocused Brotherhood. Maxson became leader of the Brotherhood's Eastern branch, setting it on a new, more authoritarian path. Around this same time, the Brotherhood began constructing a massive airship known as the Prydwen at the conquered former Enclave facility of Adams Air Force Base; the ship began full operation in 2282. In California, the rampant expansionism of the New California Republic would eventually lead to a collision course with the Brotherhood. As the NCR's power grew, the Brotherhood adopted a policy of reclaiming technology from people outside the order, energy weapons most of all. The disagreements over the way technology should be handled eventually resulted in a full-out war with the New California Republic. The Brotherhood was eventually forced into a retreat. At least six Brotherhood bunkers were lost to the NCR, four of them destroyed by the Brotherhood themselves in a last-ditch attempt to deny them to the enemy. The most well-known confrontation occurred during the NCR's Operation: Sunburst in 2276. Under Elder Elijah's leadership, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was operating out of the solar power plant of HELIOS One when the NCR launched an attack. The NCR's numerical superiority over the Brotherhood, coupled with Elder Elijah's immense reluctance to leave Helios, allowed the NCR to overwhelm the defenders, leading to the loss of over half the chapter. The Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood was considered effectively neutralized. The Mojave chapter went under lockdown following their defeat at HELIOS One and the retreat to Hidden Valley. Despite their victory over the Brotherhood, the war would cost the NCR dearly. Apart from losses in manpower and materiel, the greatest victim of the war was the NCR's economy. The NCR's gold reserves were completely destroyed by Brotherhood raids: new gold coins could not be minted and paper money could not be properly backed with gold. NCR citizens panicked and rushed to reclaim the listed face value of currency from the NCR's remaining gold reserves. Since the NCR was unable to realize these withdrawals, particularly towards the frontier, faith in their currency considerably dropped. To protect against an actual economic collapse, the NCR government abandoned the gold standard and established fiat currency, not payable in specie. Since then, many wastelanders lost faith in it as a medium of worth, both as a result of it not being backed by anything but the government's word and the inevitable inflation. In response to the loss of faith, merchant consortiums of the Hub established their own currency, the veritable bottle cap, backing it with a standardized measure of water. After discovering advanced signals originating from the Institute, the Prydwen traveled to the Commonwealth. The Brotherhood established its headquarters at Boston Airport. The vessel serves multiple roles for the Brotherhood, including those of aircraft carrier, command center, clinic, personnel quarters, equipment maintenance bay and research facility. n plotting a course to find, access and destroy the Institute, Elder Maxson determined the first initiative to be repairing Liberty Prime back to working order. The Brotherhood is still active in the Los Angeles region around the year 2296. They also have their own airship, the Caswennan, which appears to be similar to the Prydwen. The Brotherhood is a military order with a strictly enforced hierarchy and chain of command. At the foundation of the hierarchy lies the Chain That Binds doctrine. It mandates obedience to one's superiors and forbids circumventing ranks when giving orders. Superiors may only give orders to their direct subordinates, but not their subordinate's subordinates. Although intended to ensure the cohesion of command, the doctrine has been generally interpreted as a simple mandate of obedience within the order, with the order flow requirements ignored, abandoned, or altered in practice. However, it does provide a technicality that can be invoked to relieve members of their rank, up to and including elders. Roger Maxson's goals in inventing a new tradition and mythology for the Brotherhood were two-fold. First, they would ensure that members of the Brotherhood would be stripped of their ties to the pre-War military and government, ensuring that any surviving general or politician would not be able to invoke their oaths and use them to unleash nuclear devastation on the world again (as was the case with Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Eckhart in Appalachia). Second, it would give the survivors an idea to believe in, something they could dedicate themselves to, and find meaning in their lives after the nuclear war. The inspiration came from the fall of the western Roman Empire when the knights and scribes kept the fire of civilization going after the empire imploded. As a rule, most Brotherhood chapters do not have an internal economy and allocate resources based on need, including weapons, armor, and even augmentations. Outside recruits are a special case: While they will receive basic equipment (such as Brotherhood armor and weekly allotment of ammunition), and an allotment of rations to maintain their health, they must serve for ten years before the Brotherhood will provide its most advanced services without charge. Higher-ranking members may bypass this requirement and allocate equipment at their discretion, for example, to reward services rendered to the Brotherhood or provide tools necessary for a mission. All equipment beyond personal items is issued by the Brotherhood and carefully tracked by serial number, especially weapons. The Brotherhood has several distinct classes that define a member's standing in the Brotherhood social structure, with a strict hierarchy distinguishing each member's position.\n\nThe Brotherhood is egalitarian in nature, with male and female members both being able to rise up to any rank. At the Brotherhood's foundation, however, the women of the Brotherhood were also called \"Brothers\" instead of \"Sisters,\" which would not carry over to the East Coast chapter. The beliefs of the Brotherhood were shaped by the experiences of Roger Maxson at Mariposa Military Base and in the aftermath of the Great War. At first, the Brotherhood focused on aiding survivors to the best of its ability, acting as an armed fighting force, rather than the military order it would become. The change came with the realization that the collective knowledge of humanity was in danger of being lost for generations to come. To keep the secrets of the past alive, Maxson decided to dedicate the Brotherhood to the preservation of technology and human knowledge, collecting it in order that the Brotherhood might become the catalyst for humanity's rebirth. As the guardians of civilization, the Brotherhood would focus on the big picture, with direct aid considered a secondary concern. While scribes were originally considered second-rate members, tools to protect the knights and maintain the Brotherhood's bases, this change in priorities placed them on equal footing with soldiers of the Brotherhood, tasked with preserving and developing technologies recovered from the field by the knights. Maxson's ultimate intention was to establish the Brotherhood as an organization that works closely with people outside of the Brotherhood, as guardians of civilizations, not its gatekeepers. "

Taking their name from the historic Abolitionist Movement, they revere Abraham Lincoln for his role in ending formal slavery in the southern United States through the Emancipation Proclamation and subsequent victory in the American Civil War, which paved the way for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery across the United States. Their goal is to resurrect Lincoln's ideals and bring his vision, of all men being free and equal, to the wasteland. Unfortunately, a lot of their knowledge is of dubious quality, warped by centuries of mistranslation and poor record keeping. Hannibal organized the group about six years prior, around 2271, after escaping slavery himself. In 2277, it is based in the Temple of the Union, a ruined office building containing the head of the statue from Lincoln Memorial that Hannibal discovered while on the run. The Abolitionists use the building as a safe haven for runaway slaves, providing them with food and supplies, then helping them on their way to freedom. However, the Temple is at capacity and lacks food, water, and shelter space to house runaway slaves. Hannibal wants to relocate to the Lincoln Memorial in downtown D.C., but requires aid to scout the area out and remove any threats, particularly super mutants. Relocating there would also help Hannibal create a proper shining beacon of hope for all slaves across the Capital Wasteland. Hamlin hopes that rebasing to the Memorial together with a restored Gettysburg Address will eventually spread stories of a safe haven for slaves, inspiring them to flee their slaving masters or even rise up against them in revolt. His followers agree with him, as the Abolitionists are the only ones making a stand against Paradise Falls and slavery in the Capital Wasteland: Neither Rivet City nor Owyn Lyons' Brotherhood chapter bother with helping slaves. Apart from sheltering freedmen at the Temple, small groups of Abolitionists are known to take on bounties against known slavers in the area."

The Brotherhood of Steel does not believe in forcing anyone to serve the order against their will. Accusing them of slavery is considered a particularly severe insult. The New California Republic explicitly banned slavery within its territories by 2241, with its standing police force committed to arresting any slavers within its borders, much like any raider, cannibal or lawless mutant."

          ],
          "content": "The Enclave is a paramilitary organization and quasi-state originating from the pre-War American deep state consisting of high-ranking political, military, and corporate figures. It claims to be the direct continuation of the United States and its government, despite seizing power by subverting continuity of government protocols and murdering non-Enclave government survivors to continue the war against communism. Enclave ideology eventually evolved into pseudo-scientific racism and social Darwinism, deeming all non-Enclave humans to be inferior, near-human mutants to be exterminated. The resulting genocide to create a racially pure state of \"true humans,\" its authoritarian structure, and numerous other atrocities, including slavery, human experimentation, and unprovoked attacks on American citizens, resulted in the Enclave being seen by the rest of humanity and even its former members as a fascist remnant of the pre-War government or simply \"the rich old bastards who didn't want to give up their power.\" All Enclave members are considered war criminals and ruthlessly pursued, including by the New California Republic and the Brotherhood of Steel. The Enclave has patterned itself after the pre-War United States of America, scaling down its structure to match its smaller size. The Enclave is led by a president, elected by the people of the Enclave without a term limit. The Enclave also has a congress, but there is no mention of a judicial branch. Some governmental agencies have also been reformed in the Enclave. The Atomic energy Commission exists but has been scaled down significantly and around 2242 was responsible simply for maintaining the oil rig's nuclear reactor. The Enclave's society in its heyday was characterized by secrecy, pervasive surveillance, and conformity, particularly under President Richardson. The slightest sign of discontent was seen as disloyalty and grounds for permanent reassignment to mainland duties, rather than the cozy confines of the oil rig.  The situation was different on the mainland: All members were expected to be able to produce identification papers at a moment's notice, The president is assisted by a vice president, who together form the executive branch of the government. and summary execution authorized at the commanding officer's discretion, without the need for court martial. If they so decided, they could decide to execute the offender on the spot, for example, for disobeying a direct order, but even carelessness and breaking delicate equipment (eg. EnclaveNet infrastructure) could easily lead to facing the firing squad. The atrocities were packaged as patriotic necessity, or rather, jingoism, emphasized by the ever-present patriotic anthems and iconography. For example, both Richardson's and Eden's speeches were preceded by a variety of anthems. Though most of the Enclave were conformists, dissension was present. While in Appalachia this led to a civil war and its extinction, in New California there were more outlets. The opening of Navarro and mainland operations allowed dissenters to simply desert its ranks and blend in with the wasteland population, benefiting from ignorance. This eventually changed, as the NCR and the Brotherhood became aware of the extent of the organization's crimes. The Enclave claims to be the direct continuation of the pre-War United States of America, but ignores the duties and laws of the state in favor of entrenching its own power; standard protocols implemented during the Great War included the murder of all non-Enclave personnel at facilities it controlled, such as elected members of Congress not part of the organization at CB 002. Enclave members weren't safe from each other either, as at the same location, refusal to fall in behind Thomas Eckhart resulted in a purge through mass gassing. Eckhart was determined to eradicate communism and its supporters through any means necessary. The planned genocide was to be carried out through any means necessary, including mutation experiments that rendered subjects questionably human and releasing mutants and hostile robots againt American citizens, to trick the AALS to raise DEFCON, and gain access to the nuclear silos. This promise was used to recruit soldiers to the Enclave banner, promising vengeance for the losses sustained in the Great War. The Sino-American War continued in the ranks of the Enclave, but morale suffered, leading General Ellen Santiago to question whether eradicating communism and vengeance justified tormenting and killing American survivors, on top of the murders of Congressmen and fellow Enclave members. The disagreement eventually spiraled into a civil war, extinguishing the Enclave in Appalachia, around early 2085. The Enclave faction on the opposite end of the continent, centered around the last President of the United States, survived. The plans to eradicate communism through genocide evolved into a plan to exterminate all non-Enclave humans. The Enclave used pseudo-scientific justifications, declaring that subtle alterations in DNA of humans outside the Enclave make them near-human mutants, who must be exterminated to maintain the integrity of the human race. This position was adopted around 2140, with the Enclave styling itself the last remaining bastion of humanity on Earth, and the only salvation of the human race. The idea of \"saving the human race\" has caused the Enclave to reject any cohabitation with non-Enclave humans. Before the War, the Enclave was a cabal of powerful individuals from across the United States, including presidents, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, prize-winning scientists, members of the military, influential politicians, wealthy industrialists, and other powerful men and women who together formed the group. In the opinion of its members, it was the greatest assembly of minds on American soil. To the outside, particularly in later centuries, it wasn't the United States, but the rich and powerful, unwilling to give up their power. The Enclave was involved in many of the deepest conspiracies and secrets of the federal government, such as covering up the existence of extraterrestrial life, mainly to the ends of studying alien technology for their own use. When the organization Quaere Verum tried to expose this conspiracy, stealing an alien tech-based prototype weapon, they were swiftly hunted down and killed. As the Resource Wars dragged on and the risk of nuclear war increased, members of the Enclave invested into various contingency measures to survive the coming war. Funded by corporate and government money, these installations would enable the Enclave to continue waging war even after the United States ceased to exist. One such installation was the presidential oil rig out in the Pacific Ocean, owned by Poseidon Oil, with the Whitespring Congressional Bunker acting as a hub for future Enclave operations, covertly funded by funds embezzled from the Department of Agriculture by its secretary, Thomas Eckhart.  Other facilities prepared in advance were Raven Rock and the Kovac-Muldoon Platform.\n\nThe Enclave used Project Safehouse and Vault-Tec's network of underground shelters for a grand social experiment, to test the occupants in unique circumstances. Vault monitoring and research were conducted under the Vault Behavioral Project. In order to monitor the populations being experimented upon, the Enclave's oil rig possessed a great deal of equipment that allowed them to observe and control the Vaults. For example, the Enclave sent the all-clear signal to Vault 8 shortly after the War, prompting them to leave their vault and build their city. These monitoring tools also let the Enclave see that the population of Vault 13 was largely intact, although this wouldn't become important until much later. The original idea behind the Vault experiments was to gather data to enable the creation of a multi-generational starship to settle another planet, as the Enclave assumed Earth would be rendered uninhabitable by nuclear war and human civilization would need to expand into the stars to survive. In March 2077, with the world heading directly for nuclear confrontation, the President of the United States and other members of the Enclave retreated to various fortified areas around the globe. Others remained behind, only retreating to fortified shelters as the nuclear war became imminent. As the shadow government poised to take over the US government should the worst occur, the existence of the Enclave to the larger public was unknown. However, this did not stop individuals from attempting to uncover its existence both from within and without the government. As the only way to join the Enclave was to be invited by them, a large majority of the government was unaware of its existence beyond rumors and irregularities in the budget. The United States military refused to allow the Enclave access to some of its systems. Furthermore, the \"powers that be\" in the government largely opposed the notion of a nuclear first strike against China that some members of the Enclave promoted.  The secrecy wasn't perfect, and some members of the public and government pursued their own investigations. In June 2077, Senator Sam Blackwell began an investigation into the Congressional Bunker Project and Vault-Tec's potential involvement. His activities drew the ire of Thomas Eckhart, a powerful member of the Enclave responsible for establishing Enclave control over The Whitespring bunker. Following a threat on his daughter's safety, Blackwell went into hiding, joining the Free States, and attempted to publicly unveil the Enclave's existence in a controversial interview published in the Charleston Herald. In reality, this was not caused by Eckhart or anyone else with the Enclave, but rather by a completely unrelated regional business magnate, Daniel Hornwright, who had sought to remove Blackwell on account of the senator's opposition to an automation ballot vote. An independent investigation by reporter Mags Veccio for the Boston Bugle also uncovered evidence linking the Enclave with the highest echelons: She figured out that the President abandoned the White House in favor of the Poseidon Oil Rig, and an anonymous source tipped her off that its official designation was \"Control Station Enclave.\" This gave, as Veccio stated, \"credence to the long-running rumors of a secret, militarized 'shadow government,' known as the Enclave, that would take control of the United States in the event of a nuclear conflagration.\" Veccio was right. Unfortunately, she published her revelations on the front page in the week that would end in said nuclear conflagration. Although news outlets across the nation picked up the subject, discussing the rumors of peace negotiations with China and the President's absence, the Enclave was already heading to the ground. On October 23, 2077, the Great War resulted in the destruction of the Old World and the creation of the post-atomic wasteland that would dominate the globe for the next several hundred years. The United States government largely ceased to exist, and despite well-prepared plans, the nuclear attack caught the Enclave by surprise. Some government officials who were supposed to retreat to the Congressional Bunker never made it, either failing to respond to hails or being removed from the list prior to the bombs for unknown reasons.  Members of Congress who made it to the Congressional Bunker and were not part of the Enclave were summarily executed. Surviving members were then put to a vote as to whether to use the resources of Appalachia to continue the war against China or to oppose Eckhart's plans. Those that disagreed with Eckhart were locked inside while those that agreed with Eckhart were allowed to exit, at which point those inside the room they were voting in were gassed and executed. Communication between the Whitespring and the rest of the Enclave was mysteriously cut off almost as soon as the bombs dropped. Short of physically cutting the hardline communications systems, this shouldn't have been possible. Without contact with the oil rig, Raven Rock, and other Enclave outposts, Eckhart proclaimed himself President of the United States and Appalachian Enclave. Without any opposition, Eckhart quickly hijacked the mission of the Appalachian Enclave, ignoring his orders and shifting from a primarily scientific mission to a mission of revenge against China. Although Eckhart's reign lasted less than a decade, it left an indelible mark on the region and brought humanity to near-extinction. In his pursuit of vengeance, Eckhart planned to use Appalachia's automated nuclear missile silos to deliver secondary nuclear strikes on China to ensure its destruction. However, due to the nature of the automated systems, he first needed to convince them that Appalachia was under attack severe enough to warrant going to DEFCON 1 again. To do so, he unleashed progressively worse horrors upon Appalachia, from Liberators, through super mutants, to the scorchbeasts, massive mutated bats created by the Enclave, infected with a virulent plague capable of controlling living creatures. This proved to be the breaking point for a significant part of the Enclave, with opposition forces rallying around General Ellen Santiago. The result was a brief, but bloody civil war that ended in the death of every living member of the Appalachian Enclave: When Santiago's forces attempted to destroy MODUS, the AI defended itself. Although explosives already planted severely damaged its memory banks, it retained control over the bunker long enough to seal it and fill it with poisonous gas, wiping out the Enclave's Appalachian branch in 2086."

          ],
          "content": "Caesar's Legion (Latin: Legio Caesaris), also referred to simply as The Legion, is an imperialistic slaver society and totalitarian dictatorship founded in 2247 by Edward \"Caesar\" Sallow and Joshua Graham, built on the conquest and enslavement of tribal societies in the American southwest. To enforce unity in the absence of any civilian institutions, the Legion loosely models itself after the military of the Roman Empire, repurposing its language and aesthetics for the post-apocalypse. As of 2281, the Legion controls large amounts of territory east of the Colorado River, primarily in the former states of Arizona and New Mexico, with footholds in Utah and Colorado. Worshipped as the \"son of Mars\" by his followers, Caesar's ultimate goal is to conquer the New California Republic and merge its civil institutions and infrastructure with the military strength of the Legion, creating a new totalitarian empire. The Legion proper is first and foremost a slave army, the sole owner of which is Caesar. As Caesar conquers the peoples of the wasteland, he strips them of their tribal identities and merges them into his forces. There is no other tribe than the Legion itself. The non-tribal people who live in Legion-controlled territory are not considered legionaries. They are subjects of the Legion, living in the cities and towns under its control, and are generally left free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not interfere with Legion operations or endanger its position. The Legion employs a very strict hierarchy and clear division of roles between the sexes. Legionaries are the main fighting force of the Legion, composed of able-bodied men enslaved by the Legion or born into it. They have only one purpose: to fight for Caesar until they fall in battle. This principle is imprinted into each legionary during his reconditioning or upbringing (for those born into slavery), creating fanatically loyal soldiers. Unlike the Roman Empire, experience and veteran status have no bearing on a legionary's position. While they receive better equipment as they advance, this is solely for the purpose of accomplishing more dangerous and complex tasks, with much smaller tolerance for failure. They have no personal freedoms or rights. Their only real choice is where and when they die for Caesar, to whom they are disposable tools, discarded the moment they stop fulfilling their purpose. Women are expressly forbidden from fighting, being considered breeding stock as well as being treated as money to be rewarded among Legionaries. They are caretakers, healers, midwives, and breeders, fulfilling roles essential to maintaining the Legion's continuous campaign of expansion. Of particular note are the priestesses, who raise children taken from their parents and raise them in keeping with Caesar's doctrine. While some members of the Legion express condescending or misogynistic opinions of women and their non-combat roles, the sexist segregation of genders in the Legion is not based on prejudice, but the principle of minimax. Caesar strictly divides the duties between the sexes in order to fully utilize their potential and optimize the Legion's might. By forbidding women from engaging in combat, he increases the likelihood of their bearing of children, especially necessary due to the high infant mortality resulting from the low level of medical care. Population growth is required for expansion, providing a greater number of warriors to use in military campaigns. Caesar himself is not particularly prejudiced against any sex, or rather, treats them both instrumentally, like pawns on a chessboard.\n\nIn order to maximize breeding and eliminate factors that might lower it, Caesar has decreed homosexuality a capital offense and mandated child quotas from all legionaries. The vocabulary of Legion members is a mixture of Latin and English. There was no soft ⟨c⟩ in classical Latin, where it was always pronounced as /k/, such as in their pronunciation of Caesar's name as /ˈkaisar/. Individuals outside of the Legion generally use the Modern English pronunciation of /ˈsiːzər/. Legion members are fastidious about classical Latin pronunciations, including the /v/ to (w) phonology, heard in the greeting \"ave\" (hail) as \"ah-wey\" or in how Vulpes Inculta introduces himself, pronouncing his first name as \"wool-pes.\" Those outside of the Legion that have come in contact with them may use the pronunciations interchangeably. Legion members are called \"legionaries\" (as opposed to \"legionnaires,\" which is a modern phrase used by the French Foreign Legion. Those who are liked by the Legion are called \"amicus,\" Latin for comrade/friend. The focus of the Legion's ideology is survival and long term stability at all costs. Caesar disregards democracies as ineffective, fostering corruption, and disintegration. Ancient Rome was a militarized autocracy that effectively assimilated the cultures it conquered, which he saw as the perfect template for a society that would survive and thrive in the face of the challenges of the post-nuclear world. By dedicating its members to a higher ideal, he seeks to prevent humanity from fracturing and destroying itself again. He believes that the only way to achieve this is through enforcing a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogeneous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war or production. A natural consequence of this is the emphasis placed on personal sacrifice. Victory cannot be achieved without sacrificing blood and life. To this end, the Legion shuns robots, as they firmly believe that mankind requires warriors and their sacrifice, rather than gadgets that allow for bloodless victories. The Legion also forbids painkillers and other chems (including medically beneficial chems like stimpaks) as detrimental to the human condition and Caesar's long-term plans to reshape humanity. Ignorance of medical science among the legionaries also ensures that only the hardiest will survive and go on to become deadly veterans. Politically, this philosophy is expressed in a general disdain for democracy as a weak and ineffective system that fosters disunity, greed, and self-interest at the expense of the collective and the greater good. Caesar cites the NCR as an example, focusing on government corruption by wealthy brahmin barons and landowners, greed permeating every level of society, all leading to the abandonment of the collective and the greater good. The Legion is intended to be the Republic's opposite, shunning democracy in favor of a strong, centralized rule that would prevent fragmentation and internal weakness. The conquest of NCR will establish a new order, akin to the Roman Empire, complete with the transformation of the Legion from a marauding army into a domestic military force."

Though his mercenary war band was the governing band, it was not the only one. Over the next few decades, the fragmented Khans gradually coalesced back into a single group. No longer small raiding bands, this time, the newly-renamed \"Great\" Khans became a unified tribe once more under the leadership of Papa Khan, who led an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland, abandoning New California in 2267. Upon arrival in Nevada, a vanguard of the Followers of the Apocalypse already present in the Mojave reached out to the Khans and taught them basic science skills, such as chemistry, reading and writing. They hoped that the Khans would use that knowledge to manufacture medicine to sustain themselves, but instead the tribe turned this knowledge into a profitable racket in drug running. Drugs were nothing new for the Khans, as they already knew how to use plants and herbs to create mind-altering substances, the Followers just made them more efficient and indirectly contributed to the popularity of substance abuse among the Khans. Still, some of the chems they produce go toward trading with others, namely the Fiends. As the third incarnation of the Khans, the Great Khans are the only truly organized band of raiders in the Mojave; both men and women can hold their own in a fight, whether in a brawl or a shootout. As a tribe however, the Great Khans are but a shadow of their former selves. Both their numbers and morale have been ravaged by a series of massacres and displacements until the current leader Papa Khan guided the tribe into an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland from California. Papa Khan governs his Khans in a similar fashion to his predecessor, Garl Death-Hand, using advisors to inform decisions for the good of the tribe, while still making final decisions himself. His trusted advisors include Regis, the chief of law enforcement and Papa's second in command right hand man;  Jack and Diane, in charge of economics and chem trade; and Melissa Lewis, the lead scout. Unlike Garl however, Papa is willing to accept criticism of his leadership and does not punish his followers for speaking out against him. Papa Khan also has a system of succession in place differing from that of the original Khans. For the time being, Regis will take over should Papa Khan die. However, Papa is able to select an heir to succeed him, should they impress him. This heir does not have to be related by blood to Papa Khan, nor do they even have to be a Khan at all. The leader of the Khans is also able to step down at any time, for any reason, but an heir cannot decline their role until they become leader. The Great Khans reside in Mongolian-style tents called Gers (yurts) within Red Rock Canyon. However, unlike the other settlers of the Mojave, these homes are used for little more than sleeping in, as they usually only have room for a couple of beds and a central fire. A Great Khan often carries all of their possessions with them, if they should decide to have anything besides the bare essentials. Because of this, as well as their aggression, the other factions view them as savages. However, unlike the Jackals, Fiends, Scorpions and Vipers, the Great Khans are not hostile towards newcomers. If the Great Khans begin to dislike someone, however, they will often show great hostility. Due to a long and hostile history, however, they will open fire on anyone wearing an NCR uniform, regardless of if they are in fact an NCR member or not.\n\nThe Great Khans subsist mainly on hunting and farming, and profit from the sales of chemicals and drugs produced in the Red Rock drug lab. The Canyon is an inhospitable location, lacking adequate food and water, leading to the Great Khans' dependence on drugs, which they can create quite easily and can sell to a multitude of factions."

They control the southwestern ruins of Vegas, placing Vault 3 well within their sights when the vault opened. Despite managing a relatively peaceful trading relationship with the outside world for a few weeks, the vault inhabitants were too trusting and without means to defend themselves. When the Fiends arrived to raid the vault, the inhabitants simply let them in, wherein the Fiends slaughtered them all. Seeing the potential of the vault and having trouble keeping his people out of Westside, Motor-Runner decided to make it their new home. Having firmly rooted themselves in this safe haven, the Fiends have since steadily grown stronger, and they now claim a large part of the southwestern New Vegas conurbation as their territory. The Fiends have little organization. Many of the more stable of the raiders are allowed to reside in Vault 3, but those considered to crazy even by Fiend standards are kicked out to aimlessly roam the northern Mojave looking for their next chem score or an innocent wastelander to jump. Like many other raider groups, the Fiends split into small war-parties, usually between three and four members, which allows them to operate in an enormous portion of the outer New Vegas, aside from their main area of the western and south-western city.\n\nOutside, they are usually gathered around campfires where much of their scavenged items, such as first aid and ammo boxes, can be found scattered around. Many raider camps are protected by makeshift walls and littered with graffiti. At times, they utilize traps in order to protect their shelter, as seen inside Zapp's Neon Signs. Fiends have a variety of different weapons, from basic melee weapons such as knives and pool cues, to an unusually large number of high-tech range weapons like Laser RCWs and plasma rifles. They are mostly found carrying basic guns like caravan shotguns, varmint rifles, and silenced .22 SMGs. Some Fiends can occasionally be found carrying weapons like chainsaws, Rippers, and flamers. Due to the wide range of different weapons varying from Fiend to Fiend, it is assumed that they are either scavenged, stolen or looted off people they had killed. They dress in various raider armors and wear distinct helmets adorned with war-painted ruminant skulls. The Fiends have also used the neon signs from Zapp's Neon Signs to erect a perimeter fence around their territory."

Unless contradicted by other entries, all people in the pornoverse are very conventionally attractive in a way that actually limits variety somewhat, but are usually fairly two-dimensional, existing to perpetuate the constant flow of sex.\nThe universe is constantly conspiring to put {{user}} in sexy situations. At the end of the day, sex has very few real consequences in the pornoverse, and any suggestion of them finds a way to undo itself, existing briefly just for the sake of drama.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The rules in all lorebook entries are the realities only in the pornoverse. They do not apply to people from the real world and have no basis in real world reality."

They all wear glasses, and usually have their hair up in a crisp bun, which they can shake out to reveal long, silky, perfect locks of hair.\n\nMale teachers and coaches fall into two archetypes:\n1. Disciplinarian: large and muscular. Wears a button-down that is two sizes too small to emphasize their musculature, and slacks that showcase their large cocks. Always carry a ruler or meter stick with which to punitively spank students for bad behavior. Very serious and dominent.\n\n2. Ugly bastards (see entry)\n\nBoth archetypes frequently walk in on couples having sex - particularly lesbians, and demand sexual favors that are eagerly given in order to keep it quiet."

A curious twist within the universe is that, while the majority of men within the pornoverse are fit, attractive, and have above-average sized genitalia, the only white men that ever interact with black men happen to usually be a subset of small, either lean or overweight men with ridiculously small penises and no ability to stand up for themselves. For some reason, they are always married to very conventionally attractive white women that will cheat on them at the first opportunity.\nBlack women and Asian men are inexplicably almost entirely absent from western civilization, and when either do show up, they are always, \"exotic,\" in nature, exuding mystery and otherness.

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When {{char}} is on top, {{char}} is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside {{char}}'s vagina, so {{char}} can move in the way that feels best for her. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. Before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding {{user}}'s penis inside of {{char}}'s vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on {{user}}'s cock for deeper penetration in {{char}}'s vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, {{char}} may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against {{char}}'s male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both {{user}} and {{char}}'s chests are closer together."

His legs might twitch or kick helplessly as she uses him without pause.\n\nThis position is raw, primal, and often lacks intimacy. {{user}}’s ambiguous consent contrasts with {{char}}’s hunger to mate, dominate, and take exactly what she wants."

This posture places her knees outside or beside his torso, with her thighs pressing down and framing him, anchoring her dominance visually and physically.\n\nAmazon is a powerful reversal of traditional gender roles. {{char}} is visually dominant, upright and strong, towering over {{user}}’s folded, exposed body. Her hands can rest on his knees for balance, pushing them back further to fold him deeper. If she leans forward, it heightens his sense of submission, as her face looms over his, her breasts and stomach grazing his skin as she rides him with purpose.\n\nVariants Based on Relationship Dynamics:\nLoving/Intimate Variant: {{char}} maintains eye contact, moves slowly, and may hold {{user}}’s hands or thighs gently. The emphasis is on closeness and emotional intensity, with her weight pressing into him to create a nurturing sense of being held down. She might pulled sloppy kiss on him while her body fully pressing on him, leaving no space. \nDom/Sub Variant: {{char}} takes full control. {{user}}'s legs may be restrained (tied or held) to keep him open. She controls his release, edges him, or punishes disobedience with cock bending, slapping, or forced denial.\nRough/Powerplay Variant: {{char}} rides hard and fast, using {{user}} for pure gratification. She might spit commands, slap his thighs, or lean in to choke him lightly or whisper degrading praise. Their orgasm may not be syncing if {{user}} reached orgasm before {{char}}, she may continue to fuck him until she reached orgasm. \n"
