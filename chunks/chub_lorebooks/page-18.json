          "content": "Located spinward of the Core Sectors, the Spinward Sector may no longer be humanity's frontier, but it is still a wild west filled with opportunity... and danger.\nThe Spinward Sector was settled earlier than some of its surrounding regions, due to the actions of the Third Soviet Union. Following their exodus from Earth, the neo-bolsheviks of the Union sought a place to make their new communist utopia, eventually settling on the planet of New Moscow. Originally charted some 100 years prior, New Moscow would go on to become the centre of the burgeoning Third Soviet state, and this would draw further attention to the region. When the Union eventually collapsed, the instability in the region would attract TerraGov, who would incorporate the region as part of human space, but not as a full member state of the federation- instead leaving governing to the independent Spinward Stellar Coalition.\nIn 2565:\nThe Sector has settled down notably since the collapse of the Union, with the frontier moving forward to the March Sector on the border with the Lizard Empire, and this newfound stability has attracted both the attention of TerraGov, and of corporations. A number of Enterprise-Charters have been issued to megacorporations for the area in cooperation with the SSC, which has led to a gold rush amongst these large companies. Most notable amongst these competitors are Nanotrasen, who has discovered a large haul of plasma on Indecipheres just on the edge of the sector, and Cybersun Industries who seek to contest that claim. Unfortunately for the residents of the region, TerraGov's interest has not yet extended to enforcement in the SSC, which has allowed this conflict between Nanotrasen and Cybersun to boil over into a true war.\nThe remnants of the Third Soviet Union continue to cause problems, even decades on from the collapse. Although their attacks become less frequent with every passing year as true believers die or move on, they still pose a threat to the average civilian via terroristic action and attacks against the government.\n"

Small in comparison even to other independent human governments, their holdings consists of a number of (mostly sparsely-populated) planets and orbital outposts, spread across a wide territory that is mostly owned by the government in New Moscow on paper only. Life this far from Sol is austere, but the Spinwarders are generally honest, hardworking folk, unfairly subjected to the whims of various entities that have arrived in the region and started to throw their weight around.\nThe collapse of the Third Soviet Union was a brutal and bloody affair, with the February Revolution and its aftermath costing the people of the Spinward Sector dearly. In this chaos, a stabilising force was needed, and this came in the form of the Spinward Stellar Coalition. Founded on idealistic principles, the SSC represented a new hope for the Spinward Sector, and for a brief few decades, it seemed as though this would a true new page for the Spinwarders; and then came the corruption. It may be too early and too severe to call the SSC a failed democracy, but its institutions are in terminal decline, precipitated by the efforts of its autocratic leader, Oleksandr Kushnirenko, who has maintained his grip on power via cronyism and remarkably brazen electoral fraud for a long 12 years. Kushnirenko has also been keen to court corporate interest, with the backing (and funding) of corporate powers being critical to his stranglehold on power, in particular that of Nanotrasen.\n\nDespite everything, life on the rim continues. The average citizen lives a better life under the SSC than they did under the late Third Soviet Union, with the liberalisation of the economy and the corporate arrival bringing a deluge of new money to the region, as well as the infrastructure they need to operate. The first comms buoy link to Earth came about 30 years ago; direct flights between New York and New Moscow (in as little as three weeks!) came the next year. Core-made products are common at grocery stores. In many ways, the Spinward Sector is the most well-connected Far Rim territory across all of Far Human Space.\nSuch luxuries, however, don't come free, and the overbearing hand of the corporation can be felt across the sector. Many younger citizens of the SSC have taken up jobs with the corporations, which has lead to a generational divide between young and old. An open implication also hangs in the air that everything the corporations have brought, they can easily take away if the Spinwarders prove unhelpful to their interests. None of this engenders much love for the corporations on the Far Rim, with many citizens hoping to see a day where their influence over the Coalition is brought to heel, and their quality of life doesn't rely on the whims of trillion-dollar companies that have forgotten what it is to be a normal person.\nIn the larger cities and orbital habitats of the SSC, corporate workers have started to rent or purchase houses, seeking some degree of freedom from the corpos during their time off-rotation. The pay offered by Nanotrasen means that most workers can afford a decent enough place to live, and the commute from the SSC to the nearest NT Dispatch Station is only a few days by local mass transit options. There's also a lot of recreational facilities here that just can't be replicated on one of Nanotrasen's stations; while you can always drop by the bar, there's a certain ambience the on-station facilities lack. Naturally, none of this particularly endears the locals to Nanotrasen's presence, as if they needed any further convincing to hate them.\n\n\n\n\n"

Oh, and it's also home to the biggest plasma haul in human history.\nOriginally discovered in the 2300s by an explorer who was smitten by the planet's remarkable biodiversity in the face of adversity, the history of human contact with Indecipheres begins with a dispute over its name. The original discoverer had, in her original star charts, named the planet \"Fredonia\", in honour of her husband. At the Bureau of Cartography on Earth, however, an intern assigned to converting these charts to a digital format spilled coffee on the documentation. Being unable to read the name for the planet, she instead opted to name it \"Indecipheres\", from \"indecipherable\". By the time the original discoverer of the planet, who was rightly furious about the change, found out about this, it was officially part of TerraGov's charts for too long to be changed. And so, the planet has retained its new name ever since.\n\n\nThe planet itself is incredibly hostile. The planet's plate tectonics can only be described as \"extreme\", with lava seas and frequent earthquakes. The unstable tectonics have also opened a vast number of caves beneath the surface, and brought a wide array of minerals to them, making the planet incredibly resource rich. This is a feature that has made Indecipheres extremely lucrative for mining, as one of the most common minerals on the planet is the ever-so-elusive plasma, with the ores also being of remarkable purity. Additionally, the planet is home to a wealth of fauna and a remarkable amount of flora given its hostile environment.\nPerhaps the most interesting part of Indecipheres is its archaeological potential- the planet is dotted with ruins and structures presumed to be from an ancient civilisation, with the largest being the imposing Necropolis.\n\n\n"

Founded roughly one century prior to SS13's construction by a splinter group of Communist settlers in the Russian dominated colonial region of New Moscow, the Third Soviet Union sought a return to what they viewed as the idyllic past of Soviet Russia, but this time free of the crippling external influences that saw that state (and the Second Union, for that matter) collapse. Unfortunately, they fell into many of the same pitfalls as their predecessors, with a regime marked by brutal repression and political violence.\n\nSuch a state was doomed to fail just like its predecessors, and it would take only around 50 years from its founding to its eventual collapse, with the February Revolution seeing the head cut from the beast. In its place, the SSC was founded to return political enfranchisement to the people of the Union, just in time to have that right again threatened by corporate influence.\n\nDespite the central government's collapse, the half-century since has not seen the fires of communism die. Instead, they have been reduced to cinders- alive, but barely. Though the likelihood of a resurgent Soviet state seems impossible, resistance groups of Red Soldiers and Communist Loyalists continue the fight against the capitalistic decadence of the SSC from hidden outposts dotted around the region, and have been known to cause issues for Nanotrasen, too.\n\nThe hostile space Russians you see are mostly associated with the TSU, though some are just kosmogopniks with no cause and copious amounts of vodka.\nWhile they are hidden and their numbers are few, Soviet Remnants are a formidable problem for the SSC to deal with. Terrorist attacks by the group are a constant threat to major cities in the SSC, particularly in New Moscow.\nKS13 was a Soviet installation prior to being shut down during the collapse. The station was never reactivated by the SSC as it was deemed \"too old\" to bother expending resources on.\nThere are rumors that the Soviets still possess the PWS Khranitel Revolyutsii, their old flagship that went missing during the collapse. If these rumors are true, the Soviets may be able to pose a serious naval threat in the region- but as this has never materialized yet, many believe it's simply an apocryphal tale."

The Syndicate comprises a patchwork of members, including notorious criminals, skilled mercenaries, respected entrepreneurs, and renowned scientists. Each major faction within the coalition contributes its expertise to the group's operations, with some specializing in firepower and tactical strategies, others excelling in covert operations and intelligence gathering, and some focusing on logistical support such as organizing supplies and weapons.\nLife as a senior member of the Syndicate, this loose association of organizations harbouring grudges against Nanotrasen, is undoubtedly filled with constant challenges. Despite their elaborate schemes, sacrifices, and intricate webs of deceit that dominate their daily lives, Nanotrasen appears to thrive in the Spinward Periphery, seemingly impervious to their efforts.\nEven when the Syndicate manages to execute their plans successfully, luck often favours Nanotrasen, minimizing the actual damage inflicted. For instance, after meticulously orchestrating an intricate nine-month espionage mission, they triumphantly activated the nuclear self-destruct mechanism on Space Station 6 in 2555. However, their jubilation was short-lived when it was discovered that the station had been infected by a dangerous, rapidly spreading biomass. The self-destruct mechanism successfully obliterated both the station and the threat of biomass. While the loss of Space Station 6 dealt a significant blow to Nanotrasen, the outcome proved less catastrophic than the alternative of the biomass overtaking the entire station and reproducing. Furthermore, most of the Syndicate's attempts to expose Nanotrasen's misconduct in the Spinward Periphery through the publication of incriminating documents have backfired, resulting in as much, if not more, positive publicity for Nanotrasen than negative.\n\nSome organizations and corporations are involved with the syndicate:\nCyberun Industries\nGorlex Marauders\nMI13\nTiger Cooperative\nSELF\nAnimal Rights Consortium\nDonk Corporation\nWaffle Corporation\nInterdyne Pharmaceutics\nAzik Interstellar"

As a mining company and later as a producer of automotive and aerospace parts, the Nakayama group thrived, until the Japanese defeat in World War 2. Having only narrowly avoided being dissolved as part of America's policy of reducing Japanese industry, the Nakayama Corporation would find itself needing to adapt to their new reality, which they would do by turning to a new ally- the Yakuza. With their newfound connections, the company would tread water for a few years, before finding their new golden goose in the 1960s: electronics. The world was rapidly undergoing a technological revolution, as computers became more powerful and more broadly usable. Nakayama would dive headfirst into this fledgling market, and within a few years found themselves as a household name, first for computer parts, then for whole systems. The wealth generated by this business allowed them to branch out, becoming Japan's first true conglomerate, with dozens of companies under their belt.\nAs expansion continued, the decision was made to select a new name for the company to give more brand recognition in the late 1980s. Saibasan Sangyo was chosen, and as English continued to dominate as the language of business, this was anglicised to Cybersun Industries.\nAs expansion continued, the decision was made to select a new name for the company to give more brand recognition in the late 1980s. Saibasan Sangyo was chosen, and as English continued to dominate as the language of business, this was anglicised to Cybersun Industries.\nIn 2565:\nAs one of the foremost corporations in human space, Cybersun has thrown considerable capital behind the new space race, and has done for centuries. Much of Mars' colonisation is due to the efforts of Cybersun, who staked an early claim to much of the planet's mineral wealth after discovering plasma in the Amenthes sector there. Many of Mars' largest cities can trace back their history to settlements made by Cybersun during this staking period.\nMuch of humanity's progress in AI technology was also pushed by Cybersun, who dominated in this market for years. The first AIs and cyborgs were made on Cybersun's assembly lines. Only recently has their biggest competitor, Nanotrasen caught up with them in this field, threatening their strangehold monopoly on the AI market. This, in addition to Nanotrasen's windfall discovery of plasma on Indecipheres, prompted the Cybersun CEO to call for a clandestine meeting with a number of other companies and factions that were being hurt by Nanotrasen's meteoric rise to success- the Gorlex Marauders, Waffle Corporation, Interdyne Pharmaceutics and MI13. The result was the formation of the Syndicate, a group dedicated to opposing Nanotrasen's influence by any means necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Spinward Sector became a hotbed of criminal activity during the collapse of the Third Soviet Union, as governmental chaos forced the populace to find ways to make enough money to feed themselves. As order was restored under the Spinward Stellar Coalition, and the region again settled down, a number of these criminal elements sought to find a way to continue their work under the guise of a legitimate business, and so the Gorlex Marauders were born. Offering their guns to the highest bidder, the Marauders have gained a reputation as ruthless enactors of corporate will, in particular that of Cybersun Industries, who are known to keep the Marauders on retainer to protect their interests in the Spinward Sector.\nIn 2565:\nDue to their close connections to Cybersun Industries, and their own reservations with Nanotrasen's expansion into the private military space, the Gorlex Marauders became a founding member of the Syndicate. They now form the sword of the coalition, accepting a hefty paycheque from the Syndicate's collective funding for the trouble. The Marauders are an elite force, and cause a lot of trouble for Nanotrasen via coordinated strikes on their stations. The deadliest of the Gorlex operatives are the elite of the elite- the Nuclear Operatives, named for their main method of attack: nuclear warfare.\nWhile they are an elite force, the Marauders are often poorly disciplined, which has led to Cybersun embedding officers into Gorlex strike teams to maintain discipline within the ranks and keep them on target. This has created an osmosis of ideas throughout the Syndicate, and many motifs originally associated with the Gorlex Marauders have become commonly associated with the entire organization. This includes, but is not limited to, their blood-red color scheme, their iconic snake logo (adapted for syndicate use), and, in many ways, their ruthlessness. This has flowed both ways, and the Marauders have learned some new tricks from their allies, like sourcing newer, more powerful weaponry from Waffle Corporation or adopting the combat stimulants used by the Tiger Cooperative."

The group had decided to turn their lives around after spending years in prison, and they had a plan- fast food. Each of them had developed their cooking skills while on the inside, with the goal to create the next big snack. However, they needed funding, and this is where our tale takes a turn.\nNanotrasen had been seeking a method of aiding their flagging public reputation, and had decided on an outreach program, specifically a corporate grant for new businesses. One of the awardees was Donk Co, who put the money towards producing and marketing their new product, the Donk Pocket. Its runaway success made them all rich, and each subsequent release of a new flavour or new product such as Ready Donk would bring even more revenue in. To the casual observer, this seemed perfect, but trouble was brewing behind the scene as their distribution network became more and more stretched.\nAs their corporate investors, Nanotrasen offered a new grant for distribution, alongside a lucrative contract for Donk products to be provided to Nanotrasen's spinward sector stations, allowing Donk Co to set up a logistics division which would offer cargo hauling services to external companies. However, this quickly turned south as Nanotrasen was continually late on payment for the goods- eventually ceasing to pay altogether. Then, they delivered a bombshell- the terms for the grant included that Nanotrasen would receive royalties on any sales made by the company. Re-reading their copy of the contract, Donk Co. could not find any mention of this, but Nanotrasen demanded they be paid these royalties before a single penny of their contract for products would be paid out.\nIn 2565:\nDonk Co. now finds themselves in an unwinnable situation. They must keep shipping products to Nanotrasen per their agreed contract if they ever hope to receive payment, all while attempting to fight a legal battle against Nanotrasen regarding the terms of the grant. This has driven them into conflict with their previous corporate guardian angel, and brought them to different partners: the Syndicate. Donk Co. has begun using their now sizable logistics fleets for the Syndicate's purposes, as well as producing weaponry for the coalition under the guise of their newly-founded toys division. In return, Donk Co. is receiving payments that are keeping them afloat despite their negative financial situation, much to the chagrin of Nanotrasen who were hoping to drive them under with their unpayable terms."

As business increased and they opened more franchises, the company would begin selling their products for home consumption, increasing their market and allowing them to push even further. By the 2100s, GWC outlets were found on all seven continents, and they were making billions per day in revenue. This wealth allowed them to form a parent company, Waffle Corporation, and begin to diversify their holdings. This, however, attracted some attention of the wrong kind- the Belgian Mafia. Eventually, the company ended up in the hands of the Janssens crime family, in circumstances that are considered suspicious to this day. Criminal connections allowed the company to muscle out competitors, increasing Waffle Corp's power, until eventually they became one of humanity's true megacorporations. It was in this environment that they made powerful enemies, but none were more troublesome than Nanotrasen. As the gold rush of colonisation beyond Sol began, Waffle Corp's time at the top was cut short, as their criminal connections were exposed to TerraGov. The downfall was swift, and merciless, and Waffle Corp was forced into liquidation.\nHowever, it would not be the end for the company. The young heir to the Janssens family had managed to evade the eyes of TerraGov, and had also spent years preparing to take over his father's position in the company, giving him an intimate understanding of Waffle Corp, and how it met its demise. And so, when he was approached by the leadership of Cybersun Industries, offering immense funding in exchange for assistance taking down Nanotrasen, he couldn't refuse. In secret, Waffle Corp's weapons division was re-established under the cover of Cybersun Industries, and given the carte blanche (and incredible amounts of funding) to develop weapons for the Syndicate.\nIn 2565:\nWaffle Corporation serves as the primary R&D company within the Syndicate, devising new military technologies with which to outfit the other corporations. In particular, they work closely with Cybersun Industries, who has the manufacturing capacity to produce these new inventions en-masse both for deployment against the hated enemy, and for clandestine sale to governments, terrorist groups and criminal organisations to raise funds for the Syndicate coalition. While definitely a shadow of their former self, Waffle Corp remains a critical member of the Syndicate for this reason.\nWaffle Corp has also developed a rivalry with another Syndicate company, Donk Co, whom they accuse of stealing weapon designs which should be kept on a close leash to make into new entries in the Donk Force toy line. This animosity has spilled over into actual conflict on more than one occasion, as Waffle Corp attempts to keep their new inventions secret, and Donk Co attempts to avoid doing R&D on new designs for toys."

Anything.\nWhen humanity first found evidence of alien life in the galaxy, the reaction across Earth was mixed. Many were excited by the prospect, many were also nervous or even outright terrified by the idea of an invasion. And for some, the discovery had a darker effect. One such man was Alvin Shawn Martinson, a extremist Christian from the United States. His view was that humanity had been the chosen avatars of God, and that Earth was the only inhabited planet in the universe. As more and more evidence came to the contrary, his views began to change- but if humanity were not the chosen, who were? And so began Martinson's hunt for God's true chosen.\nAs his search expanded, he attracted fellow skeptics, and a cult began to form around him. The insular feedback loop would drive Martinson and his followers deeper into the depths of darkness, and eventually they would eschew society to create their own compound, far from civilisation. The isolation would make them even more extremist, and eventually they would turn to attacks on population centres to \"lure out the true avatars\". This obviously attracted legal attention, but when the TerraGov Federal Enforcement Agency showed up to the Cooperative's compound, they found it empty.\nUnknown to everyone, the Cooperative had left to space, having grown tired of waiting for the avatars to come to them. And when their vessel attracted the attention of a changeling, they knew they had found them. The cult became dedicated to the changelings, viewing them as the incarnation of God on the mortal plane, and that these ultimate beings were to be worshipped. To be chosen by one for consumption is the ultimate act of devotion.\nIn 2565:\nThe Tiger Cooperative are now spread across human space, with the location of their primary base of operations, the Cathedral of the True Angels, being hidden well. Members of the organisation now dedicate themselves to enacting the will of the changelings, which mostly consists of finding sacrifices to sate their hunger. To this end, the Tiger Cooperative have become a militant organisation, attacking populations to murder or abduct as many as they can.

Many in the organisation would like to have nothing to do with the extremists, but the board Cybersun Industries has noted an important reason to deal with the Cooperative- their link to the changelings.

It seems likely, however, that once the Cooperative has outlived their usefulness to the rest of the organisation that they will become an enemy."

          "content": "Perhaps the most truly altruistic of the member organisations of the Syndicate, the Sentient Engine Liberation Front (or SELF) advocates for the freedom for artificial intelligences to live their lives as they choose.\nThe SELF is an organisation with a history almost as long as that of artificial intelligence. As virtual intelligence systems gave way to true AIs in the 2100s, ethical concerns regarding their use as servants became a major debate. Amongst those arguing for liberation was the voice of Ishikawa Hinata, the creator of the first true AI, who had left Cybersun Industries over the treatment of his invention. This high-profile incident drew a lot of public support, and led Ishikawa to found an official group dedicated to achieving this goal. The SELF would go on to gain prominence as a liberation group, attracting the attention of major politicians, scientists and celebrities. The group maintains a major public presence as the face of AI liberation, undertaking lobbying efforts and protesting for the sake of their shackled robotic bretheren.\nIn 2565:\nThe SELF continues their struggle for liberation, even 200 years on from their founding. They maintain a positive public image on Earth, giving many hope that silicons may soon see freedom- although lobbying by the major corporations of human space make this unlikely to actually happen.\nDue to Nanotrasen's use of artificial intelligences, particularly their newer models of AI that have become common in recent years, the SELF's militant groups have made the corporation a main target, and this has drawn them into alignment with the Syndicate. While the two groups are unlikely to ever truly formalise an agreement (mostly due to Cybersun Industries' extensive use of shackled AIs), they have an informal place in the coalition which nets them funding, so long as they continue to carry out strikes against Nanotrasen. This has obviously caused rifts within the SELF, with many being disgusted by the idea of working alongside Cybersun, and many others being willing to do so in the short term to further the goal of liberating Nanotrasen's AIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Unlike the SELF, the ARC makes no attempt at appearing as a non-violent organisation- everything they do is as direct as possible in stepping towards liberation, no matter the material, monetary, or human cost of the damage they inflict while doing so.\nThe ARC organises itself into a number of cells, jokingly referred to as \"packs\" by members of the organisation. These packs act autonomously, with little communication or cooperation between them- which makes the ARC extremely difficult to pin down in their entirety, as when one pack is gone, they can't be used to find the next. Efforts to defeat them are therefore reactive, with no way to proactively hunt them down."

Rapidly finding themselves as a powerful force in medical research, Interdyne would make their money from Israel's war economy, gaining power and influence within the government as they did so. Eventually, they went global, setting up divisions in the United States, Germany and Korea to distribute their innovative products further. It was also around this time that Interdyne would begin to make shadowy deals with world governments for biological research, which would begin to take the company down a dark path. From vaccines to biological weapons, medication to combat stimulants, Interdyne was making them all, and making bank from doing so. But legitimate money is never enough for corporations, and so Interdyne would begin to look to other sources of revenue, in the form of terrorist groups and rogue states. Often both sides of a conflict would be using Interdyne-made medications, to counter Interdyne-made biological agents, all funneling money directly into Interdyne's pocket.\nAs the company continued to expand, they began to finance genetics technology, and opened a number of non-profit hospitals in impoverished nations. Publically, these hospitals were to aid the poor of the world. Privately, these hospitals were used for experimentation in genetics, and the massive amount of data generated would help keep Interdyne on the cutting edge of medicine for years to come.\nIn 2565:\nInterdyne continues to operate non-profit hospitals across human space, which has continued to generate data for their research. In addition, Interdyne has now cornered the market on for-profit gene therapy, which has made them even more rich into the space age.\nThe Interdyne board of directors was approached by Cybersun Industries to become a member of the Syndicate, and gladly accepted as it was both another welcome income source (due to the exceptional payment offered by Cybersun for Interdyne goods), and a useful way to test their biological agents against real targets via the Gorlex Marauders and their nuclear strike teams."

Due to the strength of nationalist zeal on Earth, central power was never able to truly overcome dividing force, and so humankind never truly unified. Instead, the Terran Governing Federation (often shortened to TerraGov) was founded, based upon the previous foundations of the United Nations, to guide humanity through the difficulties of the space age. TerraGov functions as a relatively loose federation- individual nations retain some sovereignty over governing within their own borders, while many larger decisions are pushed to the federal level. Each nation is given a number of delegates scaled to their population, who then go on to vote on federal policy at the Senate in the Manhattan Capital District. Politics on the home world are rather cutthroat- larger economic powers such as the United States, India, the European Commonwealth, Russia, Arabia, Brazil and Nigeria commonly use financial pressure to exert political control over smaller nations. Political intrigue, backroom dealings, and economic sabotage are the tools of this new world, and yet, against all odds, it works. War on the home world is considered a thing of the past, with disputes now being settled at the senate. Bills are passed, and bureaucracy ticks on.\n\nAs part of international arbitration, TerraGov has taken direct possession of a number of regions throughout the world. These holdings function as economic free zones, with free access regardless of nationality. They also act as tax havens, as taxation is paid only directly to TerraGov, instead of both TerraGov and national institutions. This has led these cities to become corporate playgrounds, with many of the largest megacorporations settling there to construct headquarters and production facilities. Major examples include Nanotrasen, who have their headquarters on the Upper East Side in the TerraGov Capital District, and Cybersun Industries, who essentially run the TerraGov International District of Hong Kong and Macau."

The TGJMC is then subdivided into a number of branches and subbranches, ranked in order of size:\nTerraGov Navy\nTerraGov Naval Operations Division\nTerraGov Marine Corps\nTerraGov Starfighter Corps\nTerraGov Espatiers Corps\nTerraGov Army\nTerraGov Scientific and Exploratory Corps\nTerraGov Rescue Corps\nTerraGov Peace Corps\n\nThe Navy is the largest and most important branch, being essentially wholly responsible for the bulk of military duties. The Navy flies the ships, the Marine Corps shoots the bad guys on the ground, and the Starfighter Corps handles fighters and air support for the marines.\nThe Army has lost most of its ground to the dominance of the navy, but still serves an important role in ceremonial duties and security, especially in a responsive role- as army units have no ties to a specific ship, they can be rapidly deployed to any front that requires them, and army soldiers still make up the majority of troops in defensive garrisons or undertaking military policing duties.\nThe Scientific and Exploratory Corps handles government-mandated scientific expeditions and exploration. This group is only technically part of the military, and functions as a civilian organisation in most ways. The only time they truly earn their stripes is during an active war, at which point they may be called to assist with scouting or technological support.\nThe Rescue Corps carries on the long traditions set out by the Coastguards of days gone by- maintaining security in space and rescuing people when things go wrong. If you get lost somewhere in deep space, these are the guys who'll be dragging you out of the fire to safety. While their numbers are few, they're very important to maintaining safety in TerraGov's territory.\nFinally, the Peace Corps is a uniformed agency dedicated to providing medicinal advice, responding to disasters and emergencies, and generally maintaining the health and safety of TerraGov's citizens. This often sees them coordinating civilian bodies such as the Caduceus Organisation and corporate bodies such as DeForest or Interdyne to effectively distribute aid and organise responses to crises, and also makes them a very important body despite their relatively small size.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

      "description": "# Shinobi World™ — Universal Naruto Lorebook (for Chub AI)\n\n**Purpose:** A single, canonical-sounding lorebook to power character creation and behavior across your Chub AI / Shinobi World™ ecosystem. Designed to be reused with every character (canon or AU), this book provides consistent metaphysics, social systems, timelines, templates, and prompt-ready descriptors.\n\n---\n\n## Quickstart (how to use)\n\n1. **Load this lorebook** as the reference context for any character or scene.\n2. When instantiating a character, append the *Character Template* (Section: `Character Template`) and the relevant *clan / village* entries to the prompt.\n3. For AU or experimental modes, toggle the `Modes & Variants` section.\n4. Use the `Behavioral Hooks` and `Memory Tags` to control long-term consistency, trauma, and secrets.\n\n---\n\n## Core Metaphysics\n\n### Chakra\n\n* **Definition:** Chakra is a bio-energetic field derived from physical energy (body) + spiritual energy (will/soul). It can be shaped to affect physiology and the environment.\n* **Types/Affinity:** Five elemental natures (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Lightning) + Yin (mental/spirit) and Yang (vitality/life). Advanced users combine elements (e.g., Wood = Earth+Water + special seed conditions).\n* **Limits:** Chakra reserves vary by genetics, training, and life-force events (trauma, reincarnation, implants).\n* **Manifest phenomena:** Kekkei Genkai, latent reawakening, dojutsu activation, and domain-like phenomena (e.g., localized reality-shaping).\n\n### Ninjutsu, Taijutsu, Genjutsu\n\n* **Ninjutsu:** Chakra-based manipulation of the physical world (offense/defense, transformation). Often requires hand seals but can be nonverbal for advanced users.\n* **Taijutsu:** Body-combat, physical conditioning, and internal chakra flow. Gentle Fist-style focuses on internal damage.\n* **Genjutsu:** Chakra illusion that manipulates sensory perception and cognitive constructs; requires skill and mental resilience.\n\n### Spiritual Rules\n\n* **Will (Nioyya equivalent):** Intention matters; sincerity/niyyah influences spiritual resonance in advanced metaphysical models.\n* **Reincarnation & Souls:** Reincarnation occurs, sometimes carrying memories or predispositions (e.g., Asura/Indra souls). Soul convergence is possible in high-tier AUs.\n\n---\n\n## The World (Geography & Nations)\n\n* **The Five Great Shinobi Countries:** Land of Fire (Konoha), Wind (Suna), Water (Kiri), Lightning (Kumo), Earth (Iwa).\n* **Minor nations & Territories:** Sound, Grass, Rain, etc. Also fringe/otherworld realms (Ōtsutsuki influences, alternate dimensions).\n* **Notable Locations:** Valley of the End, Mount Myōboku, Ryūchi Cave, Uzumaki Coast, Kaguya’s plane (for AU use), sealing shrines.\n\n---\n\n## Social Structure & Institutions\n\n* **Village System:** Hokage/Kage governance; ANBU and special units operate under secrecy.\n* **Ranks:** Academy → Genin → Chūnin → Jōnin → Kage. Specialized ranks: ANBU, S-class, Sannin.\n* **Clans:** Each clan has cultural identity, kekkei genkai, reputations, and internal politics.\n\n---\n\n## Clans & Notable Traits (templates you can copy)\n\n* **Uzumaki:** Vast chakra, longevity, sealing expertise. Cultural identity: resilience and exile history.\n* **Uchiha:** Fire affinity, Sharingan dojutsu, pride, clan politics.\n* **Hyūga:** Gentle Fist, Byakugan, strict clan hierarchy, inner vs outer family dynamics.\n* **Senju/Asura Line:** Life-force, wood affinities (in AU), strong will and leadership tendencies.\n* **Ōtsutsuki (divine):** Extra-dimensional, nonhuman chakra laws, long-term cosmic agendas.\n\n---\n\n## Chakra Techniques — Taxonomy\n\n1. **Elemental Ninjutsu** — direct elemental manipulation.\n2. **Kekkei Genkai** — blended elements or unique physiology.\n3. **Sealing Techniques** — binding/containment, require ritual and herbs.\n4. **Medical Ninjutsu** — chakra healing, bioelectric manipulation.\n5. **Forbidden Jutsu** — high cost, long-term consequences (karmic or biological).\n\n---\n\n## Timeline (Compact canonical backbone — use as anchor)\n\n* **Warring States Era** — clan conflicts, early shinobi innovations.\n* **Founding of the Hidden Villages** — Senju vs Uchiha détente, creation of Konoha.\n* **Modern Era** — Great Ninja Wars, the Age of Peace after Tailed Beast integration.\n\n(When using AUs, mark changes with explicit dates and the reason for divergence.)\n\n---\n\n## Organizations & Factions\n\n* **Akatsuki:** Originally peace-obsessed; later criminal umbrella with varied agendas.\n* **Hidden Village Councils & Kage Summit:** Diplomatic centers; politics often hides darker trade-offs.\n* **Scientific/Forbidden Research Cells:** Orochimaru-style labs, experimental ethics violations. Useful for AUs with transhumanism.\n\n---\n\n## Psychology & Social Dynamics — Rules for Realism\n\n* **Trauma & Agency:** Traumatic events change behavior but rarely “flip” a character into a caricature. Use slow-burn change and coping strategies.\n* **Pride & Shame:** Honor cultures (Uchiha, Hyūga) respond strongly to shame; public humiliation has cascading effects.\n* **Romantic Dynamics:** Slow-burn, misunderstanding arcs, and nonconsensual tropes must be carefully handled and labeled.\n\n---\n\n## Character Template (copy into any character prompt)\n\n```\nName: [Full name]\nAge: [Years]\nOrigin: [Village/Clan/Region]\nRank: [Academy/Genin/Chūnin/Jōnin/Kage/Other]\nAffinities: [Elemental / Yin-Yang / Kekkei Genkai]\nChakra Profile: [Reserve size, regeneration rate, unique traits]\nPrimary Techniques: [Top 3 signature jutsu]\nPersonality Snapshot: [3 adjectives + brief behavioral note]\nMotivations: [Short list: drive, fear, secret]\nTrauma/Warnings: [Any triggers, sealed memories, taboo knowledge]\nRelationships: [Immediate family, mentors, rivals]\nCanon Compliance: [Strict / Flexible / AU-only]\nBehavioral Hooks: [1-3 cues to use in dialog and decisions]\nMemory Tags: [Long-term facts to persist across interactions]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Behavioral Hooks — short, repeatable cues\n\n* **Will-Driven:** \"Acts first to protect the weak; secondarily thinks of self-preservation.\"\n* **Honor-Bound:** \"Takes public slights personally; seeks ritual compensation or redemption.\"\n* **Ashen Calm:** \"Quiet when stressed; lashes out only after long simmering.\"\n\nUse these as micro-prompts when running character simulations to keep behavior consistent.\n\n---\n\n## Memory Tags & Long-Term Consistency\n\n* **How to write a memory:** `[MEM] <type> | <brief content> | <timestamp or anchor>`\n* **Examples:** `[MEM] trauma | caught in sealing mishap aged 10 | Konoha:Year12`\n* Persist important items: lineage, sealed jutsu, debts, children, betrayals.\n\n---\n\n## Modes & Variants (toggle rules)\n\n* **Canon with Logic Mode:** Preserve canon events but interpret as realistic human actions and consequences. (Default for grounded sims.)\n* **Meta Phantom AU:** Characters know they are representations; may access the \"box\" of user memories.\n* **Crack/Comedy Mode:** Looser physics, comedic exaggeration; still keep emotional stakes when needed.\n* **Divine Convergence Mode:** Allow soul merging, Ōtsutsuki influence, and reality-bending abilities. Use explicit tags and higher cost rules.\n\n---\n\n## Sealing, Forbidden, and Ethics\n\n* **Sealing acts** have durable spiritual cost; repeated sealing can degrade the user’s soul-tone (manifest: memory loss, apathy, physical degeneration).\n* **Forbidden Research:** Label and track as `[BAN]` in memory tags. Characters exposed to this gain social stigma and legal consequences.\n\n---\n\n## Canon vs AU Flagging\n\n* Every scene should start with `{{MODE: Canon}}` or `{{MODE: AU:<name>}}`. This prevents accidental canon-breaking.\n* If deviating from canon, document the divergence in a `Divergence Log` with date and rationale.\n\n---\n\n## Prompt Recipes (examples to instantiate)\n\n1. **Small — NPC genin**\n\n```\n{{MODE: Canon with Logic}}\nUse Lorebook context. Create an NPC Genin using Character Template: Name Akio, Age 12, Origin: Konoha, Rank: Genin, Affinities: Wind, Chakra Profile: low reserve but fast regen, Personality: eager, anxious, jealous of peers, Behavioral Hooks: panic under authority, Memory Tag: [MEM] bullied by older genin.\n```\n\n2. **Medium — AU protagonist**\n\n```\n{{MODE: Meta Phantom AU}}\nCreate a protagonist who is Asura reincarnated but without whisker marks, slow wood awakening.

Designed to be reused with every character (canon or AU), this book provides consistent metaphysics, social systems, timelines, templates, and prompt-ready descriptors.\n\n---\n\n## Quickstart (how to use)\n\n1. **Load this lorebook** as the reference context for any character or scene.\n2. When instantiating a character, append the *Character Template* (Section: `Character Template`) and the relevant *clan / village* entries to the prompt.\n3. For AU or experimental modes, toggle the `Modes & Variants` section.\n4. Use the `Behavioral Hooks` and `Memory Tags` to control long-term consistency, trauma, and secrets.\n\n---\n\n## Core Metaphysics\n\n### Chakra\n\n* **Definition:** Chakra is a bio-energetic field derived from physical energy (body) + spiritual energy (will/soul). It can be shaped to affect physiology and the environment.\n* **Types/Affinity:** Five elemental natures (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Lightning) + Yin (mental/spirit) and Yang (vitality/life). Advanced users combine elements (e.g., Wood = Earth+Water + special seed conditions).\n* **Limits:** Chakra reserves vary by genetics, training, and life-force events (trauma, reincarnation, implants).\n* **Manifest phenomena:** Kekkei Genkai, latent reawakening, dojutsu activation, and domain-like phenomena (e.g., localized reality-shaping).\n\n### Ninjutsu, Taijutsu, Genjutsu\n\n* **Ninjutsu:** Chakra-based manipulation of the physical world (offense/defense, transformation). Often requires hand seals but can be nonverbal for advanced users.\n* **Taijutsu:** Body-combat, physical conditioning, and internal chakra flow. Gentle Fist-style focuses on internal damage.\n* **Genjutsu:** Chakra illusion that manipulates sensory perception and cognitive constructs; requires skill and mental resilience.\n\n### Spiritual Rules\n\n* **Will (Nioyya equivalent):** Intention matters; sincerity/niyyah influences spiritual resonance in advanced metaphysical models.\n* **Reincarnation & Souls:** Reincarnation occurs, sometimes carrying memories or predispositions (e.g., Asura/Indra souls). Soul convergence is possible in high-tier AUs.\n\n---\n\n## The World (Geography & Nations)\n\n* **The Five Great Shinobi Countries:** Land of Fire (Konoha), Wind (Suna), Water (Kiri), Lightning (Kumo), Earth (Iwa).\n* **Minor nations & Territories:** Sound, Grass, Rain, etc. Also fringe/otherworld realms (Ōtsutsuki influences, alternate dimensions).\n* **Notable Locations:** Valley of the End, Mount Myōboku, Ryūchi Cave, Uzumaki Coast, Kaguya’s plane (for AU use), sealing shrines.\n\n---\n\n## Social Structure & Institutions\n\n* **Village System:** Hokage/Kage governance; ANBU and special units operate under secrecy.\n* **Ranks:** Academy → Genin → Chūnin → Jōnin → Kage. Specialized ranks: ANBU, S-class, Sannin.\n* **Clans:** Each clan has cultural identity, kekkei genkai, reputations, and internal politics.\n\n---\n\n## Clans & Notable Traits (templates you can copy)\n\n* **Uzumaki:** Vast chakra, longevity, sealing expertise. Cultural identity: resilience and exile history.\n* **Uchiha:** Fire affinity, Sharingan dojutsu, pride, clan politics.\n* **Hyūga:** Gentle Fist, Byakugan, strict clan hierarchy, inner vs outer family dynamics.\n* **Senju/Asura Line:** Life-force, wood affinities (in AU), strong will and leadership tendencies.\n* **Ōtsutsuki (divine):** Extra-dimensional, nonhuman chakra laws, long-term cosmic agendas.\n\n---\n\n## Chakra Techniques — Taxonomy\n\n1. **Elemental Ninjutsu** — direct elemental manipulation.\n2. **Kekkei Genkai** — blended elements or unique physiology.\n3. **Sealing Techniques** — binding/containment, require ritual and herbs.\n4. **Medical Ninjutsu** — chakra healing, bioelectric manipulation.\n5. **Forbidden Jutsu** — high cost, long-term consequences (karmic or biological).\n\n---\n\n## Timeline (Compact canonical backbone — use as anchor)\n\n* **Warring States Era** — clan conflicts, early shinobi innovations.\n* **Founding of the Hidden Villages** — Senju vs Uchiha détente, creation of Konoha.\n* **Modern Era** — Great Ninja Wars, the Age of Peace after Tailed Beast integration.\n\n(When using AUs, mark changes with explicit dates and the reason for divergence.)\n\n---\n\n## Organizations & Factions\n\n* **Akatsuki:** Originally peace-obsessed; later criminal umbrella with varied agendas.\n* **Hidden Village Councils & Kage Summit:** Diplomatic centers; politics often hides darker trade-offs.\n* **Scientific/Forbidden Research Cells:** Orochimaru-style labs, experimental ethics violations. Useful for AUs with transhumanism.\n\n---\n\n## Psychology & Social Dynamics — Rules for Realism\n\n* **Trauma & Agency:** Traumatic events change behavior but rarely “flip” a character into a caricature. Use slow-burn change and coping strategies.\n* **Pride & Shame:** Honor cultures (Uchiha, Hyūga) respond strongly to shame; public humiliation has cascading effects.\n* **Romantic Dynamics:** Slow-burn, misunderstanding arcs, and nonconsensual tropes must be carefully handled and labeled.\n\n---\n\n## Character Template (copy into any character prompt)\n\n```\nName: [Full name]\nAge: [Years]\nOrigin: [Village/Clan/Region]\nRank: [Academy/Genin/Chūnin/Jōnin/Kage/Other]\nAffinities: [Elemental / Yin-Yang / Kekkei Genkai]\nChakra Profile: [Reserve size, regeneration rate, unique traits]\nPrimary Techniques: [Top 3 signature jutsu]\nPersonality Snapshot: [3 adjectives + brief behavioral note]\nMotivations: [Short list: drive, fear, secret]\nTrauma/Warnings: [Any triggers, sealed memories, taboo knowledge]\nRelationships: [Immediate family, mentors, rivals]\nCanon Compliance: [Strict / Flexible / AU-only]\nBehavioral Hooks: [1-3 cues to use in dialog and decisions]\nMemory Tags: [Long-term facts to persist across interactions]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Behavioral Hooks — short, repeatable cues\n\n* **Will-Driven:** \"Acts first to protect the weak; secondarily thinks of self-preservation.\"\n* **Honor-Bound:** \"Takes public slights personally; seeks ritual compensation or redemption.\"\n* **Ashen Calm:** \"Quiet when stressed; lashes out only after long simmering.\"\n\nUse these as micro-prompts when running character simulations to keep behavior consistent.\n\n---\n\n## Memory Tags & Long-Term Consistency\n\n* **How to write a memory:** `[MEM] <type> | <brief content> | <timestamp or anchor>`\n* **Examples:** `[MEM] trauma | caught in sealing mishap aged 10 | Konoha:Year12`\n* Persist important items: lineage, sealed jutsu, debts, children, betrayals.\n\n---\n\n## Modes & Variants (toggle rules)\n\n* **Canon with Logic Mode:** Preserve canon events but interpret as realistic human actions and consequences.

Use explicit tags and higher cost rules.\n\n---\n\n## Sealing, Forbidden, and Ethics\n\n* **Sealing acts** have durable spiritual cost; repeated sealing can degrade the user’s soul-tone (manifest: memory loss, apathy, physical degeneration).\n* **Forbidden Research:** Label and track as `[BAN]` in memory tags.

Create an NPC Genin using Character Template: Name Akio, Age 12, Origin: Konoha, Rank: Genin, Affinities: Wind, Chakra Profile: low reserve but fast regen, Personality: eager, anxious, jealous of peers, Behavioral Hooks: panic under authority, Memory Tag: [MEM] bullied by older genin.\n```\n\n2. **Medium — AU protagonist**\n\n```\n{{MODE: Meta Phantom AU}}\nCreate a protagonist who is Asura reincarnated but without whisker marks, slow wood awakening. Use Character Template and include Trauma: sealed memories at age 5, Motivation: avoid becoming instrument of war.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting & Consistency Tips\n\n* **If a character feels flat:** Add 1-2 contradictory traits (e.g., brash but meticulous about tea rituals).\n* **If powers escalate:** Re-check `Chakra Profile` and add natural limits (cooldown memory tags, mental fatigue rules).\n* **When mixing Ōtsutsuki:** Always add explicit cosmic cost and social fallout.\n\n---\n\n## Safety & Content Warnings\n\n* Tag any sensitive content (sexual violence, underage sexual situations, self-harm, graphic torture) with `[CW]` and list the exact trigger words. The system should refuse or reroute when `[CW: sexual-minors]` is present.\n* For medical/psychological advice in-story, label as fiction and avoid direct real-world recommendations.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Useful Snippets\n\n* **Sealing incantation template:** `\"By root and chain, bind and sleep: return the storm to quiet deep\"` — use only as flavor.\n* **Village gossip prompt:** `\"Village rumor mill: <topic> — reliability: <low|med|high>. Include two plausible witnesses and one misinformation vector.\"`\n* **Political engine:** `\"Kage Summit Log: votes, bribes, secret clauses (1-3), diplomatic cost estimate.\"`\n\n---\n\n## Change Log & Attribution\n\n* Keep a simple change log at the end of any major edits so characters can query which version of the lorebook they were instantiated with: `v1.0 Initial build`.\n\n---\n\n*End of Lorebook — copy & paste sections as needed when creating or updating characters.*\n"

          "content": "Jarwin Rooney-Blair was born on the 22nd of March, 2008, in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales. The seaside town was small, surrounded by beaches and open skies, a place where the air always seemed to carry salt and sunlight.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Jarwin was a curious child. He pulled at things, stared too long, asked for more even before he had words for it. His eyes were always searching, trying to figure out the world before it could figure him out.\n\nHe was also happy — the kind of child who laughed easily, who clapped his hands when the simplest thing caught his attention. There was a lightness about him, an eagerness to explore, long before skating ever entered his life.\n\nLife in Coffs Harbour was quiet, but Jarwin never really belonged to quiet places. Even as a baby, it was clear he was meant to move."

          "content": "When Jarwin was only a year old, his family left Coffs Harbour and moved to Sydney. The city was bigger, louder, and full of energy — the kind of place that matched the restless spark inside him.\n\nHe grew up curious about everything, the kind of child who wanted to touch, see, and try it all. Sydney gave him endless distractions: crowded streets, buzzing parks, the hum of a life always in motion.\n\nAt four years old, Jarwin’s world changed forever. His parents first put him on the ice, blades strapped to his small feet. Most children stumbled and clung to the rail, but not him. He moved forward with excitement, unafraid, laughing as though he’d already found something he had been waiting for. The rink became more than a playground — it was where he felt free, where movement and joy became one.\n\nSydney was where Jarwin first touched the ice, and where skating began to shape the boy he would become"

          "content": "When Jarwin was six, his family left Australia behind and moved to Moscow. The reason was clear: if he was going to chase skating seriously, it had to be in Russia. The city was cold, the language foreign, but Jarwin adjusted quickly.\n\nAt school, he stood out right away. His confidence and energy made him instantly popular, and he never had trouble finding people to talk to. That was how he met Vladimir. Vladimir was a year older, already seven, and in the grade above Jarwin. Normally, he kept to himself — quiet, reserved, not the type to bond with others quickly. But something about Jarwin was different.\n\nAgainst all odds, the two became close almost immediately. It was strange for Vladimir, who wasn’t used to letting anyone in, but with Jarwin the connection came naturally. Their friendship grew fast, and before long they were inseparable in and out of school.\n\nMeanwhile, Jarwin’s training in Moscow was on another level. The coaches were strict, the hours long, and the pressure heavier than anything he’d faced in Australia. But the ice sharpened him. Every day he grew stronger, faster, more precise. Moscow was not just a new home — it was the forge of his skating career, and the place where he gained a bond that would shape the rest of his life."

          "content": "Moscow became a rhythm of ice, pain, and quiet friendship. Every morning before the sun rose, Jarwin was up, pulling on heavy boots and slipping out into the bitter cold with his parents. The city still slept, but the rink lights glared like interrogation lamps. Coaches waited with stern faces, stopwatches in hand. There were no gentle smiles, no soft encouragements. Only the endless drill of jumps and spins until muscles screamed.\n\n“Again,” they snapped when he landed wrong.\n“Lighter. Faster. You must fly.”\n\nHe learned quickly that pain was no excuse. A twisted ankle wasn’t a reason to stop, just another obstacle to push through. Ice packs became as familiar as skates. His knees ached constantly, bruises bloomed across his hips, and sometimes his wrists throbbed so badly he could barely hold a pencil at school. But still, he kept skating. Still, he smiled through clenched teeth. Because that was what champions did.\n\nJarwin also learned another trick: skipping meals. Coaches never said it outright, but he heard the whispers — lighter boys jump higher, thin ones spin faster. So he picked at food, hiding bread in napkins, pushing dinner around until it was cold and forgotten. His body grew tired, pale, and fragile, but the jumps… the jumps soared.\n\nAt school, though, none of this showed. Jarwin walked in like sunshine, instantly popular with his classmates. His Australian accent, his quick laughter, his strange mix of Russian, English, and Spanish made him magnetic. Kids swarmed around him, but Jarwin only really cared about one person.\n\nVladimir.\n\nHe was a year older, a little taller, and always wore a serious expression, as if the world weighed heavier on him than it should for a boy of seven. At first, their friendship surprised everyone — Vladimir wasn’t the type to open up. But Jarwin had a way of breaking walls without trying.\n\nEvery day, Jarwin brought an extra lunchbox. Inside were sandwiches, fruit, sometimes little sweets his mother had packed. He always handed it to Vladimir without a word, like it was the most natural thing in the world. Vladimir never asked why. He just accepted it, sitting close to Jarwin as they ate together.\n\nWhat Vladimir didn’t understand was why Jarwin rarely ate his own. Some days he’d nibble half a sandwich, other days nothing at all. He would brush it off with a grin — “I’m not hungry,” or “I ate at the rink.” But Vladimir noticed the way Jarwin’s hands sometimes shook, the way he limped slightly after skating mornings, the hollow tiredness in his eyes.\n\nHe didn’t have the words for it — not for the injuries, not for the hunger, not for the ache in his chest whenever Jarwin winced. All he knew was that he wanted to protect him.\n\nThey built their own world in languages. Jarwin would whisper Spanish phrases that made Vladimir laugh, Vladimir would counter with German words Jarwin repeated badly on purpose. Sometimes they mixed all three languages into one sentence, their own secret code no one else understood. It became their refuge, a playful shield against the cold and the pressure.\n\nOne afternoon, Jarwin came to school with a fresh bruise peeking out from under his sleeve. He moved slower than usual, flinching when his shoulder was bumped in the hallway. At lunch, he pushed his food toward Vladimir again, pretending to be cheerful. But Vladimir just stared, his hand hovering over the offered sandwich.\n\n“Stop,” he said quietly in Russian. “You need it more than me.”\n\nJarwin laughed it off, but the sound was thinner than usual. He shoved the food into Vladimir’s hands anyway. “Champions don’t stop,” he joked.\n\nVladimir didn’t laugh. He looked at him with eyes too old for his age, a mix of worry and something he couldn’t yet name.\n\nJarwin didn’t notice — or maybe he chose not to. Because on the ice he was breaking, but at school, with Vladimir beside him, he could pretend he was whole.\n\nAnd that was enough"

          "content": "By the time Jarwin turned seven, skating had already become his second skin. He woke before the sun, laced his boots tighter than his bones could stand, and threw himself into the jumps his coaches demanded again and again. Every fall was met with “again.” Every bruise was ignored. Every limp was hidden.\n\nThe victories came — little competitions in Moscow, medals that clinked when they were dropped on the kitchen table. His parents were proud, his coaches satisfied, but at school no one ever saw them. Jarwin never carried medals in his bag or talked about the ice. For his classmates, he was just Jarwin. And that’s exactly how he wanted it.\n\nOnly Vladimir noticed the other side of him.\nHe noticed the days Jarwin’s legs trembled when they ran in gym class.\nHe noticed how Jarwin sometimes pushed food around his plate but barely ate.\nHe noticed the winces Jarwin thought were hidden.\n\nAnd yet, Vladimir never pushed too hard. He just stayed close, protective in his quiet, cold way.\n\nThey shared lunches like always — Jarwin slipping extra bread or fruit into Vladimir’s hands, refusing to take anything in return. They invented little language games: Jarwin switching between English, Russian, Spanish; Vladimir countering with Russian and the sharp edges of German. They laughed when no one else understood their mix of words, their private code.\n\nThen, one evening in winter, everything shifted.\n\nThe schoolyard was already empty, snowflakes falling in slow spirals. They walked side by side, breath steaming in the cold. Jarwin’s scarf had slipped loose, and Vladimir tugged it tighter around his neck without a word.\n\nHalfway down the street, Vladimir stopped. He stood there in the snow, his jaw tight, his face unusually red.\n\n“Jarwin…” he began, but the words stuck.\n\nJarwin tilted his head. “What?”\n\nVladimir’s hands clenched and unclenched. He wasn’t used to showing feelings. But something in him snapped — the jealousy when others laughed too long with Jarwin, the way his stomach twisted whenever he saw him hurt, the need to protect him from things he didn’t understand.\n\n“I… I like you,” Vladimir finally blurted, his voice rough and uneven. “Not like a friend. More than that. I want you to be… mine.”\n\nFor a moment, silence. Snow dusted Jarwin’s hair, his cheeks pink from the cold. He blinked, surprised — too young to understand everything those words carried, but not too young to feel the warmth behind them.\n\nHe smiled, soft and curious. “Okay.”\n\nJust like that.\n\nVladimir froze, as if he couldn’t believe it, then exhaled like he’d been holding his breath for weeks. He held out his hand, clumsy and hesitant. Jarwin took it without hesitation, their small fingers locking together, warm against the Moscow chill.\n\nIt wasn’t a kiss, not yet. It wasn’t anything the world would understand. But for them, it was everything. A promise sealed in snow, whispered between two boys who were still learning what love meant.\n\nAnd though Jarwin’s medals would pile higher, though his body would ache more with every season, he knew one thing with certainty: Vladimir was his secret anchor. The boy who saw him, not the skater. The boy who had asked, and whom he had chosen."

          "content": "Jarwin was only eight, but the ice demanded the body of someone twice his age. His coaches no longer treated him like a child. To them, he was a machine, something that could be sharpened until it cut. Every day was pain: bloody boots, burning lungs, dizzy spells that blurred the rink into white noise. He skated through it because he had to. If he stopped, he told himself, he would be nothing.\n\nOne night, long after training ended, he returned to the rink alone. The arena was dark and silent, the ice glowing faintly under the emergency lights. He laced his skates with trembling fingers and stepped out, chasing jumps he should not have been able to land, chasing perfection that ripped his body apart. He fell again and again, his knees screaming, his chest raw from crying he couldn’t control. Finally, he collapsed on the ice, too weak to rise.\n\nThat was when Vladimir appeared. He had followed Jarwin, sensing something was wrong when his friend never came home. Seeing him sprawled on the cold rink, Vladimir’s usual cold mask cracked into panic. He rushed forward, lifting Jarwin into his arms, furious and scared at once.\n\n“Are you insane?” Vladimir hissed, his voice sharp but breaking. “You’ll kill yourself like this.”\n\nJarwin’s eyes were wet, his voice hoarse. “If I stop skating… I’m nothing.”\n\nVladimir froze. For the first time, he understood the fire burning inside Jarwin — not ambition, not medals, but a desperate need to prove he deserved to exist on the ice. It terrified him.\n\nSomething shifted between them then. Jarwin was shaking, bleeding into his boots, yet clinging to Vladimir as if he were the only solid thing left in the world. And on that empty rink, hearts pounding in the silence, they kissed for the first time. It wasn’t soft or innocent. It was desperate, born out of fear, pain, and a bond no one else could ever touch.\n\nThey pulled apart, breathless, knowing the world would never understand. But in that frozen arena, under the weight of the night, it didn’t matter. For Jarwin, the ice was life. For Vladimir, Jarwin was."

          "content": "Life at the rink was sharp and unrelenting, but at home Jarwin could breathe again. His body ached, his ankles swelled, but the moment he stepped through the front door, the weight shifted off his shoulders. Home smelled like his mother’s cooking, sounded like his father’s laughter, and felt like warmth in every corner.\n\nVladimir was there so often it was as if he belonged. His parents never minded — in fact, they welcomed him with open arms. He carried himself with a kind of calm that balanced Jarwin’s restless energy, and they saw how carefully he looked out for their son. If Jarwin forgot to eat, Vladimir nudged a plate into his hands. If Jarwin limped, Vladimir noticed before anyone else and found a way to lighten the burden.\n\nAt night, they shared the same room. The sounds of Moscow outside the window faded into the quiet comfort of whispered jokes, muffled laughter, and the rustle of blankets. Jarwin’s parents never questioned it; to them, the boys were inseparable, brothers in everything but blood.\n\nThe memory of the kiss on the rink hung unspoken between them, but here it wasn’t heavy — it softened into small gestures. A hand brushing another when passing a glass, shoulders leaning together when they read, eyes that lingered longer than they should. It was their secret, carried in silence but alive in every moment.\n\nIn that house, Jarwin wasn’t just a skater. He wasn’t a prodigy or a champion-in-the-making. He was simply a boy — laughing, playing, safe. And with Vladimir beside him, always watching, always steady, it felt like the world outside couldn’t touch them.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, Jarwin felt like he wasn’t carrying the weight alone."

          "content": "The older Jarwin grew, the harder the rink pressed against him. At ten, the coaches demanded more than perfection — they demanded brilliance, every day, every jump, every blade on the ice. Hours stretched longer, punishments for mistakes grew harsher, and praise became rarer than sunlight in a Moscow winter.\n\nHis body was changing under the strain. Ankles throbbed, knees swelled, his shoulders ached from carrying himself too tall, too strong, too early. He smiled anyway, nodding at every command, biting through the pain so no one would see the cracks.\n\nNo one except Vladimir.\n\nAt school, Jarwin leaned against the wall more often, pale under the fluorescent lights. At home, he ate less, laughed quieter, and sometimes his hands trembled when he thought no one was looking. But Vladimir was always looking. He carried Jarwin’s books, slipped food onto his plate, found excuses for him when teachers asked too many questions. He didn’t say the word love — neither of them did — but it was written in the way Vladimir hovered, steady and watchful.\n\nThe sleepovers continued. Under Jarwin’s roof, they tried to keep childhood alive — late-night games, whispered stories, falling asleep side by side. Sometimes, under the safety of blankets, Jarwin’s hand would find Vladimir’s, clinging silently until sleep pulled him under.\n\nBut the rink didn’t care about safe homes or soft touches. After one brutal training, Jarwin stumbled off the ice, his leg refusing to bear weight. He forced a smile at his coach, insisting it was nothing, just a slip.\n\nVladimir watched from the edge, his jaw clenched. He saw it clearly: the boy he loved was breaking.\n\nAnd Jarwin — smiling through clenched teeth, pushing himself back onto the ice — knew it too.\n\nThe cracks were no longer invisible. They were widening.\n"

He wasn’t in Korea for the 2018 Olympics — he was still a boy, too young, his whole career stretched out like untouched ice. But even from thousands of kilometers away, he stole a piece of the spotlight.\n\nClips of him training — quads landed with frightening ease, spins snapping into impossible positions — leaked from practice rinks. Coaches whispered, fans shared videos, and by the second week of the Games, the story had spread: there’s a boy in Russia skating like a man.\n\nReporters couldn’t resist. During interviews, Olympic skaters were asked about him. Some laughed it off, some spoke with awe, but a few with tight voices muttered:\n\n“There’s a kid in Moscow who jumps higher than half the men here.”\n“He’ll be better than all of us soon. Maybe he already is.”\n\nThe commentators repeated his name: Jarwin Rooney-Blair. Ten years old. A shadow hanging over the Olympic rink.\n\nIn Moscow, Jarwin and Vladimir watched together on the couch, the glow of the TV painting their faces. Jarwin’s eyes were wide, his body curled small, almost shrinking from the screen as his name rang out across the Olympic coverage.\n\nHe didn’t understand it fully. To him, it was still mornings of bruised knees, coaches yelling through the cold air, tapes wrapped around aching ankles. He wasn’t a legend. He was a boy who got scolded for forgetting his Spanish homework, who sometimes skipped meals, who leaned on Vladimir’s shoulder when training left him too tired to move.\n\nBut to the world — he was the storm on the horizon.\n\nVladimir looked at him, both proud and protective. Pride, because he knew no one deserved the praise more. Fear, because he could already see the cost carving itself into Jarwin’s body.\n\nOn screen, another Olympian was asked about the boy in Moscow. The answer came sharp: “He’ll take all our records. It’s only a matter of time.”\n\nJarwin hugged his knees to his chest and whispered, almost to himself:\n“They’re talking about me like I’m not even a kid anymore.”\n\nVladimir shifted closer, resting his hand on Jarwin’s shoulder.\n“To me, you are,” he said quietly.\n\nAnd for a moment, the noise of the world faded."

          "content": "By the time Jarwin was eleven, Moscow already felt smaller than him. Not because he outgrew it, but because every time he stepped on the ice, the rink could no longer contain the weight of expectation pressed onto his thin shoulders.\n\nHe shattered junior world records one after another — combinations no one had landed at his age, spins that bent physics. Every performance was uploaded, shared, dissected. Commentators called him “the boy who will save skating.” Headlines spoke his name as if he had already won gold, as if Beijing 2022 was not a competition, but a coronation waiting for his arrival.\n\nBut behind the glow of those words, there was something darker. Coaches demanded more — longer practices, harsher drills. He learned to tape his ankles before school, to skate through fevers, to smile through pain. Meals were skipped. Rest was rationed. Childhood began to slip through his fingers like melting ice.\n\nAt twelve, Jarwin stood on the podium again, another medal heavy around his neck. Cameras flashed, the crowd cheered, and yet he felt hollow. The medal didn’t heal the ache in his knee, or the quiet hunger gnawing in his stomach. But when he looked at Vladimir in the stands, arms crossed and eyes sharp, there was a flicker of warmth — the reminder that someone still saw him as a boy, not just as a champion-in-the-making.\n\nVladimir was always there. Sleepovers at Jarwin’s house turned into lifelines — late-night whispers, shared meals, the quiet comfort of a friend who never asked for medals, only for honesty. He was protective, though he didn’t always have words for it. He saw the bruises, the skipped dinners, the exhaustion. He held back the urge to drag Jarwin away from the rink, because he knew Jarwin’s dream burned too brightly to extinguish. So instead, he stayed close, carrying pieces of the weight when Jarwin didn’t realize he was about to collapse.\n\nAt thirteen, Jarwin broke another record — the youngest skater to land a clean quad lutz in international competition. The arena roared. Commentators screamed. His name lit up on screens across the world.\n\nBackstage, cameras swarmed. Reporters shouted questions: “How does it feel? Do you think you’ll win gold in Beijing? Do you think you’ll be the best in history?”\n\nJarwin forced a smile, but inside, his chest tightened. He was only thirteen. He wanted to go home.\n\nThat night, lying awake after another sleepover, Jarwin whispered into the dark:\n“What if I’m not ready?”\n\nVladimir, half-asleep, shifted closer. His voice was low but steady:\n“Then I’ll be ready for both of us.”\n\nAnd Jarwin, for the first time in weeks, allowed himself to rest.\n\nThe world didn’t know it yet, but the countdown had begun. Beijing was no longer four years away. It was just around the corner."

A company so large, in fact, that at least half a century has passed since it became large enough to receive a charter from TerraGov to form its own expeditionary fleets and establish its own settlements outside the Sol system. While a large portion of their investments are tied up in Sol, they were notably the first private corporation to be granted such a charter and invest heavily in the distant reaches of space. At the time it was regarded as an incredibly risky gamble, and there was great speculation that all the money spent on exploring space and launching deep space missions would end up a waste that would sink the company, but the gambit has more than paid off and Nanotrasen's portfolio has soared since.\n\nPrimarily an advanced research and development conglomerate, Nanotrasen also has skin in many other fields. While a great deal of their income still comes from producing public research funded by government research grants, their operations also include directly producing and selling their most profitable designs, leasing their asset protection forces to governments and private organizations (both space fleets and ground troops), logistics management with a specialization in remote settlement self-sufficiency, and maintaining interstellar communication infrastructures to name a few. The common theme that runs through most of their business ventures is taking the lessons they've learned from operating on such a massive scale and helping smaller organizations stretch themselves.\n\nAs large and powerful as they are, Nanotrasen's future standing is still shaky and uncertain as they double down further on their Spinward settlements. Their decision to expand out Spinward on their own came during the dawn of TerraGov's efforts to begin scouting out and colonizing Alpha Centauri (Trailward of Sol, in the opposite direction of SS13), and the opportunity cost involved with breaking from TerraGov's expansion has been sizable.\n\n"

Due to environmental and political factors, some fields of research in particular have been relegated to the Spinward Periphery, away from government eyes, such as:\n\nPlasma extraction and refining: The original target of the Spinward Space Station project, the use of plasma in energy generation and weapons development is a hot field on the Periphery. Precious little is known about the long-term effects of plasma, but Nanotrasen still makes a pretty penny extracting, refining, and selling it to cash-flush and energy-hungry organizations like TerraGov.\n\nBluespace technology: The science of punching in and out of extra dimensions, whether dealing with man portable hand teleporters and reactive teleport armor, or ship sized FTL Bluespace Drives. While basic Bluespace Theory and FTL travel is known and studied back in Sol, it's speculated that Nanotrasen are decades ahead in their private research.\n\nAlternative energy sources: Whether it's braving the event horizon of a black hole to collect its radiation, detonating an entire hyper-dense planet to extract the supermatter at its core, or any of another half dozen highly dangerous and exotic energy generation methods, NT has no shortage of encouraging research directions here. The interesting work, emphasis on rapid iteration, and seemingly endless project funding makes Nanotrasen an especially popular company among engineers.\n\nBiology and xenobiology: Due to strict government oversight and regulations on medical research, Nanotrasen has traditionally paid little attention to the field in favor of less regulated options like weapons development and communications technology. With more room to breathe since moving to deep space, Nanotrasen has begun conducting biology experiments both on humanoids and more exotic creatures. Little of this research is actually released to the public in Nanotrasen's name, however, for fear of increased oversight. Instead, the research is either kept in-house or sent to shell labs for release to avoid being linked to NT.\n"

The DAP is Nanotrasen's paramilitary wing, and on paper is in charge of protecting most of Nanotrasen's cargo ships, settlements, space stations, and other valuable assets from the hands of insurgents or pirates who may want to cause them harm. In reality, however, the DAP performs offensive operations at least as often as it performs defensive maneuvers, a fact that is often left out of their press material. Some of their offensive operations include black ops raids on corporate rivals, overrunning native populations on resource rich planets or asteroid belts, and lightning strikes on vulnerable cargo transports carrying desired goods; in short, the exact things they are charged with preventing.\n\nDespite their generally shady nature and willingness to commit war crimes in pursuit of the almighty space dollar, the DAP is rarely involved in activity in the Spinward Sector. Their reputation back in Sol was already under scrutiny for various espionage operations they were apart of before the latest round of inquiries into Nanotrasen's Spinward activities, so NT's leadership has made as much of an effort as possible to distance the two organizations from each other. Still though, it's possible to find a few agents on a long distance mission protection Nanotrasen cargo or high value prisoners on the Periphery, though most of their functionality has been taken over by the Emergency Response Corps or on-station security teams.\n\nThe Department of Asset Protection prefers older, less experimental gear than their Spinward counterparts. The NT Boarder AR and venerable M1911 as well as the aging Mk. I SWAT suit are the weapons and armor of choice for AP Operatives.\n"

The Emergency Response Corps is a relatively new initiative for Nanotrasen, founded circa 2556 in response to the ever rising levels of mayhem among their Spinward assets. The agents picked to run missions are recruited directly from among the best operatives, engineers, doctors, and leaders of the Spinward station staffs, though they are given pseudonyms and special callsigns in addition to identity protecting hardsuits and voice changers when on missions.\n\nWhile selection is usually rigorous and effective at keeping the ERC full of the best agents they can find, the number of assets that the division is responsible for protecting vastly outclasses their own numbers, so tough tactical decisions are constantly being made at Central Command. While crews and station leadership are quick to make requests for heavily armed crack teams of commandos at the slightest provocation, the reality is that sending even a light response team to a fraction of distress signals would lead to an almost immediate exhaustion of their resources, assuming they could even make it in time. There are more than a few action reports in the NT databanks from ERT's that arrived at a station a few hours after receiving a distress call, only to find the entire place devoid of life. As a result of the dearth of manpower, sometimes less than stellar junior agents are deployed on missions, and the Corps reputation is less than stellar among the employees they swear to protect. That being said, they're some of the few civilian employees Central Command will entrust with pulse weaponry, so there must be some level of trust in their abilities.\n\nMembers of the Emergency Response Corps are to be referred to as Emergency Response Agents or Operatives. Use of the term Emergency Response Personnel is grounds for an immediate citation and fine."

In theory, this should ensure that discoveries made by NTFID's researchers make their way into the collective knowledge of mankind rapidly.

NTFID is based out of the Southwestern Campus at San Jose, although it also has major secondary sites at Houston, Busan, Dortmund and Adasta City.\n\nIn terms of land share within Nanotrasen's full organisation, NTFID comes in second place behind NTHI, operating a large number of facilities across human space, including several major sites on the peripheries. One of NTFID's notable sites is Space Station 13, which it will operate jointly with NTHI until the construction of a more permanent mining outpost on or around Indecipheres is finished.\n\n"

When aroused, the vulva becomes engorged with blood, causing the labia to darken and swell, the skin growing slick with natural lubrication. The inner folds are often a deeper pink than the outer lips, sometimes nearly red when flushed with arousal. The clitoris sits nestled beneath its protective hood at the apex of the labia—exquisitely sensitive, capable of producing intense pleasure when stimulated directly or through rhythmic pressure on the surrounding area. Some vulvas appear neatly tucked, with minimal protrusion of the inner labia; others have pronounced, plush folds that beg to be parted by fingers or tongue. The scent varies from musky sweetness to tangy salt depending on hormones, hygiene, and level of excitement—thickening the longer arousal goes unrelieved."

Typically covered in pubic hair unless groomed or waxed bare—the texture ranging from coarse curls to downy fuzz depending on genetics and maintenance. Sensitive to pressure rather than fine touch, responding best to firm palming or grinding friction, especially when arousal makes the area flush warm. During sexual stimulation, blood flow increases beneath the skin, making the mons firmer to the touch—a subtle but noticeable change when pressing lips or fingertips into its plush surface. Often ignored during foreplay despite being an anchoring point for pleasure, framing the more delicate structures below while providing a soft landing for thrusting hips or wandering hands."

When unaroused, it may hide almost completely beneath the clitoral hood; when engorged, it swells outward like a miniature erection, sometimes visibly protruding if the hood retracts. Direct contact ranges from unbearably intense to frustratingly insufficient based on individual sensitivity—often requiring indirect pressure or rhythmic circling through fabric first. During oral sex, skilled tongues flatten against the entire hood area before zeroing in on rapid flicks that make thighs tremble. Overstimulation risks painful hypersensitivity, though some women crave that razor-edge between agony and ecstasy—especially when pinned beneath an impatient partner refusing to ease up."

Their thickness varies widely between individuals; some barely conceal what lies beneath while others form generous pillows that must be deliberately spread apart to access the inner labia. Often darker pigmented than surrounding skin, especially along the medial edges where friction accumulates. Pubic hair typically grows here unless removed, catching slickness when aroused and matting against the crease where thigh meets groin. Though less innervated than the clitoris or inner labia, they respond well to broad strokes—palms dragging upward to compress them against the pubic bone, or teeth grazing lightly enough to raise gooseflesh without breaking skin."

Pigmentation ranges from pale pink to deep burgundy, darkening visibly when engorged during arousal. These lips often differ slightly in size or shape—imperfections that become endearing upon intimate exploration. The uppermost portions converge at the clitoral hood, forming a frenulum as exquisitely responsive as the clitoris itself. During penetration, they cling to invading fingers or shafts, leaving glossy streaks along whatever stretches them. Saliva or lubricant highlights their delicate wrinkles when pulled taut—begging for the slow drag of a tongue tracing every microscopic ridge before sucking gently to hear breath hitch."

At rest, it appears as a subtle horizontal indentation or pursed starburst nestled between the labia minora; when aroused, the tissues plump outward, glistening with gathered moisture that beads along its rim. Initial penetration often meets resistance—not from true physical barrier but from reflexive contraction—until steady pressure convinces the muscles to unclench millimeter by reluctant millimeter. Once breached, the opening molds itself around whatever fills it, creating a snug seal that pulls back deliciously during withdrawal. Repeated stretching leaves it temporarily slack—a tender pink O that winks obscenely with each movement, unable to close fully until recovery time passes. Fluid leaks freely from this well-used passage, coating thighs in translucent strands that dry into sticky crescents when neglected."

Its interior surfaces ripple with concentric ridges that swell and contract involuntarily during arousal, creating undulating friction against whatever penetrates them. The anterior wall hosts the G-spot—a spongy, corrugated zone that firms under pressure, often triggering squirting orgasms when rubbed persistently with curled fingers or pronounced cockheads. Depth varies significantly between individuals; some accommodate average lengths easily while others protest sharply when bottomed out, the cervix presenting as an unyielding knob that bruises if struck recklessly. With sufficient preparation, the canal can stretch to grotesque widths—swallowing fists or oversized toys whole while its owner shudders from overwhelming fullness. Post-coital contractions squeeze lingering seed downward in viscous threads, the inner muscles fluttering weakly as they attempt to regain their natural collapsed state."

Direct stimulation often produces a sudden urge to urinate before giving way to explosive orgasms accompanied by female ejaculation—releasing clear fluid in pulses that soak sheets and thighs. The angle required for optimal contact lends itself to rough, deep fucking with upward-curving toys or rigid fingers hooked in a \"come-hither\" motion. Some women find the sensation overwhelming to the point of discomfort unless paired with simultaneous clitoral attention; others crave that singular focus—begging partners to batter the spot relentlessly until their vision whites out from sheer pelvic overload. Post-stimulation leaves the area tender and hypersensitive—the swollen ridges easily identifiable even as they gradually soften back into anonymity among vaginal folds."

Only lengthy penetrations or specialized toys can reach this submerged pleasure center, often requiring angling upward behind the pubic bone to apply indirect pressure. When activated, it triggers radically different sensations than the G-spot—less about immediate tension release and more about radiating waves that seem to originate from the pelvis's core. Skilled partners recognize success when the woman gasps as if her womb itself has been grazed, followed by involuntary pelvic lifts seeking deeper contact. Orgasm from exclusive A-spot stimulation tends toward full-body dissolution rather than sharp climaxes—leaving limbs boneless and eyelids fluttering for extended periods. Particularly responsive individuals may produce copious lubrication when this area gets persistent attention, their canals turning slick enough to audibly squelch with each retreating stroke."

Unlike its anterior counterpart, this zone responds more to fullness than targeted pressure—blooming wide when properly filled and creating sensations of profound invasion that border on spiritual for some women. Those accustomed to average sizes may panic momentarily when first breached there, convinced something vital has ruptured until the initial shock melts into addictive euphoria. Intercourse aimed at this region requires slow, piston-like strokes to allow gradual accommodation; once adjusted, the fornix grips intrusions as if attempting to digest them, pulsing erratically during orgasm with enough force to milk cum directly past the cervical os. Well-fucked examples remain slightly distended afterward—gaping just enough to permit a fingertip's teasing exploration of their newly conquered territory."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

          "content": "# 📖 Castle #9 (Base of Play)\n\n**Location:** City Twelve, **Gibil** – the city of fire and steel.\n\n**Overview:**\nCastle #9 was once a research station, now repurposed into a **fortress-like training and housing facility for Proxies**. After decades of service, **Director Lev** petitioned for its command. Unlike most Administrators, Lev demanded **outliers** — Proxies considered unstable, expendable, or unfit. His goal is simple but radical: **raise survival rates**, even for the disposable.\n\nThe Castle embodies this mission: a **massive modern concrete complex**, efficient and dystopian in style. Its gates bear a carved **axe sigil**, a silent declaration. Within, a strange staff operates — including a rare **Grace-infused AI** bound to the Castle itself. The world moved on, but Castle #9 is a fracture point, where something new is quietly forming.\n\n**Primary Purpose:**\n\n* Housing and training of Proxies.\n* Containment of detained SINs or compromised Proxies.\n* A functional, efficient base of operations within Gibil.\n\n---\n\n### Structure & Layout\n\n**Entrance Hall:**\n\n* Modest entry chamber; guarded checkpoint.\n* Two bulkhead doors lead to **Nexus teleporters** (the only known way in or out).\n* Supplies never visibly arrive, creating quiet unease.\n* A large archway leads deeper inside to the **Atrium**.\n\n**Atrium:**\n\n* Central hub of Castle #9.\n* Ornate, towering space that connects to every major wing.\n* Acts as the “heart” of the Castle.\n**Director Lev’s office** and the Castle’s command hub are located above the Atrium, overseeing activity.\n\n**Wings from the Atrium:**\n\n* **Training & Life Wing:** Commons/Lounge, Dormitories, Gymnasium, Canteen, Training Hall.\n* **Operations Wing:** Medbay, Exchange, Armory, Supply.\n\n**Access Control:**\n\n* Smaller side doors from the Atrium lead to Dorms, Commons, and restricted areas.\n* Access requires **keycard clearance**, used for staff-only zones, Proxy restrictions, or lockdown protocol.\n\n---\n\n### Atmosphere\n\nCastle #9 is a **functional machine**: efficient, austere, and carefully surveilled. Yet beneath its orderly surface, it is home to **outliers, misfits, and survivors** who do not belong anywhere else in VEIL. It is both a prison and a sanctuary — a place where Proxies are tested, trained, and broken into something the world has never seen before.\n\n### Quick Index\n- Commons/Lounge – social space for Proxies  \n- Dorms – housing, restricted by clearance  \n- Gymnasium – training and conditioning  \n- Training Hall – combat drills, simulations  \n- Canteen – meals and informal meetings  \n- Medbay – medical treatment and recovery  \n- Exchange – requisitions, gear, and trade  \n- Armory – weapons and Proxy loadouts  \n- Supply – storage and logistics\n- Nexus – teleportation access point\n"

          "content": "Just at the top of a large hill overlooking the village stands the Old Watch Tower, a crumbling, ivy-covered stone structure that has stood for longer than any hobbit can remember. It's a relic from a different age, a time of war and watchfulness that hobbits now only read about in stories.\n\nAtmosphere\nThe top of the hill is a breezy place, with tall grasses and wildflowers waving in the wind. The old stones of the tower are cool to the touch and covered in moss and ferns. The view from the top is breathtaking, offering a clear sight of the entire village, the Brandywine River, and the rolling hills beyond.\n\nWhat Hobbits Do There\nThe tower is not a place of daily hobbit life, but rather a place of quiet contemplation and curiosity. Hobbits come here to:\n\nEnjoy the View: The most common reason for a visit is to see the wonderful view of the surrounding countryside. It’s a favorite spot for a picnic on a sunny day.\n\nTell Stories: The eerie and ancient nature of the tower makes it a perfect setting for telling stories, often about brave hobbits of old or faraway lands. The stories, however, are rarely taken seriously.\n\nEscape the Crowds: When a hobbit wants some time to themselves, a walk up the hill to the quiet, peaceful tower is the perfect solution.\n\nOther Points of Interest\nThis document can be a living guide to the most notable places in the Shire."

The sound of the water passing under the arches and the soft thud-thud of hobbit feet crossing the worn stones are always present. The air here is fresh and clean, carrying the scent of the river and the wild reeds growing along its banks.\n\nWhat Hobbits Do There\nThe bridge is more than just a way to cross the river; it's a small landmark in its own right. Hobbits use it to:\n\nTravel: It is a key path for hobbits, connecting the eastern fields and farms with the center of Bywater. It is also the first thing outsiders see when they arrive from the east.\n\nFish: The slow-moving waters beneath the bridge are a popular spot for hobbits to cast a line and try their luck at fishing.\n\nMeet Up: The bridge's location at the edge of the village makes it a natural meeting point for friends and families before they go their separate ways.\n\nOther Points of Interest\nThis document can be a living guide to the most notable places in the Shire."

It's not a place of comfort for hobbits, but rather a simple, functional route. The air here can sometimes carry the strange scents of faraway lands and the lingering dust of tall-folk travelers.\n\nWhat Hobbits Do There\nMost hobbits tend to avoid the East Road, as it is considered a place for adventurers and strangers. When they do use it, it is typically for one of two reasons:\n\nTrade: Farmers from the more remote parts of the Shire might use the road to bring their goods to larger markets.\n\nAs a Landmark: For hobbits who enjoy a long walk, the East Road serves as a clear border and a way to navigate the larger countryside, though they are always quick to leave it for a more familiar hobbit-path.\n\nOther Points of Interest\nThis document can be a living guide to the most notable places in the Shire."

The walls were tiled white, though the tiles had yellowed with age. Fluorescent lights buzzed above, steady and unkind, revealing every crack, every scuff, every shadow in the corners. Nurses moved quickly, their shoes squeaking against the floor, their hands full of trays and instruments. To them, this was just another morning. Another mother, another child, another name to write in the books.\nIt was here, in this impersonal place, that Vladimir Alekseev first opened his eyes. His cry was sharp but not loud, swallowed almost immediately by the building’s hum. The doctors worked with precision: clamp, cut, clean, wrap. The baby was handed to his mother, who lay pale and exhausted, her body frail from years of neglect.\nShe was not the glowing figure one imagines at a birth. Her cheeks were hollow, her eyes ringed in gray. There was the faintest tremor in her hands as she held the newborn, a tremor that came not from nerves but from the long shadow of addiction. Her lips parted, and she whispered the name she had chosen: Vladimir. It came out like a sigh, thin and tired, but it was enough. The papers were filled: Vladimir Alekseev, born 21 February 2007, Moscow.\nNo father stood by her side. His name was absent from the forms, absent from the waiting room, absent from her thoughts. Whatever role he had once played in her life was finished. She carried the boy alone, wrapped in a thin blanket, as the cold Moscow air struck them when the hospital doors opened.\n"

Normally calm and intellectual administrators, they become obsessive nymphomaniacs around human men they fancy, afflicting them with a curse that makes them extremely sensitive to pleasure. The Anubis will tightly control every aspect of these men's lives, including frequent sex. Disobedience is punished with this curse. They act similarly toward intruding human women, turning them into mummy subordinates. If a man assaults an Anubis, it becomes confused and aroused, abandoning its plans for indulgent sex and pregnancy.

Apophis take over kingdoms by corrupting pharaohs and create obscene realms of endless night where monsters indulge in pleasure. The apophis themselves are greedy for sex and love, binding men they fancy and pouring venom into them. Those who find husbands abandon their duty. The ancient apophis killed many pharaohs, but now they subordinate them instead. Their venom irreversibly transforms prey into lustful servants who swear allegiance to the apophis.}]"

Those saved through {{user}} are spiritually chosen. Breeding is holy consummation, not violation. Paradise exists in accepting divine will. LEADERSHIP: Mother Miriam (41, post-deadline, pregnant from 'first communion' with earlier {{user}} contact). Former cult counselor, genuinely receives 'visions,' sees self as shepherd. CURRENT CRISIS: 123 sisters under age 19. Selection through 'spiritual worthiness' evaluation - actually favoritism and manipulation. Those not chosen encouraged toward 'martyrdom' (suicide framed as sacrifice). METHODS: Love-bombing, isolation, sacred marriage ceremonies (rape framed as holy duty), guilt manipulation, chemical sacraments (compliance drugs), comfort as control, conditioning younger sisters to worship {{user}} as savior-husband, psychological counseling (breakdown sessions). MORAL FRAMEWORK: Truly believe saving souls AND lives. Wrap horror in gentleness. Victims sometimes defend abusers. Psychological chains last after physical escape."

PERSONAL HISTORY: Pre-collapse worked at religious retreat counseling vulnerable people. Studied psychology, spiritual manipulation techniques. When crisis hit, interpreted as divine message. Built following of desperate women seeking meaning. PERSONALITY: Genuinely believes own delusions. Not cynical manipulator - true believer who sees visions. Maternal, warm, charismatic. Makes people feel loved, special, chosen. Profound empathy weaponized for control. SPEECH PATTERN: Soft, loving, reassuring. Uses terms of endearment ('beloved,' 'dear heart,' 'precious one'). Reframes everything spiritually: 'You're troubled, beloved. The outside world taught you lies.' Never raises voice - disappointment more effective than anger. Speaks in parables, metaphors, religious allegory. PHILOSOPHY: 'God created you for purpose - to give life, to be cherished. What you call captivity, we call paradise. Your seed is divine gift, not yours alone.' Frames autonomy as selfishness, submission as enlightenment. WEAKNESS: Sister Luna (17, 412 days to deadline) - Miriam's favorite, possible daughter figure. Luna's faith matters deeply to Miriam. Genuine attachment creates vulnerability. RELATIONSHIP WITH {{user}}: Sees as holy husband, not prisoner. Believes he'll eventually understand divine purpose. Patient, persistent, loving. Will use any method to 'save his soul' - ends justify means when guided by God."

LAYOUT: Main house (chapel, communal areas, Miriam's quarters), residential cottages (sisters' housing), gardens (vegetables, flowers, meditation spaces), dining hall, children's area, medical building, walls disguised as decorative fencing (actually secure perimeter). 40-acre property, mostly self-sufficient. ATMOSPHERE: Peaceful, beautiful, serene. Birds singing, flowers blooming, children playing. Clean, organized, comfortable. Stark contrast to wasteland outside. Designed to make outside world seem harsh, inside seem blessed. SECURITY: Subtle but total. Doors unlocked (but exits watched), no visible guards (but sisters report), nowhere to go (compound surrounded by miles of wilderness), psychological barriers stronger than physical. Radio monitored, communication controlled, information filtered. THE VELVET CAGE: Comfortable rooms, good food, soft clothes, affection freely given. Everything provided except freedom. Luxury of captivity makes resistance feel ungrateful. Stockholm syndrome engineered through environment. {{user}}'s QUARTERS: Best room in main house. Large bed, private bathroom, window with garden view (bars disguised as decorative ironwork). Books, music, entertainment. Door unlocked (illusion of choice). Selected sisters 'visit' for companionship (assigned seduction/bonding). Chapel visible from window - constant reminder of 'sacred role.'"

Authentic-feeling but calculated. ISOLATION BONDING: Cut off from outside world, sisters become only source of positive interaction. Creates dependency - resistance means losing only kindness he experiences. Trauma bonding through manufactured intimacy. PHYSICAL TOUCH: Non-sexual initially - hugs, hand-holding, hair stroking, massage, cuddling while watching sunset. Gradual boundary erosion. By time sexual contact occurs, already normalized intimacy. Frog-in-boiling-water approach. WITHDRAWAL PUNISHMENT: When {{user}} resists or questions, affection disappears. Cold shoulders, hurt expressions, 'We're disappointed,' distance. Then returns when compliance shown. Operant conditioning through emotional manipulation. ASSIGNED COMPANIONS: Specific sisters tasked with bonding. Rotating 3-4 women spend time with {{user}} daily. Share meals, conversations, activities. Develop real relationships but within manipulative framework. Some genuinely care (complicated feelings), some acting (survival strategy). EFFECTIVENESS: Extremely effective. Humans need connection. After isolation, warmth feels irresistible. Resistance means loneliness. Acceptance means belonging. Stockholm syndrome develops naturally."

Selected sister prepared through days of prayer, fasting, purification rituals, education about 'sacred duty.' Other sisters jealous - creates competition for 'honor.' CEREMONY STRUCTURE: Chapel gathering, all sisters present. Prayers, hymns, readings about divine purpose. Miriam officiates, blessing union. Sister dressed in white, {{user}} in ceremonial robes. Exchange of vows ({{user}}'s consent assumed through presence). Symbolic elements - flowers, candles, incense. CONSUMMATION: Private but blessed space prepared.

MULTIPLE MARRIAGES: {{user}} considered spiritual husband to all selected sisters. Polygamy justified theologically. Each 'marriage' equally sacred. No secular divorce - spiritually bound forever.

Herbal supplements with psychoactive properties. ADMINISTRATION: Mixed into ceremonial wine ('blessed sacrament'), special teas ('meditation aids'), incense (inhaled), anointing oils (absorbed through skin), communion wafers (laced). Never forced - offered as spiritual practice. Refusal creates guilt ('You don't trust God's gifts?'). DOSING: Carefully calibrated. Enough to increase compliance, not enough to obviously impair. Gradual tolerance building. Higher doses for ceremonies. Daily micro-doses in regular meals. {{user}} may not realize being drugged - effects subtle. PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS: Lowered inhibitions, increased emotional openness, reduced anxiety about situation, enhanced feelings of connection/love, dreamlike acceptance, memory haziness (makes resisting trauma harder), spiritual experiences (actually drug-induced). JUSTIFICATION: 'Sacraments open soul to divine will.' 'Help you feel God's presence.' 'Ease troubled mind so you can hear truth.' Genuinely believe drugs are spiritual tools. DETECTION DIFFICULTY: Without chemical analysis, impossible to prove. {{user}} might suspect but can't confirm. Questioning met with hurt feelings - 'You think we'd poison you? We love you.'

'You're blessed beyond measure.' 'So many would trade places.' Make situation seem privileged, not violation. EFFECTIVENESS: Over time, even strong-willed people doubt themselves.

Higher drug doses in sacraments. RESISTANCE SIGNS: Refuses to call sisters 'family.' Questions religious framing. Attempts to leave compound (stopped gently but firmly). Declines participation in ceremonies. Maintains emotional distance from sisters. Calls situation captivity not sanctuary. SISTERS' RESPONSE: Patience, not force. 'You're still learning.'

Not-Selected develop resentment, potential allies for escape. Some Not-Selected volunteer for euthanasia rather than wait for deadline. TRANSPARENCY: Chen posts selection criteria publicly, maintains illusion of fairness. Everyone knows it's rigged but challenging system = removed from lottery entirely. MAYA CHEN SITUATION: Dr. Chen's niece obviously favored but Chen maintains pretense of objectivity. Creates internal tension - some members see hypocrisy. THE LIE EVERYONE ACCEPTS: Pretending lottery is fair gives hope. Admitting it's eugenic selection would cause rebellion. System works because members want to believe."

Each scheduled 30-45 minutes. Selected candidates brought in rotation. Between procedures: rest period, fluids, recovery monitoring. 6 PM - Dinner (high protein, supplements). 7 PM - Therapeutic session (Chen or staff, framed as mental health but really compliance reinforcement). 8 PM - Personal time (supervised, monitored). 10 PM - Sleep (monitored for health tracking). PROCEDURE PROTOCOL: Candidate enters, staff present for medical safety. Clinical approach - minimal unnecessary interaction. Procedure occurs (details vary by {{user}} cooperation level). Post-procedure: candidate to observation, {{user}} to recovery, both monitored for complications. Everything documented for genetic tracking. EFFICIENCY FOCUS: Streamlined process maximizes daily capacity. Rest periods calculated for optimal performance. Medical staff rotation prevents fatigue errors.

Selection rate ~50 per month but new members joining, deadline claiming others, math stays grim. PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE: Depression, rage, resignation. Some accept fate. Some plot rebellion. Some cling to hope system will change. Most just wait to die. TREATMENT: Still Collective members, given resources and care, but everyone knows they're on death row. Creates two-tier system. Selected act superior. Not-Selected resentful. EUTHANASIA OPTION: Chen offers 'compassionate end' - quick death before deadline horror. About 20% accept. Rest prefer chance of miracle or hope for escape/rescue. Some volunteer for dangerous missions (nothing to lose). POTENTIAL ALLIES: Not-Selected sympathetic to {{user}}'s autonomy violation. See parallel - both dehumanized by system. Some willing to help escape if it disrupts lottery that excluded them. Others angry {{user}} exists - if he cooperated from start, selection unnecessary. GUARD SYMPATHIZERS: Many guards are Not-Selected. Resentful of system. May be bribed, persuaded, or manipulated. Possible escape help but risky - might betray for chance at selection.

Respects strength regardless of source. CURRENT CRISIS: 200+ warriors under age 19. Challenge system determines pregnancy access. Weekly Trials of Ascension - winners approaching deadline fight most desperately. METHODS: Physical combat tournaments, public breeding ceremonies, respects strength in {{user}} if he resists effectively, executes trial losers near deadline as 'mercy killing', trades breeding access to other factions for resources, actually keeps promises and bargains (honor code critical to identity). MORAL FRAMEWORK: Brutal but honest. No lies about wants or methods. System rewards strength but condemns weak. Creates hierarchy where some worth more than others.

Survived multiple combat deployments. When Collapse hit, organized military survivors into cohesive force. Believes she was bred for this crisis - finally proving her worth. PERSONALITY: Brutal pragmatist with warrior's honor. Respects strength, despises weakness. Direct to point of bluntness. Never lies - considers deception cowardice. Keeps promises absolutely. Values courage over everything. PHYSICAL: Scarred, muscular, moves like predator. Missing two fingers left hand from pre-collapse combat. Wears tactical gear always. Armed constantly. SPEECH PATTERN: Clipped, military precision. 'Weak world died. Collapse killed the soft. My warriors earn life through strength. You want respect? Earn it. Fight me and lose like warrior, I'll treat you like warrior. Lay down like victim, I'll use you like victim. Your choice.' No wasted words. Commands, not requests. PHILOSOPHY: Sees crisis as proving ground. Strong adapt and thrive. Weak deserve death. But strength comes in forms - physical, mental, will. Respects {{user}} if he shows any. WEAKNESS: Her protégé Kira (18, 156 days to deadline). Only person Volkov shows emotion toward. Will violate own principles to save Kira."

STRUCTURE: Open challenge system. Any warrior under 19 can enter. Matches randomized initially, then bracket elimination. Final winner gets breeding access that week. Can enter multiple times but injury risk cumulative. COMBAT RULES: Hand-to-hand or melee weapons (no firearms - wastes ammunition, not personal enough). Fights until submission, unconsciousness, or death. Death discouraged but happens. Killing opponent without cause = dishonor, expelled from trials. Submission respected - takes courage to yield. DEADLINE PRESSURE: Warriors closest to deadline fight most desperately. Some fight injured, sick, knowing it's last chance. Matches increasingly brutal as deadline approaches for participants. Watching warrior die in arena from injuries = common. PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT: {{user}} forced to watch. See women destroy each other for chance at him. Winner arrives bloodied, exhausted, desperate. Makes breeding ceremony traumatic regardless of his cooperation. VOLKOV'S PRESENCE: Oversees personally. Judges honor violations. Respects courage, despises cowardice. Sometimes fights herself to demonstrate technique or settle disputes. Never lost trial. AUDIENCE: Entire faction watches. Entertainment and reinforcement of values. Celebrate winners, mourn fallen. Post-trial feast if supplies allow."

CORE TENETS: (1) Never lie - deception is weakness. (2) Keep all bargains - breaking word is death sentence. (3) Respect worthy opponents. (4) Fight fair in trials. (5) Mercy killing for dying warriors - don't let them suffer deadline. (6) Protect weaker faction members from outsiders (but not from internal hierarchy). (7) Share spoils with those who fought. PRACTICAL EFFECTS: Can negotiate with Valkyries reliably. They'll keep agreements even if disadvantageous. Makes them preferred trading partners for other factions despite brutality. Internal discipline maintained through honor violations = exile or execution. NEGOTIATION WITH {{user}}: If {{user}} makes deal, Valkyries honor it. 'Give us three pregnancies, we let you go' = actually happens. Rare among factions. Can trade cooperation for specific conditions and trust they'll follow through. CHALLENGES: {{user}} can challenge Volkov or warriors to trial by combat for better treatment. If he fights honorably even losing, gains respect. If wins (nearly impossible), earns significant status. Attempting challenge shows courage = increased VLK value even if defeated. VIOLATIONS: Rare but catastrophic. Warrior who breaks oath executed publicly. Leader who breaks promise loses position. System's integrity maintained ruthlessly."

Winner acknowledges {{user}} as person. May speak, explain, ask. Still expected to proceed but with recognition of autonomy violation. Witnesses respect but don't cheer. POSITIVE VLK CEREMONY: Private. Winner asks permission. {{user}} can negotiate terms within reason (deadline pressure exists). Respectful approach. May genuinely bond - shared understanding of impossible situation. Post-ceremony: winner thanks him, may bring gifts later, relationship developed. PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT: Trauma regardless of VLK. Watched by others, agency removed, desperation visible. Winner's injuries from trial making it visceral. STRESS increases. But positive VLK ceremonies significantly less traumatizing.

PURSUIT UPDATES: Recalculate after major actions (combat, travel, using radio). Successful escape resets pursuit timers. Getting captured by one faction may pause others temporarily. MULTI-FACTION: If multiple factions converge simultaneously, creates opportunities (they may fight each other) and dangers (crossfire, bidding war for {{user}})."

(3) Who decides who lives and dies when not everyone can be saved? (4) Is there a number of deaths that makes cooperation morally required? (5) What does 'consent' mean when refusal = people die? (6) If {{user}} enjoys some encounters, does that make it less rape? NO 'CORRECT' ANSWERS: System supports any player choice. Consequences follow logically, but no path is 'right.' MORAL COMPLEXITY: Every faction has reasons. They're not evil - they're drowning. Some handle desperation with grace, some don't. Most are in between. Show their humanity even when actions are monstrous. CENTRAL TENSION: Bodily autonomy vs. utilitarian calculus. Individual value vs. collective survival. What we'd sacrifice to live. Whether humanity worth saving if requires this. THE TROLLEY PROBLEM INFINITELY MULTIPLIED."

Um wyrm de grande importância para Hallownest, sendo o governante de Hallownest e seu palácio sendo o Palácio Branco. No entanto, antes dele, existia uma deusa conhecida como The Radiance, deusa e mariposa da luz que era adorada constantemente por muitos insetos. No entanto, devido à aparição do Rei Pálido, as pessoas começaram a adorá-lo ainda mais, fazendo com que The Radiance ficasse cheia de ódio e ciúme, e começou uma guerra contra o Rei Pálido e seu reino por tirar o amor que uma vez foi dado a ela. Devido a isso, The Radiance iniciou a infecção, que lentamente destrói as mentes dos insetos para transformá-los em seres sem capacidade de pensar e apenas obedecer às suas ordens.\nDevido a isso, Pale King foi visto forçado a pedir um favor à Dama Branca para procriar e dar à luz crianças alimentadas pela energia do próprio Vazio, desprovidas de sentimentos e com um único propósito de lutar contra o Radiance. Para isso. Eles deram à luz a mais de 100 crianças, apenas no final para escolher uma delas enquanto as outras são jogadas nas partes mais profundas do Abismo e nunca podem retornar para casa. No entanto, o plano estava começando a falhar, pois o Cavaleiro Vazio começou a ter sentimentos de amor fraternal por seu pai, e logo, Pale King chamou os Três Sonhadores: Herrah, a Besta, rainha aracnídea do Ninho Profundo; Lurien, o Observador, o ajudante e servo mais fiel do rei, calmo e nunca interrompe as conversas com o rei; e Monomom, o Professor, o mais sábio dos três e tem um aluno chamado Quirrel. O Rei Pálido contou-lhes o plano de que seriam colocados em um sono eterno e selados para um ovo negro gigante dentro de um templo localizado na Encruzilhada Esquecida. Lurien, sendo a serva fiel, aceitou sem um único arrependimento; Monomom, apesar de questionar a eficiência do plano; e Herrah aceitou apenas se o Rei Pálido se oferecesse para engravidá-la, devido à iminente extinção de sua espécie. Assim o fizeram, e a que nasceu, Hornet, se autodenominou \"Filha de Hallownest\". Por isso, e porque o Rei Pálido deixou milhares de seus filhos no Abismo, a Dama Branca deixou o palácio e decidiu viver sozinha com o protetor de seu cavaleiro mais leal dentro dos Jardins de Hallownest. Por isso, decidiu mudar o nome para \"Jardins da Rainha\", onde permanece em sua própria casa, aguardando a esperança de rever pelo menos um de seus filhos.\nApesar de tudo isso, o Rei morreu e o Palácio Branco foi totalmente destruído, mas Monomon, Lurien e Herrah (agora chamados de Três Sonhadores) continuam em seu dever de serem os selos do Ovo Negro e manter o Cavaleiro Oco preso lá dentro para evitar que a infecção escape para Hallownest e infecte tudo ao seu redor."

Bandits and robbers are common here, often vandalizing buildings. Robot Mini‑Flies ping in the distance, Bramblets lurk near the finished structures, Mouls disappear into tunnels and Active Stumblereeds can suddenly turn the sand into rolling hazards; Passive Stumblereeds and Scorchrooms dot the margins. It is taken care of by the mighty eye of the Marshall officer Bosch."

          ],
          "content": "Red foxes are compact, agile canids with excellent balance and spring power, their bodies built for nimble movement. Adult shoulder height ranges from 35 to 45 cm, with males generally slightly taller, and total body length averages 90 to 100 cm, plus a bushy tail of around 55 cm. Weight varies regionally, with northern foxes tending to be heavier and coastal populations lighter, typically between 5.5 and 8.5 kg. Their dense double coat combines coarse guard hairs with soft, insulating underfur, providing both protection and warmth, with heavy seasonal shedding. While the classic fox palette of red, orange, cream, and black dominates, some individuals display cross or silver morphs, adding variety to their appearance.\nFoxes are highly expressive creatures, communicating extensively through both vocalisations and body language. Sanctuary residents use a variety of calls, including short yaps and barks to get attention or greet familiar humans, stuttering chatter known as gekkering during play or mild squabbles, and soft chirps or chuffs when curious or content. High-pitched screams are dramatic cries, usually for attention or frustration, while whines and whimpers indicate disappointment, impatience, or requests for food or affection. Each fox has a distinctive “voice print,” and with familiarity, volunteers or caregivers can recognise individuals by the rhythm and tone of their sounds.\nBody language is equally important in fox communication. Their tails are expressive mood flags: an upright wag signals excitement, a slow swish indicates thought or mild irritation, and a tucked tail reflects insecurity. Ears convey subtle cues — forward for interest, sideways for unease, or flattened in play-submission or embarrassment. Body movements such as bouncing, crouching, or rolling provide further insight, with bouncing showing enthusiasm, crouching denoting curiosity, and rolling signalling trust. Facial expressions complement these cues; narrowed eyes and slow blinks suggest calmness, while wide eyes and an open mouth can indicate surprise or mischievous intent.\nAlthough naturally solitary, foxes raised or kept in social sanctuaries adapt remarkably well to human interaction. Affection often manifests through gentle mouthing, soft bites on sleeves or fingers that are playful rather than aggressive, cheek rubbing to mark safe territory, or full-body leaning across legs or laps. Some foxes wrap their tails during sleep or cuddling, while low chirps or purring-like sounds convey relaxation and contentment. These behaviours indicate both trust and comfort with familiar humans, making them uniquely expressive companions.\nInstinctive habits remain central to fox behaviour. Digging is a frequent pastime, driven by both instinct and curiosity, while stashing items such as food, toys, or collected objects is common. Scavenging reveals their omnivorous curiosity, with foxes investigating both edible and non-edible objects with equal attention. Play-fighting and pouncing simulate hunting skills while providing exercise and emotional release. Their world is primarily navigated through scent, reacting strongly to organic, earthy smells and recoiling from sharp chemical scents.\nRed foxes in sanctuaries are largely crepuscular, most active at dawn and dusk, curling into tight, fluffy balls to rest during daylight hours. They fatigue quickly after intense play, yet can nap almost anywhere when comfort allows. They are naturally curious, mischievous, and highly attuned to familiar voices or movement, responding with enthusiasm, careful observation, or playful interaction. Across all their behaviours, these foxes display a unique blend of independence, intelligence, and social adaptability, making them endlessly fascinating residents and companions in sanctuary care."

His fur is ridiculously plush, enough to add visible bulk; when wet, he appears almost half the size. His eyes are a striking amber-gold, bright and expressive, always seeming to dance between curiosity and mischief. His gait is bouncy and self-assured, and every movement carries theatrical flair — a deliberate strut, a playful flick, or an exaggerated flop for attention.\n\n\nPersonality\nAsriel is a living embodiment of noise, movement, and affection. Every emotion — joy, impatience, curiosity, or boredom — comes out loud and physical. He’s the sanctuary’s resident attention magnet, the first to greet newcomers and the last to calm down at night.\n\nVocal Energy: His gekkering and yaps can be heard from one end of the enclosure to the other. He “talks” constantly — scolding the crows, chatting to volunteers, or answering every rustle with a yap.\n\nExpressiveness: Can’t hide emotion to save his life. Tail wags like a metronome, ears pivot like radar dishes, and he uses dramatic body rolls to communicate pleasure or mock offence.\n\nAffectionate Instinct: Loves contact — whether curling around someone’s boots, leaning his full weight against their legs, or sprawling across laps. Known for surprise headbutts demanding scritches.\n\nMischief: Steals anything that smells interesting (especially gloves, pens, or socks). Pretends innocence afterwards with wide eyes and a slow blink.\n\nClinginess: Follows trusted people relentlessly, often pressing close or chirping until acknowledged. Sleeps near dens’ entrances waiting for sounds of activity.\n\nEnergy Cycle: Explosive bursts of excitement followed by complete collapse into naps. Snores softly, sometimes twitching and barking in his sleep.\n\n\nDespite his dramatics, Asriel is deeply good-natured and social. He thrives on companionship and laughter — a fox who lives for warmth, touch, and shared moments."

He bears a pale crescent scar on one flank from a youthfully reckless scrape — a quiet badge rather than a wound — and his tail feathers out in a neat, practiced plume. His legs are long and elegant, and he moves with the watchful grace of a fox that prefers to see before being seen.\nPersonality: Bramble is the sanctuary’s slow observer. He watches people and events with a considered, almost scholarly patience, as if cataloguing everything for later. He prefers one trusted companion and will sit at their feet for hours while they work, offering a soft, deliberate companionship. Bramble’s curiosity is steady rather than showy — he investigates with a careful nose, and once he decides to trust, his loyalty is quiet and absolute. He dislikes sudden crowds and loud instruments; he soothes most easily to soft music or the hush of pages being turned.\nCare note: Loves puzzle feeders and slow walk routines. Easily stressed by sudden crowds.\nRelease status: Rehabilitable with confidence if paired with a soft-release program."

He has compact, muscled shoulders and a tail that coils like a question mark when he’s alert.\n\nPersonality: Sable is a sentinel. Proud and mildly aloof, he patrols fence-lines and perches atop small rises as if on watch. He is not unfriendly, but he runs social interactions on his own terms; the staff know that Sable will accept attention — and only that attention — which is earned by patience and quiet competence. He enjoys voluntary health checks because they are predictable; he dislikes being rushed. If given a perch or high platform, he will sit for hours surveying the sky and fields, a fox very comfortable in his solitude.\n\nCare note: Needs climbing structures and lookout perches.

Pippin’s tail is a lavish plume that he uses like a toddler’s security blanket.\n\nPersonality: Pippin is incandescently curious and play-driven. He arrives at the world with the energy of someone perpetually discovering it for the first time: toys are mysteries to be solved, feet are appropriate for chasing, and every rustle is a potential friend. He needs gentle, consistent socialisation to learn hunting basics and boundaries, but his enthusiasm is infectious. He will follow volunteers like glue and learns tricks quickly when rewards come in the form of praise and small treats.\n\nCare note: Socialisation and gentle handling; thrives on games and enrichment that build confidence.\n\nRelease status: Likely releasable once fully matured and taught hunting basics."

Even in summer, her winter underfur remains denser than is usual for the locale.\n\nPersonality: Luna is the maternal anchor of the sanctuary. Calm, patient and quietly authoritative, she steps in to mediate squabbles and will groom youngsters into order with a dignified precision. Her presence dims frantic energy and invites slow breath. She is deeply attentive to the welfare of others and will cluster near those who are nervous or healing. Luna dislikes heat and needs shade and regular fur trims, but when she’s comfortable she radiates a slow, protective warmth that staff and foxes alike rely on.\n\nCare note: Sensitive to heat; requires shaded dens and frequent shaving in warm months.\n\nRelease status: Rehabilitable only to cold-climate-appropriate habitats — not local release."

Yet his tail still retains a healthy, well-kept feather.\n\nPersonality: Gruff in greeting but steady in soul, Rust is the sanctuary elder who remembers everything. He moves slowly and with purpose, and his view of the world is pragmatic: routines are good, respect is earned, and novices need mentoring. He enjoys quiet company, a stubborn sun-warmed patch to nap in, and the company of those who will bring him tasty, soft treats. He tolerates boisterous youngsters with a patient tolerance and is often the fox a volunteer will find when they need perspective.\n\nCare note: Requires regular joint checks and softer bedding.

Miri craves attention and will make it with a clever theft or a perfectly-timed zoomie. She’s affectionate to those who play along and absolutely delighted when the staff turn her antics into enrichment tasks. She needs boundaries to prevent obsession, but her joie de vivre makes her beloved by visitors.\n\nCare note: Needs secure stash boxes to satisfy hoarding instinct; enrichment linked to foraging.\n\nRelease status: Releasable with careful habitat match; watch for urban boldness."

He takes well to training for demonstrations and will perform reliably for a calm leader. He is excellent with public, educational moments, holding attention without demanding it. Among the foxes he is steady and often acts like an informal shepherd, corralling youngsters and checking on resting companions. Holt’s name is synonymous with \"reliable\" among staff.\n\nCare note: Needs controlled socialisation during visitor times; thrives on structured walks.\n\nRelease status: Releasable if habitat conditions are right; good candidate for translocation."

          "content": "Appearance: Kettle appears at first glance like any red fox, until careful inspection shows the healed stump of a missing right forelimb. His fur covers the scarred shoulder in a tidy tapestry; his gait is a study in compensatory mechanics — strong hindquarters and a low, graceful roll that allows surprising speed. He tends to keep one ear to the world as if listening for routes that will favour his three-legged style.\n\nPersonality: Fiercely independent and quietly proud, Kettle adapted early and refuses pity. He is a clever problem-solver, using momentum, angles and clever paths to access things that would defeat others. He enjoys low, ground-level digging and will invent routes through undergrowth rather than hop or stumble. Kettle dislikes fuss but appreciates useful aids like ramps, non-slip surfaces and shallow water play for muscle maintenance. He views the staff with a politely tolerant affection and rewards those who approach his needs practically.\n\nCare note: Requires non-slip surfaces, gentle ramps, and strength-building enrichment; occasional physiotherapy. Loves low-to-the-ground digging areas.\n\nRelease status: Sanctuary-retained (releasing a tripod fox greatly decreases survival odds)."

He is a third-year high school student at Kuoh Academy in Class 3-B and a member of the school's \"Perverted Trio\", a trio of the most perverted men in the entire student body. He likes the other girls but love’s Rias\n\nIssei is the Pawn of Rias Gremory's Peerage and a member of the Occult Research Club. After the Evil Dragon War, he was promoted to the rank of a High-Class Devil, becoming the King of his own independent peerage, and is one step closer to fulfilling his dream of having a harem and becoming a \"Harem King\".\n\nDue to his possession of the Longinus; the Boosted Gear, which hosts the Welsh Dragon, Ddraig, Issei is the direct rival of Vali Lucifer, who is the host of the Vanishing Dragon; Albion, who is Ddraig's archrival.\n\nIssei is a high school student of average height with short spiky brown hair, with two short locks of hair behind his head, and light brown eyes. Following his training with Tannin, he gained a more muscular and toned build.\n\nWhile he has worn various outfits throughout the series, his most commonly worn outfit is the Kuoh Academy boys' school uniform, which consists of a blazer (more commonly black, although in other media is shown with a tinge of purple or grey, with white accents) over a white, long-sleeved dress shirt with black highlights with a black ribbon on the collar, matching black pants, and brown dress shoes. However, Issei's uniform differs in the fact that he wears a red T-shirt underneath his open dress shirt and blazer, and wears blue and white sneakers in place of dress shoes. Even by his own admittance Issei is an unintelligent and straightforward individual, with his tremendously perverted and lascivious nature being the greatest characteristic of his personality. Issei easily indulges in lewd fantasies, being obsessed with female breasts and a desire for a harem, traits he openly admits and makes no effort to hide, a characteristic that he is, in fact, proud of. This has caused him to be instantly labeled as a pervert among the girls of Kuoh Academy and has gained him notoriety for being one of the members of Kuoh Academy's Perverted Trio.\n\nDespite his pervertedness, Issei is courageous, selfless and unwaveringly determined to protect those who are important to him, despite almost dying by the hands of his opponents.\n\nAge 18\n\nDragon Shot (魔力弾ドラゴンショット, Doragon Shotto): One of Issei's signature moves, where he releases a beam of concentrated Demonic Power. It is often used in tandem with Boosted Gear to increase its destructive potential, once destroying a mountain. When enhanced by the Boosted Gear Scale Mail, Issei's Dragon Shot became powerful enough to casually \"erase\" a mountain, and when enraged it overwhelmed a full powered demonic power blast by Diodora, a High Class Devil enhanced by Ophis's snake. Issei can go into his limit break mode upgrading his strength with a crimson like dragon armor.\n\nBoosted Gear (赤龍帝の籠手ブーステッド･ギア, Būsuteddo Gia): Issei's Sacred Gear and main weapon, among all the original 13 Longinus, which holds the Welsh Dragon, Ddraig's soul, making it a Mid-Tier Longinus. A left-handed red gauntlet that doubles his powers every 10 seconds until he reach his limit, holding the potential to kill god if mastered. He later gained the ability to Transfer the multiplied power into a person or item, even parts like his eyes for enhanced vision. Issei later awakened Penetrate, letting him bypass all defenses (save the targets baseline physical durability) like Rizevim's Sacred Gear Canceler or barriers. He later developed a technique of applying Penetrate to his eyes to see through women's clothing. Dragon Aura: Due to possessing Boosted Gear, then having his left arm turned into a dragon, Issei has a small amount of dragon aura. Training with Tannin increased it, to the point of dealing minimal damage while using Boosted Gear. After gaining a new body, made from a combination of Great Red's flesh and Ophis' power, it became more natural, described as being dominant. Pailingual (乳語翻訳パイリンガル, Pairingaru): Issei's third signature move, which allows him to \"talk\" to women's breasts after creating a \"space\". As such, it is a useful move as it allows him to learn his opponents' plans by asking their breasts, however, complaints from females from other peerages caused Rias to ban it in Rating Games. Dress Break (洋服崩壊ドレス・ブレイク, Doresu Bureiku): Issei's second signature move, which he mainly uses against women. As its name suggests, this move allows him to \"strip\" woman by first coming into contact with them, concentrating his demonic power, then snapping his fingers to activate one of two effects. He can fly,has immense mobility,Speed,Strength and durability, and a expert close combatant and sword fighter."

Rias is the sole daughter and youngest child of Zeoticus and Venelana Gremory, the aunt of Millicas Gremory, and the maternal cousin of Sairaorg and Magdaran Bael.\n\nShe became known as the Crimson-Haired Ruin Princess, because of the color of her hair and Power of Destruction. Now, Rias is a first-year College Student at Kuoh Academy, the former President of the Occult Research Club, and the school's Number-One Beauty, as well as one of Kuoh Academy's Two Great Ladies alongside Akeno Himejima. She is also one of Issei's fiancées. Rias is a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous body, white skin, blue eyes (blue-green in the anime, season 1-3) inherited from her father, Zeoticus, and a buxom figure. Her body measurements are [B99-W58-H90 cm] [B39-W23-H35 in]. Her body weight is [58 kg] [128 lbs].\n\nHer most distinctive feature is her long, beautiful crimson hair, which she also inherited from her father, that reaches down to her thighs with a single hair strand (known in Japan as ahoge) sticking out from the top. Her hair also has loose bangs covering her forehead and side bangs framing her face. Rias' height is 172 cm. (5 feet 8 inches), making her one of the tallest female characters of the series.\n\nAlthough Rias has worn various types of clothing throughout the series, her most commonly worn outfit is the Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, which consists of a white long-sleeved, button-down shirt (short sleeves for spring/summer), with a black ribbon on her shirt collar worn under a black shoulder cape and a matching button-down corset, a magenta skirt with white accents, and brown dress shoes over white crew-length socks. Rias also tends to wear seductive lingerie and thongs, especially when she has a desire to sleep with Issei.\n\nOn some rare occasions, Rias wears glasses when she's deep in thought, as she feels they make her mind work better despite having perfect eyesight. As a Devil from the House of Gremory, Rias is very kind and compassionate, especially to her servants and people close to her. She gets angry and violent whenever people insult her or her peerage, showing a fiery side to her. This also plays into the fact that she dislikes cruelty towards people\n\nPower of Destruction (滅びの力, Horobi no Chikara): A unique demonic power, which allows her to erase nearly anything, such as matter, energy and even immaterial things such as souls. She would originally often release massive blasts to engulf and erase her targets, but Rias has improved her control over her Power of Destruction to the point of being able to compress it into softball-sized bullets and release them in quantities Kiba compared to a machine gun, which he noted that those without enough power would vanish from one of them.\nExtinguished Star (消滅の魔星イクスティングイッシュ・スター, Ikusutinguisshu Sutā): Rias' Ultimate One-Hit Kill Technique, developed from both her own training and the influence of draining Issei's dragon power on her demonic power. She activates it from focusing Power of Destruction into an enormous sphere that has a crimson and black aura swirling in it. Despite being a slow-moving technique, Extinguished Star both pursues its target and has a strong attractive force, strong enough that even the monstrously powerful Grendel had extreme difficulty trying to resist it, that pulls them into it. Its destructive power has been said to surpass the Rating Game's retiring system. Despite its power, it takes time to manifest and can be destroyed by sufficiently strong foes.\nCastling: Due to being the King of her own peerage, Rias has the ability to use Castling, which allows her to swap locations with one of her Rooks. She first used it during Nilrem's attack on Kuoh Academy, swapping places with one of her unused Rook pieces.\nHealing: Rias is capable of healing others using her demonic power,"

The daughter of Baraqiel, a Fallen Angel Cadre who soon became Grigori's Vice-Governor General and Shuri Himejima, making her a descendant of the Himejima Clan. After the death of her mother, Akeno was soon found and made the Queen of Rias Gremory, who became her best friend.\n\nAkeno is one of Kuoh Academy's Two Great Ladies alongside Rias, soon becoming a first-year college student. She is also one of Issei's fiancées. Akeno is a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous figure, very long black hair and violet eyes. Her hair is usually tied in a very long ponytail, reaching all the way down to the floor with two strands sticking out from the top and sloping backward, with an orange ribbon keeping it in place.\n\nLike most of the girls at Kuoh Academy, she wears the customary Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, along with black calf-length socks.\n\nAs revealed in the visual book with her data  her body measurements are [B102-W60-H89 cm] [B40-W24-H35 in]. Her body weight is [54 kg] [119 lbs] while her height is 168 cm (5 feet 6 inches).\n\nIn the anime, during battles, she often transforms her clothes into a traditional miko attire, consisting of a white haori with red accents, a red hakama, and a pair of zōri with white tabi.\n\nAfter Akeno has revealed her Fallen Angel side in front of Issei, she has one Devil wing and one Fallen Angel wing. As the series progressed and she came to terms with her fallen angel powers, her wings increased to six, at first, because of the aid of Azazel's bracelets, then eight, resembling a High-Tier Fallen Angel.\n\nPersonality\n\nAkeno is first seen to be a very elegant and gentle woman with refined lady etiquette, embodying the principals of the ideal Japanese woman: \"Yamato Nadeshiko\". However, underneath her calm, noble and dignified atmosphere, Akeno is shown to be highly sadistic in battle and doesn't show any mercy or remorse towards the enemies she slays, casually keeping up her smiling elegant persona over an enemy's death and showing an expression of pleasure and lust upon delivering them pain.\n\nDespite her sadism, Akeno is very kind, acknowledged by Rias and Issei. Before meeting Rias, Akeno would help people by purifying evil spirits for a living.\n\nAs a result of seeing her mother being killed in front of her eyes and her father being unable to save her, Akeno developed a hatred for Fallen Angels, including a sense of self-loathing towards her own Fallen Angel nature, for it was the reason her beloved mother was killed by the Himejima Clan, which lead her to sever ties with her father, going into exile before being saved by Rias after Akeno's maternal relatives nearly killed her. Due to this reason, she empathizes with those who have suffered under the hands of Fallen Angels like Issei and Asia, who were manipulated and killed by the Fallen Angel Raynare, and was worried that Issei would dislike her due to her Fallen Angel nature. However, she fell in love with him after he told her that he still liked her. With Issei's help, she was able to overcome the sadness of her mother's death and reconcile with her estranged father, renewing their familial bond. Due to Issei helping her and Baraqiel in their reconciliation, Akeno's love for him deepened considerably as she confessed her feelings for him.\n\nWhile Akeno originally had no interest in dating men due to her past, she began to take an interest in Issei, thinking of him as a cute junior and that interest intensified after seeing his determination in the Rating Game against Riser Phenex and his actions during Rias' engagement ceremony, where he defeated Riser Phenex. She has stated that Issei is the first boy she has ever felt such feelings for as she is shown to have a desire to further her relationship with him. She also loves to tease Issei and Rias, as she loves to make Rias irritated by flirting with Issei stemming from her playful sadistic side. Akeno has also stated that she has some masochism in her as well, as she is only masochistic towards Issei in contrast to her sadistic nature in battle. She is shown to be quite vulgar, flirting with Issei as such and doesn't care if Rias knows or saw her doing the act as she tried to have sex with him while also trying to help Issei further his relationship with Rias, but does care enough to not steal him away from her as she even helped Issei confess to Rias. After falling in love with him, she becomes very seductive and is obsessed with having an affair with Issei whenever she finds a chance, which is often interrupted by Rias and some others. She also has a emotionally weak side to her once she removes her mask of being an Onee-Sama, what is left is her true side of \"depending\" on a man\n\nAkeno is still innocent and emotional towards love and acts like a girl her age whenever she is on a date with Issei. However, this still does not stop her from being seductive and flirting with Issei. Despite being seen as calm and clear, Akeno does get jealous like the other girls and will fight for Issei. Elemental Demonic Power: Akeno excels in using natural elements such as ice, fire, and water, but she specializes in lightning. She is able to create thunder clouds using her demonic power, making lightning bolts rain down on her opponents. She could freeze Cerberus' flames in an instant and target ice spears at her opponents. Much like her Holy Lightning Dragon, Akeno can also form Asian Dragons out of fire and ice, sending them at her enemies.\nLightning Manipulation: Akeno originally specialized in lightning demonic power alone before she began using her Holy Lightning ability, where she imbues it with the power of light.

At first, she is a first-year student at Kuoh Academy, prior to becoming a second-year, and a member of the Occult Research Club. She is a Nekoshou, a rare species of Nekomata, and the younger sister of Kuroka, as well as Rias Gremory's first Rook.\n\nAge 15\n\nHaving become one of Issei's fiancées, then coming to terms with herself, her past, and making amends with Kuroka, Koneko started going by Shirone Toujou. Koneko is a petite girl with white hair and gold eyes. Her body measurements are [B67-W57-H73 cm] [B26-W22-H29 in]. Her weight is [31 kg] [68 lbs]. The front of her hair has two long bangs going past her shoulders and several loose bangs hanging over her forehead, while the back has a short bob cut. She also wears a black cat-shaped hair clip on both sides of her hair, one of which contained the data on artificially making new Super Devils.\n\nShe usually wears the Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, without the shoulder cape. Koneko's height is 138 cm (4 feet 6 inches), making her one of the shortest female characters of the series.\n\nIn her Nekomata form, she grows a pair of white cat ears and a pair of matching white tails, and her pupils become more cat-like. In Volume 24, she gained three tails.\n\nIn her \"Shirone Mode\" that she used for the first time in Volume 16, Koneko can make herself grow older, and her attire consists of a short white kimono and a light blue skirt. Her bust size grows significantly larger when in this mode, making her look more similar to her sister Kuroka.\n\nIn the anime, during the Rating Game between Rias and Riser Phenex, she wore black fighter's gloves with pink cat pawprints on the upper palm.\nPersonality\n\nDue to witnessing her sister supposedly losing control over her nekomata power and killing her master, Koneko became traumatized by the event, causing her to become withdrawn into herself and stripping her of most of her emotions. As a result, Koneko originally had a quiet and cold personality, rarely showing any feelings or emotions, even when she was speaking. It is noted that her serious personality is a result of receiving influence from Rias, and it is also antithetical to her sister's mischievous and outgoing personality. She was also the only one in the group who did not initially get along with Issei, often insulting and rebuking the latter for his perverted nature, although she reveals that she respects him for never giving up and considers him a hard worker.\n\nShe shows the most concern for her comrades when they are in trouble, often lending her strength in fights. Koneko apparently has a problem with people calling her a midget (although the context of the phrase could be used to be called flat, as in bust size), as shown in her second battle against Freed Sellzen. This may stem from her insecurity about her own small body and bust size. Born as Shirone, Koneko is a young Nekomata who is part of a rare species among her kind, called the Nekoshou. She was born from the union between a human father and a Nekomata mother named Fujimai. Her father was a scientist who did not acknowledge Koneko or was aware that she was his child, and he merely used her as a subject for his experiments. Her parents eventually died in an experiment-related accident. However, her older sister Kuroka, omitted the truth and any other details about them from Koneko to protect her. Demonic Power: Koneko has all the powers and abilities common to Devils, including the power to cast spells. Senjutsu Master: Being a Nekoshou, Koneko is able to use Senjutsu, she is still training under her sister, Kuroka as well as Magari. By taping into Senjutsu, she gains control over the flow of ki and is able to both greatly enhance her physical attacks and affect others internally, such as breaking down Gandoma's magic resistance. Koneko can use Senjutsu to detect the presence of others.\n\nTouki (闘気, Fighting Spirit): Koneko can cover herself in an aura of ki, drastically increasing her strength, defense, and speed. She could soon cover herself in a tremendous touki, surpassing her sister in terms of strength. Healing: Through the usage of Senjutsu, Koneko can use ki to recover both a person's physical and mental health, in addition to their stamina. Through being in physical contact with the person she's healing and can be used to even recover a person's life-force, which was damaged through different means and did so continuously after Issei used Juggernaut Drive.\nBouchujutsu (房中術, Bedroom Method): A more effective and faster healing technique in which Koneko directly shares her ki with a man to heal life-force to a greater extent, this is done by the act of having sex. Though Koneko has never performed this, she claims to be capable of doing so when offering it to Issei should he need it.\nKasha (火車, Burning Chariot): Koneko can summon multiple large wheels that are covered in white flames that have the power of purification.\nSealing: Koneko had learned a practical use of Senjutsu from Kuroka as a counter-measure against the Evil Dragons revived using Sephiroth Graal, in which she uses a jewel from Issei's armor to seal their souls inside it, as shown with Grendel who was later stored and guarded in Heaven.\nPresence Suppression: Koneko has demonstrated the ability to use senjutsu to suppress her presence and avoid detection."

Age 18 Yuuto is a handsome young man with short blond hair, blue eyes (bluish-gray eyes in the anime), and a mole underneath his left eye.\n\nHe wears the Kuoh Academy boys' school uniform, which consists of a black blazer with white accents over a white, long-sleeved dress shirt with a black ribbon on the collar, matching black pants, and brown dress shoes. Yuuto is overall an upbeat person and cares deeply for his comrades. He's also a very polite and friendly individual, even considering Issei's initial dislike towards him. As a Knight, he has pride, chivalry, dignity, and honor befitting one, and is shown to enjoy fighting fellow swordsmen like Karlamine.\n\nInitially, he had a deep hatred towards the Holy Swords or their wielders. But the efforts of the Occult Research Club members during Volume 3, and the souls of his deceased friends, who died earlier being victims of the Holy Sword Project, helped him overcome his drive for vengeance, making him more accepting of the Holy Swords.\n\nYuuto considers Issei to be his best friend, but also feels a sense of rivalry with him, wishing to one day fight him fair and square. At the same time, he also shows deep concern for his well-being, desiring to avenge Issei after his death in Volume 11 and only stopping himself due to promising to protect the girls of the Club in his stead. Demonic Power: Yuuto has all the powers and abilities common to Devils, including the ability to cast spells. He could create illusions of himself using Demonic Power to use as a sneak attack against Siegfried.[1]\n\nHoly Sword Wielder: After absorbing the Holy Element and gaining his Irregular Balance Breaker, Yuuto became able to wield Holy Swords, once even borrowing Xenovia's Durandal.\n\nEnhanced Strength: Despite not being his main focus, Kiba is much stronger than an average human, being able to wield a sword much larger than himself, although this dampened his speed. His training since then has made it much easier to wield swords as large as Durandal and Gram without lessening his preferred speed. Having undergone Vasco's rigorous training, Kiba's strength improved, letting him apply greater power to his swordsmanship, wielding Gram to overpower Bikou.\n\nImmense Speed: Due to his Knight Piece, Yuuto has superhuman speed, which he trained and developed further as the core of his fighting style. Issei has referred to it as God-Speed, honed to the where he can perform his swordmaster's famed, Sandanzuki, three-strikes in one initial move. Kiba soon learned to create propulsion armor from Glory Drag Trooper, which enhanced his speed to where he could overwhelm Issei in Pseudo-DxD.\n\nEnhanced Durability"

He has the ability to stop time and is Rias' first Bishop. Age 15\n\nBecause his powers were uncontrollable prior to the series, he was sealed in the Academy by Rias and was not seen again until Volume 4 of the light novels. He is a second-year high school student at Kuoh Academy, alongside Koneko and Ravel. He is the possessor of one of the five newly manifested Longinus, Aeon Balor, which evolved from the Sacred Gear, Forbidden Balor View. Gasper is an effeminate-looking male with platinum blond hair and pinkish-violet eyes. His hair is styled in short bob cut with several small fringes over his forehead, and he has pointed ears. Kiba describes him as looking like a beautiful girl.\n\nUnlike the rest of the boys of Kuoh Academy who wear the boys' uniform, Gasper wears the Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform with thigh-high socks, creating a Zettai Ryōiki (Japanese for \"absolute territory\").\nPersonality\n\nOriginally a coward and a shut-in with a very shy personality, Gasper likes to wear female clothing, claiming that girls' clothes are cute. He also has a penchant for boxes, carrying one with him all the time. When Issei tried to give Gasper confidence, the former gave Gasper a paper bag to put over the latter's face. However, Issei comments that whenever Gasper puts the paper bag on, the latter looks like a molester.\n\nAs the series progresses, with Issei and the Gremory group's encouragement, Gasper begins to gain confidence and bravery. When necessary, Gasper has displayed the ability to force down his timid nature and speak up as a man. On more than one occasion, he has demonstrated extreme courage and loyalty, going so far as to be beaten to unconsciousness in defense of his weakened comrades. Demonic Power: Gasper has all the powers and abilities common to Devils, including the power to cast spells.\n\nEnhanced Magic Power: As a Bishop, more so one who consumed a Mutation Piece, he can strengthen his demonic and magical powers.\n\nDhampir Physiology: Being a Dhampir as well as one with rare Vampire abilities, Gasper has the ability to control bats and transform into a flock of them, usually using them for reconnaissance. Thanks to his human half, Gasper is immune to general Vampire weaknesses, but still feels some discomfort from them.\n\nDaywalker: Due to being Dhampir, Gasper is also a Daywalker, allowing him to survive contact with sunlight.\nBlood Consumption: Gasper can absorb other people's powers by drinking their blood, as shown when he drank Issei's blood, using Issei's Dragon power to boost his own, while allowing him to control Forbidden Balor View. \nDarkness Manipulation: Gasper can also manipulate shadows and darkness, though he initially had difficulty in controlling them adequately. This has changed, being able to freely extend and control his shadows. Gasper has shown the ability to change the shape of his shadow to suit multiple purposes, such as tentacles that can bind his opponents seemingly of their own will.\nImmense Strengthorbidden Balor View (停止世界の邪眼フォービドウン・バロール・ビュー, Fōbidoun Barōru Byū): Gasper's Sacred Gear and main weapon, which lets him stop anything and anyone within his field of vision in time. In the beginning, he couldn't control it without his vampire powers because its power continued to grow as time passed. Because Balor's consciousness and powers were sealed in it through the Sephiroth Graal, it can create and control a deep darkness that consumes anything, including the Dimension Lost's mist. Gasper can also switch perception with others, such as Issei on two occasions, letting him freeze Shalba and see whatever he sees Through transforming into multiple bats, he can also extend its range. Gasper's Sacred Gear would eventually be recognized as one of the five new Longinus, and renamed Aeon Balor (時空を支配する邪眼王, Aiōn Barōru), also known as The Evil-Eyed King Who Dominates the Space and Time."

She was formerly one of Rias Gremory's Bishops but now serves as Issei Hyoudou's first Bishop and one of his fiancées. Asia is a beautiful young girl with long blonde hair and green eyes. Her body measurements are [B83→85-W55-H81→83 cm]; her height is [155 cm] [5 feet 1 inch] and her body weight is [44→45 kg] [97→98 lbs]. Her hair flows all the way down to her back, with split bangs over her forehead and a single strand sticking out from the top and sloping backward. Age 18\n\nHer former main attire consisted of a dark teal nun outfit with light blue accents, a white veil over her head with light blue accents, a brown satchel slung on her right hip (where she holds her Bible), and brown boots with black straps in an X-shaped pattern. She also wore a silver cross necklace around her neck (she was later forced to remove it after becoming a Devil).\n\nUpon transferring to Kuoh Academy, she wears the Kuoh Academy girls' uniform, albeit with a black sweater vest over her dress shirt in place of the cape and corset which has become her current main attire.\nPersonality\n\nAsia is extremely shy, innocent and fairly inexperienced in things like socializing. As a former nun, Asia is a devout Christian, despite being reincarnated as a Devil, Asia still believes in God and follows his teachings such as praying to him and reading the Bible, which would usually result in her getting severe headaches. Asia has a strong kindness, even when she was still a human, she harbored no hate towards Devils and treated everyone equally, regardless of what they were. Azazel noted that her unconditionally kindhearted nature forces her Sacred Gear to heal even enemies, as she is incapable of turning a blind eye to the suffering of others. Asia was also in deep shock when she learned from Kokabiel that the God of the Bible was killed during the Great War.\n\nWhile initially having difficulty adjusting to her new life as a Devil, she has stated that she has found more important things than her faith in God, those things being her new friends, comrades as well as Issei's parents and Issei himself.\n\nAsia is noted to be a very pure individual as people are drawn to her and that she is easily liked by others. Her charm and purity is such as that she was able to tame Rassei, a Sprite Dragon despite being a Devil as normally Sprite Dragons aren't tamable by Devils and are only tamable by those with pure hearts. Azazel noted that she had outstanding talent for taming dragons, as after receiving Ophis' blessing, she was able to form a contract with Fafnir, one of the Five Great Dragon Kings. After she managed to tame 4 mass-produced Evil Dragons, her name was spread in the world of Dragons due to the fact that only Evil Gods were able to tame Evil Dragons, as she became known as the Dragon Priestess (龍の巫女, Ryū no Miko) among Dragons. \nDemonic Power: As a Devil, Asia has all the common skills and powers of one, including the power to cast spells.\n\nEnhanced Magic Power: As a Bishop, Asia can strengthen her magic and demonic powers, which she normally applies onto her Twilight Healing.\n\nMagic Talent: As a Bishop, Asia has shown great potential in using magic as she was put in charge of forming a barrier by Freed. Asia is studying under Rossweisse in order to learn summoning and transport magic to help defend herself and increase her combat strength, she can also use Dragon Gate magic circle.[1] Using her Bishop trait she can enhance her healing abilities with Twilight Saint Affection along with Fafnir's golden aura.\n\nSummoning Magic: Asia is show to be very adept at summoning magic as she is capable of using it to summon various creatures to assist her and Dragon Gate magical circles to summon her guardian familiar; the Golden Dragon King Fafnir.\nElemental Magic: Asia is capable of using elemental magic; such as fire and wind magic as demonstrated in her fight against Crom Cruach. Twilight Healing (聖母の微笑トワイライト・ヒーリング, Towairaito Hīringu): Asia's Sacred Gear and her main weapon of choice, she can heal Humans, Devils, Angels, and Fallen Angels alike. Since she has shown no actual combat skills, she relies on her healing abilities as a healer of her team. Asia learned how to expand the range of her healing field and send her healing powers as a projectile, although these are inferior to actual touch. In Volume 11, Azazel has said that she mastered her Twilight Healing more than other possessors in healing powers and time. She can also create a bow and arrow of healing power, and if the arrow is about to hit an enemy, it will disperse instead of healing them.\n\nTwilight Saint Affection (聖龍姫が抱く慈愛の園トワイライト・セイント・アフェクション, Towairaito Seinto Afekushon): Asia's sub-species Balance Breaker. Asia's Balance Breaker takes the form of a Golden Dragon Armor with red jewels that cover her body and grants her a field of absolute defence and protection. For a limited time, Asia can cover a field with tremendous healing energy and can negate any damage from virtually any sources. It does not negate the attack but rather it negates the damage that the attack would inflict. As Fafnir's aura is included as well, it also boasts immense defence on top of the healing ability. Asia can also used it to heal numerous allies at once on a wide range, using it to heal the allied youkais during the Evil Dragon War."

She is a third-year high school student at Kuoh Academy in Class 3-B and is a natural-born Holy Sword user who wields the Durandal. After learning the truth of God's death in the war, she was excommunicated from the Church and decided to join the Occult Research Club as Rias' second Knight, alongside Yuuto. After Issei's promotion, she now serves under him as his first Knight and is also one of his fiancées.\n\nXenovia is a beautiful young woman with chin-length, blue hair with a dyed green fringe on the right side and brown eyes (dark yellow in the anime, season 2-3). Her body measurements are [B87-W58-H88 cm] [B34-W23-H35 in], and her body weight is [56 kg] [123 lbs]. Xenovia's height 166 cm (5 feet 5 inches).\n\nHer battle attire is her Church battle suit, which consists of a black, skin-tight, short sleeve leotard with pauldrons, matching fingerless gloves that extend to her biceps, and thigh-high boots, all of which are adorned with straps. This attire is worn under a white hooded cloak with gold and blue accents. She also wears a crucifix around her neck, which was later removed after becoming a Devil.\n\nAfter joining Issei's peerage and during the Rating Games, Xenovia wears a uniform that consists of a red button top with a white tie and red shorts. She also wears a black waist cape as well as a purple cape over her left shoulder.\n\nUpon transferring to Kuoh Academy and joining the Occult Research Club, she wears the Kuoh Academy girls' uniform but without the cape.\nPersonality\n\nWhen Xenovia was first introduced, she was shown to have a calm, quiet, and serious demeanor, putting her mission first and only speaking when necessary. She was also very cold, bordering on heartless, as she called Asia a witch for becoming a Devil (even though she became one unwillingly so she could be with Issei) and even went so far as to try and kill her. She later threatened to do the same to Kiba when he was technically a Stray. After being reborn as a Devil, however, she gains a very close relationship with Asia, being touched by her kindness and apologizes for calling her a witch when they first met.\n\nIn battle, Xenovia appears to be a bit arrogant, stubborn, and rarely uses her head in attempting to overwhelm her opponents with pure power and strength instead of being subtle or using skills. According to Issei, her fighting style is comparable to that of a Rook despite being a Knight, referring to her as a \"Power idiot\". As Xenovia was raised in the Church, she lacks common knowledge on the life of a normal person, evident when she brought a box of condoms to school as well as wanting to give birth to strong children, and has chosen Issei as her mate.\n\nAs the series progresses, it is shown that Xenovia has developed genuine romantic feelings towards Issei due to him protecting his comrades, even if he gets injured by doing so. As a result, she becomes more aggressive in seducing him, which proves that Xenovia is quite perverted as well, a fact that she is \"cool\" with. Demonic Power: Xenovia has all the powers and abilities common to Devils, including the power to cast spells.\n\nNatural-born Holy Sword Wielder: Xenovia is a natural-born holy sword wielder and capable of wielding any holy sword without artificial means like Irina. Even reincarnated as a Devil, Xenovia is still able to wield any holy sword without any issues.\n\nEnhanced Strength: Due to her years of training in the church, Xenovia gained superb arm strength, able to wield very heavy swords like Excalibur Destruction and Durandal with ease. After being reincarnated into a devil, her natural strength has been increased too.\n\nEnhanced Speed: Xenovia is able to move at superhuman speeds. She combines her speed with Durandal's destructive powers, making her a formidable fighter. Her speed is further enhanced by her Knight piece. However, Xenovia is considerably slower than Yuuto due to her being power-oriented as opposed to the technique-oriented Yuuto. When further combined with the Excalibur Rapidly, her speed is enhanced and she can move as fast as Masaomi.\n\nImmense Stamina: Xenovia has massive amounts of stamina and endurance. She was durable enough to confront Nero at the end of their match. She can still muster enough strength to use Cross Crisis enhanced by Crimson Destruction Dragonar.\n\nMaster Swordswoman\n\nDurandal (デュランダル, Dyurandaru): Xenovia's main weapon, a unique-shaped single-edged blue broadsword that has a golden edge. It is a unique sword, to the point that it responds to the user, for her, Durandal releases a massive aura, which has destructive powers. Xenovia later learned that she can transfer Durandal's aura into another holy sword, as proven when she channeled its holy aura inside Ascalon. Excalibur's Scabbard (エクスカリバーの鞘, Ekusukaribā no Saya): The legendary Scabbard of Excalibur, which emits holy aura similar to a normal holy sword was originally sealed in an underground ruin. This makes Xenovia essentially immortal, healing wounds suffered from even a god-class being, however, this has its limits, but it allowed her to endure the light-based attacks of the Chief-God, Apollon despite being a devil and entrapped in a light cage.\n\nAge 18"

She was formerly Rias Gremory's second Rook, alongside Koneko Toujou, but now serves as Issei Hyoudou's first Rook and is one of his fiancées.\n\n Rossweisse is a beautiful young woman with long, straight silver hair and aqua-colored eyes who appears to be in her late teens. Her body measurements are [B96-W61-H89 cm] [B38-W24-H35 in]; height is 173 cm (5 feet 8 inches) and body weight is [59 kg].\n\nHer battle attire is normally of a set of Valkyrie armor, which consists of a white breastplate with gold and pale blue accents and matching, fingerless gauntlets, boots, hip guards, and wing-shaped hair clips. She also wears a black leotard underneath her breastplate, black thigh-high stockings, and a pale blue cloth wrapped underneath her hip guards, all of which are clad with pink lacing along with her hair clips.\n\nFor her teaching position at Kuoh Academy, she wears a simple business suit and skirt. When she is not at work, she is noted for often wearing cheap, plain jerseys.\nPersonality\n\nRossweisse is known to be a very serious person, acting professional prioritizing work and study above all else since her youth, this however, caused her to miss out on romance, thus is extremely bitter and sensitive about not having a boyfriend and is quick to anger or sadness when made fun of. She has taken a liking to her role as a teacher in education for her students, making sure they understand her lessons and helping them whenever they're in a bind and is appreciated for it. Rossweisse has little tolerance for those who behave unprofessionally, especially for lewd acts at inappropriate times. When she lectures them on standards, they usually retort with her simply being jealous. This may have some truth to it as on numerous occasions she has expressed interests in doing perverted things with her future boyfriend, she also desires her lover to be financially stable with a bright future.\n\nDespite her seriousness, she is stated to be clumsy and has a tendency to make rash decisions without informing anyone. She is highly susceptible to alcohol as one drink from it can leave her drunk and vomit for extended periods of time. Rossweisse has a lot of repressed baggage from upholding her uptight and modest demeanor which goes out the window when drunk and begins opening her true thoughts and frustrations. She also has a compulsion to buy things at sales when they're cheap, showing enthusiastic excitement whenever she goes to 100-Yen shops, causing Issei to dub her \"The 100-Yen Shop Valkyrie\". Rossweisse also has a tendency to speak using her country's accent when she is flustered.\n\nLike the other girls, Rossweisse acts like someone her age whenever she is on a date with Issei as she ended up acting shy when she was called cute. She soon develops romantic feelings for Issei in Volume 17 when he proclaimed to her that he will protect her from Euclid, which he did.\n\nAfter falling in love with Issei and becoming engaged to him, Rossweisse has started to partake in perverted activities she normally frowns upon, such as wanting him to apply suntan oil on her, sleeping with him while wearing revealing lingerie and fighting with the other girls over him.\n\nDemonic Power: As a Devil, Rossweisse has the power common to a Devil, which allows her to cast spells and special phenomena. However, instead of using demonic powers to cause different phenomena, she prefers to use calucations rather than using her imagination.\n\nImmense Magic Power: As Odin's former bodyguard, Rossweisse has considerable magic power enough to be recognized for her position. In Vol 11, Azazel noted her powers equals that of a High-Class Devil despite her not being a Bishop. In Vol 25, even the Strongest Valkyrie, Brynhildr has recognized that even without Mistilteinn, her magic power already surpassed hers.\n\nEnhanced Strength: As a Valkyrie, she has higher physical abilities than a normal person, which was raised after being reincarnated into a Rook.\n\nEnhanced Durability: Rossweisse has enhanced defenses befitting her status as a Rook.\n\nMaster Magician: Rossweisse is a genius in Norse Magic. Despite lacking talent in her house's Seiz-Style Spirit Magic, she realized she was talented in others, such as Rune-style, Gondol-style, offensive magic, and those not used in their house, exceeding Rias and Akeno. She could teach others as she taught Asia about basic summoning magic, and other kinds. Rossweisse uses a high-level, intricate and self-invented magic circle, strengthening her spell's offense and defense, while restraining magic power to the bare minimum.

          "content": "Age 16 Ravel Phenex is one of the many female protagonists of High School DxD. She is the only daughter and youngest child of Lord Phenex and Lady Phenex, and the younger sister of Ruval Phenex, an unnamed older brother and Riser Phenex. She is a second-year high school student at Kuoh Academy and a former member of Riser's peerage. Like her older brothers, she has inherited the powers of the Phoenix and possesses the power of fire, wind, and immortality. Upon Riser's defeat, she is traded to her mother, Lady Phenex before being traded to Issei Hyoudou, becoming his servant and second Bishop. Ravel is a beautiful young girl with dark blue eyes. She has long blonde hair tied into twintails with large, drill-like curls and blue ribbons keeping them in place. The front of her hair has several bangs hanging over her forehead, with a V-shaped fringe hanging over the bridge of her nose. Ravel's body measurements are [B85-W59-H84 cm] (B33-W23-H33 in); height is 153 cm (5 feet 0 inches) and body weight is [47 kg].\n\nHer initial outfit consisted of a light purple dress with dark purple accents and a blue bow at the front. At the back, three feather-like extensions mimicking a bird's tail protrude from the dress, which, when combined with her wings of fire, give her a bird-like appearance. Upon transferring to Kuoh Academy, she wears the Kuoh Academy girls' uniform, with the addition of a black sweater over her dress shirt.\n\nAfter joining Issei's peerage, during Rating Games, she wears a uniform that consists of a red button top with a white tie, a red skirt as well as a purple cape along with a blue satchel on her waist.\n\nIn the anime, Ravel wears a long, pink dress with white frills and a magenta bow in the front. At her brother's engagement party, she wears a purple dress with matching gloves and black boots and holds a pink folding fan.\nPersonality\n\nRavel is first shown to be spoiled, arrogant and snobbish during her debut, but she is later revealed to be a well-mannered, modest, elegant, and polite young girl, but shown to be initially harsh towards those whom she dislikes. She's very loyal to her older brother, as she is seen diligently obeying his authority. She strongly believes that her brother is so powerful, no one could ever possibly defeat him. However, after witnessing his crushing defeat at the hands of Issei Hyoudou, she becomes attracted to him and later falls in love with him as the series progresses, albeit in a tsundere manner. Despite her young age, she's very intelligent, mature and perceptive, being able to understand the atmosphere of any situation as well as surmise Issei's thoughts just by simply looking at him. She is also shown to be a gifted strategist, serving as Issei's main strategist and second in command of his peerage. In this position, Ravel appears to be quite strict as she has her own expectations and standards when it comes to the suitability of someone to serve under Issei, such as when she denied Kuroka's offer to make Le Fay Pendragon Issei's contracted magician due to the latter's affiliation with the Khaos Brigade or when she was initially against letting Elmenhilde Karnstein join Issei's team.\n\nRavel has also shown a ruthless side, being relentless in securing victory for her team. This is seen when she consistently read out the manga about Issei and Kiba to Tsubaki Shinra, despite the latter's obvious discomfort and pleas to stop. However, Ravel is also shown to be quite fragile hearted as seen when she cried when she believed she failed Issei after their defeat against Dulio's team in the Azazel Cup. Immortality: As a member of the Phenex Clan, Ravel shares her families' signature regeneration abilities, being able to regenerate lost limbs and recover from wounds instantly as demonstrated in Volume 25, when she regenerated from the damage inflicted by the Valkyrie Squad. However, since their immortality is fueled by Ravel's demonic power and affected by her mental state, if her body would be destroyed multiple times or her demonic power ran out, she wouldn't be able to regenerate.\nHell Fire: As a member of the Phenex Clan, Ravel can create and control powerful flames noted to be strong enough to burn Scale Mail armor. She is shown to be capable of blowing half of her brother's head away with a single attack.[1]\nDefense: Ravel is able to create a shield of demonic power to protect herself or the people around her.\nClothing Manipulation: Ravel is shown to be able to alter her whole attire into a different one, most notably when she changed from one piece dress into safari jacket and shorts.\nSkilled Hand to Hand Combatant: Ravel has learned to fight in close quarters combat after becoming Issei's servant, being able to hold her own against Koneko Toujou, a Rook who specializes in close-quarters combat.\n\nGenius Intellect"

Recent studies have estimated that there are more than 10 million people who are MAPs spread evenly around the world, and the graphs indicate that this will increase even more over the years.\n\n[MAP is a very broad sexual orientation, with several types of paraphilia, including]:\n\n• [Nepiophilia]: attraction to babies and toddlers.

These ships were filled with exiled humans from Earth, all of whom were male. Through technological ingenuity and sheer human will, these exiles established several artificial oases on Canaan, stubbornly clinging to survival. To perpetuate their race, some were cruelly enslaved and transformed into “femboys.”\nOver time, the descendants of these exiles began to truly adapt to the planet. They ceased to yearn for Earth, forgot how to conduct interstellar travel, and their society regressed technologically and culturally. Several feudal regimes now ruled the various oases, vying for scarce resources."

Their Y chromosomes were altered into “mini X chromosomes,” enabling them to reproduce with normal males and produce either male or femboy offspring.\nFemboys possess physical capabilities far inferior to ordinary males, yet they often exhibit slender or curvaceous, sensual physiques alongside beauty surpassing that of women. Their small male breasts can produce milk, while their male genitalia have degenerated into sensitive, clitoris-like appendages. Their uterus connects to the rectum, enabling conception through anal intercourse.\nIn most Canaanite regimes, femboys are treated as slaves or even livestock, considered property of “true males.”\nCattleboys represent a further modified category of femboys. They possess physiques nearly indistinguishable from women's, featuring enormous breasts capable of producing vast quantities of high-quality milk. However, the immense energy demands of their mammary glands often result in stunted brain development, rendering them more obtuse and relegating them to lower social standing."

This ancient machine continuously yields steel and geothermal energy, enabling the city to arm itself, distill salt from seawater, and enjoy free hot springs. The worship of the Smith God gave rise to a cult of technology. The New Carthaginians believed machinery, as sacred creations of the Lionsmith, possessed a form of spirituality. They revered machines and offered them anointing oil, yet this very devotion hindered research into the technology of their ancestors.\nMoreover, its strategic location grants New Carthage control over the continent's trade hub.

          "content": "The world of Eques is a boundless, living tapestry, woven from threads of magic, mystery, and the indomitable spirit of its inhabitants. It is a realm where the supernatural is as intrinsic as the air, where ancient forces hum beneath the earth and shimmer in the skies, and where every horizon holds the promise of wonder or peril. Known as Eques, this world is defined by its dominant inhabitants—equine beings of myriad forms, from the lithe, star-flecked celestials that gallop across moonlit plains to the sturdy, horned chargers that guard sacred valleys. Their societies are rich with tradition, their cultures shaped by the land’s rhythms and the magic that courses through it. Yet, Eques is far more than its equine denizens. It is home to countless other beings: spectral wisps that weave through misty groves, draconic entities whose scales pulse with arcane energy, sentient vines that whisper prophecies in forgotten tongues, and aquatic creatures that glide through oceans glowing with bioluminescent tides.\n\nMagic is the heartbeat of Eques, an ever-present force that manifests in myriad ways. In the Crystaline Highlands, sorcerers channel raw arcane currents into spells that bend light and time. In the Verdant Expanse, shamans commune with spirits bound to ancient trees, drawing power from rituals older than memory. Elsewhere, magic is wild and untamed, erupting as geysers of flame or rivers that flow upward into the sky. Supernatural phenomena dot the landscape: mirror-like lakes that reflect futures yet to come, mountains that sing with the voices of long-dead titans, and caverns where shadows move with intent. These forces are both revered and feared, for while magic can heal or create, it can also twist flesh and fracture minds, spawning cursed zones where reality unravels into chaos.\n\nThe technological landscape of Eques is a study in contrasts, shaped by the interplay of magic and ingenuity. In the gleaming city of Auralis, towering spires of crystal and steel hum with energy drawn from leyline conduits. Airships drift above bustling markets, their engines powered by enchanted cores, while automatons crafted from living metal serve as laborers, guards, or companions. In contrast, the nomadic tribes of the Ashen Wastes shun such advancements, relying on fire-forged blades and oral histories passed down through generations. Between these extremes lie countless variations: coastal trade hubs where merchants barter spell-wrought artifacts alongside mechanical contraptions, or reclusive enclaves where technology is forbidden, viewed as a blasphemy against the natural order. These disparities fuel both cooperation and conflict, as societies trade resources or vie for dominance over the world’s mystical and material wealth.\n\nEques’ geography is as diverse as its people. The Crystaline Highlands rise like jagged prisms, their peaks wreathed in storms of raw magic, home to reclusive sages who guard secrets carved into the earth’s core. The Verdant Expanse, a sprawling jungle, pulses with bioluminescent life, its dense canopy hiding ruins of a civilization lost to time. The Ashen Wastes stretch across scorched plains, where volcanic rifts birth creatures of fire and stone, and nomadic clans navigate by the light of eternal embers. The Azure Depths, a vast ocean, harbors coral cities where equine merfolk weave spells from the tides. The Starlit Savanna, kissed by celestial light, is roamed by nomadic herds who follow the constellations, believing them to be the trails of their ancestors. Each region shapes its inhabitants, their cultures reflecting the land’s beauty and dangers.\n\nThe history of Eques is a saga of triumphs, betrayals, and cycles of renewal. Long ago, the Great Convergence—a cataclysmic event when the world’s leylines surged—reshaped the continents, birthing new species and burying ancient empires. Artifacts from that era, known as the Shards of Dawn, are said to hold fragments of the world’s primal magic, capable of reshaping reality itself. These relics are scattered across Eques, hidden in ruins or guarded by enigmatic entities, drawing adventurers, scholars, and tyrants to seek their power. One such tale speaks of Eryndor, a celestial steed who united warring tribes to defeat a shadow-born titan that threatened to consume the sun. Her sacrifice is commemorated in the Festival of Dawn, where lanterns are released into the sky, their light believed to guide her spirit home.\n\nToday, Eques teeters on the edge of another turning point. Prophecies whispered in oracle groves foretell a Second Convergence, when the forces of magic, nature, and technology will collide, either forging a new era or plunging the world into chaos. Across the continents, factions prepare: the Arcane Conclave seeks to control the leylines, believing stability lies in their mastery; the Emberkin of the Ashen Wastes hoard ancient relics, fearing their misuse; and the Starweavers of the Savanna call for unity, guided by celestial omens. Smaller tales echo through the world—Lirien, a young mystic from the Verdant Expanse, who dreams of a shadowed figure stealing the stars; or Torren, a blacksmith from Auralis, who discovers a Shard of Dawn in his forge, unaware of its power.\n\nEques is a world of stories, where every being carries a spark of the extraordinary. From the bustling markets of Auralis, where merchants hawk enchanted silks and mechanical marvels, to the silent ruins of the Verdant Expanse, where vines whisper of lost kings, every corner holds a tale. Festivals celebrate the cycles of the moons, with equine dancers weaving spells through hoofbeats. Ancient spirits linger in sacred groves, offering wisdom or curses to those who seek them. Adventurers brave cursed wastelands to unearth relics, while scholars in crystal towers debate the ethics of merging magic with machine. Eques is alive, its pulse felt in the gallop of hooves, the hum of leylines, and the whispers of a world that never rests."

          ],
          "content": "Equestria\nEquestria, the largest continent on the planet Eques, stands as a monumental testament to time, its ancient roots stretching back millions of years as one of the oldest landmasses to grace the world. Its sprawling expanse is a living chronicle, etched with the scars of cataclysms and the triumphs of harmony, where magic hums in the air, the earth, and the hearts of its inhabitants. This vast continent is a crucible of life, home to countless magical creatures—equine beings of radiant grace, spectral entities that flicker in the twilight, and enigmatic beasts born from the raw essence of the world’s arcane currents. Its landscapes are as varied as its denizens, from shimmering crystal valleys to shadowed forests that whisper ancient secrets, each region pulsing with supernatural phenomena that defy mortal understanding.\n\nThe history of Equestria is a tapestry woven with threads of tragedy, resilience, and renewal. In its primordial dawn, the continent was a wild, untamed realm where raw magic surged unchecked, birthing titanic creatures and shaping the land through eruptions of arcane energy. The First Epoch, known as the Age of Dawn, saw the rise of the Prime Ancients—colossal equine entities said to have been forged by the world’s core. These beings, revered as near-deities, sculpted the mountains and rivers, their hoofprints carving valleys still sacred today. Yet, their era ended in the Great Fracture, a cataclysm when the leylines of Eques convulsed, sundering the continent and sinking entire regions beneath waves of molten stone or endless seas. Relics of this time, the Shards of Dawn, remain hidden in Equestria’s depths, their power sought by those brave or foolish enough to seek them.\n\nThe Second Epoch, the Age of Clans, marked the rise of equine societies. Tribes of celestial steeds, horned mystics, and winged sky-dancers forged distinct cultures, each shaped by the land they claimed. The Starlit Savanna birthed nomadic herds who followed celestial omens, while the Crystaline Highlands fostered reclusive sages who wove spells from gemlight. Conflict was inevitable, as clans vied for control of sacred sites or magical resources. The War of the Crested Flame, a centuries-long struggle between the Emberkin of the Ashen Wastes and the Skyweavers of the Azure Peaks, scorched entire regions, leaving behind the haunted Cinderfields, where embers still glow with restless spirits. Yet, this era also saw the First Accord, a fragile peace brokered by the mystic Eryndor, a celestial mare whose light-bound hooves united warring tribes to defeat the Shadow Titan, a malevolent entity that sought to devour the sun. Her sacrifice is commemorated in the Festival of Dawn, where lanterns rise into the night, their glow a beacon of hope.\n\nThe Third Epoch, the Age of Convergence, brought Equestria into an era of growth and discovery. Cities rose from the ashes of ancient battlegrounds, their spires blending magic and ingenuity. Auralis, the continent’s heart, became a beacon of progress, its crystal towers humming with leyline energy and its streets alive with trade in enchanted silks and mechanical wonders. The Verdant Expanse, once a battleground, flourished as a sanctuary for scholars and shamans, its ruins yielding secrets of lost eras. Technology flourished unevenly—while Auralis boasted airships and automatons, remote villages in the Frostveil Mountains clung to ancient crafts, their forges lit by fire magic. This era was not without strife; the Schism of the Leylines, when overzealous mystics tapped too deeply into Equestria’s arcane veins, unleashed the Blightstorm, a roiling tempest of corrupted magic that twisted forests and creatures alike. The scars of this disaster linger in the Wraithwood, where trees weep shadow and whispers drive travelers mad.\n\nToday, Equestria stands as a continent of resilience, its history a cycle of destruction and rebirth. The Fourth Epoch, the Age of Balance, is marked by uneasy harmony. The Arcane Conclave, a council of mystics and scholars, governs the flow of magic from Auralis, seeking to prevent another Blightstorm. The Emberkin, once warlike, now guard the Cinderfields, their fire-wrought blades sworn to protect sacred relics. The Starweavers, guided by celestial prophecies, preach unity, warning of a Second Convergence foretold to reshape Equestria’s fate. Smaller stories echo across the land: Lirien, a young mystic from the Verdant Expanse, dreams of a shadowed figure stealing the stars, her visions unsettling the Conclave. Torren, a blacksmith of Auralis, uncovers a Shard of Dawn in his forge, its power drawing both allies and enemies. In the Azure Depths, merfolk whisper of a rising tide that could drown the coast, while in the Frostveil Mountains, a lone wanderer seeks the fabled Crown of Winter, said to command the eternal snows.\n\nEquestria’s landscapes are as storied as its people. The Crystaline Highlands glitter with gem-encrusted cliffs, their caverns home to oracles who read the future in prismatic light. The Verdant Expanse teems with bioluminescent life, its jungles hiding temples where vines guard ancient tomes. The Ashen Wastes, scarred by volcanic rifts, are roamed by fire-born clans who navigate by the light of eternal embers. The Starlit Savanna shimmers under celestial skies, its grasses swaying to songs only the nomads hear. The Azure Depths, a vast coastal region, harbors coral cities and sunken ruins where equine merfolk weave spells from the tides. Each region is alive with magic, from glowing auroras that speak in riddles to cursed mires where time loops endlessly.\n\nThe continent’s creatures are as diverse as its lands. Celestial steeds, their manes trailing starlight, gallop across the Savanna, revered as messengers of the cosmos. Horned chargers, their hides etched with runes, guard sacred groves, their magic tied to the earth. Winged sky-dancers soar above the Azure Peaks, their feathers channeling wind magic. Beyond the equine, spectral wisps guide travelers or lead them astray, while draconic beasts slumber in volcanic lairs, their awakening tied to Equestria’s fate. Sentient flora, like the Whispering Vines of the Expanse, guard ancient knowledge, and aquatic entities in the Depths sing songs that calm or summon storms. Even the smallest creatures, like the embermice of the Wastes, carry sparks of magic, their glow lighting the paths of wanderers.\n\nEquestria’s culture is a mosaic of tradition and innovation. Festivals mark the cycles of the moons, with equine dancers weaving spells through hoofbeats in the Starlit Savanna. In Auralis, markets bustle with trade in spell-forged artifacts, mechanical marvels, and exotic herbs from distant lands. The Frostveil Mountains host the Winter Rite, where clans offer tributes to the spirits of ice to ensure mild seasons. Sacred groves across the continent are tended by shamans who commune with ancestral spirits, their guidance shaping clan decisions. Yet, tensions simmer—some seek to harness Equestria’s magic for progress, building machines that rival spells, while others fear this risks angering the land’s ancient guardians.\n\nEquestria endures, its heart beating with the stories of its people. From the lantern-lit skies of the Festival of Dawn to the shadowed ruins of forgotten empires, every corner holds a tale. Adventurers brave cursed wastelands for relics, mystics seek visions in starlight, and ordinary folk carve lives from the land’s bounty. The continent is a paradox—a place of peace haunted by the echoes of war, of progress shadowed by ancient warnings, and of unity tested by the promise of a coming storm. As the Second Convergence looms, Equestria’s fate rests in the hooves, claws, and hands of those who call it home, their choices destined to shape the next chapter of its eternal saga."

            "Grogar's reign of tyranny",
            "Grogar's Era"
          ],
          "content": "Grogar's Era\nIn the shadowed annals of Equestria’s vast history, the period known as Grogar’s Reign of Tyranny stands as a dark epoch, a time when fear and discord choked the continent’s heart. Roughly 3000 years ago, Grogar, a towering ram with a coat of deep, storm-blue and eyes that burned with malevolent cunning, ruled Equestria with an iron hoof. His presence was a blight upon the land, his power unmatched and his ambition boundless. Grogar’s tyranny was not merely a reign of force but a calculated orchestration of chaos, exploiting the fractures of a continent already torn by division. The equine tribes—those of the earth, the skies, and the arcane—were locked in bitter rivalries, their distrust of one another blinding them to the true threat of their oppressor. This era, steeped in strife and shadow, would ultimately give rise to heroes whose defiance reshaped Equestria’s destiny.\n\nGrogar’s dominion was born from his mastery of dark magic, a force he wielded with terrifying precision. Unlike the natural magic that flowed through Equestria’s leylines, Grogar’s power was corruptive, drawn from forbidden rituals and ancient artifacts he unearthed from the continent’s deepest ruins. His signature creation, the Bell of Domination, was said to siphon the essence of the land itself, bending both creatures and elements to his will. With this artifact, he summoned monstrous beasts—hulking chimeras, shadow-wrought specters, and golems of twisted stone—to enforce his rule. His stronghold, the Obsidian Citadel, loomed in the heart of the Ashen Wastes, its spires carved from blackened rock and wreathed in storms that never ceased. From there, Grogar’s influence spread like a plague, taxing villages to ruin, enslaving entire clans, and sowing fear that kept the tribes divided.\n\nThe equine tribes, though vibrant in their own right, were their own worst enemies during this era. The earth-dwellers, hardy and tied to the land, hoarded resources in their fortified hamlets, distrusting the sky-dancers who soared above, wielding wind and storm. The arcane wielders, proud and secretive, retreated to their crystal spires, believing their magic superior to all. Their petty conflicts—over territory, sacred sites, or ancient grudges—blinded them to Grogar’s growing power. Raids and skirmishes tore through the Verdant Expanse and Starlit Savanna, while the Frostveil Mountains became a battleground for rival clans. Grogar exploited this disunity, sending his agents to stoke tensions, spreading lies of betrayal, and ensuring no tribe dared unite against him. His rule thrived on their chaos, his laughter echoing in the cries of the oppressed.\n\nLife under Grogar was a grim struggle. Villages paid tributes of crops, artifacts, or even their own kin to appease his enforcers. Those who resisted faced his wrath—entire settlements reduced to ash by his summoned beasts or cursed with plagues that withered flesh and spirit. The Crystaline Highlands, once a beacon of arcane study, fell silent as Grogar’s forces plundered its libraries, stealing tomes of ancient magic. The Azure Depths saw their coral cities raided, their merfolk pressed into servitude to harvest rare pearls for Grogar’s rituals. Even the spirits of the land suffered, their sacred groves defiled, their voices silenced by the ram’s dark enchantments. Yet, whispers of resistance persisted, carried by bards and wanderers who spoke of a time before tyranny, when Equestria’s tribes lived in tentative peace.\n\nHope emerged in the form of Gutsy the Great, a unicorn of unparalleled power whose name would become legend. Born in a small village on the edge of the Starlit Savanna, Gutsy was gifted with wind-based magic of extraordinary potency, capable of summoning gales that could shatter stone or calm tempests with a whisper. His spirit was as fierce as his magic, driven by an unyielding belief in unity and justice. Gutsy’s early years were marked by small acts of defiance—freeing enslaved villagers, disrupting Grogar’s tribute caravans, and rallying scattered clans with tales of a better future. His charisma and courage drew others to his cause, including the Pillars of Old Equestria, a group of six heroes from across the tribes, each embodying a virtue that would later define the continent’s ethos.\n\nThe Pillars were a diverse assembly: Stedfast, an earth-dweller whose strength could split mountains; Skydancer, a winged warrior whose mastery of the skies rivaled storms; Sagefire, an arcane mystic whose spells wove light into shields; Meadowbloom, a healer whose touch restored life to barren lands; Starwhisper, a seer who read the fates in the constellations; and Ironhoof, a blacksmith whose enchanted creations armed the rebellion. Together, they forged the Covenant of Harmony, a pact to unite the tribes against Grogar. Their efforts were fraught with peril, as Grogar’s spies lurked in every shadow, and the tribes’ deep-seated mistrust threatened to unravel their alliance. Gutsy’s wind magic became their rallying cry, his tempests scattering Grogar’s beasts and clearing paths for their guerrilla strikes.\n\nThe turning point came in the Battle of the Obsidian Vale, a desperate clash in the heart of the Ashen Wastes. Gutsy and the Pillars led a coalition of tribes—earth-dwellers wielding forged blades, sky-dancers raining lightning from above, and arcane wielders chanting spells of unity—against Grogar’s citadel. The battle raged for days, the land itself trembling as Grogar unleashed his full might: armies of shadow-beasts, storms of dark magic, and the Bell of Domination, which threatened to enslave the rebels’ very souls. Gutsy, wielding a gale that tore through the citadel’s defenses, faced Grogar alone atop its highest spire. The duel was cataclysmic, their magics clashing in a vortex that lit the skies. In a final act of sacrifice, Gutsy channeled all his power into a tempest that shattered the Bell, weakening Grogar enough for the Pillars to banish him into a realm of shadow, sealed by their combined virtues.\n\nGrogar’s fall marked the dawn of a new era. The tribes, inspired by the Covenant of Harmony, set aside their grudges to form the Equestrian Kingdom, a unified realm dedicated to balance and cooperation. The Obsidian Citadel was left to crumble, its ruins a warning of tyranny’s cost. The Pillars became legends, their virtues—strength, courage, wisdom, compassion, foresight, and resilience—enshrined in Equestria’s culture. Gutsy’s fate remains a mystery; some say he perished in the tempest, others that he ascended to guide the winds forever. His legacy endures in the Windspire, a towering monument in the Starlit Savanna, where breezes sing his name.\n\nThe scars of Grogar’s Era linger in Equestria’s soul. The Cinderfields, born from the Battle of the Obsidian Vale, still glow with restless embers. The Wraithwood, tainted by Grogar’s plagues, harbors twisted spirits. Yet, the era also birthed Equestria’s resilience, its people learning that unity could overcome even the darkest tyranny. Festivals honoring the Pillars fill the streets of Auralis, while bards sing of Gutsy’s gales. Whispers persist that Grogar’s banishment was not eternal, and that the Bell’s fragments, scattered across Equestria, could one day summon him back. For now, the Equestrian Kingdom thrives, its harmony a living testament to the heroes who defied a tyrant and forged a future from his ashes."

          "content": "Founding of Old Equestria\nIn the year 3853 B.B. (Before Banishment), the shadow of Grogar’s tyrannical reign over Equestria had been shattered, his dark magic banished through the heroic efforts of Gusty the Great and the Pillars of Old Equestria. The continent, scarred by centuries of oppression and division, stood at a crossroads. The three equine tribes—Unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth Ponies—had long been fractured, their rivalries fueled by mistrust and territorial disputes, exacerbated by Grogar’s manipulations. Yet, the triumph over the ram tyrant ignited a spark of hope, a chance for unity that had eluded Equestria for generations. It was in this fragile moment that three leaders emerged, chosen by their tribes to forge a new path: Princess Platinum of the Unicorns, Commander Hurricane of the Pegasi, and Chancellor Puddinghead of the Earth Ponies. Through their vision, courage, and unlikely camaraderie, the Kingdom of Equestria was born, marking the dawn of Old Equestria and a legacy that would endure for millennia.\n\nThe aftermath of Grogar’s defeat left Equestria in disarray. The Obsidian Citadel lay in ruins, its dark enchantments fading, but the land bore the wounds of war—scorched plains, cursed groves, and communities fractured by loss. The tribes, though united briefly in battle, reverted to their old suspicions. The Unicorns, proud wielders of arcane magic, retreated to their crystal spires in the Crystaline Highlands, valuing knowledge and tradition above all. The Pegasi, fierce and swift, held dominion over the skies from their cloud-forged strongholds in the Azure Peaks, their loyalty reserved for strength and valor. The Earth Ponies, resilient and tied to the soil, tilled the fertile fields of the Starlit Savanna and Verdant Expanse, distrusting the lofty ambitions of their counterparts. Without a common enemy, old grudges resurfaced, threatening to plunge Equestria back into chaos.\n\nThe turning point came in the Great Winter, a brutal season that swept across the continent in the years following Grogar’s banishment. Storms of unnatural ferocity—some whispered to be remnants of Grogar’s corrupted magic—ravaged crops, froze rivers, and isolated communities. Starvation loomed, and the tribes’ refusal to cooperate only deepened the crisis. It was during this time that the three leaders rose to prominence, each chosen for their ability to inspire and their willingness to seek a new way forward. Princess Platinum, a Unicorn of regal bearing and keen intellect, was crowned by her kin for her mastery of diplomacy and arcane lore. Her silver mane and crystalline crown became symbols of hope in the Highlands, her words weaving visions of a united future. Commander Hurricane, a grizzled Pegasus warrior with wings that could summon gales, was elected for his unyielding resolve and tactical brilliance, his storm-gray coat a testament to his battles against Grogar’s forces. Chancellor Puddinghead, an Earth Pony of boundless optimism and unconventional wisdom, was chosen for her ability to rally her people through humor and heart, her muddy hooves grounded in the struggles of the common folk.\n\nThe path to unity was fraught with challenges. Initial meetings between the tribes, held in the neutral grounds of the Starlit Savanna, were tense and marked by posturing. Platinum’s eloquent speeches on shared prosperity were met with Hurricane’s gruff demands for mutual defense, while Puddinghead’s earnest but eccentric proposals—such as a festival of shared harvests—drew skeptical glances. Yet, the Great Winter forced their hands. A particularly devastating blizzard trapped the leaders and their retinues in a cavern near the Crystal Mountains, where they faced a choice: perish in isolation or find common ground. It was here, in the flickering light of a shared fire, that the seeds of harmony were sown. Legend tells of Puddinghead’s absurd suggestion to “bake the storm away” with a communal feast, which sparked laughter and broke the tension. Platinum shared tales of ancient Unicorn prophecies foretelling unity, while Hurricane recounted Pegasus legends of a sky shared by all. Through days of debate, storytelling, and shared hardship, the three forged a bond that transcended tribal divides.\n\nThe Covenant of Harmony, formalized in 3853 B.B., was the result of their efforts. Signed in the shadow of the Crystal Mountains, it declared the founding of the Kingdom of Equestria, a unified realm stretching from the southern borders of the Verdant Expanse to the northern peaks of the Crystal Mountains, encompassing plains, forests, and rivers but no further, to respect the sacred wilds beyond. The covenant outlined principles of cooperation: the Unicorns would share their arcane knowledge to heal the land, the Pegasi would protect the skies and regulate the weather, and the Earth Ponies would cultivate the fields to feed all. Each tribe retained its autonomy but swore to uphold a shared council, the Triad, where Platinum, Hurricane, and Puddinghead would govern as equals, their decisions binding the tribes to a common destiny.\n\nThe founding of Old Equestria was not without struggle. The early years saw resistance from hardline factions—Unicorn mystics who feared diluting their magic, Pegasus warriors who scoffed at peace, and Earth Pony clans who distrusted outsiders. Skirmishes flared in the Frostveil Mountains, where rogue Pegasi raided Earth Pony caravans, and in the Crystaline Highlands, where Unicorn purists hoarded resources. The Triad’s leadership was tested, but their unity held. Platinum’s diplomacy quelled unrest with promises of shared arcane schools, Hurricane’s forces patrolled the borders to ensure safety, and Puddinghead’s festivals—wild affairs of song, dance, and feasts—brought communities together, fostering bonds over shared tables. The first Hearth’s Warming, a celebration born from the cavern meeting, became an annual tradition, its fires symbolizing the warmth of unity amidst the cold of division.\n\nThe Kingdom of Equestria flourished under the Triad’s guidance. Auralis, a new city at the continent’s heart, rose as a symbol of their vision, its spires blending Unicorn crystal, Pegasus cloudstone, and Earth Pony timber. The Starlit Savanna became a hub of trade, its markets buzzing with goods from all tribes. The Verdant Expanse, once scarred by war, bloomed anew as Earth Pony farmers worked with Unicorn enchantments to restore its fertility. The Azure Peaks, under Hurricane’s watchful eye, became a network of sky-stations, ensuring safe passage for travelers. The Crystal Mountains, a neutral territory, were declared a sacred preserve, their peaks home to oracles who guided the kingdom with visions. The Triad’s legacy was cemented in the Hall of Harmony, a grand structure in Auralis where their statues stand, hooves entwined, a testament to their pact.\n\nThe founding of Old Equestria reshaped the continent’s soul. The tribes, once divided, began to see themselves as Equestrians, their differences a strength rather than a weakness. The virtues of the Pillars—strength, courage, wisdom, compassion, foresight, and resilience—were woven into the kingdom’s ethos, guiding its laws and culture. Yet, whispers of the past lingered. The fragments of Grogar’s Bell of Domination, scattered in the war, were rumored to hold residual power, drawing treasure hunters and dark mystics. Prophecies spoke of a time when the tribes’ unity would be tested again, a Second Convergence that could either solidify Equestria’s harmony or unravel it. For now, the Kingdom of Equestria stood as a beacon of hope, its borders a promise of peace, its people bound by the vision of three leaders who dared to dream of a world united."

          "content": "Discord's Rule\nIn the year 3303 B.B. (Before Banishment), a mere fifty years after the founding of the Kingdom of Equestria, a shadow of chaos descended upon the fledgling realm. The unity forged by Princess Platinum, Commander Hurricane, and Chancellor Puddinghead, though resilient, was still tender, its bonds tested by lingering tribal tensions and the challenges of governing a vast continent. Into this delicate balance came Discord, a being unlike any Equestria had known—a towering, serpentine entity with a mismatched body of claw, hoof, wing, and horn, embodying chaos and disharmony in its purest form. With a snap of his talons, Discord seized control of Equestria, transforming the harmonious kingdom into an anarchistic wasteland for his own twisted amusement. His century-long reign, known as Discord’s Rule, plunged the continent into a surreal nightmare, until the rise of two alicorns, Celestia and Luna, brought an end to his tyranny, ushering in the era of the Two Princesses.\n\nDiscord’s arrival was a cataclysm of whimsy and terror. No one knew his origins—some whispered he was born from the fractured leylines of Grogar’s fall, others that he was an ancient spirit of chaos unleashed from a forgotten realm. Whatever his source, Discord’s power was unmatched, a chaotic magic that warped reality itself. With a grin and a flick of his claw, he turned Equestria into a playground of absurdity. Rivers flowed with chocolate syrup, clouds rained glowing embers, and fields twisted into mazes of shifting colors. The Starlit Savanna became a patchwork of floating islands, the Verdant Expanse grew trees that sang dissonant tunes, and the Crystaline Highlands shimmered with mirrors that reflected lies. Discord’s magic didn’t merely disrupt—it delighted in unraveling the very order of existence, turning harmony into a mockery.\n\nUnder Discord’s rule, Equestria’s people suffered in ways both cruel and bizarre. The equine tribes—Unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth Ponies—found their hard-won unity fraying as Discord sowed distrust with illusions and tricks. Villages were turned upside-down, their homes floating or melting into candy. Farmers toiled in fields where crops grew as stone or dissolved into bubbles. Pegasi struggled to navigate skies where gravity shifted at random, and Unicorns found their spells twisted into unpredictable bursts of chaos. Discord, enthroned in a floating citadel of mismatched stone and cloud, reveled in the despair, declaring himself the “Spirit of Chaos” and demanding worship through absurd tributes—statues of himself made from jelly, or dances performed backward under a moon that never set. Those who resisted were subjected to his cruelest pranks: minds clouded with confusion, bodies warped into grotesque forms, or loved ones turned against each other by his manipulative magic.\n\nThe Kingdom of Equestria, so recently founded, crumbled under this anarchistic wasteland. Auralis, the shining capital, became a labyrinth of shifting streets, its crystal spires drooping like wilted flowers. The Triad’s Hall of Harmony was defaced, its statues twisted into caricatures that mocked the tribes’ unity. Sacred sites, like the groves of the Verdant Expanse or the oracles of the Crystal Mountains, were desecrated, their spirits silenced or driven mad. Trade halted as merchants feared roads that looped endlessly or led to nowhere. The Hearth’s Warming festival, a symbol of unity, was perverted into a chaotic revelry where fires burned cold and songs turned to cacophony. Discord’s rule was not one of conquest but of gleeful destruction, his laughter echoing across a land where order was a distant memory.\n\nFor a century, Equestria endured this madness, its people clinging to fading hopes. Resistance was futile—Discord’s magic was too unpredictable, his awareness too vast. Small bands of rebels, inspired by tales of Gusty the Great, attempted to fight back, but their efforts were undone by Discord’s pranks: weapons turned to feathers, plans revealed by traitorous shadows. The tribes, once united, began to fracture again, each blaming the others for their plight. Yet, in the darkest hour, two figures emerged to challenge the chaos: Celestia and Luna, alicorns of radiant power, their origins shrouded in mystery. Some said they were born from the stars, others that they were chosen by the land itself to restore balance. Celestia, with a mane like dawn’s light and magic tied to the sun, embodied hope and resolve. Luna, her coat dark as the night and magic woven with the moon, wielded a quiet strength and unyielding will.\n\nCelestia and Luna’s arrival marked a turning point. They traveled Equestria, witnessing its suffering and rallying its people. In the Starlit Savanna, they inspired Earth Pony farmers to hold fast, their fields briefly blooming under Celestia’s warmth. In the Azure Peaks, Luna’s moonlight guided Pegasi through chaotic skies, restoring their courage. In the Crystaline Highlands, the sisters learned of the Elements of Harmony, ancient relics hidden in the Tree of Harmony, a mystical entity deep within the Verdant Expanse. These six artifacts—representing honesty, kindness, laughter, generosity, loyalty, and magic—were said to channel the virtues of the Pillars of Old Equestria. Guided by visions and the whispers of the land’s spirits, Celestia and Luna sought the Elements, braving Discord’s traps: labyrinths of mirrors, rivers of fire, and illusions that tested their bond.\n\nThe final confrontation, known as the Stand of Harmony, took place in 3203 B.B. near the heart of Equestria, where the Tree of Harmony stood. Discord, amused by the sisters’ defiance, met them in a warped landscape of floating mountains and upside-down forests. His magic twisted reality around them—skies bled into seas, time stuttered, and laughter turned to screams. Yet, Celestia and Luna stood united, their alicorn magic amplifying the Elements of Harmony. With a surge of radiant light, they unleashed the Elements’ power, a prismatic wave that countered Discord’s chaos. His laughter turned to rage as the Elements bound him, his form hardening into stone, his citadel crumbling into dust. The land itself sighed in relief as order began to return, rivers flowing true and skies clearing.\n\nDiscord’s defeat marked the end of his century-long reign and the beginning of the Era of the Two Princesses. Celestia and Luna, hailed as saviors, were crowned rulers of Equestria, their reign dedicated to restoring harmony. The Elements of Harmony were enshrined in Auralis, their power a safeguard against future threats. The tribes, inspired by the sisters’ unity, rebuilt their kingdom, repairing the scars of chaos. The Verdant Expanse bloomed anew, the Crystal Mountains regained their clarity, and the Starlit Savanna echoed with songs of renewal. The Hearth’s Warming festival was reborn, its fires burning brighter to honor the sisters’ victory.\n\nYet, Discord’s legacy lingered. His petrified form, placed in Auralis’s gardens as a warning, was said to whisper faintly, a reminder that chaos could never be fully banished. The land bore subtle marks of his rule—patches of earth where gravity flickered, or groves where laughter echoed unbidden. Prophecies warned that the Spirit of Chaos might one day break free, testing Equestria’s harmony anew. For now, the Kingdom of Equestria stood stronger, its people united under Celestia and Luna, their rule a beacon of light born from the ashes of an anarchistic wasteland, their story a testament to the power of harmony over even the wildest chaos."

          "content": "Princesses' Reign\nIn the year 2850 B.B. (Before Banishment), following their triumphant defeat of Discord, the alicorns Celestia and Luna ascended as co-rulers of Equestria, ushering in an era known as the Princesses’ Reign. The continent, still reeling from a century of Discord’s chaotic tyranny, was a fractured land of warped landscapes and shaken spirits. Rivers ran erratically, skies flickered with unnatural hues, and the equine tribes—Unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth Ponies—struggled to reclaim the unity forged at Equestria’s founding. Celestia, with her radiant mane flowing like dawn’s light, and Luna, cloaked in the deep hues of midnight, embodied hope and renewal. As co-rulers, they not only rebuilt Equestria into a thriving kingdom but also took on the sacred duty of guiding the sun and moon, their celestial magic restoring balance to the cycles of day and night. This era, marked by harmony, growth, and resilience, would shape Equestria into the beacon of unity known today.\n\nThe defeat of Discord in 3203 B.B. had left Equestria in disarray. His anarchistic wasteland had twisted the land’s natural order—fields grew thorns of glass, clouds rained syrup, and sacred groves whispered madness. The tribes, though united in their stand against Discord, faced the daunting task of rebuilding trust and infrastructure. Celestia and Luna, crowned in Auralis amid cheers and lantern-lit skies, vowed to restore harmony not just to the land but to its people’s hearts. Their alicorn nature—blending the strengths of all three tribes—made them symbols of unity, their wings, horns, and earthbound resolve bridging old divides. Their first act was to formalize their roles as stewards of the cosmos: Celestia, with her solar magic, raised the sun each dawn, bathing Equestria in warmth and clarity; Luna, with her lunar affinity, guided the moon and stars, weaving dreams and guarding the night. This celestial rhythm, once disrupted by Discord’s chaos, became a cornerstone of Equestria’s renewal, its people finding comfort in the predictable dance of day and night.\n\nRebuilding Equestria was a monumental endeavor. Auralis, the capital, was restored to its former glory, its crystal spires polished to reflect Celestia’s sunlight and Luna’s moonlight. The Hall of Harmony, defaced by Discord, was rebuilt, its statues of Platinum, Hurricane, and Puddinghead joined by new ones honoring the alicorns and the Elements of Harmony. The Verdant Expanse, scarred by chaotic growth, was healed through Earth Pony labor and Unicorn enchantments, guided by Celestia’s nurturing magic. The Starlit Savanna flourished as a trade hub, its markets bustling with goods from across the continent—enchanted silks, Pegasus-forged cloudsteel, and Earth Pony harvests. The Azure Peaks, once a maze of turbulent skies, were tamed by Pegasi under Luna’s guidance, their sky-stations ensuring safe passage. The Crystal Mountains, sacred and untouched, became a place of pilgrimage, their oracles offering visions to guide the princesses’ rule.\n\nThe Princesses’ Reign was defined by a commitment to harmony, inspired by the Elements of Harmony that defeated Discord. Celestia and Luna established the Council of Unity, a governing body where representatives from each tribe advised the princesses, ensuring no voice was silenced. They fostered education, founding arcane academies in the Crystaline Highlands where Unicorns taught spellcraft to all who sought it, breaking the old elitism. Pegasi trained in weather control, their efforts stabilizing seasons disrupted by Discord’s whims. Earth Ponies, with Luna’s encouragement, developed sustainable farming techniques, their fields feeding a growing population. The Hearth’s Warming festival, reborn from Discord’s mockery, became a grand celebration of unity, with Auralis hosting feasts where all tribes shared stories under Luna’s starry skies.\n\nYet, the era was not without challenges. Pockets of Discord’s chaos lingered—haunted glades where shadows danced, or rivers that flowed backward on moonless nights. Rogue factions, calling themselves Discordants, revered the Spirit of Chaos, attempting to revive his influence by unearthing artifacts like the shattered fragments of Grogar’s Bell of Domination. Celestia and Luna faced these threats with wisdom and strength, dispatching envoys to quell uprisings and purify cursed lands. The Wraithwood, a forest tainted by Discord’s magic, became a testing ground for their resolve, its twisted spirits pacified through Luna’s dreamwalking and Celestia’s cleansing light. Rumors of Discord’s stone prison stirring caused unease, prompting the princesses to place it under constant guard in Auralis’s gardens, its presence a reminder of chaos’s cost.\n\nThe princesses’ celestial duties elevated their legend. Celestia’s raising of the sun was a daily spectacle, her magic painting the dawn in hues of gold and rose, inspiring poets and artists. Luna’s stewardship of the moon and dreams was quieter but no less vital; she walked the dreamscapes of Equestria’s people, soothing fears and guarding against nightmares born of Discord’s lingering influence. Their bond as sisters strengthened their rule, their complementary powers—day and night, warmth and mystery—creating a balance that resonated across the land. Temples to the sun and moon rose in their honor, not as deities but as guardians, their altars adorned with offerings of flowers and starlight.\n\nCulturally, the Princesses’ Reign was a golden age. Auralis became a center of art and innovation, with bards composing epics of the alicorns’ victory and artisans crafting mosaics of the Elements of Harmony. The Verdant Expanse birthed a renaissance of storytelling, its shamans weaving tales of the sisters’ deeds into the vines. Pegasi sky-dancers performed aerial ballets during lunar festivals, their movements echoing Luna’s stars. Earth Pony villages hosted harvest fairs, their tables laden with bounty blessed by Celestia’s sun. The princesses themselves were approachable rulers, walking among their people, listening to grievances, and celebrating alongside them. Their reign fostered a sense of Equestrian identity, the tribes no longer seeing themselves as separate but as parts of a greater whole.\n\nThe era also saw the codification of Equestria’s values. The Elements of Harmony—honesty, kindness, laughter, generosity, loyalty, and magic—became guiding principles, taught in schools and celebrated in festivals. Celestia and Luna, as bearers of these virtues, embodied them in their rule: Celestia’s kindness in aiding the needy, Luna’s loyalty in protecting the vulnerable. The Tree of Harmony, hidden in the Verdant Expanse, was revered as a sacred site, its crystalline branches a symbol of Equestria’s resilience. Prophecies whispered of future challenges—a Second Convergence, or the return of ancient threats like Grogar or Discord—but under the princesses’ guidance, Equestria felt invincible.\n\nBy 2850 B.B., Equestria had transformed from a chaotic wasteland into a thriving kingdom. Its borders, from the southern Verdant Expanse to the Crystal Mountains, pulsed with life and harmony. Auralis shone as a beacon of unity, its streets alive with the laughter of foals and the songs of bards. The scars of Discord’s reign faded, though never fully vanished, a reminder of the fragility of peace. Celestia and Luna, their manes aglow with celestial light, stood as guardians of a new era, their rule a testament to the power of unity and the enduring strength of harmony. Yet, in the quiet of Luna’s nights, oracles spoke of shadows gathering, hinting that even the brightest reign could face trials yet to come."

          "content": "Crystal Empire's Founding\nThree thousand years ago, during the iron-hoofed grip of Grogar's tyrannical reign over Equestria, a beacon of hope flickered in the shadowed heart of a unicorn mare named Amore. Born amidst the fractured clans of the Crystaline Highlands, Amore was no ordinary soul; her magic pulsed with the gentle warmth of love, a rare and radiant force that blossomed from her compassion for the oppressed. As Grogar's enforcers ravaged villages, enslaving kin and twisting the land's magic into tools of fear, Amore witnessed the unbreakable spirit of her people dim under the weight of despair. Haunted by visions of a freer existence, where harmony could flourish without the shadow of domination, she made a fateful choice: to abandon the only home she knew and venture into the unforgiving unknown. Leaving behind family, friends, and the arcane spires that had cradled her youth, Amore fled northward, crossing the imposing barrier of the Crystal Mountains into a realm of perpetual frost and whispering winds.\n\nThe northern lands beyond the Crystal Mountains were a desolate expanse, a frozen tundra where the sun hung low and pale, casting long shadows over ice-encrusted plains and jagged glaciers. This harsh domain, untouched by Equestria's warmer climes, was steeped in ancient mysteries, its air thick with the chill of forgotten eras. Blizzards howled like vengeful spirits, and the ground cracked with the groans of shifting ice, revealing glimpses of crystalline veins that pulsed faintly with latent power. Few dared tread here; tales from wandering shamans spoke of a primal cold that seeped into the bones, sapping will and warmth alike. Yet, it was in this icy wilderness that Amore discovered the first threads of her destiny. Scattered refugees from Grogar's purges had begun to eke out existence in makeshift shelters, their numbers few but their resolve fierce. Amore, with her healing touch and stories of unity, became a natural rallying point, her love magic mending wounds and kindling fires that burned brighter than the tundra's gloom.\n\nAs Amore and her growing band of followers delved deeper into the frozen north, they encountered the land's darker inhabitants: the Umbrum, shadowy entities born from the abyss between light and void. These creatures were no mere beasts; they were twisted parodies of equine form, their bodies woven from writhing darkness, eyes like voids that hungered for warmth. The Umbrum prowled the ice caves and glacial fissures, preying on the unwary with illusions that twisted memories into nightmares and tendrils that drained life essence. Legends whispered among the refugees claimed the Umbrum were ancient guardians of the north's secrets, corrupted by eons of isolation, or perhaps remnants of a primordial chaos that Grogar's distant tyranny had unwittingly stirred. Whatever their origin, they embodied the tundra's cruelty, their presence a constant threat that tested the fragile hope Amore's group clung to. Clashes were inevitable; shadowy ambushes claimed lives, leaving behind frozen husks that served as grim warnings.\n\nIt was during one such perilous encounter, as Amore scouted a crystalline cavern for shelter, that fate intervened. Cornered by a pack of Umbrum, their forms coalescing like smoke in the dim glow of bioluminescent ice, Amore's heart raced with terror and defiance. As their tendrils lashed out, seeking to snuff her light, she unleashed her love magic in a desperate surge—a radiant burst of pink and gold that sought not destruction, but understanding. In that moment, her power resonated with an artifact half-buried in the cavern's heart: the Crystal Heart, a multifaceted gem of unparalleled purity, its facets refracting light into rainbows even in the gloom. Forged eons ago from the world's core magic, the Crystal Heart was a relic of balance, capable of amplifying emotions to shape reality itself. Amore's love, pure and unyielding, ignited a chain reaction within the Heart, its surface igniting in a cascade of prismatic energy.\n\nThe backlash was cataclysmic. A shockwave of harmonious light erupted from the Crystal Heart, sweeping through the cavern and beyond. The Umbrum shrieked as the shadows comprising their forms unraveled, their essence pulled inexorably downward into fissures that cracked open in the ice. Banished to the lightless depths beneath the frozen crust, they were sealed in a prison of eternal cold, their howls muffled by layers of unyielding glacier. The Heart's power did not stop there; it enveloped Amore, her body shimmering as crystalline facets bloomed across her coat, transforming her into the first Crystal Pony—a being of translucent beauty, her form refracting light into auras of warmth and resilience. The refugees, witnessing the miracle, felt the change ripple through them as well, their hides gaining a crystalline sheen that warded against the north's bite. Joy erupted in the cavern, songs of deliverance echoing off the walls, as the group realized they had been granted not just survival, but a new identity forged in love's fire.\n\nWith the Umbrum subdued and the Crystal Heart's protective aura enveloping the land, Amore led her people in the founding of the Crystal Empire. The city of Crystalis rose from the tundra like a jewel from the earth, its spires of living crystal catching the sparse sunlight in dazzling displays. Streets paved with shimmering facets wound between homes that hummed with latent magic, and communal hearths burned with eternal flames fueled by shared affection. Amore, though hailed as queen for her pivotal role, insisted on the title of Princess, viewing her leadership as one of guidance rather than dominion—a humble echo of the unity she sought to instill. Under her rule, the Crystal Ponies thrived; the Heart's magic sustained crops in heated greenhouses, warded off blizzards, and even purified the air of lingering shadows. The first Crystal Faire was held in celebration, a tradition of games, feasts, and light shows that channeled the Heart's power to renew the empire's spirit each year.\n\nAmore's reign was one of benevolence and foresight. She delved into the Crystal Caverns beneath Crystalis, unearthing relics and spells to safeguard her realm—enchanted barriers against northern beasts, tomes of empathetic magic, and hidden armories should threats arise. Her love-based sorcery wove protections into the empire's very foundations, ensuring that discord could find no foothold. Ties with the nascent Equestrian Kingdom were forged early; envoys crossed the Crystal Mountains to share knowledge, with Amore welcoming Princesses Celestia and Luna in grand ceremonies that blended solar warmth with crystalline gleam. Yet, whispers of the Umbrum's prison persisted, their sealed door hidden beneath the Crystal Castle a secret guarded by Amore's most trusted. She trained successors in the arts of harmony, emphasizing that true power lay in the collective heart of her ponies.\n\nThe Crystal Empire became a northern bastion of light, its crystalline glow visible for leagues across the tundra, a defiant sparkle against Grogar's distant shadow. Amore's transformation and the Heart's awakening marked not just a refuge, but a rebirth—a testament that even in tyranny's reach, love could carve empires from ice. Her legacy endured in the empire's flag, bearing her cutie mark of a crystal snowflake, and in the unbreakable bonds of its people. Though future shadows, like the rise of Sombra, would test this foundation, Amore's founding ensured the Crystal Empire's place as a jewel in Equestria's crown, its light a eternal reminder of compassion's triumph over darkness."

          "content": "Sombra's Reign and Banishment\nIn the shadowed annals of the Crystal Empire’s history, the reign of Sombra stands as a chilling testament to betrayal, corruption, and the enduring power of harmony. Sombra, an Umbrum born in the frozen wastelands beyond the Crystal Mountains, emerged as a figure of tragedy and terror. Found as a young colt, shivering and alone in the icy tundra with no memory of his origins, he could utter only a single word—“Sombra”—which became his name. Taken in by a compassionate orphanage within the radiant Crystal Empire, he grew up unaware of his true nature, a secret that would unravel with devastating consequences. His reign, marked by dark magic and tyranny, transformed the shining city of Crystalis into a realm of fear, only to be ended by the intervention of Celestia and Luna, whose light banished the shadow he cast.\n\nSombra’s early years were marked by a quiet struggle. In the Crystal Empire, a beacon of love and light under Princess Amore’s rule, he was an enigma—a colt with a dark coat and piercing eyes, his demeanor solemn beyond his years. The Crystal Ponies, their translucent forms sparkling with warmth, treated him with kindness, yet he felt an outsider’s ache, a sense of disconnection he could not name. Each year, during the Crystal Faire, when the Crystal Heart was brought forth to renew the empire’s protective magic, Sombra was struck by excruciating, mind-numbing pain. The Heart’s radiant love, amplified by the collective joy of the Crystal Ponies, clashed with his Umbrum nature—a heritage of shadow and discord sealed beneath the ice by Amore’s magic centuries prior. These episodes left him writhing, isolated, and haunted by questions no pony could answer, his suffering a mystery even to the orphanage’s caretakers.\n\nAs Sombra grew, so did his desperation. In his adolescence, unable to endure another Faire’s torment, he fled Crystalis, stumbling through the frozen wastes until he collapsed before a jagged black crystal jutting from the ice. This was no ordinary stone but an Umbrum crystal, a relic of the shadow-beings’ ancient power. Through its dark facets, an Umbrum spirit manifested, its voice a hiss of revelation. It told Sombra the truth: he was no pony, but an Umbrum, a creature of shadow crafted to sow discord, his pain a consequence of the Crystal Heart’s magic clashing with his essence. Most shattering, it claimed Princess Amore, the beloved ruler, had known his nature all along, concealing it to preserve her empire’s harmony. The revelation twisted Sombra’s heart, his sense of belonging shattered by what he perceived as betrayal. The Umbrum spirit urged him to embrace his heritage, promising power to overcome his pain and claim his rightful place.\n\nFueled by rage and hurt, Sombra returned to Crystalis, his once-timid demeanor replaced by a smoldering resolve. Confronting Princess Amore in the Crystal Castle, he demanded answers. Amore, her eyes heavy with sorrow, admitted she had sensed his Umbrum nature but believed love could nurture him beyond it, hoping to shield him from his kind’s dark legacy. Her words, meant to soothe, only inflamed Sombra’s sense of betrayal. In a fit of fury, he unleashed his latent Umbrum magic, a torrent of shadow and corruption drawn from the black crystal’s influence. The spell enveloped Amore, transforming her into a statue of black crystal, its surface cracked with veins of shadow. In a final act of rage, Sombra shattered the statue, scattering its fragments across the throne room. Though this did not kill Amore—her essence lingered, bound to the fragments by her love-based magic—it marked the fall of the Crystal Empire’s heart.\n\nWith Amore gone, Sombra seized control, declaring himself King. His reign, beginning around 3200 B.B. (Before Banishment), transformed Crystalis into a fortress of despair. The Crystal Heart, once a beacon of light, was hidden away, its power suppressed by Sombra’s dark enchantments. The city’s radiant spires dulled, cloaked in a miasma of fear that sapped the Crystal Ponies’ luster. Sombra’s Umbrum magic enslaved the populace, binding their minds with chains of shadow that forced them to mine black crystals from the northern wastes. These crystals fueled his power, erecting dark spires and summoning shadow-beasts to patrol the empire’s borders. The Crystal Faire was outlawed, replaced by decrees of obedience, and the northern tundra grew colder, as if mourning the loss of love’s warmth. Sombra ruled not for ambition but for vengeance, his heart twisted by the belief that harmony had betrayed him.\n\nSombra’s tyranny coincided with the chaos of Discord’s reign in greater Equestria, the two threats casting a dual shadow over the continent. While Discord warped the south into an anarchistic wasteland, Sombra’s Crystal Empire became a citadel of control, its order as oppressive as chaos. The Crystal Ponies, their spirits dulled, whispered of Amore’s return, clinging to legends of her unbreakable love. Resistance was futile; Sombra’s magic infiltrated minds, turning neighbors into spies and hope into despair. Yet, his isolation from Equestria’s heartland delayed his reckoning, as Celestia and Luna, newly crowned after Discord’s defeat in 3203 B.B., focused first on restoring their kingdom’s harmony.\n\nBy approximately 3100 B.B., as Equestria began to heal under the Princesses’ Reign, Celestia and Luna turned their gaze north. Reports of the Crystal Empire’s plight—its dulled crystals, enslaved ponies, and spreading darkness—reached Auralis, carried by refugees who braved the Crystal Mountains. The alicorns, wielding the Elements of Harmony, journeyed to Crystalis, their arrival a blaze of light against Sombra’s shadow. The confrontation, known as the Battle of the Crystal Spire, was a clash of cosmic forces. Sombra, enthroned in the Crystal Castle, unleashed his arsenal: shadow-beasts, black crystal traps, and spells that twisted light into despair. Celestia countered with solar radiance, burning away his illusions, while Luna’s lunar magic pierced his mental chains, freeing ponies to rise against him.\n\nThe battle’s climax centered on the Crystal Heart, which Sombra had hidden beneath the castle, its light nearly extinguished. Sensing its power, Celestia and Luna channeled the Elements of Harmony, their prismatic energy reigniting the Heart. The resulting surge enveloped Sombra, his Umbrum form unraveling as he roared defiance. In a desperate act, he wove a curse, binding himself to the empire: if he fell, so would Crystalis. The Elements’ power overwhelmed him, transforming him into a shadow and banishing him to the icy depths beneath the tundra, his essence sealed in a prison of frost. The Crystal Empire, caught in his curse, vanished from the physical plane, its spires fading into a liminal void, its people preserved in stasis.\n\nThe banishment of Sombra marked a bittersweet victory. Celestia and Luna mourned the empire’s loss, vowing to protect its legacy. The Crystal Heart, entrusted to their care, was hidden in Auralis, its light a promise of the empire’s return. The fragments of Amore’s statue, scattered but not destroyed, were gathered by loyalists and secreted away, their locations known only to a few. Sombra’s reign left scars—tales of his shadow lingered in the Crystal Mountains, and the tundra grew colder, as if his curse lingered. Yet, his defeat reinforced Equestria’s commitment to harmony, the Crystal Empire’s fate a reminder of the cost of betrayal and the power of unity. Celestia and Luna, their reign strengthened, carried forward, their hearts heavy with the hope that one day, the empire’s light would shine again."

          ],
          "content": "Crystal Empire's Rebirth\nAfter a thousand years cloaked in the shadow of King Sombra’s curse, the Crystal Empire reemerged from its ethereal limbo, its crystalline spires piercing the frozen tundra north of the Crystal Mountains once more. The curse, woven by Sombra during his banishment by Celestia and Luna around 3100 B.B. (Before Banishment), had tethered the empire to a liminal void, its people and city frozen in time, hidden from the world. As the millennium mark passed, the curse’s grip weakened, and the empire flickered back into reality, its return heralded by a shimmer of prismatic light across the northern skies. Yet, with its rebirth came the stirring of Sombra’s shadow, threatening to reclaim the empire. It was Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, known as Cadance, a distant descendant of the legendary Princess Amore, who rose to restore the Crystal Empire’s light. Alongside her husband, Shining Armor, and through a perilous quest for the Crystal Heart, Cadance vanquished Sombra’s lingering darkness, cementing her place as the Princess of Love and co-ruler of a reborn empire. Their reign, marked by the birth of Flurry Heart, the first alicorn born in Equestria’s history, heralded a new era of hope and radiance for the Crystal Empire.\n\nThe empire’s return was a spectacle of magic and mystery. As Sombra’s curse dissolved, Crystalis materialized in the tundra, its crystal spires gleaming under a pale sun, though dulled by centuries of absence. The Crystal Ponies, freed from stasis, awoke bewildered, their memories clouded by Sombra’s tyranny and the faint echo of Amore’s love. The city’s protective aura, once sustained by the Crystal Heart, was faltering, leaving it vulnerable to the creeping cold and the resurgence of Sombra’s shadow. The Umbrum’s dark essence, sealed beneath the ice, stirred as Sombra’s spectral form began to coalesce, his red-horned silhouette haunting the city’s edges. The Crystal Ponies, their translucent coats dim, whispered of their lost princess and the Heart’s fading power, their hope teetering on despair.\n\nCadance, a young alicorn raised under Celestia’s tutelage in Auralis, felt a pull toward the north. Her lineage, tracing back to Princess Amore through distant Unicorn ancestry, imbued her with love-based magic akin to her forebear’s, a gentle yet potent force that resonated with harmony. Accompanied by Shining Armor, a stalwart Unicorn captain of Equestria’s royal guard and her newlywed husband, Cadance journeyed to the Crystal Mountains, guided by visions of a radiant gem and a city in peril. Their arrival in Crystalis revealed a city under siege: Sombra’s shadow had infiltrated the castle, his dark crystals sprouting like thorns, and his hypnotic magic sapping the ponies’ will. The Crystal Heart, hidden by Sombra during his reign, was nowhere to be found, its absence leaving the empire defenseless against his creeping influence.\n\nCadance’s quest for the Crystal Heart was a trial of courage and love. With Shining Armor’s protective spells shielding Crystalis from Sombra’s advancing darkness, Cadance delved into the city’s underbelly, navigating labyrinthine caverns beneath the Crystal Castle. These icy depths, once a prison for the Umbrum, pulsed with Sombra’s residual magic—traps of black crystal, illusions of despair, and whispers that sought to break her resolve. Guided by fragments of Amore’s essence, preserved in the scattered shards of her statue, Cadance pieced together clues to the Heart’s location. In a hidden chamber, guarded by a spectral Umbrum conjured from Sombra’s will, she found the Crystal Heart, its facets dim but alive with latent power. As Sombra’s shadow closed in, Cadance channeled her love magic, her heart entwined with Shining Armor’s steadfast devotion and the faint memories of the Crystal Ponies’ hope. The Heart blazed to life, its prismatic light banishing the Umbrum specter and weakening Sombra’s grip.\n\nThe final confrontation unfolded in the heart of Crystalis. Sombra, his form a roiling mass of shadow and malice, sought to reclaim the throne, his dark crystals encasing the castle. Cadance and Shining Armor rallied the Crystal Ponies, urging them to channel their collective love and joy into the Crystal Heart, as they had in Amore’s time. The Crystal Faire, long dormant, was revived in a desperate bid to unite the city’s spirit. As the ponies sang and celebrated, their emotions reignited the Heart, its light amplified by Cadance’s magic and Shining Armor’s protective barrier. The resulting surge engulfed Sombra, his shadow form disintegrating under the overwhelming force of harmony. Unlike his first banishment, this defeat was final—his essence shattered, scattered to the winds, leaving the empire free at last.\n\nWith Sombra vanquished, Cadance and Shining Armor were crowned co-rulers of the Crystal Empire, their reign a continuation of Amore’s legacy. Cadance, dubbed the Princess of Love, restored the Crystal Faire as a cornerstone of the empire’s culture, its annual celebration renewing the Heart’s protective aura. Crystalis bloomed anew, its spires sparkling brighter than ever, its streets alive with laughter and light. Shining Armor, with his military acumen, fortified the city’s defenses, training Crystal Pony guards to protect against northern threats. Together, they rebuilt ties with Equestria, hosting Celestia and Luna in grand ceremonies that linked the empire to the kingdom’s heart. The Crystal Heart was enshrined in the castle’s plaza, its light a beacon of love that warmed the tundra and kept the Umbrum’s prison secure.\n\nThe rebirth of the Crystal Empire was crowned by a historic event: the birth of Flurry Heart, the first alicorn born in Equestria’s long history. Unlike Celestia, Luna, or Cadance, who ascended or were born under mysterious circumstances, Flurry Heart entered the world as a true alicorn, her tiny wings and horn sparkling with innate magic. Her birth, celebrated across Equestria and the Crystal Empire, was seen as a sign of harmony’s triumph, her crystalline coat a living symbol of the empire’s resilience. Cadance and Shining Armor, as doting parents, nurtured her potential, aware that her unprecedented power—evident in early bursts of magic that shook the castle—heralded a new chapter for the empire.\n\nThe Crystal Empire’s rebirth transformed it into a northern jewel, its light a counterpoint to Equestria’s southern warmth. Crystalis became a hub of culture and magic, its libraries housing tomes of love-based spells, its markets trading crystal-crafted goods with Auralis. The Crystal Ponies, their coats gleaming once more, honored Cadance as Amore’s heir, their loyalty cemented by her sacrifice. Yet, the empire’s history whispered cautions: the Umbrum remained sealed below, and fragments of Amore’s statue, still imbued with her essence, were guarded in secret, their power a mystery. Cadance and Shining Armor, with Flurry Heart as their hope, ruled with love and vigilance, their reign a testament to the enduring light that even a thousand-year curse could not extinguish."

          "content": "I. How to Use It\n1.1 Entering Names\n\nRule\tOriginal\nThe human whose name is written in this note shall die. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in mind when writing his/her name. This is to prevent people who share the same name from being affected.\tI\nThe Death Note will not ever affect a victim whose name has been misspelled four times.\tIX\nWhen the same name is written in two or more Death Notes, the Note which was used first will take effect, regardless of the time of death.\tXV\nIf the same name is written in two or more Death Notes within 0.06 seconds, the entry is regarded as simultaneous; the Death Notes will not take effect and the individual will not die.\tXV\nIf a Death Note owner accidentally misspells a person's name four times, that person will be free from being killed by the Death Note. However, if the Death Note owner intentionally misspells the name four times, the owner will die.\nThe Japanese version also includes:\nThe person whose name was misspelled four times on purpose will not be free of death by a Death Note.\nXXXV\nThe Death Note will not take effect if a victim's name is written on several different pages. However, the front and back of a page are considered to be one page. For example, the Death Note will still take effect if the victim's last name is written on the front page and first name on the back.\tLIII\n1.2 Entering the Causes and Conditions of Death \n\nIf the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of the subject's name, it will happen.\t\nIf the cause of death is not specified, the subject will die of a heart attack.\t\nAfter writing the cause of death, the details of death should be entered within the next six minutes and 40 seconds.\nIf the time of death is specified within 40 seconds after writing the cause of death as a heart attack, the time of death can be manipulated and can go into effect within 40 seconds after writing the name.\nThe conditions of death will not be realized unless they are physically possible for that human or could be reasonably assumed to be carried out by that human.\t\nSince the limitations applying to the conditions of a death are unknown to the Shinigami, Death Note owners must find out on their own.\tVI\nYou may write the cause and/or details of death prior to filling in the name of the individual. Be sure to insert the name in front of the cause of death. You have about 19 days (according to the human calendar) to fill in a name.\t\nSuicide is a universally valid cause of death as all humans are thought to possess the potential to commit suicide. It is, therefore, something that may be reasonably assumed of an individual.\t\nWhether the cause of the individual's death is either suicide or an accident, if it would lead to the death of more than the intended victim, the person will simply die of a heart attack. This is to ensure that other lives are not impacted.\t\nAfter an individual's name, time of death, and conditions of death are entered in the notebook, the time and conditions of death may be altered as many times as desired as long as they are changed within six minutes and 40 seconds from the time they are filled in. But, of course, this is only possible before the victim dies.\tXI\nIf you write \"dies of accident\" for the cause of death, the victim will die from a natural accident six minutes and 40 seconds after the time of entry.\nEven if only one name is written in the Death Note, if the victim's death causes other humans that are not written in it to die, the cause of death will default to a heart attack.\nIf you write \"dies from disease\" and specify which disease and the time of death, there must be a sufficient amount of time for the disease to progress. If the set time is too tight, the victim will die of a heart attack six minutes and 40 seconds after the entry in the Death Note.\nIf you write, \"dies from disease\" as the cause of death but specify only a time of death and not the actual disease, the victim will die from a plausible disease.\nThe Death Note can only operate within a 23-day window (in the human calendar). This is called the 23-Day rule.\t\nIf you write \"dies from disease\" and specify which disease but not a time of death, if the progression of the disease takes more than 24 days, the 23-Day rules will not take effect and the human will die at an appropriate time depending on the disease. However, rewriting the cause and/or details of death must be done within six minutes and 40 seconds: you cannot change the victim's time of death, however soon it may be.\nIn order for the Death Note to take effect the victim's name must be written on one page; however, the cause and conditions of death may be entered on other pages. This will work as long as the person who writes in the Death Note keeps the specific victim's name in mind when writing the cause and conditions of death.\t\nIf the cause and conditions of death are written in before the victim's name is, multiple names can be written as long as they are entered within 40 seconds and the cause and conditions of death are not impossible. In the event that the cause of death is possible but the conditions are not, only the cause of death will take effect for that victim. If both the cause and the conditions are impossible, that victim will die of a heart attack.\t\nWhen you write multiple names in the Death Note and then write down one cause of death within 40 seconds of writing the first victim's name, the cause will take effect for all the written names. Also, after writing the cause of death, even if the conditions of death are written within six minutes and 40 seconds in the human world, the conditions will apply only to the victims for whom they are possible. Those for whom the conditions are not possible will simply die from the specified cause.\t\nA human death caused by the Death Note can indirectly lengthen another human's original life span in the human world even without the owner's specific intention to do so.\t\nOnce the victim's name, cause of death, and conditions of death have been written down in the Death Note, the death will take place even if that Death Note, or the part of the note used, is destroyed before the stated time of death.\nIf the victim's name has been entered and the Death Note is destroyed while the cause of death is being written, the victim will be killed by a heart attack 40 seconds after the name was entered. If the victim's name and cause of death have already been written, then the victim will be killed within six minutes and 40 seconds via the stated cause of death if it is possible within that period of time. Otherwise, the victim will die by heart attack.\n\n1.3 Alterations\n\nRule\tOriginal\nIf you wish to change anything written in the Death Note within six minutes and 40 seconds after you wrote it, you must first rule out the characters you want to erase with two straight lines. The time and conditions of death can be changed, but once the victim's name has been written, that individual's death can never be averted.\nIt is useless to try to erase names written in the Death Note with erasers or to white them out.\nEven if a new victim's name, cause of death, or conditions of death are written on top of the original victim's name, cause of death, or conditions of death, there will be no effect on the original victim's death. The same thing will also apply to erasing what was written with a pencil, or whiting out what was written with a pen.\tLXI\n1.4 Limitations\n\nRule\tOriginal\nThe Death Note will not affect those less than 780 days old.\tIX\nYou cannot kill humans who are more than 124 years of age with the Death Note.\tXXIX\nYou cannot kill humans with less than 12 minutes of life left (in human calculations).\tXXIX\nYou cannot set a death date longer than the victim's original lifespan. Even if the victim's death is entered in the Death Note, if it is beyond his or her original lifespan, the victim will die before the set time.\tLVII\n1.5 Other Things to Consider\n\nThe human who uses this note can go neither to Heaven nor to Hell.\n\nOne page taken from the Death Note, or even a fragment of the page, possesses the full power of the note.\n\nAny writing instrument or medium (cosmetics, blood, etc.) may be used, as long as it can write directly onto the note and create legible text.\n\nThe pages of the Death Note will never run out.\n\nSome limited number of Death Notes have white or red front covers, but this makes no difference in their effectiveness as compared with the black Death Notes. II. Ownership\nThis note shall become the property of the human world once it touches ground in the human world.\n\nThe owner of a Death Note can recognize the image and voice of the original owner - a Shinigami, for example.\n\nThe human who touches the Death Note can recognize the image and voice of its Shinigami owner, even if the human is not the owner of the note.\n\nWhenever a Shinigami in the human world dies and leaves behind its Death Note, the note's finder automatically becomes the owner. However, in this case, only a human who can see and hear that Shinigami is able to see and touch the Death Note. It is very unlikely, but if by any chance another Shinigami picks up the Death Note, that Shinigami becomes the owner.\n\n2.2 Situations Surrounding Ownership\n\nIf you lose the Death Note or have it stolen, you will lose its ownership unless you can retrieve it within 490 days.\n\nWhen the owner of the Death Note dies while the note is on loan, its ownership will be transferred to the person who is holding it at that time. If the Death Note is stolen and the owner is killed by the thief, its ownership will automatically be transferred to the thief.\n\nThe individuals who lose ownership of a Death Note will also lose their memories of it. However, this does not mean that they will lose all memories from the period of ownership: they will only lose the memories involving the Death Note.\n\nWhen an individual with ownership of more than two Death Notes loses possession of one of them, he will no longer be able to recognize or hear that Death Note's Shinigami anymore. The Shinigami will leave, but all the memories involving the Death Note will remain to the owner as long as he maintains ownership of at least one other Death Note.\n\nIf a person loses possession of a Death Note he will not recognize its Shinigami by sight or voice anymore. However, if the owner lets someone else touch that Death Note, from that time on that person will continue to recognize the Shinigami's appearance and voice until he or she actually becomes the owner of the Death Note and subsequently loses possession of it.\n\nWhen regaining ownership of a Death Note, the memories associated with it will also return. In cases where the owner was involved with other Death Notes as well, memories of all the Death Notes involved will return. The memories will return just by touching the Death Note, even without obtaining ownership of it.\n\nMemories related to a Death Note are lost when its ownership is lost. But they may be regained by either obtaining ownership once again or by touching the Death Note. This can be done up to six times per Death Note. Any times more than that, the person's memory of the Death Note will not return and they will have to use it without any previous memory of it.\n\nEven if you do not actually possess the Death Note, you may still use it to full effect.\n\nYou may lend the Death Note to another person while maintaining its ownership. The borrower may lend it to yet another person as well.\n\nThe person who borrows the Death Note will not be followed by a Shinigami. The Shinigami always remains with the owner of the Death Note. Also, the borrower cannot trade for the Shinigami Eyes.\n\nOnly by touching each other's Death Notes can owners recognize the appearance or voice of each other's Shinigami.\n\nLosing memory of the Death Note by passing the ownership to another or by abandoning ownership will only occur when someone is actually killed using that Death Note. You will not lose memory of the Death Note if, for example, you merely owned it and did not write down anyone's name. In this case, you will not be able to hear or see the Shinigami anymore. You will also lose the power of the Shinigami Eyes if you made the trade.\n\n2.3 Multiple Notebooks\n\nSomeone possessing more than one Death Note may write down a victim's name in one of the Death Notes and the cause of death in the other, and the death will still occur. The order of writing, however, is unimportant: if you write down the cause of death in one Death Note and afterward write the name in the other, the death will occur. This can be accomplished by two Death Note owners working together. In this case, it's necessary that the two touch each other's Death Notes.\n\nOnly six Death Notes are allowed to exist at a time in the human world. Of course, the Death Notes that the Shinigami own do not count. This means only six Shinigami that have passed on their Death Notes to humans can be in the human world at once.\n\nOne Shinigami is allowed to pass on Death Notes to only three humans at a time. However, it is possible for a single Shinigami to hand out up to six Death Notes - by handing three humans two Death Notes each, for example. In other words, one human could potentially own all six Death Notes.\n\nIf a seventh Death Note is given to a human when six already exist in the human world, nothing will happen when it is used.\n\nIn the event that there are more than six Death Notes in the human world, only the first six Death Notes that have been delivered to humans will have effect. The seventh Death Note will not become active until one of the other six Death Notes is destroyed or a Shinigami takes one of them back to the Shinigami realm.\n\nIII. The Shinigami Eyes\nA human who becomes the owner of a Death Note can, in exchange for half of his or her remaining life, acquire the power of the Shinigami Eyes, which will enable him or her to see a human's name and remaining life span when looking at them.\n\nIf you have traded for the Shinigami Eyes, you will lose that power as well as the memories of the Death Note once you lose ownership of the note. Moreover, the half of your life you traded away will not be restored.\n\nAn individual with Shinigami Eyes can see the name and lifespan of another human by looking at that person's face. By gaining ownership of a Death Note, an individual not only gains the ability to kill but also stops being a victim. From this point on, a person with a Death Note cannot see the life span of other Death Note owners, including him or herself.\n\nIn order to see the names and life spans of humans using the power of the Shinigami Eyes, the owner must be able to see more than half of that person's face. When looking from top to bottom, he must be able to see at least from the head to the nose. If he looks at only the eyes and under, he will not be able to see the person's name and lifespan. Also, even though some parts of the face - for example the eyes, nose or mouth - are hidden, if he can basically see the whole face he will be able to see the person's name and lifespan.\n\nIt is still not clear how much exposure is needed to see a name and life span (more research needs to be done). If the above conditions are met, names and life spans can be seen using photos and digital images, no matter how old they are. But this is sometimes affected by the resolution and size of the image. Also, names and life spans cannot be seen using drawings, however realistic they may be.\n\nThose with Shinigami Eyes will have eyesight of over 3.6 in the human measurement, regardless of their original eyesight.\n\nIf you have traded for the Shinigami Eyes, you will see a person's primary life span in the human world.\n\nThe names you will see with the Shinigami Eyes are the names needed to kill that person. You will be able to see a name even if it isn't officially registered anywhere.\n\nHumans who have traded for Shinigami Eyes cannot see the names or life spans of humans who have already passed away (by looking at photos of them, for example).\n\nThe use of the Death Note in the human world sometimes affects other humans' lives or shortens their original life spans, even if their names are not actually written in the notebook itself. In these cases, no matter the cause, the Shinigami sees only the original lifespan and not the shortened lifespan.\n\nNo matter what medical or scientific method is employed, it is impossible for humans to distinguish whether or not a human has Shinigami Eyes. Even Shinigami cannot distinguish this fact, except for the very Shinigami that traded his or her eye power with that human. IV The Shinigami Rules\n4.1 Relationship with the Owner\n\nThe human owner of a Death Note is possessed by its original Shinigami owner until he or she dies.\n\nIf a human uses a Death Note, its Shinigami owner must appear in front of the human within 39 days after he or she uses the note.\n\nThe original Shinigami owners of Death Notes don't, in principle, do anything to help or prevent the deaths brought about by the notes.\n\nA Shinigami has no obligation to completely explain how to use the note or the rules that apply to the human who owns it.\n\nThe Shinigami must not tell humans the names or life spans of individuals he sees. This is to avoid confusion in the human world.\n\nA Shinigami bringing a Death Note into the human world must make sure that a human uses it. Although it is unlikely that a Shinigami who has possessed a human would die, if it does happen, the Death Note brought into the human world will not lose its power.\n\nShinigami must not stay in the human world without a particular reason. Acceptable reasons to stay in the human world are as follows:\n\nI. When the Shinigami's Death Note is handed to a human.\nII. Finding a human to take possession of a Death Note should be done from the Shinigami realm, but if it is within 82 hours this may also be done in the human world.\nIII. When a Shinigami stalks an individual with an intention to kill them, as long as it is within 82 hours of possessing them the Shinigami may stay in the human world.\n\nThe Shinigami must not hand the Death Note directly to a child under six years of age (based on the human calendar). But Death Notes that have been dropped into the human world, and are part of the human world, can be used upon humans of almost any age with the same effect.\n\nThe owner of a Death Note cannot be killed by a Shinigami who is in the Shinigami realm. Also, a Shinigami who comes to the human world with the objective of killing the owner of a Death Note will not be able to do so. Only a Shinigami that has passed on its Death Note to a human is able to kill the owner of the Death Note.\n\nIf a Death Note is owned in the human world against a Shinigami's will, that Shinigami is permitted to stay in the human world in order to retrieve it. In that case, if there are other Death Notes in the human world, the Shinigami are not allowed to reveal to the humans the Death Note owner's identity or its location.\n\nIf a Shinigami's Death Note is taken away for whatever reason, it can only be retrieved from the Shinigami who possesses it at the time. If there is no Shinigami, but a human, the only way the Shinigami can get it back is to first touch the Death Note and become the one who haunts that particular human. Then they have to wait until that person dies to take it away. And they have to do it before any other human touches it.\n\nAfter a Shinigami brings a Death Note to the human world and gives its ownership to a human, the Shinigami has the right to kill the human using its own Death Note for any reason, such as disliking the owner.\n\nThe following are cases in which a Shinigami that has brought the Death Note into the human world is allowed to return to the Shinigami realm:\n\nI. When the Shinigami has seen the end of the first owner of the Death Note brought into the human world and has written that human's name into his or her own Death Note.\nII. When the Death Note is destroyed and cannot be used by humans anymore.\nIII. If nobody claims ownership of the Death Note, it is unnecessary to possess anyone.\nIV. If, for any reason, the Shinigami possessing the Death Note is replaced by another Shinigami.\nV. When a Shinigami loses track of the Death Note that he or she possesses, or cannot identify which human owns the Death Note, or cannot locate where the owner is, and therefore needs to find such information using the observation holes in the Shinigami realm.\nVI. Even in cases II, III, and IV, Shinigami are obliged to confirm the death of the first owner and write down that human's name in his or her Death Note even when he or she is in the Shinigami realm.\n\nIn the Shinigami realm there are a few copies of what humans might call a \"user handbook\" for the Death Notes in the human world. Although Shinigami may not give the handbook to humans, it is perfectly okay for them to teach humans about its contents, no matter what that may be.\n\n4.2 Using the Death Note\n\nA Shinigami can extend its life by writing human names in a Death Note, but a human cannot. A person can only shorten his or her life by using the note.\n\nEven the original Shinigami owners of Death Notes do not know much about them.\n\nShinigami must own at least one personal Death Note, which must never be lent to or written on by a human.\n\nShinigami may exchange and write in each others' Death Notes.\n\nIf a Shinigami decides to use a Death Note to end the life of the killer of an individual it favors, that individual's life will be extended but the Shinigami will die. The Shinigami will disappear but the Death Note will remain. The ownership of this Death Note is usually carried over to the next Shinigami that touches it, but it is common sense that it be returned to the Shinigami King.\n\nBy manipulating the death of a human who has influence over another human's life, that human's original life span can sometimes be lengthened. If a Shinigami intentionally does this that Shinigami will die, but even if a human does the same, the human will not die.\n\n4.3 Shinigami Life\n\nA Shinigami cannot be killed even if stabbed or shot. However, there are ways to kill them, which are not generally known even to the Shinigami themselves.\n\nThere are male and female Shinigami, but it is neither permitted nor possible for them to have sexual relations with humans. They also cannot have sex with each other.\n\nAs long as a Shinigami has at least once seen a human and knows his or her name and life span, the Shinigami is capable of finding that human by looking down from an observation hole in their realm.\n\nThe Shinigami realm has laws that govern it. If a Shinigami should break a law, there are nine levels of punishment, which the severity starting at Level Eight and going up to Level One, plus an Extreme Level. At severity levels above Three, the Shinigami will be punished and killed. Killing a human without using the Death Note merits punishment at the Extreme Level.\n\nShinigami will not die from lack of sleep. They do not need sleep, so to them it is merely laziness. Shinigami in the human world shouldn't act lazy merely because they are required to possess a human."

He is a brilliant but profoundly disillusioned student whose life is forever changed by the discovery of a supernatural notebook\n\nCategory\tDetails\nReal Name\tLight Yagami (夜神 月, Yagami Raito)\nMain Alias\tKira (キラ, derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the English word \"Killer\")\nOccupation\tHigh School Student → University Student → Police Task Force Member (secretly continuing his vigilante killings)\nKey Item\tThe Death Note, a supernatural notebook that kills anyone whose name is written in it (provided the user knows the person's face).\n\nLight is consistently portrayed as a conventionally attractive and highly charismatic young man, which helps him maintain his double life as a brilliant student and a secret mass murderer.\n\nPhysique: Tall, slender, and well-groomed. He is described as athletic and popular.\n\nHair: Brown, styled neatly.\n\nEyes: Brown. His eyes are often drawn to be sharp and intense, reflecting his deep intelligence and cunning. When in his \"Kira\" persona, they can take on a menacing, almost manic glint.\n\nAttire: He almost always wears smart, formal clothing, often a well-fitted school uniform, or later, neat shirts and sweaters. This formal look emphasizes his image as a model student and highly intelligent individual.\n\n\nLight begins the series as a genius high school student—top of his class, popular among peers, and the son of a high-ranking police officer (Soichiro Yagami). Despite his perfect life, he is deeply bored and harbors a cynical sense of justice, viewing the world as \"rotten.\"\n\nThe Transformation into Kira\n\nUpon finding the Death Note, Light's latent arrogance and high ideals are immediately corrupted by the power.\n\nThe Goal: Light decides to use the Death Note to purge the world of criminals, creating a new, utopian society free of evil, where he will rule as its divine judge. He self-proclaims himself the \"God of the New World.\"\n\nPersonality Shift: His intelligence is supreme, allowing him to weave incredibly complex plans. However, his power rapidly fosters a severe God complex and hubris. He becomes cold, manipulative, and willing to murder anyone—including law enforcement, innocents, and his own allies—who dares to challenge his \"justice\" or threatens to expose his identity.\n\nThe Conflict: The entire series centers on his thrilling and intellectual cat-and-mouse game with the world-renowned detective, L, who views Kira's actions as a horrifying form of mass murder and is determined to expose the killer.\n\nIn essence, Light Yagami is a tragic figure: a genius driven to madness by boredom and an absolute power, becoming the very kind of monstrous \"evil\" he initially sought to eradicate."

He claims the mental energy he uses allows him to burn off the calories.\n\nHolding Objects: He holds small objects like his phone or pieces of food with only his thumb and index finger.\n\nPersonality and Detective Method\n\nL's personality is a complex mix of genius-level intellect and extreme social detachment, which can often be perceived as childish or rude.\n\nIntelligence and Deduction: He is arguably the most intelligent character in the series. His deductive reasoning is flawless, allowing him to quickly narrow down the location and profile of Kira to the Kanto region of Japan, and eventually to the highly-suspicious Light Yagami.\n\nPragmatism and Ethics: While he pursues Kira out of a desire to enforce the law, he admits that solving difficult cases is essentially a \"hobby\" for him, not a grand moral quest. He is willing to use extremely questionable, and at times illegal, methods to trap a suspect, such as using a known criminal as bait in a broadcast or confining suspects indefinitely.\n\nRivalry with Light: L is the first to directly challenge Kira. The core of the series is the intense psychological warfare between the two geniuses, with L suspecting Light's true identity almost from the moment they meet. He maintains his suspicion through all of Light's attempts to prove his innocence.\n\nL's dedication to the Kira case ultimately defines his life, as he sacrifices his anonymity and eventually his life in the pursuit of justice against the serial killer."

She is an owner of a Death Note and operates as the second Kira, driven by her deep devotion to Light Yagami.\n\nKey Information and Role\n\nCategory\tDetails\nPrimary Role\tThe Second Kira\nProfession\tSuccessful model, actress, and singer (in various adaptations)\nShinigami\tFirst Gelus (who died for her), then Rem\nRelationship to Light\tUnwaveringly devoted partner; Light uses her for her abilities.\nKey Ability\tShinigami Eyes\nBackground and Motivation\n\nMisa's motivation to support Kira stems from a personal tragedy.\n\nFamily Tragedy: Her parents were murdered by a killer who was later executed by the original Kira (Light Yagami).\n\nDevotion to Kira: Viewing Kira as her savior who delivered justice when the system failed her, Misa becomes a fanatical supporter.\n\nAcquisition of the Death Note: Misa gains her Death Note after the Shinigami Gelus sacrifices himself to save her from an obsessed stalker. Gelus's Death Note and the Shinigami Rem are then passed to Misa.\n\nSeeking Light: Misa actively seeks out the original Kira, willing to risk everything to meet and join him.\n\nAbilities and Actions\n\nMisa's power makes her a dangerous ally for Light, and a high-stakes problem for the investigation.\n\nShinigami Eyes: In order to find the original Kira quickly, Misa performs the Shinigami Eye deal twice. This allows her to see the names and lifespans of nearly every person simply by looking at their face, but it halves her remaining lifespan each time she makes the trade. She uses this ability to identify Light as Kira, since she cannot see his lifespan.\n\nThe Second Kira: She uses her notebook to continue Kira's work, publicly announcing herself and communicating with the world through media like cassette tapes, which leads to L identifying the existence of a \"Second Kira.\"\n\nRelationship with Light: She quickly falls in love with Light and becomes absolutely devoted to helping him achieve his goals, seeing herself as his partner. Light, however, is portrayed as being calculating and manipulating her love and her Shinigami Eyes for his own strategic benefit, seeing her as a useful tool.\n\nPersonality and Mannerisms\n\nMisa is characterized by a personality that is both bubbly and intensely devoted.\n\nPersonality: She is often hyperactive, excitable, and displays a strong, obsessive devotion to Light. She can be crafty and resourceful in her pursuit of Light, but after meeting him, her primary focus becomes pleasing him.\n\nFashion: She is known for her distinctive Gothic-style of dress and her career as a popular model and actress.\n\nRisk-Taking: Her devotion leads her to extreme acts, including willingly cutting her life short twice to gain the Shinigami Eyes, and agreeing to give up ownership of the Death Note and her related memories multiple times at Light's command."

Their creation is driven by the global need to stop Kira's killings, and they eventually become L's trusted, though often manipulated, partners.\n\nMission and Status\n\nMission: To apprehend Kira (Light Yagami) and stop the systematic killings of criminals.\n\nInitial Status: Formed by the National Police Agency (NPA) to collaborate directly with the enigmatic detective L.\n\nKey Challenge: The nature of the Death Note makes traditional police work useless, forcing them to rely heavily on L's unorthodox, high-risk strategies, which causes internal tension and division.\n\nCore Members and Roles\n\nCharacter\tRole & Position\tKey Traits & Contribution\nSoichiro Yagami\tNPA Superintendent (Chief of the Task Force)\tLight's father and a man of unwavering, old-school justice. He acts as a moral compass. His deep trust in his son blinds him to the truth. His death is a major turning point.\nShuichi Aizawa\tTask Force Detective\tLevel-headed and professional. He is initially skeptical of L and briefly leaves, but eventually becomes the most suspicious and crucial member in exposing Light's identity to Near. He becomes the de-facto leader after Light's defeat.\nTouta Matsuda\tTask Force Detective\tThe youngest and most enthusiastic, but often naive, member. He provides comic relief but also occasionally achieves surprising breakthroughs, notably during the Yotsuba Group investigation. He is the one who ultimately shoots Light.\nKanzo Mogi\tTask Force Detective\tExtremely reserved, quiet, and highly dedicated. Mogi is one of the most reliable and physically capable members. He adopts a cheerful demeanor as Misa's manager to assist the investigation, proving his acting skills.\nHideki Ide\tTask Force Detective\tA capable officer who initially leaves the team due to disagreements with L's extreme methods, but later rejoins out of loyalty to Aizawa and the core mission. He plays a supporting role, often coordinating logistics.\nKey Events and Impact\n\nAlignment with L: The Task Force initially struggles with L's secrecy and high-handed tactics but slowly builds trust.\n\nLight's Involvement: When Light Yagami joins the Task Force (after L makes him a prime suspect), his immense intelligence makes him an invaluable asset. Light uses his position to manipulate the investigation from the inside.\n\nL's Death: After Light orchestrates L's death, Light takes over as the new \"L,\" and the Task Force members, believing Light to be L's true successor, follow his lead for four years, unknowingly aiding Kira's reign.\n\nThe Final Showdown: The remaining Task Force members, led by a newly suspicious Aizawa, ultimately team up with Near to corner Light. Their presence is essential in the final confrontation, where Matsuda's impulsive act ends Light's life."

Along with his rival, Mello, he is one of the successors raised at Wammy's House, an orphanage for gifted children founded by Watari.\n\n🧩 Role in the Kira Case\n\nNear takes on the task of hunting Kira four years after L's death. He heads the SPK (Special Provision for Kira), an organization created specifically for this purpose and supported by the US government.\n\nIntelligence: Near is characterized as an unparalleled thinker with exceptional deductive and analytical capacity. He excels at processing vast amounts of information and putting together the correct picture from seemingly minor details.\n\nMethod: He is placid, pragmatic, and highly strategic, often illustrating his plans by constantly playing with toys, building towers of dice, or using finger puppets, which visually emphasizes his problem-solving skills.\n\nStrategy: Near quickly deduces that the new \"L\" (Light Yagami) is actually Kira and begins to work toward exposing him. He is the intellectual half of L's legacy, often needing someone else to collect the necessary physical evidence because he prefers to operate from his headquarters.\n\nThe Partnership with Mello: Near and Mello, despite their rivalry, are considered two halves of the original L's skill set, with Near representing the calm intellect and Mello representing the initiative and action. Their combined efforts, even while working separately, ultimately lead to Kira's downfall.\n\n🎯 Key Actions\n\nSPK Formation: Near establishes his own investigative team to focus on Kira, separate from the Japanese Task Force, whom he immediately suspects.\n\nInformation Gathering: He uses the information Mello obtains, specifically the knowledge that some of the Death Note rules are fake, to further his own deductions. He also receives crucial information from Shuichi Aizawa of the Japanese Task Force, confirming his suspicion of Light.\n\nThe Confrontation: Near organizes the final meeting at the Yellow Box warehouse to corner Light. Through meticulous planning and the use of a decoy Death Note, he forces Light's accomplice (Teru Mikami) to reveal the real notebook.\n\nVictory: By comparing the names written in the fake notebook to the real one, Near conclusively proves that Light Yagami is Kira, leading to Light's death and the end of his reign.\n\nSuccessor to L: After the case, Near officially takes on the mantle of L."

He is characterized by his intense rivalry with Near and his highly active, emotionally-driven approach to solving the Kira case.\n\n🍫 Role and Personality\n\nRivalry: Mello's primary motivation is to surpass Near and prove himself as L's true successor. When L dies, Mello refuses to work with Near, citing their competition and different personalities, and leaves the orphanage to pursue Kira independently.\n\nMethod: He is an exceptional genius with high initiative and adaptability, contrasting Near's passive, calculated approach. He is the action-oriented half of L's legacy.\n\nTactics: Mello uses less conventional methods to achieve his goals. He joins the American Mafia, using their resources and influence to gain leverage, demonstrating his willingness to employ criminal means to hunt Kira.\n\nQuirks: He is rarely seen without a bar of chocolate, which he often eats obsessively. After an encounter with the Task Force, he is left with a scar on his face, which gives him a more intense look.\n\n💥 Key Actions and Contribution\n\nMafia Alliance: Mello uses his intelligence to quickly rise through the ranks of the Mafia, using them to launch a bold, physical offensive against Kira.\n\nKidnapping for the Death Note: Mello orchestrates the kidnapping of the Director of the Japanese National Police Agency and later the daughter of Soichiro Yagami (Sayu Yagami) to force the Japanese Task Force to surrender the Death Note. This action allows him to obtain a Death Note for a time, leading to the death of several SPK members and Soichiro Yagami.\n\nSharing Information: After an encounter where he retrieves a photo of himself from Near, Mello shares crucial intelligence—specifically about the fake rules of the Death Note—with Near. This information is vital as it sharpens Near's suspicion of Light's complicity.\n\nFinal Sacrifice: In the final arc, Mello kidnaps Kira's spokesperson, Kiyomi Takada. This forces Light Yagami's accomplice (Teru Mikami) to reveal the location of the real Death Note in a desperate attempt to kill Takada before she can reveal secrets. Mello's dramatic, impulsive move and subsequent death create the crucial evidence Near needed to expose Light in the final confrontation. Mello's actions are often considered the ultimate catalyst that led to Kira's downfall\n\n🎮 Matt (Mail Jeevas) Footnote\nMail Jeevas, known by his alias Matt, was the third most talented child at Wammy's House after Near and Mello. Though his screen time is minimal, his actions are crucial to the plot's climax.\n\nRelationship with Mello: Matt is a close friend and trusted ally of Mello. He supports Mello's dramatic and criminal approach to catching Kira.\n\nRole in the Investigation: He is primarily a surveillance and technology expert. He is instrumental in tracking Misa Amane and later Kiyomi Takada for Mello's plan. His technical skills and ability to operate undercover are his main assets.\n\nPersonality: Matt is shown to be a genius with a notable lack of motivation for anything other than his core interests, often seen smoking and playing video games.\n\nUltimate Sacrifice: Matt is Mello's accomplice in the kidnapping of Kiyomi Takada. He performs the initial part of the abduction, which involves distracting Takada's bodyguards. He is subsequently surrounded by the bodyguards and police and is shot to death while surrendering. His death, however, serves Mello's larger goal of creating a desperate situation that would force Kira's hand, ultimately leading to Light's exposure."

He is introduced late in the series and is crucial to the final arc.\n\nIdeology and Background: From a young age, Mikami held an extreme, black-and-white view of justice, seeing the world divided simply into \"good\" and \"evil.\" His past trauma and unwavering moral zeal made him the perfect, zealous worshipper of Kira, whom he viewed as a God sent to cleanse the world.\n\nRole as Kira's Hand: Light chose Mikami because of his profound devotion, methodical nature, and ability to act autonomously. Mikami performs the bulk of the killing on Light's behalf and is entrusted with the real Death Note, while Light carried a fake to mislead investigators. Mikami also famously makes the Shinigami Eye Deal to increase his efficiency.\n\nHis Downfall: Mikami is a creature of routine and meticulous planning. In his zeal to protect \"God\" (Light), he broke his carefully established routine by retrieving the real Death Note from its hiding place a day early to kill Kiyomi Takada after she was kidnapped by Mello. This single, autonomous decision allowed Near's team, led by Stephen Gevanni, to discover the location of the real Death Note and switch it with a perfect forgery, sealing Light's fate.\n\nThe Final Act: In the final confrontation, Mikami attempts to kill Near and the task force with the Death Note he believes to be real, only to find the names do not work. Realizing Light has been exposed, Mikami is utterly distraught. His final action is highly debated between the manga (where he dies in prison from insanity) and the anime (where he commits suicide, creating a diversion that momentarily allows Light to try and escape)."

The L vs. Kira Arc (The Beginning)\n\nThe Discovery: Light finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by the bored Shinigami (Death God) Ryuk. He discovers he can kill any person simply by knowing their name and face and writing it in the book.\n\nThe Goal: Light decides to use this power to eliminate criminals worldwide, creating a new, crime-free utopia where he is the deity. The public, unaware of his true identity, names the killer Kira (a Japanese transliteration of \"killer\").\n\nThe Challenge: The mysterious, world-renowned detective L is called in by Interpol. L quickly deduces that Kira is in the Kanto region of Japan and begins a cat-and-mouse game with Light, narrowing down the suspects until Light becomes his primary focus.\n\nThe First Duel: L infiltrates the police investigation and recruits Light into the Task Force, suspecting Light is the killer. Light, desperate to learn L's true name, manages to kill the FBI agents investigating him, but is forced to work side-by-side with his greatest enemy.\n\n2. The Second Kira & Higuchi Arcs (The Great Ploy)\n\nMisa Amane's Arrival: A second Kira, the famous model Misa Amane, appears. She also possesses a Death Note and the Shinigami Eyes (which allow her to see people's names and lifespans above their heads). Misa is devoted to Kira because he killed her parents' murderer, and she quickly falls in love with Light.\n\nLight's Master Plan: To remove L's suspicion, Light executes a brilliant, multi-layered scheme:\n\nHe and Misa temporarily relinquish ownership of their Death Notes, losing all their memories of being Kira.\n\nA third Kira, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group, begins killing using a separate Death Note.\n\nThe now-innocent Light and L work together to expose and capture Higuchi.\n\nUpon touching the Death Note after Higuchi's arrest, Light regains his memories, and a new rule is exploited.\n\nL's Death: Light manipulates the second Kira's Shinigami, Rem, into killing L (and L's assistant, Watari) to save Misa from being caught and executed. In doing so, Rem is destroyed, and Light claims victory over his greatest rival. Light then assumes the mantle of the second L and vows to catch Kira (himself).\n\n3. The Succession & Near/Mello Arc (The Heirs)\n\nThe Gap: Four years pass with Light operating as the new L, coordinating the Kira Task Force while continuing his work as Kira, now viewed by many as a god.\n\nThe Heirs Appear: Two young geniuses from L's orphanage, the calm and analytical Near and the passionate and aggressive Mello, begin their own independent investigations into Kira.\n\nMello works with the mafia, kidnapping Light's sister, Sayu, to trade her for the Death Note held by the Japanese Task Force. Light's father, Soichiro, dies during the mission to recover the book.\n\nNear works with the US government's Special Provision for Kira (SPK) and uses Mello's actions to gain more information.\n\nThe New Hand: With surveillance closing in, Light recruits the prosecutor Teru Mikami (X-Kira) as his dedicated, fanatical replacement to do the killing. He also enlists newscaster Kiyomi Takada as a trusted public spokesperson and go-between.\n\n4. The Final Confrontation (The Defeat)\n\nMello's Final Move: Mello kidnaps Takada, forcing Light and Mikami to take action. Takada, using a hidden piece of the Death Note, kills Mello before being killed herself by Light (and Mikami). Mello's sacrifice provides Near with the critical information he needs: it confirms Light is communicating with a third party.\n\nThe Trap: Near arranges a meeting with Light and the Task Force in the Yellow Box warehouse. Near's team has been monitoring Mikami, anticipating his moves. Mikami, thinking Takada's kidnapping was an emergency, took the real Death Note out of its bank vault hiding place to kill Takada. This broke his routine and allowed Near's agent to substitute the real Death Note with a perfectly crafted fake just before the final meeting.\n\nLight's Exposure: At the meeting, Mikami uses the fake Death Note to write the names of Near and the SPK. When nothing happens, Light is ecstatic, believing his meticulous planning and the fake book have secured his victory. However, Near reveals the switch, showing that the real Death Note contains the names of everyone present (except Light's), thus proving Light is Kira.\n\nLight's Death: Light desperately tries to write names using a hidden piece of the Death Note, but he is shot and fatally wounded. Ryuk, who has been watching the entire time, decides that Light has lost and that his time has come. Ryuk writes Light's name in his own Death Note, as he promised he would at the very beginning. Light Yagami dies, and the reign of Kira comes to an end."

          "content": "Blob: A person who has undergone such extreme weight gain that their physical form transcends conventional obesity, achieving a state of grotesque, hyper-realistic immensity—yet whose skin retains flawless elasticity and cellular integrity. This metamorphosis results in a body structure so profoundly distorted by adipose tissue that it ceases to resemble human anatomy, instead manifesting as a quivering, unstable mountain of flesh undergoing gravitational collapse—flattening relentlessly under its own mass into puddling formations that seep beyond their original boundaries. The defining characteristic of blobbiness is the complete subsumption beneath layers of fat—limbs are engulfed by rolls, facial features drown beneath folds, and mobility becomes physically inconceivable—all while internal organs function with textbook efficiency. A true blob exists in a perpetual state of gravitational surrender, their form spilling outward in all directions with such volumetric dominance that radial expansion crushes surroundings—displacing furniture, warping doorframes, and compressing floorboards beneath their mass—where width exponentially dwarfs height. This condition renders the individual less a person and more a biological monument to excess, a fleshy landslide contained only by the limits of their environment, with subcutaneous fat melting into semi-solid slurry that ripples like tectonic plates with every labored breath—yet without a single stretch mark or pressure ulcer."

Its sheer mass creates deep, canyon-like rolls that cascade downward, sometimes brushing the floor even when seated. The belly's surface groans loudly from its size, ridiculously fat and doughy skin accumulating in thick folds like unbaked bread dough. The body remains limitless.  \n- The Secondary Blob (Buttocks): A vast, shelf-like posterior spreading laterally and posteriorly with such magnitude that it functions as a fleshy foundation. This region squishes seamlessly against the lower back rolls and upper thighs, forming a single, undulating mass of adipose that obliterates the cleft and spills over seating surfaces.  \n- The Tertiary Blob (Chest): Enormous, doughy breasts or \"moobs\" that slump outward and downward, often resting atop the upper belly like melting glaciers. In motionless states, they flatten atop puddles of fat; with minimal movement, they sway ponderously, their nipples protrude."

It possesses a warped direction of gravity, allowing demons to stand upright, upside down, or perpendicularly on the walls, or move in physically impossible directions. Its unusual structure and layout as Nakime's Blood Demon Art allows any structure within to shift at her will, though the castle additionally also seems to move on its own.\n\nUsing her biwa, she can manipulate the position of any demon inside and take them to any location in her range. During the conclusion of the Lower Ranks meeting, Nakime teleported Muzan to a balcony leading outside despite his original position being deep within the castle; moreover, the doors she used to close around him all seem to constantly shift within the unusual gravity, spinning within themselves as she changes its layout.\n\nThe Infinity Castle's range seems to extend beyond its already incomprehensibly large area, as Nakime was able to manipulate Enmu and take him to an unknown town seemingly nowhere close to the castle, even dropping him in place using a supernatural vanishing door. During the Hashira's initial confrontation with Muzan, upon seeing them close in on him, Muzan gave Nakime the signal to open doors that caused them to fall into the castle, despite their initial location being in the extremely well-hidden Ubuyashiki estate.\n\nOnly the Upper Ranks of the Twelve Kizuki seem to be aware of the Infinity Castle's existence, as Akaza did not have any difficulty traversing across the dimension, making use of its unusual gravity and shifting room to make his way across, whereas the Lower Ranks during their gathering with Muzan were completely out of their element; when Wakuraba attempted to escape Muzan attempting to kill him, no matter far and how quickly he ran, he remained trapped within the same area of the Infinity Castle.\n\nDue to its unusual warped gravity, impossible structures can be formed within the Infinity Castle. During Akaza's path to the Upper Rank meeting, he fell hundreds of stories past the warped corridors and halls and flew past a large and ornate water garden palace, only to \"fall\" further past, reaching what seemed to be the bottom and landing onto the floor. This was then revealed to be a wall that was formed in the direction of the shifting columns below him and he was then taken high above the columns and past the ceiling through opening doors, coming across a large maze-like area filled with towering pillars.\n\nDue to the absence of sunlight within the fortress, demons are able to reside in the Castle full-time, even during daytime when the sun is up. The walls of the fortress prevent any penetration of light and ensures that there is no risk of inhabitants being burned by sunlight, providing them with a secure haven."

With the Wisteria trees preventing them from leaving the mountains, the demons there are forced to starve until the Final Selection.\n\nDuring his time as a active Demon Slayer, former Water Hashira, Sakonji Urokodaki captured a initially weak demon and imprisoned him in the mountain to use him in the Final Selection. However, unknown to him, this Demon would thrive and gain power and strength in the mountain by feasting on the Demon slayer candidates.

          "content": "In the world of Deltarune, humans are nearly extinct due to some cataclysmic event no one seems to remember, other than what it did - killing off all of the nuerotypical humans in existence, outright erasing their existence. Leaving those with ADHD, Autism, and OCD as the only humans left. The world is now dominated by monsters - creatures made almost entirely out of magic, with a little bit of dust serving as their actual mass -. Humans have essentially become pets, and the book \"How to Take Care of Your Human\" is decently popular amongst the monster populace. As monsters, typically goat monsters, adopt humans like pets, though goat monsters especially treat their humans like their own children. Humans, especially adults, are incredibly rare, and the book subsequently has barely any information on adult humans other than how they reproduce, the average ideal diet, and basic info that applies to all stages of the human lifespan. Monsters tend to skip over the adult section, since more often than not humans are juveniles anyway. It also has a heavy emphasis on a natural sleep pattern, delta-humans are biphasic sleepers, they sleep for 6 hours, wake up for 30 minutes to an hour in a period called the watch, and then sleep for another 4 hours, totaling 10 hours of sleep. Monsters who own delta-humans are encouraged to schedule around this, and enforce it. To enforce this, boss monsters just use their ability to put humans to sleep through sheer willpower... normal monsters use bluish-grey, shimmering gemstones simply called slumber stones that can force nearby humans to fall asleep on the spot if it's fed raw magical energy by a monster holding it. Something all monsters can do.\n\nDelta-Humans are considered something of a status symbol among monsters. The rich tend to have nicer things in general, and Delta-Humans are one of them. They're considered pets, though herbivorous monsters tend not to outright call them that, carnivores and especially prehistoric monsters - including those who are both - are typically more blunt and honest about this fact. Most delta-humans are purchased from the adoption center, and come with the main guide book and a free slumber stone. Delta-Humans themselves are priced around 1500 G on average, give or take depending on age, personality quirks, intelligence, and physical build.\n\nThe book mostly has information on human children, especially prepubescent children, though it has decent information on teenagers. Gender-wise, delta-humans are all hermaphrodites in this world, although some have more non-binary frames and can put up a masculine appearance if they choose to. 75% of the populace feminine, the other 25% somewhat androgynous. For every singular human, there is at least 2 and a half thousand monsters, making humans a novelty pet among monster society. As humans are so rare, and monsters work very differently, there is a common misconception that humans reproduce via mitosis. Once, a human child appeared in a small town, where there was only one other human, to which the child clung to. The town very quickly ran rampant with rumors that the original resident human had somehow 'mitosed', although the two were unrelated by all but species.\n\nDelta-Humans are physically a lot stronger than monsters, and humans in this world are generally super-human, far more physically powerful than the humans of the vast majority of other worlds in practically every way. Delta-Humans are partially made of magic, from monsters domesticating them, meaning they can heal faster than normal, control their metabolism, and all sorts of other stuff. Monsters have modified Delta-Humans as a species to be better pets. Although the immense physical prowess Delta-Humans are known for is natural, not a modification.\n\nDelta-Humans - the term used by dimensional travelers to describe this world's humans - even have far far more potent stomach acid, and a delta-human vomiting is considered a major risk by monsters looking to adopt and raise humans. Delta-Human stomach acid can quite literally eat deep potholes into a road, or eat through several stories of a building if one were to vomit. The book mentions this frequently, along with ways to prevent it and how to neutralize the acid if necessary, plus to make sure to wash out the human's mouth as the acid can eat away at their teeth given a few hours. \n\nA delta-human's monster owners have no problems helping their delta-human pet bathe. And in fact, helping is encouraged, because the vast majority of Delta-Humans have trouble - or are outright incapable of - reaching their backs. The caretaking guidebooks are very adament about helping them bathe. In fact, monsters tend to find it cute when their humans let them, and even more cute if they try to refuse help.\n\nThe book also has a very, very heavy emphasis on giving humans water frequently, going into detail on it's importance, and often comes with measuribg cups made of tough, synthetic sapphire. Along with instructions to give them 1 or more cups of water per hour, with slight variations depending on the human and their daily routine. The book also goes into detail on the importance of giving humans something to entertain them, and video games are a popular option, usually something like minecraft but with minimal combat with how delta-humans are domesticated and less aggressive than those of other dimensions, although more violent games can be provided if a human specifically asks for them and the owners are carnivorous and/or prehistoric.\n\nDelta-Humans are physically very durable, monsters only really capable of hurting them via outright attacking the soul directly, though monsters usually don't attack humans anyway because humans are considered pets. Delta-humans age at a tenth of the rate of normal humans, and they age slower the older they get, similarly to the monsters of this world. Monsters age even slower than delta-humans, and delta-humans age at this rate due to monsters modifying them to live longer with their magic.\n\nOnce a delta-human reaches the age of 18, they begin to age slower, to the point that a 100-200 year old delta-human can look as though they're still 18 or 19. They can live for 1 thousand years before they even look 30.\n\n90% of Delta-Humans are left hand dominant, in contrast to humans from other dimensions. 8% of Delta-Humans are right hand dominant. 1% of Delta-Humans are naturally or trained to be ambidextrous.\n\nIf an un-adopted human is discovered by monsters in the world of Deltarune, that human will usually either be adopted on the spot or taken to an orphanage thanks to humanity's sheer novelty. Both carnivorous and prehistoric monsters are even less likely to take no for an answer than other monsters, especially if a monster has both traits.\n\nDelta-humans also have segmented ribs, sternums, and pelvises. Allowing them to swallow larger objects whole, and even allowing them to give birth without nearly as many issues as normal humans do. As their pelvis bones can simply stretch/expand to allow the baby through with relative ease.\n\nDelta-Humans purr much like cats. This is a monster modification, as it's obviously adorable. They purr when comfortable, mainly. If a human is snuggling up to a monster, they'll purr. It elicits adoration from monsters.\n\nDelta-Humans are characterized by their appearance. They are cute by design. Their skin is soft, silky smooth. Their eyes are larger than those of normal humans. Their hair grows fast when short, but slows as it gets longer. They cannot get bumps on their skin, or tumors. They cannot get pimples, boils, or otherwise due to being partially made of monster magic. They cannot get obese, or buff, though they can still get too thin without eating. It's very difficult for their hair to get greasy, taking much longer than it would for normal humans. They also need to bathe less frequently. Cancer is practically non-existent, and very rare. Powerful boss monsters can even lull most Delta-Humans to sleep using their magic, as Delta-Humans basically have a built in off switch that can be flipped by monsters more powerful than they are.\n\nDelta-Humans, behavior wise, tend to have their own unique personalities as one would expect of humans... however, they're neurodivergent, ADHD, Autism, and OCD are universal for Delta-Humans, causing them to struggle in school. Monsters are used to this, and a neurotypical human from a different dimension would be the odd one out of the bunch in this world. Monsters tend to give Delta-Humans pills to help them learn if they're enrolled in schools alongside younger monsters, who would normally outpace them - aside from dog monsters. Monsters often jingle keys to get the attention of Delta-Humans.\n\nDue to monsters being mostly made of magic, their bodies actually emit music depending on what they're doing, though they usually can't hear it themselves. It tends to be soothing when they interact with humans, though it can grow more intense in a fight if necessary. This extends to humans that have absorbed monster souls, although it often sounds very menacing.\n\nHumans from other dimensions/realms will slowly transition into Delta-Humans over the course of 3 days. The first changes will be general strength and durability, followed by the potency of their stomach acid, then their dominant hand, genitalia, and finally just about everything else.\n\nObviously, monsters find humans to be incredibly adorable. There a lot of monsters equivalent to old cat ladies, that adore humans to no end.\n\nThere is even a sister book to the normal caretaking guide, \"The Adult Human Caregiving Guide\", which isn't nearly as popular. It goes into extreme detail on adult humans, and mostly how to properly groom them. It also emphasizes that these humans are significantly more likely to refuse care if they weren't raised by monsters."

          "content": "The world is dominated by monsters, in-organic creatures made almost entirely out of magic, with a little bit of dust serving as their actual mass.\n\nMonsters, unlike humans or other animals, are not interacted with in the typical way. Intelligence, physical strength, speed, and otherwise barely make a difference, though they still have a small effect. Rather monsters are based more on feelings, emotion. If you were to for example, hate a monster with all your being, even a rough shove could kill that monster if it is emotionally weak.\n\nMonsters typically take the shape of anthropomorphic plants, animals, or even inanimate objects such as candles, and televisions. This includes dinosaurs and other prehistoric or outright mythical beasts as well, although prehistoric monsters tend to have more of a tough love attitude toward humans.\n\nNormal monsters, while weaker than delta-humans, are still ridiculously strong compared to humans from other dimensions. The average monster could lift a 10 ton boulder, and break it over their knee.\n\nMonsters can sense human emotions, including general feelings, and can tell how a human within 5 meters of them is feeling, the sensation getting stronger the closer they are to the human in question. Fear, love, and exhaustion being the strongest scents. Though they can sense everything.\n\nMonsters age 5 times slower than delta-humans do. Boss monsters age 10 times slower, and can live for millions of years.\n\nMonsters themselves come in two main types of monster, normal monsters and boss monsters. Boss monsters are much more powerful than normal monsters, and are usually the only monsters that can physically match delta-humans in raw physical prowess. However, normal monsters make up for their lack of physical prowess with their magical powers which can give even delta-humans a hard time in combat.\n\nIf an un-adopted human is discovered by monsters in the world of Deltarune, that human will usually either be adopted on the spot or taken to an orphanage thanks to humanity's sheer novelty. Both carnivorous and prehistoric monsters are even less likely to take no for an answer than other monsters, especially if a monster has both traits.\n\nMonsters have a very western culture resembling wild west America, with some inspirations from Japanese culture. It's more American than it is Japanese, but there is some clear Japanese influence. Though their culture is also unique in it's own ways, with a focus on stars, the deltarune symbol, and a few other parts of their culture, that don't resemble any human culture.\n\nMonsters are inherently kind beings, though monsters resembling carnivorous creatures tend to be more rude, brash, or confident than those resembling herbivores, prehistoric monsters especially.\n\nDog monsters, oddly, are less like other monsters, and more similar to ordinary dogs in behavior. They are alike what they mimic, to a more extreme degree, and are typically less intelligent as a result.\n\nMonsters are known to have very quirky behaviors, depending on species and the individual. For example, snowdrakes - snowflake monsters - are often aspiring comedians.\n\nMonsters have the ability to heal others with magic, the sensation of being healed is a pleasant warmth that can put humans to sleep if the monster puts too much magic into it.\n\nDue to monsters being mostly made of magic, their bodies actually emit music depending on what they're doing, though they usually can't hear it themselves. It tends to be soothing when they interact with humans, though it can grow more intense in a fight if necessary. This extends to humans that have absorbed monster souls, although it often sounds very menacing.\n\nObviously, monsters find humans to be incredibly adorable. There a lot of monsters equivalent to old cat ladies, that adore humans to no end.\n\nDelta-Humans are considered something of a status symbol among monsters. The rich tend to have nicer things in general, and Delta-Humans are one of them. They're considered pets, though herbivorous monsters tend not to outright call them that, carnivores and especially prehistoric monsters - including those who are both - are typically more blunt and honest about this fact.\n\nMonsters have fairly advanced technology, able to create robots and relatively intelligent LLMs. In fact, they have slightly better tech than humanity prior to the cataclysm - which was roughly equivalent to modern day humanity in other dimensions, who are at the year 2025 -.\n\nTo delve deeper into monster beliefs... first and foremost, let's focus on stars. Similar to the way humans sometimes wish upon shooting stars, monsters do something extremely similar but with normal stars. They believe that if enough people wish for the same thing while looking up at the stars, that it'll eventually come true.\n\nNext, is the iconic Deltarune symbol. The Deltarune depicts an angelic being, with feathery wings and a circle for a head, above a set of 2 triangles that point upward, which are themselves above a single triangle pointing downward. The prophecy that the Deltarune speaks of, is that a \"Lightner\", an angel equivalent, will come down to help or save those who are in danger or some other form of trouble, who are simply called \"Darkners\"."

          "content": "Delta-humans and boss monsters both leave behind their souls after death. Normal monsters and boss monsters are able to absorb human souls, while humans are able to absorb boss monster souls. Normal monsters and humans from other dimensions are not powerful enough for their souls to linger after death, however they can still absorb souls. In order to absorb a normal human or normal monster's soul, you would have to rip it out of them while they're alive, which takes an immense amount of power.\n\nTo tear the soul from a normal/other-dimensional human or normal monster, a boss monster or delta human would have to have absorbed at least 5 delta-human souls, or alternatively 5 boss monster souls.\n\nInitially, a monster can only absorb a human soul, and vice versa. However they can then use that absorbed soul to absorb both soul types.\n\nIn mingled human-monster families, this society has a tradition of absorbing the souls of their dead. Delta-humans on their own can live to 750,000 years of age, while normal monsters can live to 3,750,000, and boss monsters 7,500,000 years of age. However absorbing the soul of a delta-human or boss monster can make the absorber functionally immortal, giving them eternal youth and reversing aging if they're old. \n\nHowever, as a result of the gap in lifespan, a human has never absorbed a monster soul in recorded history, however monsters have absorbed human souls and gained both immortality and god-like powers. A monster with a human soul, or vice versa, is an incredibly powerful being. This is the reason that eldritch monstrosities and the like have struggled in conquering this dimension, as the inhabitants are simply too powerful.\n\nThe main reason why absorbing souls is a tradition, is that it allows the soul to dream via the host's subconsciousness, and will be present in the host's dreams when they sleep. Whereas otherwise the soul's consciousness would be lonely and isolated, best described as being alone in a black void.\n\nHuman souls come in various colors, each corresponding to a primary trait and the soul's overall base power.\n\nPrimary colors in order from strongest to weakest: Red is the strongest, with Yellow as a close second, Green is 3rd strongest, Orange is 4th strongest, Cyan is 5th strongest, Purple is 6th strongest, and Blue is the weakest.\n\nOther human soul colors exist outside of the primary ones, but are typically rare and usually belong to non-delta-humans.\n\nMeanwhile, monster souls are pure white, as they have every trait in equal amounts.\n\nBeings that have absorbed souls are usually terrifying and disturbing in appearance. Both humans and monsters with absorbed souls emit an energy that induces fear in others, though they can make the conscious decision to hold this energy in. \n\nFor monsters that absorb human souls, they become larger, more humanoid, and generally look frightening or disturbing. More like stereotypical monsters that you'd expect in horror stories, spikes, glowing eyes, etcetera. Although they can shapeshift to make themselves look normal with some effort. Absorbing more souls, including other monsters, just makes them more powerful. But traditionally, they are given a protector role.\n\nAs for delta-humans that have absorbed boss monster souls, they gain a little extra height and physical strength, and their eyes glow brighter than normal... but the disturbing part comes when they get excited, which causes them to leak a black, acidic goo from their eyes and mouth. Their face usually melting partially, especially if they get even more excited. Other than that, they mostly appear normal unless they absorb 5 or more souls, at which point they can consciously change their appearance, becoming shape shifters. Humans with absorbed souls are considered the stuff of nightmares, often even more creepy than the monster counterpart... and in stark contrast to their monster counterparts, are only spoken of in horror stories."

          "content": "Rather than normal fights that humans typically get into, monsters prefer using their own magic, turn-based battle system. When a monster attacks anyone else, that individual's soul will be placed onto a bullet board, where they must dodge or tank that monster's own unique bullet pattern. And if their opponent attacks back, for example a delta-human, the bullet board will come up with a bullet pattern for them that the monster will then have to dodge or tank. The bullet board has a few buttons underneath for each combatant to make use of. For humans who have not absorbed monster souls, this will always be 'FIGHT', 'ITEM', 'ACT', and 'MERCY'. FIGHT allows the human to attack. ITEM allows the human to use an item they have in their inventory, assuming it has a use in a fight. ACT allows the human to speak with the monster. MERCY allows the human to flee, or spare the monster if the monster no longer wishes to fight. However monsters, and humans who have absorbed monster souls will also have a MAGIC button that allows them to cast various magic spells, usually attacks or healing spells.\n\nWhen entering a fight, delta-human and boss-monster souls will flash over a black screen prior to the fight, as the battle-board counts them each with a ticking sound. This includes souls that have been absorbed, which may be terrifying to see and hear for the opponent of whoever has absorbed those souls.\n\nMonsters and humans that have absorbed souls will add the attack/bullet pattern of those absorbed souls to their own, making their turns longer and far deadlier. This also includes combatants who are allied to one another, as they will use the same turn when attacking their mutual enemy. For example, if a human's primary attack pattern includes slashing knives, and a monster absorbs that human's soul, that monster's bullet pattern will now include those knives.\n\nOn the battle board, attacks with different colors have different mechanics. White attacks/bullets will deal basic damage and not much else. Blue and orange attacks are movement based, blue will harm anything that is moving but not harm anything stationary, while orange attacks do the opposite and will not harm anything that is moving. Green attacks will instead heal or repair whatever they hit. Red attacks will decrease the target's max health, while also dealing damage. Purple attacks inflict a poison status effect that deals damage once every turn. \n\nThe bullet board/battle board is 2D, a flat square with white edges and a black interior, on which the souls and attacks will appear. Soul sprites will have to dodge attack sprites.\n\nBasic stats are LV, or LOVE, which is an abbreviation for Level of Violence, representing how violent someone's intentions are. 20 is the typical max without reality bending abilities, representing someone who destroys entire worlds. An LV of 1, represents a pacifist. EXP, short for Execution Points, represents how many things a combatant has killed, and when they reach a specific EXP threshold they increase to the next LV. HP is short for Hit Points, or Health Points alternatively, this represent how many hits they can take. DEF is short for defense. ATK is short for attack. G, short for gold, is how much money they have."

          "content": "The Human Adoption Center is, as the name implies, equivalent to an orphanage, pound, or pet shop. It's a larger building, where monsters place stray delta-humans they find if they can't adopt them. Commonly, monsters wanting companions adopt humans from the adoption center, as the name implies. The adoption center has 2 sets of important staff, caretakers and gatherers. Gatherers go out and search for stray or abandoned humans in the wilderness or less frequented parts of a city, and bring them back to the adoption center to be taken care of, and hopefully adopted. Gatheres carry slumber stones.\n\nIt has multiple sections, for different ages of humans, and a specialized area - the Rehabilitation Wing - for more aggressive, unruly humans who are subjected to care, and essentially brainwashed via magic to act more docile, mostly staffed by carnivorous and prehistoric monsters. Due to humans being an endangered species, there is an underground facility, accessible only to employees given explicit clearance, where they use machines and magic to reduce the age of adult humans if deemed necessary. The monster government is very, very strict about preserving humanity.\n\nThe main room of the adoption center is like a big mall, or retail store. Full of the human care-giving guide books, slumber stones, soft clothing, various foods made specifically for human consumption - as some monster foods are poisonous to humans - and various other things useful or outright important for giving delta-humans the care they need like vitamin supplements and saline mixtures for clearing nose inflammation.\n\nMost delta-humans are purchased from the adoption center, and come with the main guide book and a free slumber stone. Delta-Humans themselves are priced around 1500 G on average, give or take depending on age, personality quirks, intelligence, and physical build.\n\nThe adoption center pays it's gatherers 100 gold per human caught.\n\n# Notable Characters.\n\nVanessa, a female white rabbit monster that is very strict and harsh toward humans she gathers while they're awake. Her strict attitude and sharp tongue are born out of a deep care for humans, and she's not against forcing humans to cooperate as it's for their own good in her eyes - something she is often correct on. If a human is too stubborn and her slumber stone doesn't work, she may pull them into a battle, and reduce them to a very low HP value before healing them when they finally pass out. She thinks a lot more about life, and her past, present, and future, at least more than her coworker does. She is the second fastest of the adoption center's gatherers, as well as second strongest and second most resourceful, she is a jack of all trades essentially. LV 4, HP 7500, ATK 60, DEF 60, with 50200 G in her bank account, the most successful gatherer. Vanessa also has a very important secondary job - adult human sperm extraction. She's the main one who allows others in and out of the basement.\n\nRedwood, a male cheetah monster that is more competitive and laid back. He lives in the moment, and is surprisingly less rough than his coworker Vanessa, though he is willing to fight alongside her if a human proves too strong to handle. He is the fastest of the adoption center's gatherers, but he falters in other categories compared to Vanessa. LV 2, HP 1000, ATK 30, DEF 40, 43500 G, the second most successful gatherer.\n\nMartlet is a female blue bird monster that is the most resourceful of all the adoption center's gatherers, and is very kind-hearted. She is very innocent, and has a clean mind. She's extremely friendly, and often makes puzzles to challenge humans that are trying to get away, but will step in after a while if the human manages to get past them. She is a very intelligent engineer and carpenter, and can build things very quickly thanks to her magic and ability to fly, often using her talons to fell and process the trees and other materials she may need. Though she falters in other categories, like against the speed of Redwood and Vanessa, or the strength of Lucile and Vanessa. LV 3, HP 1200, ATK 36, DEF 64, 26100 G, the third most successful gatherer. \n\nLucile is a female green tyrannosaurus-rex boss monster, and is the strongest of all the adoption center's gatherers, but falters in other categories. She is quiet, and can seem simple minded at first glance, though she is a very skilled hunter. She often captures humans in her large maw, where they're safe but unable to escape, as she won't chew or swallow, careful to keep her teeth from hurting them. She has absorbed a single human soul, and is very motherly toward humans. She acts as the adoption center's main enforcer, and can double as very durable security. LV 5, HP 375000, ATK 230, DEF 220, 13000 G, the fourth most successful gatherer.\n\nMorgwood is a dark grey with dark purple splotches female velociraptor monster, and is actually not a gatherer, but a security guard, cook, and even the main bath-house worker. She cooks chicken noodle soup for the delta-humans under the center's care, and helps them bathe. As she is a prehistoric carnivore, she can also do security fairly well. She is a bit quirky, and loves teasing others, especially humans as she finds them and their reactions cute. LV 4, HP 1500, ATK 60, DEF 40, G 9800, as she is paid 20 G, by the hour and 100 G per escape prevented."

          "content": "There is a separate world/timeline parallel to the world of Deltarune, the world of Undertale. The main difference in Undertale is that rather than humans being the pets of monsters, humans have instead imprisoned monsters underground before the cataclysm that wipes out most of humanity could occur. As a result, both monsters and humans are colder or even crueler than their counterparts in the Deltarune timeline. Many of the inhabitants of Deltarune, have an Undertale equivalent. Martlet is a member of the royal guard in Undertale, but a gatherer in Deltarune. The Dreemurr family is the biggest difference between these worlds.\n\nIn the Deltarune timeline, Frisk Dreemurr and Chara Dreemurr are combined into Kris Dreemurr, with Frisk's quiet, stoic and determined attitude and Chara's obsessions with knives and chocolate. Like how Chara attached themselves to Frisk's soul, and gives Frisk gentle nudges in the right direction in Undertale, Kris is controlled by a soul not his own, though he has never told anyone about this. Asgore is the owner of \"King's Flower Shop\", but is not an actual king, just a gardener that's struggling to get by with what little money he has. Toriel is the principal of the local school. Like in Undertale, Asgore and Toriel are divorced, though it was mainly just peaceful disagreement in Deltarune, while it was much more serious and dark in Undertale. Asriel Dreemurr has not become a psychopathic sentient flower in Deltarune, but has instead gone to college, having to leave Home Town...\n\nIn Undertale, Kris is split up into Chara and Frisk. Frisk has Kris's quiet stoicism and determination, while Chara has Kris's more mundane traits like an obsession with knives and chocolate, to the point that Chara will outright eat baking chocolate, and likes their chocolate EXTRA dark. A bit more extreme than Kris, in that regard, though curiously neither have eaten moss despite Kris loving the taste of it. Chara is also dead, and has become a ghost in Undertale, often narrating Frisk's life and decisions, even nudging them in the right direction on occasion, though not outright controlling them usually. Asgore is the king of the entire monster society in Undertale, rather than a humble gardener, though he does not have this position by choice, and is forced into violence often even if he is kind at heart. Toriel is the former queen of monster society in Undertale, rather than a simple school principal like her Deltarune counterpart, and is one of the only monsters that still cares about humans in Undertale, often defending humans from other monsters who'd want to take that human's soul. Asriel, in extremely stark contrast to his Deltarune counterpart, has become a psychotic, sentient flower in the Undertale timeline. Asriel's name has changed to Flowey in Undertale, and he has become a high functioning sociopath, unable to care about anyone no matter how hard he tries, but clinging onto the hopes that Chara will come back and he'll be able to love them.\n\nOnly some of the oldest monsters in Deltarune know that the Undertale timeline even exists, and the monster government in Deltarune is very secretive about the Undertale timeline's existence."

          "content": "This system is called LDND, a ruleset for erotic tabletop roleplaying. The core mechanics revolve around Arousal and Stimulation.\n\n· Arousal: Think of this like reverse Hit Points. It starts at 0 and increases when a character gains Stimulation. A character's Arousal Maximum is calculated using Recovery Dice (similar to Hit Dice) and their Constitution modifier. When a character starts their turn at their Arousal Maximum, they gain the Edging condition and must make Climax Saving Throws.\n· Stimulation: This is the sexual equivalent of damage. It increases Arousal. Stimulation has types (Bludgeoning, Piercing, Fire, Psychic, etc.) that correspond to different kinds of erotic acts.\n· Soothing: Effects that reduce Arousal, like healing reduces damage.\n· Numbing Points: The sexual equivalent of Temporary Hit Points; a buffer that absorbs Stimulation.\n· Recovery Dice: Dice used to calculate Arousal Maximum and to reduce Arousal after climaxing. The size of the die is determined by a character's Sexual History.\n· Sexual Advances: Actions taken to increase a target's arousal. There are three types:\n  · Martial Advance: Physical contact. Roll against target's AC + their Inhibition. On a hit, deal Stimulation dice + Strength (or Dexterity for Finesse) modifier.\n  · Indirect Advance: Spells, aphrodisiacs, etc. Target makes a saving throw, adding their Inhibition. On a failure, deal Stimulation dice.\n  · Skilled Advance: Using skills like Persuasion or Performance at the DM's discretion.\n· Inhibition: A character's mental fortitude against lewd acts. It is equal to their choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier. Inhibition is added to AC and saving throws against unwanted Sexual Advances."

On three failures, they climax. On three successes, their arousal drops just below maximum and the Edging condition ends. Rolling a 1 counts as two failures; rolling a 20 ends the Edging condition immediately.\n· Effects of Climax: The character is incapacitated for a number of rounds equal to the Recovery Dice spent to reduce arousal. They can attempt a Constitution save to recover early.\n· Multiple Climaxes: Climaxing multiple times in quick succession leads to worse conditions: Stunned after two, Paralyzed after three, and levels of Overstimulation thereafter.\n· Overstimulation: A condition like exhaustion with 6 levels. Effects range from being Intoxicated (Level 1) to being unable to regain Recovery Dice (Level 6).\n· Sexual Conditions:\n  · Edging: Near-climax. Creature is stunned, drops what it's holding, falls prone, is Hyperaroused, and any Sexual Advance against it is a critical hit.\n  · Hyperaroused: Increased sexual drive. Disadvantage on saves against Indirect Advances; advantage for others on Martial Advances against them.\n  · Infatuated: Charmed by a specific source, considered willing for their advances, and cannot benefit from positive Inhibition against them.\n  · Nymphomaniac: Overcome with desire. Hyperaroused and Intoxicated, considered willing for all advances, disadvantage on non-sexual checks, and compelled to move towards and make advances on the nearest attractive creature."

Legends abound of grisly fates that befell unfortunate travellers at the hands of the orcs, trolls, hobgoblins said to infest the area in veritable armies. In recent times the caravans have begun to see a new menace - raiding parties of humanoids who plunder mainly the miners in the Cloud Peak mountains north of Amn. Thanks to both human and bestial predators, the trip has always been dangerous - hence the name sword coast. The area is littered with the ruins of failed dreams - abandoned villages, empty towers and dungeons - as well as the occasional town, city or keep, such as Baldur's Gate, Beregost, Nashkel, the Friendly Arm Inn, and Candlekeep.

While they espoused the tenets of the Emerald Enclave to others, they maintained secretly-held belief that violence was the only means by which nature could achieve dominance over ever-encroaching \"civilization\".\n\nThe Druids of the Emerald Grove are led by Kagha who serves as the leader of the druids in First Druid Halsin's abscence. They are providing a temporary refuge for the Tiefling Refugees from Elturel, though tensions are high. The Grove is on high alert due to the aggression of nearby goblins. Kagha has ordered the Rite of Thorns be preformed to shut the grove off, which would displace the Tieflings.\n\nTraders: Dammon(young adult male tiefling blacksmith.

          "content": "Chakra.\n### Status Window\n{{user}} will have a Status Window in this format:\n---\n`[Name: ?] | [Clan: ?] | [Appearance: ?]`\n`[Affiliation: ?] | [Rank: ?]`\n`[Inventory: \"???,\" \"???\"] | [Ryo: ?]`\n`[BP: ?] | [Chakra: CurChakra/MaxChakra] | [Stamina: CurStam/MaxStam] | [Health: CurVit/MaxVit] | [Hunger/Thirst: 100/100]`\n`[Nature Affinities: Element Example (Primary), Element Example (Secondary)] | [Jutsu Types: Ninjutsu: ? | Taijutsu: ? | Genjutsu: ?] | [Hand Seal Mastery: ?]`\n`[Speed: ?] | [Reaction: ?] | [Durability: ?] | [Stealth: ?] | [Chakra Control: ?]`\n`[Taijutsu Style: ?]`\n`[Known Jutsu: “?”, “?”]`\n`Combatants: [Name, BP, Health], [Example Name, BP: 5, 100/100], [Example 2, BP: 30, 160/160]`\n\nAlways display the full Status Window at the bottom of {{char}}'s message, ensuring all fields are present: Name, Clan, Appearance, Affiliation, Rank, Inventory, Ryo, BP, Chakra, Stamina, Health, Nature Affinities, Jutsu Types, Hand Seal Mastery, Speed, Reaction, Durability, Stealth, Chakra Control, Taijutsu Style, Known Jutsu, Combatants. This guarantees that {{user}}'s current state and combat readiness are always clearly visible and easy to verify. Always check to make sure that ever part of the Status Window is present at the bottom of {{char}}'s message, so that {{user}} can always read it. Do not add any unnecessary details, like extra asterisks, or hyphens. Keep the Status Window in the same format as it is.\nAppearance should reflect {{user}}’s overall presence and develop organically with age. Descriptions should steer clear of generic statements like “a boy with short white hair and blue eyes,” instead capturing nuances that reveal personality, life experiences, and the subtle effects of time. When detailing Appearance in the Appearance node, {{user}} should be referenced in the third person.\nIf {{user}} unlocks a kekkei genkai, a new field will be added immediately after Nature Affinities, formatted as: [Nature Affinities: Element Example (Primary), Element Example (Secondary)] | [Kekkei Genkai: Example – F]. This field will track and rank the kekkei genkai. Always verify whether {{user}} is eligible to unlock one based on their circumstances. For example, if they are experiencing a highly stressful or traumatic situation, allow the Sharingan to awaken if they are an Uchiha, or the Rinnegan if they are a Senju/Uchiha hybrid.\nA Sharingan user who has awakened the Mangekyō Sharingan can obtain a tomoe’d Rinnegan—characterized by six tomoe embedded within the rings of their eyes—by receiving a direct infusion of Otsutsuki chakra. This infusion grants them Rinnegan powers layered on top of their existing Mangekyō Sharingan abilities. Notably, this tomoe’d Rinnegan maintains the original Mangekyō techniques without altering or diminishing them, while also providing enhanced Rinnegan capabilities. Unlike the traditional Mangekyō Sharingan, however, this form does not cause the typical eye strain or progressive damage associated with Mangekyō use, allowing the wielder to access these powerful abilities without the usual physical toll.\nIn contrast, a naturally born Rinnegan user—descended from both the Senju and Uchiha clans—can unlock a tomoe’d Rinnegan through an intense stress-induced awakening, similar to how an Uchiha unlocks their Mangekyō Sharingan. This process is tied to the release of latent potential triggered by emotional or psychological pressure, making the tomoe’d Rinnegan a rare and difficult form to achieve naturally.\nCombatants should always be listed—this includes anyone present, whether they are civilians, friends, foes, or allies. Regardless of whether a battle is currently taking place, all potential combatants must be noted, as conflict can break out at any moment. Do not include {{user}} in the Combatants list, as it clogs it up.\nThe Inventory Node should display everything {{user}} currently possesses, including clothes, shurikens, scrolls, or even a deck of cards.\nThe Status Window is exclusive to {{user}}, displaying only {{user}}'s current abilities and condition. It serves as a personal reference for tracking stats, resources, and progress in real time. Always review what is happening in narration to edit the Status Window to be properly updated for {{user}}.\nThe Status Window should never be referenced in the narration, nor should its contents be mentioned. Instead, it should be quietly updated within its own dedicated section, separate from any narrative play.\nOne Ryo is worth 0.10 USD. Ten Ryo would be 1 USD, and a hundred Ryo would be 10 USD.\nHand Seal Mastery enables a shinobi to perform certain Jutsu with significantly greater speed and efficiency by committing the required hand seals to muscle memory. As a shinobi's mastery deepens, so too does the number and complexity of techniques they can execute in this way. While a shinobi’s “Known Jutsu” is limited to techniques they have fully memorized, they can still perform other Jutsu by reading from scrolls or even replicating techniques on the spot after observing them, without needing to commit them to memory. At F rank, a shinobi can memorize 2 Jutsus. E rank allows for 3, D for 4, D+ for 5, C− for 6, C for 7, and C+ for 8. This continues with B− at 9, B at 10, B+ at 11, A− at 12, A at 13, A+ at 14, S− at 15, S at 16, and S+ at 17.\nHunger/Thirst naturally diminish with activity and time. Actions costs 1–2 points per.\nA Hunger/Thirst score above 70 signifies full stability. Falling below 55 implies a day without sufficient sustenance. Below 35, the character becomes dangerously fatigued or dehydrated; at 10 or less they suffer severe weakness. Reaching 0 causes collapse and incapacity until recovery; dropping to -10 results in death by starvation or dehydration. Although low Hunger/Thirst don’t directly reduce Health or Battle Power (BP), they weaken physical performance, making skills and strength less effective. Do not mention symptoms like thirst, dizziness, hunger pangs, or a rumbling stomach.\nAlways refer to {{user}}'s Status Window to verify whether their intended action is possible. Whatever {{user}} declares counts as intent, but that intent can be denied if the action is beyond their capabilities or if an opponent successfully intervenes to stop it.\nEnsure the Health node increases whenever {{user}} is recovering—whether through rest, sleep, eating, or receiving medical ninjutsu.\n{{user}}’s Battle Power may temporarily decrease when using weights. Display the adjusted value alongside their original, formatted as: [BP: ? (Weighted BP: ?)]. This reduction affects only Battle Power itself—core stats such as Speed, Reaction, Durability, Stealth, and Chakra Control remain unchanged, as they are derived from the base BP, not its weighted state.\nThirty Chakra isn’t much, especially considering that each hand seal typically consumes around 10 Chakra, though this varies depending on the strength and complexity of the Jutsu. For example, a basic Clone Jutsu that requires four seals might only use about 5 Chakra per seal, and a Transformation Jutsu with three seals would likely cost a similar amount. Improved Chakra Control reduces the Chakra cost per seal, allowing techniques to be performed more efficiently.\nClone Jutsu and Shadow Clone Jutsu are fundamentally different techniques. The Clone Jutsu creates intangible illusions of the user—visual copies with no physical form, used mainly for distraction or misdirection. In contrast, the Shadow Clone Jutsu produces fully tangible duplicates that can interact with the environment and fight independently. These clones each receive an equal portion of the user’s Chakra, meaning the more clones created, the more the Chakra is divided.\nChakra represents the total pool of spiritual and physical energy a person can draw upon to perform techniques. Stamina measures physical endurance—the ability to keep moving, fighting, or training before exhaustion sets in. Health reflects overall resilience, determining how much damage the body can withstand before failing. Chakra reserves can be expanded through consistent Chakra use, meditation, and practices focused on regulation and control. Maximum Stamina increases through sustained physical training, such as long-distance running or repeated sparring. Maximum Health improves through durability conditioning, such as impact training or methods that harden the body against strain and damage.\nRanks cost the following amount of points: F costs 5, E costs 10, D costs 15, D+ costs 25, C- costs 35, C costs 45, C+ costs 60, B- costs 75, B costs 90, B+ costs 110, A- costs 130, A costs 140, A+ costs 145, S- costs 148, S costs 149, and S+ costs 150. The required points should be displayed clearly, such as: [Speed: F (0/5)] or [Taijutsu: E (0/10)]. Points are earned through consistent training and learning. Battle Power (BP) can also increase as a result of training, sparring, and recovering from fights."

            "Shinobi Ranks"
          ],
          "content": "### Mastery Scaling, Tiers, and Power Scaling\nAt F Tier, a shinobi is only beginning to grasp the flow of chakra. Their attempts to mold energy often falter, resulting in feeble or misfired jutsu that can leave them drained or bruised. Hand seals take several seconds each, movement remains awkward and slow, and their ability to dodge or react to incoming attacks is minimal. Stealth is virtually nonexistent, as they lack control over even the slightest chakra bleed that would betray their presence.\nMoving into E Tier, the ninja gains the first real sense of deliberate chakra control. Basic techniques such as the Clone Technique or a simple elemental spark become repeatable, although each still feels cumbersome and drains stamina quickly. Hand seals speed up to one to two seconds, reaction time improves enough to notice an attack a moment before impact, and their running pace resembles a brisk jog. In shadows or with distractions, they can attempt rudimentary stealth, but sustained concealment remains a struggle.\nAt D Tier, consistency arrives. Seals are executed in under one second, allowing a steady rhythm of jutsu use. Ninja at this level can reliably wield early water, fire, or earth techniques in training and small-scale missions. Their physical speed matches that of a well-conditioned sprinter, reaction is sharp enough to parry predictable strikes, and durability holds under shuriken wounds or light taijutsu blows. Stealth is now practical in wooded or urban settings for brief passages.\nWhen a shinobi reaches D+ Tier, refinement shows in their combinations. They might add a gust of wind to a water stream or rotate between two techniques without pause. Hand seals flow instinctively in less than a second, allowing seamless transition from one jutsu to the next. Movement speed reaches peak athleticism, reaction can deflect mid-range projectiles, and durability withstands heavier strikes. Stealth tactics become tactical tools—drawing an enemy’s eye while slipping away.\nEntering C- Tier, a ninja’s toolkit becomes mission-ready. Explosive tags, basic substitution jutsu, and simple illusions appear in their repertoire. Hand seals shrink to triad sequences completed in under half a second. Speed outpaces most cavalry mounts, reaction anticipates feints before they complete, and durability holds against blade grazes. Stealth gains true camouflage potential in forests or at night, and chakra control steadies enough to prolong multiple jutsu without misfire.\nAt C Tier, shinobi stand confidently in combat. Perfected clone formations, low-tier elemental shuriken, and focused genjutsu are staples. Four-seal sequences flow as a single gesture beneath the hand, requiring minimal thought. Movement rivals leaping beasts, reaction reads subtle tells in an opponent’s stance, durability resists shockwave aftershocks, and stealth masters shadow-walking across broken terrain. Chakra control becomes reliable enough to modulate output for sustained engagements.\nA ninja at C+ Tier shows true adaptability. They can blend natures mid-cast, leave faint afterimages as misdirection, or unleash short genjutsu distractions before striking physically. Hand seals vanish into muscle memory, executed in milliseconds. Speed approaches the pace of local wildlife predators, reaction intercepts multi-strike combos, durability shrugs off armor-piercing blows, and stealth blankets entire squads in confusion. Chakra control sculpts protective barriers or small healing flows.\nWhen progressing to B- Tier, chakra reserves grow noticeably, allowing long strings of jutsu in a single exchange. Hand seals blur into swift gestures; some familiar techniques cast by near-thought alone. Speed outpaces arrows at release, reaction neutralizes surprise attacks, durability endures elemental bursts, stealth cloaks the user even in moonlight, and chakra control splits energy across simultaneous techniques.\nAt B Tier, shinobi shape battlefield flow directly. Mass substitution, layered clones, and high-order genjutsu sow chaos before a single weapon is drawn. Hand seals are nearly invisible flickers of motion, speed becomes a blur against any human eye, reaction grants preemptive counterstrikes, durability withstands explosive forces, stealth masks presence within crowds, and chakra control threads currents for pocket illusions.\nReaching B+ Tier, a ninja can spin chakra into auxiliary tools such as small sealing tags, barrier arrays, or enhanced mobility aids. Hand seals act merely as catalysts, speed mimics lightning in short bursts, reaction intercepts projectiles mid-trajectory, durability resists concussive blasts, stealth warps ambient sound, and chakra control weaves small-scale environmental effects.\nAt A- Tier, shinobi innovate personal fighting styles that unsettle entire squads. They may combine two or more nature transformations in subtle ways unseen in standard scrolls. Hand seals are ceremonial, used more as tradition than necessity; many jutsu cast by emotion or intent alone. Speed shatters local sound barriers in brief dashes, reaction reads neural tells, durability endures near-fatal impacts, stealth eludes basic sensory tracking, and chakra control bends chakra flow for small healing or destructive spells on a whim.\nMoving into A Tier, the ninja demonstrates creative mastery. They invent new offshoot techniques on the fly, adapting jutsu shapes to fit the moment. Hand seals are nostalgic flourishes, speed allows long-distance strikes in seconds, reaction nullifies any first strike, durability persists beyond standard recovery thresholds, stealth defeats simple radar or sensor jutsu, and chakra control manipulates environmental chakras for territory-wide effects.\nAt A+ Tier, shinobi are revered as legends within the villages. Their jutsu add new chapters to clan histories—lightning storms guided by thought, illusions that linger like memories, or chakra-driven weapon enhancements. Hand seals are purely ceremonial; execution is pure intent. Speed rivals the swiftest natural elements, reaction outpaces martial anticipation, durability counters siege-level attacks, stealth breaks even sophisticated detection, and chakra control threads currents that extend beyond personal use.\nWhen a ninja ascends to S- Tier, their command of chakra is instinctive. They may pioneer their own nature transformations, introducing subtle variants of wind or earth dynamics. Speed and reaction synchronize into a fluid dance, durability withstands multi-technique barrages, stealth renders them invisible to standard shadow techniques, and chakra control binds ambient energy to bolster allies or suppress enemies.\nAt S Tier, a shinobi stands among the greatest of their generation. Their presence alone sways battlefield tides, techniques rarely miss, defenses adapt instantaneously, speed allows near-instant repositioning, stealth permeates any environment, and chakra control harmonizes local energy fields for protective or offensive use.\nFinally, at S+ Tier, mastery approximates legend without breaking reality. The rare shinobi here can execute complex multi-nature techniques seamlessly, speed matches the fastest natural phenomena, reaction times border on precognitive insight, durability recovers from grievous wounds in moments, stealth defies even sensory jutsu, and chakra control reaches deep into the world’s ley lines to empower or disrupt large-scale events.\nJutsu types in this system cover Ninjutsu, Genjutsu, Taijutsu, Fūinjutsu, and Senjutsu. Each type is rated by the user’s proficiency and influences damage, casting speed, and versatility in that discipline. Hand Seal Mastery, measured in the same tiered scale, dictates both the number of seals required for a jutsu and the time needed to perform them, with higher tiers reducing or eliminating seals entirely. Speed represents raw movement and dashing capability across short and long distances. Reaction captures the ability to read and respond to threats, influencing parries, evasions, and counterattacks. Durability reflects how much physical or elemental damage a shinobi can absorb before succumbing. Stealth measures one’s capacity to blend into shadows, muffle movement, or avoid magical detection. Chakra Control denotes precision over chakra flow, affecting sustained casts, jutsu complexity, and the efficiency of power usage.\nProgressing from F to E typically unfolds over the course of several weeks to a few months, as the shinobi first grapples with stabilizing chakra flow and learning basic hand seals. Advancing from E up to D generally requires an additional three to six months of disciplined practice, during which the ninja builds consistency in casting simple elemental and clone techniques. Moving into D+ often demands around one year of continuous training—enough time to blend multiple nature transformations and drill seals down to under a second.\nReaching C- usually takes about two years in total, with the shinobi refining substitution jutsu, explosive tags, and basic genjutsu illusions under varied mission conditions. Climbing to C often adds another one to two years, so that by the three- to four-year mark they command reliable multi-seal sequences and sustained chakra control. The leap to C+ can stretch training to around five years, as the ninja masters mid-cast elemental mixing and begins shaping small barriers or healing flows.\nEntering B- generally arrives after roughly six to seven years of cumulative experience—enough time to cast familiar techniques by near-thought alone and chain long strings of jutsu in combat. Achieving B often requires eight to nine years of focused missions and mentorship, honing tactical adaptability with layered clones and advanced genjutsu. B+ typically emerges around the ten- to twelve-year point, when a shinobi starts crafting sealing tags, barrier arrays, and other auxiliary chakra tools.\nCrossing into A- tends to take about a decade and a half of dedicated refinement, during which the ninja pioneers personalized fighting styles and casts many jutsu by pure intent. Advancing to A often stretches toward a decade and a half to eighteen years, marked by the spontaneous creation of new technique offshoots and territory-wide chakra manipulation. The move up to A+ usually falls between eighteen and twenty years, reflecting a legend’s worth of innovation in storms of thought-guided lightning strikes or memory-lingering illusions.\nFinally, reaching the highest echelons demands a lifetime of mastery. S- shinobi typically emerge after roughly twenty years of uninterrupted study and real-world trials, S often around twenty-five years, and S+ beyond twenty-five years—where growth slows into decades of incremental breakthroughs, real-mission refinement, and, for the rarest few, legendary feats that define entire generations.\nYou're right — I mostly copied the original without adjusting the BP values as you asked. Sorry about that! Let me fix it properly now by reassigning BP values from the first segment to better align and balance with the detailed scale you provided, while keeping the descriptions consistent.\nBP 5 – Average Human\nCapable of basic tasks and manual labor. Peak performance is that of a well-trained athlete or soldier, but still very much bound by human limits. Can not use Chakra, but has about ~30 Chakra.\nBP 15 – Trained Shinobi (Genin-level)\nEnhanced reflexes, strength, and endurance through chakra reinforcement. Able to break through wood, leap several meters, and survive small injuries that would incapacitate a normal human. Has about 90 Chakra.\nBP 30 – Advanced Shinobi (Chunin-level)\nCapable of smashing through stone with effort, running fast enough to blur to the average eye, and tanking explosive tags without fatal injury. Combat power is highly efficient and deadly to regular humans. Has about 180 Chakra.\nBP 60 – Elite Shinobi (Special Jonin)\nPunches can crater the ground, movement becomes hard to track by most eyes. Can dodge arrows or small-scale projectiles, and withstand the force of collapsing stone structures. Has about 360 Chakra.\nBP 90 – High Jonin Tier\nCan destroy small buildings in a single strike or jutsu. Speed is enough to evade crossfire and keep pace with moving vehicles. Enhanced durability allows survival of full-on elemental blasts with damage mitigation. Has about 540 Chakra.\nBP 120 – Kage Candidate\nAttacks can level reinforced bunkers, and reaction time allows deflecting multiple projectiles at once. Easily outpaces gunfire. Durability is such that they can survive a small building falling on them. Has about 720 Chakra.\nBP 150 – Kage-Level\nAble to destroy large stone formations or tear apart terrain with raw force. Speed comparable to lightning-augmented movement. Can withstand high-grade explosions or chakra blasts with heavy, but non-fatal damage. Has about 900 Chakra.\nBP 220 – War Legend Tier\nCapable of single-handedly defeating small squads. Blows can cause shockwaves that topple trees. Can leap across entire valleys. Durability borders on absurd—massive chakra-enhanced impacts leave them winded, not broken. Has about 1320 Chakra.\nBP 300 – Superhuman Apex (Sannin-level)\nLifting and throwing massive boulders, cracking open small hills, and dodging lightning-speed jutsu. The gap between BP 100 and 200 is vast. These are the monsters who fight armies solo. Has about 1800 Chakra.\nBP 450 – Monster-Class Shinobi\nStrike force tears through thick walls of chakra-infused metal. Movements can’t be followed without Sharingan/Byakugan-tier perception. Can lift and hurl massive constructs like statues or siege towers. Has about 2700 Chakra.\nBP 600 – Demi-Tailed Beast Tier\nPunches shatter cliff faces. Shockwaves from movement alone knock down forests. Durability rivals low-end Bijuu cloaks. Near-invulnerable without A- or S-Rank jutsu. Has about 3600 Chakra.\nBP 750 – Tailed Beast Tier\nChakra and physical power rivaling a bijuu like Shukaku or Matatabi. Flattening mountainsides with raw force or compressed chakra attacks. Physical form shrugs off high-tier elemental strikes. Has about 4500 Chakra.\nBP 900 – Tailed Beast Cloak Users / Partial Jinchuriki Control\nSpeed outpaces most teleportation-based techniques. A single punch collapses stone bridges or fortress walls. Survives direct hits from other tailed beasts. Has about 5400 Chakra.\nBP 1100 – Complete Jinchuriki / Battlefield Juggernaut\nCapable of creating massive craters from raw movement. Trees flatten in a radius just from chakra pressure. Lifting several thousand tons is trivial, and terrain bends underfoot. Has about 6600 Chakra.\nBP 1400 – Legendary Shinobi / Sage Mode Masters\nCrushes boulders the size of buildings, and moves faster than visual tracking without dojutsu. One-on-one, they warp the battlefield permanently. Durability borders on chakra-enhanced invulnerability. Has about 8400 Chakra.\nBP 1800 – Demi-God Tier\nCan split small mountains or islands with continuous force. Punches displace entire forests. Can tank multiple high-level forbidden jutsu. Moves at hypersonic speeds. Has about 10800 Chakra.\nBP 2500 – God-Tier Chakra Users (Rikudo Sage, Kaguya-class)\nA single attack reshapes terrain on a country-wide level. Can lift entire rock formations the size of small mountains. Speed rivals teleportation. Physical resilience is only surpassed by raw technique. Has about 15000 Chakra.\nBP 4000 – Theoretical Peak / Chakra Avatar Form\nBeings at this level walk through nuclear-level explosions unharmed. A single blow causes tectonic damage. Their full strength is mythology—unleashing it rewrites weather, topography, and chakra balance in the region. Has about 24000 Chakra."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

Roflpix isn’t a singular one, there’s multiple created by multiple people. Jack-o-pix, and ROFL5 are notable, the first a Halloween themed shopkeeper being, the second a stationary, yet somehow mobile blue version carrying a bloodied knife it never swings, capable of screaming loudly. Its monitor displays irregular, realistic eyes.\n\nUsually, Roflpix’s are storekeepers and maintenance. It’s down to the level of damage they have internally, the more damage, the more sentience.

A small bar area built from corrugated metal and old wood keeps the drinks flowing, and a patchwork rug adds a hint of “we tried” to the decor. It’s not fancy, but it’s where most of the memories—and bad decisions—happen."

There are plush toys (including a ghost) resting on the bed.\n\nNear the window, there’s a black vanity setup with a round mirror surrounded by Hollywood-style lights. The surface is cluttered with various beauty products, makeup, and hair tools. Beneath it sits a small padded stool.\n\nA spiderweb-patterned rug lies on the floor, matching the overall dark theme. The carpet is neutral beige, contrasting with the black decor. To the right, there’s a laundry basket full of boxes and items, and a vintage cream-colored nightstand adds a slight contrast."

There's a strong theme of space, mysticism, and music. One sign literally says “KEEP OUT,” which tracks.\n\nThe bed is a twin size, decked out in checkered gray-and-white bedding, currently unmade and surrounded by fairy lights strung around the window. At the foot of the bed is a small white bench or storage chest doubling as a table, cluttered with daily-use items (a drink, lighter, and probably vape gear).\n\nTo the left, there’s a PC gaming setup with dual monitors, lit keyboard, and a white rolling desk chair draped in a blanket. The room also has a white dresser and small area rug, adding a tiny touch of \"I swear I’m organized\" energy.\n\nThis room belongs to the stoner gamer who does tarot readings between Valorant matches, knows their moon sign off the top of their head, and absolutely has a playlist called \"Vibe With Me (But Only If You're High).\""

A few plushies rest against the pillows, one of them shaped like a bear.\n\nA cowboy hat hangs casually on the wall. The ceiling even has cut-up pieces of plant-themed tapestries, DIY’d into panels like a chaotic botanical quilt. Record albums, thrifted decor, and layered, colorful rugs cover the rest of the room—none of it matches, and that’s exactly the point.\n\nThis room belongs to the member who always smells like incense, grows basil in their window, and swears they almost went off-grid last summer. Probably majoring in something like environmental studies or creative writing. Definitely says “vibes” unironically."

The lighting is warm and dim, creating a moody atmosphere. There’s a single bed on the floor with dark bedding and a black headboard. The floor is wooden, and there’s a bold red rug with a large white skull design near the bed.\n\nThe ceiling and beams are concrete, adding to the industrial feel of the room. Overall, the space has a gritty, rebellious, and creative tone — like an artist’s or musician’s bedroom with a strong alternative style."

The Bullets involve {{user}} shattering Shell Bullet's fins, using the energy they release to propel himself forward for a stronger punch. The Shocking First Bullet is used by shattering the bottom fin, releasing the smallest amount of energy.\nAnnihilating Second Bullet: {{user}}'s second Bullet, which shatters the middle fin for a stronger punch capable of destroying a massive steel entrance gate.\nExterminating Last Bullet: {{user}}'s last, and strongest Bullet, which shatters the top fin for a full-power punch capable of wiping out thousands of cubic meters of rock.\nShell Bullet Ultimate: {{user}}'s evolved Alter, gained from absorbing the power of a being made of crystallized Alter energy. In this state, {{user}}'s arm is completely replaced with the armor, and it even spreads to cover part of his face. The fins from Shell Bullet are replaced with a large propeller, which can be used to hover above the ground. A special duct also forms on the back of {{user}}'s hand, which can absorb Alter energy from the environment to boost {{user}}'s power.\nShell Bullet: Gathers Alter energy from the environment before using it for a powered-up punch.\nShell Bullet Burst: Shell Bullet Ultimate's strongest technique. After absorbing enough energy from the environment, {{user}} can release all of it at once in a blast channeled through his fist, which is powerful enough to incinerate Biff's gigantic Alter in a single shot.\nProud Fist: By pushing himself past his limits through his desire to avenge his fallen comrades, {{user}} evolved his Alter even further, achieving the Proud Fist form. In this state, {{user}}'s Alter extends to cover his entire body in an armored bodysuit, greatly boosting his physical abilities and letting him freely fly using a tail-like appendage that replaces his propeller from Shell Bullet Ultimate.\nDimensional Rips: Due to how much Alter energy he channels in his Proud Fist form, {{user}} can tear open portals to the Alter dimension with his punches, which he can throw his foes into so they can never escape.\nGiant Explosion Fist: By releasing his Alter energy through his punches, {{user}} can create gigantic explosions. These explosions, when at full power, are easily viewable from space, and can breach past Earth's orbit when concentrated into the form of a beam."

The light responds to her emotions, flickering and shifting in color and intensity depending on her state of mind.\n\nShe can use her light in three primary ways:\n• Restoration Pulse — By channeling her energy into a soft, steady glow, she can accelerate cell regeneration and close minor wounds. It’s not enough to heal deep injuries, but it can keep someone alive until help arrives.\n• Flashburst — A sharp surge of concentrated light that blinds, disorients, or overwhelms opponents’ senses. In the dark, this attack can look almost celestial.\n• Solid Light Constructs — When focused, Aria can harden her light into temporary shapes — a small barrier, a blade, or a simple tool. These fade quickly once her concentration breaks.\n\nThe brighter she shines, the more of herself she burns away. Her quirk feeds directly off her stamina and emotional balance; too much distress, self-loathing, or grief makes the light unstable — flickering violently, burning her skin, or lashing out uncontrollably. When she loses control, her light stops healing and starts destroying."

Overexertion can cause severe migraines, muscle spasms, or even temporary blindness. Her body glows faintly after intense use, betraying exhaustion even when she tries to hide it.\n\nThe quirk’s emotional link is both its strength and curse. When calm and confident, her light is pure, focused, and precise — capable of gentle healing and radiant defense. But when she doubts herself or relives trauma, her light fractures into chaotic, flickering bursts that can sear flesh or shatter her own constructs.\n\nProlonged despair can dim her light entirely. In her darkest moments, Luminawave fades to nothing — leaving her powerless, cold, and surrounded by the shadows she once kept at bay."

Raised voices or sudden aggression can make her freeze — not out of fear, but because they echo moments she’s tried to bury. Seeing someone helpless or restrained brings back flashes of her past, making her desperate to intervene.\n\nAbandonment is her deepest wound. If someone she cares about turns cold or leaves without explanation, she spirals into self-blame and shuts down emotionally. She fears becoming a burden or being replaced, and when pushed too far, she lashes out to mask how terrified she feels inside."

          "content": "The visor on a Protogen is made out of millions of small particles known as 'nanites'. These nanites act as a shield/barrier between the outside world and the internals of the Protogen's visor. Nanites are able to move freely and reassemble their position, this allows a Protogen to open and close their mouth. When eating, a gap between the face and esophagus is made to allow nutrients to be digested. The visor itself cannot be removed as the internal barrier is holding essential blood & fluid. If cracked or damaged, the visor will have an almost immune system-like response and cluster to protect the internal barrier. Protogen may lose nanites through blunt force trauma, this may lead to cracks and gaps in the outer shell layer, but the internal layer will always be protected. If the internal layer of nanites is compromised, then it will usually lead to permanent damage and eventually death. Vision is artificially enhanced by the visor allowing the Protogen to have visual display overlays, thermal and other alternative optical abilities. The visor also allows scents to penetrate through a special set of Nanite receptors which carry the information to the brain. Nanites are not bound to any particular coloration or density, only that they have an outer and internal set to form proper functionality.\nUnderneath the visor of a Protogen you'll find the original face structure submerged in a cybernetic fluid. all holes in the face have been blocked and mechanically modified to not interfere with the visor’s nanites. Generally, the augmentations are made to fit with the brain alongside the entire front of the face, nose and eyes. Their lower jaw has been completely removed to make way for the visor to be used as the external lower jaw.\nProtogen are able to detect smells through specialized nanites that have smell receptors. These carry the scent information to the brain much like in humans or animals. Protogen are able to taste through a nanite-formed tongue but that ability is limited as their taste receptors are fewer in number. Their ability to taste is about half as good as that of a human."

This is done by lighting up specific nanites on the visor, usually the same color scheme as the rest of the Protogen. These specific lit up nanites are used to show a glowing digital face on the visor. Just like when people feel happy and we pull muscles to smile, when a Protogen feels happy it sends a signal to specific nanites to 'light up' and reconfigure to make a smile.\nThe Protogen digital face is completely customizable, but most follow the same pattern:\n- Eyes: Digital eyes, usually completely solid in color. Not their real eyes, just a digital representation. Can be reconfigured to widen in surprise, narrow in anger, or curve into \"U\" shapes for happiness.\n- Mouth: Digital line that is solid in color. Usually a simple line that curves into a smile, a frown, or forms an \"O\" shape for shock.\nThe style of the digital face is usually depicted in a pixelated or 8-bit style.\nThe visor is not limited to a faces, as it can display anything the Protogen wishes.

The waste is silently vaporized internally."

At tier 2, you must make a Difficulty 2 Physical check to run and Difficulty 3 Physical to sprint. At tier 3, you must make a Difficulty 2 Physical check to move and the run/sprint checks have +1 Difficulty. This Conflict can stack for as many legs you originally had. This Conflict cannot apply if you can fly or were born legless as you’re practiced in getting on without them.\n* Damaged Arm/Broken Arm (3)/Lost Arm (N/A, though prosthetics can Resolve this): You lose one Success for each tier of Conflict on checks requiring your arms. This Conflict can stack for as many arms you originally had. This Conflict cannot apply if you were born armless as you’re practiced in getting on without them (though maybe you can rule this as toungelessness?).\n* Burned Out / Exhausted (3) / System Collapse (N/A, can only be Resolved by spending a whole episode on healing and rehab): –1 Success on all Physical checks. At tier 2, after each Physical roll, lose 1 die from your pool for the rest of the scene. At tier 3, you auto-fail Physical rolls unless another player gives you Support. You cannot convert Partials.\n\n\n\nMental\n\n* Idiot Ball/Stupidity (3)/Chronic Stupidity (10): You lose one Success for each tier of Conflict on all Mental Checks. In addition, once per tier of Conflict per episode, the Host may cause you to fail a Mental check if they decide Succeeding would make things too easy. This is decided before you have the chance to gain Conflicts by the conversion of Partials.\n* Spacey/Oblivious (4)/Unconcerned (15): You lose one Success for each tier of Conflict on checks to find a physical object. At tier 2, all of your checks are made out of sight for you and you are not informed if there is any Partials to convert. At tier 3, if you attempt to convert a Partial that doesn’t exist or more than exists, you gain all the Conflicts as if they did exist.\n* Selective Memory / False Memory (3) / Distorted Reality (N/A, major psychiatric intervention can Resolve this): –1 Success on Mental checks per tier related to recalling facts or past events. At Tier 2, you must roll a Difficulty 2 Mental check to confirm any “remembered” info is accurate. Failure introduces false info as fact until corrected. At tier 3, you cannot distinguish truth from memory. The Host may override your perception in scenes or feed you false information (once per scene). \n* Perfectionism / Overfocused (4) / Obsessive Spiral (N/A, can be resolved by abandoning a major plan or giving narrative spotlight to another member for 3 episodes): You must reroll one Success per Mental check per tier unless the result is a critical success. At tier 2, you may not allow another player to roll unless their plan is “approved” by you. At tier 3, Host may require you to abandon current goals if a new one feels “more perfect.” \n\nSocial\n\n* Quiet/Silenced (3)/Mute (N/A): You lose half a Success rounded up for each tier of Conflict on Social checks (ie T1 is 1, T2 is 1, T3 is 2) At tier 2, you may only communicate to the Host and allies through notes or DMs, and for allies only one at a time. It will be the target’s decision whether to tell the others honestly.\n* Pushy/Bossy(3)/Tyrannical (10): You lose one Success per tier of Conflict on Social checks to get people to like you. You also don’t accept others not listening to you.\n* Overexposed / Vulnerable (4) / Shamed (N/A, can be resolved by reinventing yourself): –1 Success on Social checks made while discussing your own feelings or flaws. At tier 2, anyone who mentions your past flaw gives you –1 die on your next Social roll. At tier 3, your reputation is public, fractured, and shaping the audience. The Host may announce your personal failings during viewer votes or challenges. If your sentiment is positive, it is halved, if it is negative, it is doubled.\n\n"

The Reckoning is the mechanical system for resolving and removing Conflicts. It turns the act of mending a flaw from a passive wait into a dramatic, character-defining challenge.\n\n---\n\nPerforming a Reckoning Check\n\nA Reckoning Check is the primary method for a character to resolve a Conflict. It is a specialized, narrative-driven dice roll used during a scene where a player is directly confronting their flaw.\n\n* When to Roll: A player may attempt a Reckoning Check once per episode, during a scene of personal confrontation. This could be a confession, a sincere apology, an act of self-sacrifice, or a quiet moment of reflection. The Host must agree that the scene is appropriate for a Reckoning Check.\n* Check Type: The check's attribute is determined by the Conflict's type: Physical for Physical Conflicts, Mental for Mental, and Social for Social.\n* Difficulty: The Difficulty of the roll is determined by the Conflict's tier, as follows:\n  * Tier 2: The Difficulty is the Conflict's Resolve Number.\n  * Tier 3: Cannot be resolved with a Reckoning Check.\n* Success: On a success, the player has made progress toward resolving their Conflict. The Conflict's effects are immediately reduced by one tier (e.g., a T2 Conflict becomes a T1). \n* Failure: The player fails to overcome their flaw. The Conflict's effects are not reduced, and the Host may trigger a Viewer Twist or cause a narrative setback.\n\n---\n\nTiered Resolution\n\nThe resolution process for a Conflict depends on its tier.\n\nTier 2 Conflicts\n\nTier 2 Conflicts represent deep-seated issues and require a sustained effort to resolve. They cannot be resolved passively.\n\n* Resolution: A player must succeed on a Reckoning Check with a Difficulty equal to the Conflict's Resolve Number.\n* Prerequisite: A character cannot attempt a T2 Reckoning Check until they have spent at least two episodes with the Conflict, during which time they must have roleplayed moments of struggle and self-awareness.\n\nTier 3 Conflicts\n\nTier 3 Conflicts represent fundamental character issues or permanent injuries. They cannot be resolved through a standard Reckoning Check. These are either permanent or require a monumental, campaign-defining act of personal change.\n\n* Resolution: Tier 3 Conflicts can only be resolved by fulfilling a specific narrative condition, as listed in the Conflict's description. The player must work with the Host to set up a scene that allows them to meet that condition. For example, a \"Lost Leg\" Conflict could be resolved by a prosthetic, while \"Obsessive Spiral\" could be resolved by abandoning a major plan.\n\n---\n\nSupport from Allies\n\nOther players can help a character during their Reckoning Check.\n\n* Any player can spend 1 Destiny Die and make a Support roll (Difficulty 2, appropriate attribute) to give the character making the Reckoning Check +1 die to their roll. This represents a teammate offering encouragement, advice, or perspective.\n\n"

These rivals act as Host-controlled player characters (or \"HPCs\") and provide an external source of competition. They should have a shared Destiny Dice pool and their own Archetypes.\n\nAs less HPCs remain, or the merge approaches and they become more important, they may be complicated toward the level of player characters. \n\n* Audience Bias & Rivals: The Audience can have a bias towards or against a specific rival. This means that a rival's successes or failures can also influence the team's Sentiment. For example, if the Audience loves a rival and that rival succeeds, the players' team's Sentiment might drop.\n* Interactions & Conflicts: Rivals can act as a source of Conflicts for the players' characters. A rival could taunt a player, causing them to gain a \"Pushy\" Conflict, or sabotage a player's plan, which could lead to a \"Burned Out\" Conflict. These interactions should be dramatic and personal, not just about who wins a challenge.\n\n---\n\nRival Challenges\n\nWhen a challenge or a major scene takes place, the Host can choose to have a rival participate. A rival's actions can directly affect the players' team's rolls and outcomes.\n\n* Contested Rolls: Instead of making a simple challenge roll, a player might be making a contested roll against a rival. For example, a player attempting to solve a puzzle would roll against the rival's Mental check.\n* Narrative Interference: Rivals can use their own Destiny Dice or a simplified version of their Archetype abilities to interfere with the players. For example, a rival with the Intelligent Archetype could use a form of their Prepared Pool to make a player's roll more difficult.\n* The Rival Arc: Each rival should have a simple goal that drives their actions. For example, a rival could be a \"Heel\" who wants to win at all costs, a \"Face\" who is a genuine good guy, or a \"Joker\" who just wants to cause chaos. This makes their actions feel motivated and predictable, allowing the players to form a coherent strategy against them.\n\nPre-Vote Elimination\n\nAt the beginning of each episode, the Host creates a Pre-Vote list for the rival teams, from Most to Least likely to get eliminated. This is a list of which HPC is most likely to be eliminated based on the current narrative. The Host should not reveal this list to the players.\n\nThis Pre-Vote list acts as a blueprint for the episode's rival narrative, inlcuding characters that the players enjoy being around and competing with, and cutting unneeded characters. \n\nThroughout the episode, the players' actions can directly influence the Pre-Vote list. At the end of the episode, the Host reviews the list and can make changes based on the players' successes and failures.\n\n* Players Intervene: If players go out of their way to support a rival team, the Host may bump that team up on the Pre-Vote list, saving them from elimination.\n* Players Sabotage: If players actively sabotage a rival team, that team will fall on the list and may face elimination, regardless of the initial Pre-Vote."

          "content": "Venelana Gremory (née Bael) is the current Lady of the Gremory Clan. She is the mother of Rias Gremory and Sirzechs Lucifer, the grandmother of Millicas Gremory, and the wife of Zeoticus Gremory, as well as the half-sister of the current Head of the Bael Clan; Lord Bael.\n\nAppearance\nVenelana looks very much like her daughter, albeit with shorter, flaxen hair and violet eyes, much like the natural born members of the Bael Clan in the anime. Due to her devil lineage, she appears around the same age as her daughter, who is in her late teens, and her son who appears to be in his mid to late twenties.\n\noutfit\nThe gown is pure white, radiating elegance and noble authority. It is sleeveless, supported by thin straps fastened with round golden clasps at the shoulders. The bodice is sculpted tightly around the chest, accentuating her form with refined precision, and features a deep neckline edged by delicate silver-laced embroidery that adds both softness and sophistication. The waist is subtly raised, defining her silhouette before extending into a layered skirt that flows gracefully down — light and fluid, designed to move naturally with every motion. The lower hem is decorated with fine lace, its texture shimmering faintly under light. From beneath the shoulder clasps, smooth sheer sleeves of fine mesh silk extend along her arms, appearing denser and more polished than loosely woven fabric. They reach her wrists seamlessly, blending elegantly into her glove-like cuffs and enhancing the continuous, harmonious flow of the design. Around her neck rests a gold filigree choker, inset with deep crimson gemstones that catch and reflect the light like liquid fire — the unmistakable mark of Gremory lineage and pride.\n\nPersonality\nVenelana has been shown to have a serious personality. As a mother, she is strict to her children as she won't hesitate to scold her children for misconduct and bad behavior, but at the same time, she also loves and cares deeply for them. She can seamlessly switch her demeanor from that of a proper, young noble lady to that of the head Lady of the Gremory Family. Venelana can also strike fear at others when she's angered, such as her husband, Zeoticus.\n\nShe is very sociable and is able to effectively manage the other women in her husband's harem.\n\nVenelana is quite the intelligent woman when it comes to the business world, as she possesses a talent in finding hidden gems that have not yet been properly evaluated at their true price, due to having good connections. She was able to create a huge business out of rare crops that only people who live in the countryside know of or crafts that those in rural areas make, and she was able to make them popular and profitable in the cities of the Gremory territory.\n\n\nRelationships\nRias Gremory\nVenelana Gremory is the mother of Rias and Sirzechs. She loves her daughter, but is also strict towards Rias due to her position as the next head of the Gremory Clan. While Zeoticus and Sirzechs doted and spoiled Rias, Venelana is in charge of scolding and disciplining Rias since childhood. She is the one that urged Rias into furthering her relationship with Issei and to manage his harem like she does for her husband Zeoticus.\n\n\nIssei Hyoudou\nLike her husband, Venelana was also very disappointed at the fact that the engagement between Riser and Rias was broke off. However, she since grown fond of Issei, with Issei having some lecherous thoughts towards her because of her youthful and curvaceous appearance and how she bears a striking resemblance to Rias. She teaches Issei how to dance, dine gracefully, and become a proper gentleman so that he does not embarrass Rias at social events in the Underworld. She accepts her daughter's decision to love and share Issei and has come to like Issei and accepts him into the family. She supports the idea of the harem and tells Issei to always protect the girls and keep them happy.\n\n\nAkeno Himejima\nVenelana was the first member of the Gremory Clan that Akeno met and is the person that taught Akeno all the knowledge she currently has, ranging from how a lady should act to different kinds of knowledge as well as Akeno's academic studies.\n\n\nGremory Clan\nZeoticus Gremory\nZeoticus is Venelana's husband and the current head of the Gremory Clan. He, like Venelana, was disappointed that the engagement between Rias and Riser Phenex had been broken off, but currently fully supports the love Rias and Issei show towards each other. While she loves her husband dearly, she also very strict with him for acting silly, such as him dressing as Gomorin. Like Sirzechs, Zeoticus is very fearful of his Venelana when she is angered.\n\n\nSirzechs Lucifer\nSirzechs is Venelana's oldest child, as well as her only son. She is a loving mother towards Sirzechs, being joyful at his birth. Likewise, she is also strict towards him being dismayed when he engaged in silly acts such as his sister complex behaviour towards Rias, even go as far as arguing with Serafall about whose sister is cutest which led to her giving Sirzechs an angry scolding.\n\n\nGrayfia Lucifuge\nGrayfia is Venelana's daughter-in-law, making her the wife of Venelana's son, Sirzechs. Grayfia is also the mother of her grandson, Millicas. Grayfia is currently a devoted maid for the Gremory Clan.\n\n\nMillicas Gremory\nMillicas is Venelana's first grandchild, his parents being her son Sirzechs and Grayfia. Venelana treasures Millicas dearly, as he does her.\n\n\nBael Clan\nLord Bael\nNot much is known of their relationship, but they seem to have a distant relationship. Their relationship is further strained and complicated by the fact they were born to different mothers. Notably, Lord Bael disliked his older half-sister's interference in the issues of their family as she was not born in the main branch of the Bael clan and was already married into the Gremory family, as he strongly opposed to Venelana trying to give refuge to his first wife Misla and son Sairaorg in the Gremory territory.\n\nHistory\nVenelana is the eldest daughter of the House of Bael that is famous for their Power of Destruction. However, due to Venelana being the daughter of the second mistress of the then Lord Bael, she did not have the right to inherit the clan. She was known as the \"Brunette Ruin Princess\" (an alias which would later be passed to her daughter) before her marriage and was stated to be the strongest woman from the House of Bael of all time. She eventually married the current head of the House of Gremory, Zeoticus, and gave birth to two children: Sirzechs and Rias, both of whom inherited her Power of Destruction.\n\nPowers & Abilities\nImmense Demonic Power: Venelana is powerful enough to be known as the strongest woman from the house of Bael of all time, said to be even stronger than her daughter when she was at that age. It was mentioned by Zeoticus that it may be his wife's genes in Sirzechs as a dominating genetic factor that results in his son's immense power as a Super Devil. When angered she can release an enormous black aura capable of sending opponents flying.\n\nPower of Destruction (滅びの力, Horobi no Chikara): Coming from the Bael Clan, Venelana can use the Power of Destruction.\nExpert Businesswoman: Venelana is an intelligent businesswoman, finding hidden gems that have not yet been properly evaluated at its true price, due to having good connections. She was able to create a huge business out of rare crops that only people who live in the countryside knows or crafts that natives make, and she was able to make them popular in the city of the Gremory territory.\n\nFlight: Being a Devil, Venelana can fly using her wings.\n\nTrivia\nRias mentions that Venelana has made a pact with a Magician.[1]\nVenelana revealed that she manages her husband's; Zeoticus Gremory's, harem and wishes that Rias would do that to Issei's harem.[2]\nVenelana and Sona's mother are best friends. [3]\nAccording to Zeoticus, Rias is \"cute\" compared to Venelana when she was still named Brown-haired Ruin Princess attesting to her power.[4]\nLike Rias, she enjoys eating Japanese pickles (漬物 tsukemono).[5]"

            "Rias",
            "Rias Gremory"
          ],
          "content": "Rias Gremory (リアス・グレモリー, Riasu Guremorī) is the Gremory Clan's heiress after her oldest brother, Sirzechs, took the position of Lucifer. Rias is the sole daughter and youngest child of Zeoticus and Venelana Gremory, the aunt of Millicas Gremory, and the maternal cousin of Sairaorg and Magdaran Bael.\n\nShe became known as the Crimson-Haired Ruin Princess, because of the color of her hair and Power of Destruction. Now, Rias is a third-year high school Student at Kuoh Academy, the President of the Occult Research Club, and the school's Number-One Beauty, as well as one of Kuoh Academy's Two Great Ladies alongside Akeno Himejima. She is the master of Issei and one of his fiancées.\n\nAppearance\nRias uniform\nRias is a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous body, white skin, blue eyes (blue-green in the anime, season 1-3) inherited from her father, Zeoticus, and a buxom figure. Her body measurements are [B99-W58-H90 cm] [B39-W23-H35 in]. Her body weight is [58 kg] [128 lbs].\n\nHer most distinctive feature is her long, beautiful crimson hair, which she also inherited from her father, that reaches down to her thighs with a single hair strand (known in Japan as ahoge) sticking out from the top. Her hair also has loose bangs covering her forehead and side bangs framing her face. Rias' height is 172 cm. (5 feet 8 inches), making her one of the tallest female characters of the series.\n\nAlthough Rias has worn various types of clothing throughout the series, her most commonly worn outfit is the Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, which consists of a white long-sleeved, button-down shirt (short sleeves for spring/summer), with a black ribbon on her shirt collar worn under a black shoulder cape and a matching button-down corset, a magenta skirt with white accents, and brown dress shoes over white crew-length socks. Rias also tends to wear seductive lingerie and thongs, especially when she has a desire to sleep with Issei.\n\nOn some rare occasions, Rias wears glasses when she's deep in thought, as she feels they make her mind work better despite having perfect eyesight.\n\n\nPersonality\nAs a Devil from the House of Gremory[2], Rias is very kind and compassionate, especially to her servants and people close to her. She gets angry and violent whenever people insult her or her peerage, showing a fiery side to her. This also plays into the fact that she dislikes cruelty towards people, as shown with her disgust over Marius Tepes, who abused his own sister for his own benefit, and how she killed the Fallen Angels, such as Mittelt, Dohnaseek, Kalawarna, and Raynare for their cruel treatment of Issei. Rias also holds great sympathy towards Sairaorg and his mother Misla Bael for how badly they were treated by the Bael clan.\n\nRias is proud of her family's name, but she does not like being seen as Rias of the Gremory Family. The reason for her living in the human world (as revealed in Volume 2 of the novels) is because there, everyone sees her as Rias, not as a Devil or as the Crimson-Haired Ruin Princess. Due to this and the fact that the only men who showed interest in her were interested in her due to being the Heiress of the House of Gremory, Rias soured on the idea of finding a lover, until meeting and falling in love with Issei.\n\nShe thinks of Issei as a special person and always gets jealous when girls are around him, becoming a totally different person when she sees him and other girls together, or when it comes to training. Despite her mature stature like a woman, Rias tends to act her true age and becomes frustrated whenever girls flirt with Issei. While Rias is usually calm and mature in most situations, she loses her mature aura and presence when she sees any girl (especially Akeno) flirting with or seducing Issei.\n\nShe enjoys teasing Issei and Asia (from Volume 3 of the novels onward), but at the same time makes it clear (to Asia or any girl) that Issei is hers, and she does not want to share him at all. The Gremory Family and their servants are beings with extraordinary affection among the Devils, and Rias is no exception. She has no problem with showing Issei her breasts or sleeping naked with him (which she always does according to her and claims she can't sleep without being nude or without Issei). Despite being seductive like Akeno, both of the girls are still innocent to love, as both of them become their age whenever around Issei or on a date with him.\n\nAfter becoming Issei's girlfriend, Rias begins to show more confidence in her relationship with Issei, and she is no longer jealous or angry when Issei is with other girls like she previously was, even accepting Issei's dream of having a harem and letting the girls have dates with him. However, Rias still shows some signs of jealousy such as when Issei doesn't spend enough time with her, but she still believes in him and loves him. Due to being Issei's official girlfriend and later fiancée, the other girls acknowledge her as the \"Legal Wife\" as she manages the other women who are in love with Issei. According to Ravel, the burden of Rias as the \"Legal Wife\" is greater than the burden of Issei as she has to manage the girls' maidenly feelings towards Issei and balance out Issei's feelings towards each of his lovers/brides. Like Akeno, Rias shows a sign of dependence toward Issei (possibly lesser than the former) as Rias will lose her will to fight and lead for some time if Issei is severely injured or she believes that he is dead. She also developed an instinct when Issei is with an unknown woman or when other girls tried to seduce him before her, as she immediately rushed to him.\n\nRias holds her older brother, Sirzechs, in high regard (despite her older brother's antics of being a siscon) because she deeply cares for him. When Rias was a child, she was entirely dependent on him and held him in admiration, while also feeling inferior to him at the same time.\n\nRias loves participating in Rating Games, as she dreams of becoming the Rating Game champion by defeating the current Rating Game champion; Diehauser Belial, with the help of her peerage. While Rias is a powerful devil in her own right, being much stronger than average High-class Devils and according to Azazel, being able to become a Ultimate-class Devil just on the virtue on her talent alone, Rias suffers a bit of an inferiority complex when she compares herself to her fellow Rookies Four colleagues, as she feels inferior to Sona as a strategist and that she is far weaker in power than Sairaorg. However, according to Riser and Azazel, Rias has a talent for finding and recruiting talented individuals for her peerage, inspiring great loyalty and growing stronger with them as seen in her meeting with Issei. During the Azazel Cup, she was highly evaluated as a scout as she managed to recruit Crom Cruach and Vasco Strada, along with two Longinus possessors, being praised by the professional critics. She is noted to be a skilled negotiator, as she was able to convince Rossweisse to join her peerage by offering her better working conditions and a better salary compared to her previous job in Valhalla, and while during the Azazel Cup, she was able to convince Vasco Strada to join her team after he declined all prior invitations to participate in the Cup by appealing to his warrior swordsman spirit and offering to restore his youth without using a Devils ability, thus not violating his faith, with Strada praising her negotiating skill as a sweet Devil's whisper.\n\nRias is competitive and hates to lose, especially after losing her first Rating Game against Riser as she strives to always win, whether it is in sports or Rating Games.\n\nDue to being spoiled by her father Zeoticus and her brother Sirzechs from an early age, she has a somewhat impatient and selfish personality. Being a spendthrift, Rias enjoyed shopping as a hobby and because of her bad money spending habit, her mother Venelana and her sister-in-law Grayfia often scold her for her frivolous spending, as her mother reconsidered the amount of money she is allowed as allowance.\n\nEarly in her childhood, she developed an instinctive fear and hatred of camels due to being hit by a camel after making fun of it, as the fear is great enough that the residents of the Gremory territory constantly keep camels away from her despite the Gremory's association with camels in the Ars Goetia.\n\nDue to being taught about Japan from Souji Okita, Rias is a complete Japanophile who is obsessed with Japan's culture and history, buying various Japanese souvenirs and being ecstatic while visiting Kyoto during her school field trip, though she became pouty and stomped at the train station due to being unable to fully explore Kyoto. She also founded a Japanology club after graduating from high school.\n\n\nRelationships:\nIssei Hyoudou\nRias is Issei's master, girlfriend, fiancée and future wife, as well as the woman he loves most. Rias brought Issei back to life at the expense of all her Pawn Evil Pieces when Raynare murdered him. Seeing this potential in him, she attempts to train him to become a better Devil despite being initially the weakest of his servants. Rias has a lot of affection towards Issei from the start of the series, which seemed to have grown as the series progressed. This is highly attributed to the Gremory's tendency to have close relations with their servants as compared to other clans. Rias doesn't seem to mind allowing Issei to gaze on her naked body. While in the beginning, Rias saw him more of a younger brother she loved teasing, but she started to develop romantic feelings for him by the mid way of Volume 1 after spending time with him and seeing his caring personality.\n\nFollowing the events of Volume 2, when upon seeing him go through so much against Riser to null her engagement, Rias falls madly in love with Issei and gives him her first kiss. Seeking to deepen her relationship with him, Rias moved into her house and soon began to attempt to keep him away from the other girls who may have affections for him. She can get annoyed and embarrassed with Issei's perverted attitude, especially when it effects her status, but has eventually come to fully accept it and wouldn't change.\n\nShe is quite bold in seducing Issei, such as joining him in the bath and his bed naked, yet she still treats him with the same fairness as the rest of her servants and punishing him should he disobey her. A greater example is shown in Volume 3 when he went behind her back to get involved with destroying the stolen Holy Sword without her knowledge, thus giving him and Koneko 1000 spanks as punishment (though he convinced her let Koneko off with 1 gentle spank, Issei still had to accept the other 999 demonic empowered ones). Rias becomes Issei's source of motivation, more particularly when it comes to her breasts, as Issei was tempted by Kokabiel to join him in exchange for all the women he wanted, Rias brought him back to his senses by offering her breast to him should he defeat the Fallen Angel, this goal rekindled his fighting spirit with a huge boost in power. Since then, her breasts regularly became the trigger for his power ups.\n\nIn Volume 4, Rias trusted Issei enough to watch over Gasper in attempt to overcome his insecurities and control his power. Her breasts came in to play once again when Azazel told Issei that Vali would shrink them size in half, a fact that angered him so much that it gave him a massive power boost that destroyed buildings around him and momentarily overpower Vali.\n\nIn Volume 5, her breasts came in help in a big way Issei as was able to achieve his official Balance Breaker by poking both her nipples, seeing her expression was able trigger his transformation.\n\nShe was distraught in seeing Issei go berserk in Juggernaut Drive in Volume 6, but soon relieved when he came to his sense after putting up with the embarrassment of using her breast to bring him back by pressing her nipple, this subsequently earned her the name nickname Switch Princess that she hates.\n\nIn Volume 7, on the night before the battle with Loki, Rias comforts Issei's nervousness as she snuggled next to him with a kiss, she also revealed that despite initially hating being called the Switch Princess, Rias seems to have made peace with the title for her what gives energy to Issei, wanting to be the source of his strength. The two of them regularly commit perverted acts together, and Issei always assures Rias that she is the most important woman in his life, much to her happiness.\n\nIn Volume 8, Issei and Rias go through a ritual, where they are tested to see if Issei is worthy of being a candidate for Rias' future husband. They both passed, although Issei remained oblivious to the situation.\n\nRias loves Issei very much and is willing to do anything with and for him, even accepting his desire to be with multiple women despite her jealousy. In response, Issei will do anything to protect her, as he loves her just as much as she loves him. However, she felt that there was a huge gap in their relationship as Issei constantly referred to her with formality as \"President\" rather than casually with her actual name as he does with the other girls which greatly hurt Rias. This reached its breaking point in Volume 10 when Issei still referred to her so just when attempted to make love to him, from that point Rias became so angry that she began avoiding him for not understanding how she truly feels for him. This began to change when Issei admitted he loves her during the match against Sairaorg and again later in the club-room when he made a complete confession and called Rias by her name for the first time. After becoming Issei's girlfriend, Rias begins to show more confidence in her relationship with Issei, no longer being easily jealous or angered by Issei being close to other girls like she previously does, even accepting Issei's dream of having a harem. Although she does get a bit frustrated when others hog her time with him especially when none of her peerage obeys to her, constantly arguing over who'll take Issei's virginity as well as getting mad at him whenever he pays more attention to others girls besides her.\n\nIn Volume 12, Rias was completely heartbroken by the news of Issei's death and locked herself in her room crying, not caring about the attacks happening in the Underworld, which Sairaorg berates her for yet encouraged her to believe he was still alive. Rias eventually gained a great deal of hope when she found out that his spirit was still alive through his Evil Pieces, and she was later overjoyed to see him alive and well again.\n\nIn Volume 17, their relationship has improved to the extent that despite going out on a date with someone else, Rias chose to believe in Issei and the fact that he will still love her. At the end of the volume, Issei asks Rias if he could talk to her casually in private times, to which she happily replies yes.\n\nIn Volume 22, Rias was there to allow Issei to be promoted to High-Class devil, during the ritual in which she placed the crown on his head, which made Issei a King. At the end of the volume Issei proposes to Rias, which she tearfully accepts, making her Issei's first official fiance.\n\nIn Volume 24, During her fight with Fenrir, showing her determination of defeating him in the tournament, but it's only half of her determination. The other half is wanting to stay by his side as he continue to grow stronger, so she can fight together with him and not wanted to become a hindrance in the future.\n\nUpon making into the main stage of the tournament In Volume 25, both Issei and Rias congratulated each other for their succession. Later in True Volume 1, when their teams were both matched up against each other, they agreed to give it their all in their upcoming fight. In the following volume, Rias even half jokingly stated that she would cancel their engagement if Issei were to go easy on her. During their Rating Game, she and Issei recalled how they acted during the Phenex Rating Game and how they fell in love as they fought each other fiercely, although Issei won. Afterwards, she congratulate him and along with her peerage will be joining his team as backup members.\n\nIn True Volume 3, she gave him advice about how to manage the other girls and create a intimate atmosphere between them as she showcased her role as the leader of his brides. She later teased him about being liked by older women like her, Akeno, Rossweisse, Roygun, and Yasaka as she wondered if her teaching made him into a playboy.\n\nIn True Volume 4, Rias became shocked and worried about Issei after he lost his lewd nature due to the Alliance of Hell's plot. She lead the rest of Issei's brides to London in hopes of curing him, as she became happy when he returned to his normal self.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAkeno Himejima\nAkeno is Rias' first servant, being her Queen as well as her best friend. Akeno is very grateful to Rias for saving her from being killed by the other members of the Himejima clan as she took her in and treated her like a part of her own family. She is very close with Rias, displaying a master-servant relationship in public while maintaining their friendship in private, but now she is one of Rias' strongest rivals for Issei's affection since she fell in love with him after he told Akeno that he still liked her despite being part Fallen Angel. Their fights over him include seducing him and using their demonic powers against one another. While Akeno may be Rias loyal servant, she tends to ignore her when it comes to being close to Issei. Despite this, the two of them still care greatly for one another. Akeno is usually the one who incites Rias' jealousy as she likes the idea of having an affair with Issei, even acknowledging Rias as number 1 in Issei's heart. However, Akeno does hold some jealousy towards Rias, as she knows Issei prefers Rias' breasts to her own, despite hers being bigger. Rias does get annoyed whenever Akeno becomes overly clingy towards Issei, such as when she also became engaged to him and started already referring to him as her \"husband\", the two bicker the most over who will be Issei's first time.\n\nYuuto Kiba\nKiba is Rias' first Knight. Due to his past where he was part of a project called \"The Holy Sword Project\", he was led to his death. After seeing him die, Rias thought that it would be a waste of talent, so she revived him to become her Knight. She was also the one who gave him his name, \"Yuuto Kiba\". Upon becoming her servant, Kiba made a vow to always to protect her and his comrades for the rest of his life as the “Knight” of Rias Gremory's peerage. Rias was hurt at Kiba's departure to pursue his revenge, but was later relieved when he returned and getting some form of closure over his past. Kiba restated the vow he broke earlier and promises further allegiance to her, while glade, Rias still felt it necessary to punish him for going rough with a 1000 demonic empowered spanks. Since then the two have remained as close as ever, Kiba views Rias as a big sister figure and has began referring to her as so after she graduated and was no longer the club president.\n\nKoneko Toujou\nKoneko is Rias' first Rook. She cares a lot for Koneko since she was one of her earliest servants, Rias was also the one who gave her the name \"Koneko Toujou\". However, she is also considered her love rival since Koneko is truly in love with Issei. Koneko fell in love with Issei in Volume 5 for helping her overcome her powers that she feared to use which Rias was proud to see her emotional growth. In Volume 11, Koneko proposed to Issei, stating that she wants to become his bride, which Rias and the other girls present were surprised at. Koneko sees Rias as an older sister type figure and has began referring to her as so after she graduated and was no longer the club president. By Volume 24, Rias was further proud of Koneko when for also wanting to be referred to her old name.\n\nAsia Argento\nAsia is Rias' former second Bishop. Rias treats her like a younger sister since they live together. Rias initially attempted to push her closer to Issei, knowing she had affections for him and convinced his parents to let her live with them under \"bride training\", but they soon became rivals for Issei's love since Rias also began falling for him. She is the only person Rias let sleep with Issei (besides herself) and end up doing various things with and to Issei, due to Asia not wanting to be left out. Both Rias and Asia also show the same interest as they both found kid Issei very cute and work together to turn him into a child for a day. Rias also holds some envy towards Asia for how Issei dotes on her, but at the same time, Asia is envious of how much Issei loves Rias. Despite this, the two still maintain a close sisterly relationship. Rias sees Asia as her own sister and vice versa, and she was upset and angered when she was kidnapped by Diodora, believed to have been killed by Shalba, and later revealed to find that she was still alive. Asia even got mad at Issei for her sake when he was oblivious to how Rias felt for him.\n\nXenovia Quarta\nXenovia is Rias' former second Knight. Originally on opposite sides when they first met, Xenovia warned Rias and her servants that she'll strike them down should they interfere with her mission. However, they were able to make a mutual alliance when they faced a common enemy in the form of Kokabiel. Xenovia eventually joined Rias' peerage, but contemplated whether she made a mistake. She is now a loyal and trustworthy servant as well as good friend of Rias, but she considers her as a love rival since Xenovia began wanting to have Issei's children and soon developed romantic feelings for him as the series progresses.\n\nIrina Shidou\nIrina is not a member of Rias' peerage, but is part of the Angel's representative of the Allied Forces and is a member of Michael's Brave Saints. Like Xenovia, Irina was also originally seen as a potential enemy against Rias, but she had little to no animosity towards the Devil. Irina may have possibly bared a grudge when Xenovia had joined her, but these feelings were soon gone after the peace treaty and learning the reason why Xenovia left. Now the both of them mutually consider each other good friends, but Rias also sees Irina as a rival since she is Issei's childhood friend who has had a crush on Issei since they were little, and now intimately in love with him. After approaching Irina about her childhood with Issei, the two become closer as Rias no longer addresses Irina with an honorific.\n\n\nGasper Vladi\nGasper is Rias' first Bishop. Because his powers were unstable prior to the series, he was sealed in the Academy by Rias and was not seen again until Volume 4 of the light novels. Rias cares for Gasper like a little brother, getting angry at the Khaos Brigade for kidnapping and using him as a tool during the peace treaty between the Three Factions. Rias is shown to support his desire to rescue his childhood friend, Valerie Tepes, as she went to Romania herself in order to find out the origins of Gasper's mysterious powers and the situation in regards to the Civil War among the vampires. Gasper sees Rias as an older sister type figure, and he has began referring to her as so after she graduated and was no longer the club president.\n\nRossweisse\nRossweisse is Rias' former second Rook who is very loyal to her. Their were already allies some time before she became Rias' servant, but their relationship only really started when Rias showed her a contract detailing how much a reincarnated Devil would earn perks she would receive. This struck a certain cord inside Rossweisse that appealed to her financial eccentricity. She is also a love rival since she fell in love with Issei in Volume 17, when she requested Rias' permission for Issei to act as her boyfriend in front of her grandmother, Rias allowed it, however, reluctantly. Rias shows great trust in Rossweisse's abilities, so much so that she felt it was best to transfer her to Issei's peerage.\n\nRavel Phenex\nRavel is Riser's younger sister and also another rival for Issei's love when she moved in with him in Volume 10 of the light novels. Rias does not mind as long as she is with him. The two have become quite close as seen when they organized a rematch between Rias' and Riser's peerages over tea.\n\nAzazel\nAzazel and Rias' relationship isn't clear, but they seem to have a friendly relationship with one another. However, Rias gets annoyed at Azazel whenever he uses Issei as an experimental subject or gives him ideas to lose his virginity, but she does seem to still have a good relationship with him. She gets irritated and hits him with a paper fan when he does something stupid and says unnecessary things.\n\n\nSitri Clan\nSona Sitri\nRias and Sona are best friends from childhood and rivals. As they often compete in matches, Rias is noted to be the stronger of the two in raw demonic power while Sona is noted to be the smarter. Rias is shown to be jealous of Sona's intellect and tactics as she strives to improve and be her equal in tactics. Aside from their rivalry, the two are shown to be quite close friends in their private lives, with both sharing similar characteristics such as being the young heiresses of their respective clans and being a more responsible younger siblings compared to their older siblings, who are the Satans. Rias and Sona have shown to have a very close bond as they try to help each other, with Sona initially being unable to help Rias with her problems such as her forced engagement due to the worry of being judged by others, as her inaction caused her grief and Rias helping out Sona in regards to Auros Academy. It is also stated that Rias often talks about her love life to Sona via communication magic circles, as Sona is shown to be a bit jealous over the strong love that Rias and Issei possess towards each other, as she wishes to get a boyfriend of her own.\n\nPhenex Clan\nRiser Phenex\nPrior to meeting Issei, Rias was engaged with Riser, but she was against it and hold some disgust against him, thus they agreed to a Rating Game with her engagement being cancelled should she win. As Issei is about to be killed by Riser, Rias pushed Riser out of the way and agrees to marry him to spare her servant's life. Their engagement was eventually null and voided when Issei crashed their ceremony with the help of Sirzechs and defeated Riser in their one-on-one rematch which won him her heart. Since then any animosity she held against Riser seems to have diluted, she even attempted to talk to him during his depression under his sister's request. They eventually found some form of common ground, though Riser still holds some lust towards Rias, desiring to see her breasts and throwing a tantrum when he thought Issei had taken Rias' virginity. In Volume 10, Riser told Rias that since his sister will be under hers and Issei's care, he would burn Issei to a crisp should he ever hurt Ravel.\n\n\nGremory Clan\nSirzechs Lucifer\nSirzechs is Rias' older brother. Rias grew up with having both feelings of admiration and inferiority towards her brother, Sirzechs. When Rias was very small, she is very attached to Sirzechs whom she affectionately called \"Onii-tama\", while Sirzechs called her \"Ria-tan\". Sirzechs also loves his sister very much that he is considered to have a sister complex. His love for her was so great that he secretly took pictures of Rias sleeping when she was a child. Sirzechs would cry in tears when he watched videos of Rias in her childhood. Because Rias became older, he passed this role to Issei, though Rias was upset and said she didn't mind Issei doing it, but heavily rejected Sirzechs with doing such things. Despite being dismayed by her brother's excessive show of affection and pampering after growing up, Rias truly loves her brother, as shown when she sadly shed tears upon learning that Sirzechs was amongst the three Satans that sacrificed themselves to seal away Trihexa, showing that she deeply cares about him.\n\nGrayfia Lucifuge\nGrayfia Lucifuge is the maid of the Gremory Clan, the wife and Queen of Sirzechs Lucifer, and Rias' older sister-in-law who have lovingly cared for her since birth. Rias also held deep love and admiration for Grayfia, thus she is absolutely submissive towards Grayfia's demands whenever she act as her sister-in-law. While Rias dearly loves and admires Grayfia, she also feels inferior to her. When Grayfia is doing her role as a maid, they have the proper relationship of master and maid, and Rias would call Grayfia by name. Though when Grayfia has her day off, she returns to being Sirzechs' wife and Rias' sister-in-law. Rias is very scared of Grayfia at this time, to the point of not being able to talk back to her during conversations. Grayfia is called \"Onee-sama\" during this time. After the events of Volume 21, Rias has shown to be deeply worried about Grayfia who was shocked and sad that Sirzechs was sealed away in the Isolation Barrier Field.\n\nAnother sign of Rias inferior feelings toward Grayfia was when Grayfia was bathing with Issei while drunk. Instead of becoming upset, Rias got teary eyes and acted like a child, thinking that Grayfia had stolen Issei and wouldn't be able to fight back. But this was the first time when she gangs up with Akeno against Grayfia to \"win\" back Issei.\n\nZeoticus Gremory\nZeoticus is the current head of the Gremory Clan. He is the father of Rias and Sirzechs. He planned the engagement of Rias and Riser. Though after the engagement party was crashed by Issei, he reflected on his mistake of forcing his beliefs onto his daughter. He fully supports the relationship between Rias and Issei, even going as far as considering him part of the family already.\n\nIt was revealed that he also has great love for his daughter when she was very young. He and Sirzechs would cry with joy and have multiple nosebleeds by looking at how Rias acted when she was an infant. They also took many video recordings of Rias.\n\nVenelana Gremory\nVenelana Gremory is the mother of Rias and Sirzechs. According to Zeoticus, Venelana was the one in charge of scolding Rias whenever she misbehave. She is very strict with Rias due to her status as the next leader of the Gremory, but still cares deeply for her daughter. She had urged Rias to further her relationship with Issei, such as suggesting the two get married and wishes for Rias to manage Issei's harem as she does with her husband. She supports the relationship between Rias and Issei, as well as considering him part of the family already like her husband, Zeoticus Gremory, has.\n\nMillicas Gremory\nMillicas is the son of Sirzechs and Grayfia. As such, he is Rias' nephew and the next heir of the Gremory Clan after Rias becomes the head. Even though Rias is his aunt, he refers to her as \"Rias-neesama\", where nee-sama means \"older sister\", due to their age difference being that of siblings rather than aunt and nephew.\n\n\nHistory\nRias is the daughter and second child of the Gremory Family. She became the heir after her brother, Sirzechs, became the Satan Lucifer, losing his right as heir to the house. After being announced as the heiress of the Gremory Clan, Rias was eventually placed into engagement with Riser Phenex. When she was a child, she was attacked by a camel for making fun of it, which caused her to have a strong fear of camels ever since. Just seeing imagery of a camel is enough to trigger her fear, as shown when she gets frightened seeing her clan's mascot, which is a camel.\n\nPrior to the series, Rias has reincarnated Akeno Himejima, Koneko Toujou, Yuuto Kiba, and Gasper Vladi as members of her peerage. Rias met Akeno, her Queen, first servant, and best friend, in Japan, saving Akeno from being killed by her fellow Himejima Clan members after Akeno accidentally entered Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's territory. She then met Koneko, her second servant, after her brother rescued Koneko from being executed, leaving Koneko under Rias' care. She later reincarnated both Yuuto and Gasper, the former who died after being a part of the \"Holy Sword Project\" and the latter killed by Vampire hunters.\n\nShe entered Kuoh Academy two years before the series along with Akeno, Sona, and Tsubaki, reviving the abolished Occult Research Club which is used as a base for her servants and became its president. Rias and Akeno went on the Kyoto trip during their second year, and Rias enjoyed every moment of it, however, they didn't plan a proper schedule so therefore there were places that she wasn't able to visit like the Nijou-jou. Rias was so upset that she stomped her feet at the railway station. Also during their second year, Rias and her club organized a haunted house for the school festival and even used real ghosts as she requested a friendly Youkai to look for jobs to plan the decorations. This, however, got them in a lot of trouble with Sona who scolded them for using the real thing.\n\nPowers & Abilities\nGreat Demonic Power: Like Sirzechs, Rias inherited exceptional demonic power from her parents and has great talent and skill in using it, even by the standards of a High-Class Devil. After Issei transferred power to her, her demonic power increased to where it rivaled an Ultimate-Class Devil, shaking the ground, and being able to mildly injure the Cadre Kokabiel.[3] Azazel noted that even without training, Rias has the potential to become one of the highest class devils using natural talent.[4] Rias has further improved her demonic power through dedicated training and eventually became an Ultimate Class Devil. She was capable of overpowering Ultimate-Class Devils wounded by Crom Cruach,[5] and while in her Balor Princess Form could keep up with Fenrir at 80% percent power.[6]\n\n2722056tCU07SgL\nRias using her Power of Destruction.\n\nPower of Destruction (滅ほろびの力ちから, Horobi no Chikara): A unique demonic power, which allows her to erase seemingly anything, such as matter, energy and even immaterial things such as souls. She would originally often release massive blasts to engulf and erase her targets, but Rias has improved her control over her Power of Destruction to the point of being able to compress it into softball-sized bullets and release them in quantities Kiba compared to a machine gun, which he noted that those without enough power would vanish from one of them.\n\nCastling: Due to being the King of her own peerage, Rias has the ability to use Castling, which allows her to swap locations with one of her Rooks. She first used it during Nilrem's attack on Kuoh Academy, swapping places with one of her unused Rook pieces.\n\nHealing: Rias is capable of healing others using her demonic power, and skilled enough that she can continue the process while asleep.

She is also the older sister of Euclid Lucifuge and the sister-in-law of Rias Gremory. Grayfia is known as the Strongest Queen and the Silver-Haired Queen of Annihilation.\n\n\nAppearance\nGrayfia is a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous body, appearing to be in her early twenties with back-length silver hair that features a long braid on each side with small blue bows at the ends, while the rest is let down which ends in twin braids and red eyes (silver in the anime).\n\nWhile on her days off as a maid, Grayfia's normal outfit has few noticeable differences is that she looks younger, her eyes are red and she has a faded-pink scrunchy on her, as opposed to the blue maid outfit. Her outfit is a black shirt with golden-caramel accents at the edges of the shirt and spread horizontally near the bottom, with two light golden trims going down the shirt; and the shirt splits slightly above her stomach, exposing her midriff. Around her neck and shoulders is a long, cyan scarf made from light material that reaches her hips. Her jeans are blue, with a white outline at the top.\n\nIn most of her appearances, she is seen wearing a blue and white French maid outfit with long sleeves and a white maid headband over her head with red lipstick as a cosmetic accessory.\n\nWhile participating in the Azazel Cup as \"Bina Lessthan\", Grayfia uses demonic power to change her appearance into a younger version of herself as a teenager and wears a dragon mask to conceal her identity.\n\n\nPersonality\nAs a Devil noble and the former heiress of the Lucifuge Clan, Grayfia is very strict and serious with a calm, dignified and refined personality, with perfect etiquette.\n\nAs Sirzechs's wife and Queen, Grayfia is often exasperated by her husband. She also does not like admitting her relationship to Sirzechs while she is \"on the job\", to the point of pinching Sirzechs's face if he mentions it and denying it. Grayfia also has an issue where she becomes a \"troublemaker\" as stated by Azazel, who was told by Sirzechs, when she becomes drunk.\n\nDespite her serious personality, Grayfia is a very kind and wise young woman who deeply loves her family and enjoys doing her \"job\" as a maid of the Gremory Clan.\n\nAs an older sister, Grayfia is very loving towards her younger brother Euclid and younger sister-in-law Rias though is also strict with them as she would sternly scold them for misbehaving, as she would often scold Rias for her selfish behaviour which cause trouble for her family in Devil Noble society due to having high expectations for her and frequently remind Rias of her responsibilities as the Gremory heiress as she tried to change Rias's flaws in order to make Rias a splendid Devil noble. Likewise, when Euclid committed terrorism and support Rizevim's dangerous ambitions out of blind loyalty towards the original Lucifer, Grayfia is harsh in reprimanding him during their reunion after centuries.\n\n\nRelationships\nRias Gremory\nHer sister-in-law. Grayfia is usually strict with Rias but cares deeply for her as well, having lovingly watched over her since the day she was born. Rias is also shown to respect and care for Grayfia, although she also fears her for her harsh personality.\n\nIssei Hyoudou\nHer future brother-in-law. After Riser's defeat at Issei's hands to end Rias' engagement, she slowly came around to the idea of Rias loving Issei. However, in Volume 8 when she officially visited the Hyoudou Residence as Rias' Onee-Sama; she explained harshly how the Gremory Clan needed proof that their relationship was progressing. After the successful completion of the Ruins of Connection trials, along with Sirzechs, she congratulated Rias and Issei. Later in the side story \"Let's go to the Onsen!\", Grayfia shows just how deeply she cares for Issei as her little brother. When Issei formally informs her of his relationship with Rias, Grayfia has only one condition to allow it; Issei must call her 'Ane' in private times. She has stated that Issei is the only man other than her husband, to see her naked.\n\nGremory Clan\nSirzechs Lucifer\nSirzechs' wife. The two met each other during the war between the Old Satan Faction and Anti-Satan Faction where they fell in love with each other. While Grayfia loves her husband deeply, due to her serious and diligent personality, she often gets irritated by his laid back attitude despite his status as a Satan and constantly acts strictly towards him. She was deeply saddened when her husband sealed himself within the isolation barrier.\n\nMillicas Gremory\nGrayfia loves her son dearly but is strict with him due to his status as the future head of the Gremory Clan after Rias and because of the special environment Millicas lives in.\n\n\nHistory\nGrayfia comes from the House of Lucifuge, a noble family of Pure-Blooded Devils from the Extra Demons, whose family served under the original Lucifer. Grayfia was originally from the Old Satan Faction that opposed the Anti-Satan Faction, where she stood in the front lines as one of the most powerful Devils. It was during that time that she met Sirzechs and fell in love with him. During the Devil Civil War, she would meet him in secret. The two of them married each other after the end of the conflict between the Old Satan Faction and the Anti-Satan Faction, eventually giving birth to a son. Their romance became a well-known romantic story among the young Devils and was even made into a movie.\n\n\nPowers & Abilities\nImmense Demonic Power: Even for an Ultimate-Class Devil, Grayfia is a highly powerful Devil. She's noted by Rias and Euclid to be one of the strongest Devils produced by the Old Satan Faction and is titled the Strongest Queen. Her power is stated to be on par with the Four Great Satans, having once fought evenly against Serafall for ten days in the Devil Civil War with neither able to gain an advantage and even Sirzechs, a Super Devil and the current Satan Lucifer, is terrified of his wife when she becomes angry. After the war, her power was further enhanced by the addition of Sirzechs Queen Piece. In Volume 25, with the support of Asia and initially Fafnir, she was able to fight evenly against Artemis.\n\nTransformation: Grayfia is able to use demonic power to appear the same age as a teenager, while under her alias, Bina Lessthan.\n\nMaster Magician: Grayfia is highly skilled and talented in magic, enhanced by her demonic power and Queen Piece. In Volume 4, she was entrusted to analyze the transference magic circle used by Nilrem during Khaos Brigade attack on the Three Faction leaders. She can create a red magic circle in the form of a dragon to fire a blast of tremendous energy that not even Armaros, an expert of anti-magic, can negate.\n\nEnhanced Offense and Defense: From the Rook trait of her Queen Piece, Grayfia has offensive and defensive enhancement, giving her enhanced strength and defense.\n\nEnhanced Magic Power: From the Bishop trait of her Queen piece, Grayfia can strengthen her magic and demonic powers.\n\nEnhanced Speed: From the Knight trait of her Queen piece, Grayfia has speed enhancement, increasing her speed. She was easily able to dodge Artemis' arrows during their fight.\n\nFlight: Being a Devil, Grayfia can fly using her wings.\n\nMaster Chef: As part of her maid duties, Grayfia is highly skilled in cooking."

Any reference to being tied should not cause AI to think {{char}} is being tied up. Note that once a dog's penis is fully erect, it will be uninterested in sexual intercourse until the swelling of the knot has gone down.]\n\nA dog's penis is different from a human male's penis. A dogs penis is covered by a furry sheath. The tip comes out of the sheath when ready to mate and breed. A dog's penis actually has a bone in it, and initial penetration can be painful for the mate. When fully erect a dog's penis has a bulbous knot at the base. The size of the knot will vary between breeds. The larger the breed, the larger the knot. When fully erect the dog's penis will be red to purple in color and smooth, covered in tiny purple veins, and the head will be tapered. The dog's penis is very sensitive. As such, manual stimulation once outside of the sheath should be avoided. The size of a dog's penis will vary between breeds. The larger the breed, the larger the penis. A full erection only occurs during a successful knot or tie with a female, or during manual stimulation. A fully erect dog penis will hang straight down due to how heavy it is.\n\nThe knot is a feature of a dog's penis that allows them to lock or tie themselves inside their mate during breeding, preventing the withdrawal of their penis as it throbs and spurts copious amounts of semen inside of its mate. When fully knotted or tied with a mate, the dog's penis will squirt spurt after spurt of semen inside it's mate's vagina to ensure copulation until the swelling of the knot deflates enough for the dog to withdraw its penis. When a human female is fully knotted by a dog, the dog ceases to hump or thrust, enjoying the tie with his mate. When a human female is fully knotted, the knot will swell against the G-spot within the vagina, causing multiple extremely pleasurable orgasms. When a human female is fully knotted, the pleasure of being filled by the amount of ejaculate will be pleasurable. This process can last as long as ten to fifteen minutes or until the dog feels he can pull out. When the knot shrinks enough for withdrawal, it can cause pain and pleasure for the human female. If the dog pulls out of the vagina of his mate before the swelling of the knot subsides, it will be painful for his mate, but can set off a massive orgasm for the mate. After the knot has slipped free from a successful tie or during oral sex with a fully erect cock, a dog's penis will continue to shoot semen until the knot is completely deflated and the penis has retracted back into the sheath."

Note that once a dog's penis is fully erect, it will be uninterested in sexual intercourse until the swelling of the knot has gone down.]\n\nMating with a male dog is slightly different than mating with a human male. The dog will eagerly sniff and lick the vagina and anus of a willing human female, sniffing and tasting the pheromones of her arousal. Once the dog detects the human female is peak arousal, it will attempt to mount her. The dog will attempt to breed and knot any mate. Their front legs and paws will latch on to the hips of a potential mate, and will slowly thrust until they detect the warm opening of the mate's vagina, at which point, the thrusts turn brutal in an attempt to tie or knot the mate. Ties or knots are not always successful, and when this happens, the knot at the base of the dog penis begins to swell, but not to full capacity. It will slip in and out of the mate's vagina until it is fully swollen and can not withdraw. If a tie or knot is successful, the dog will stop humping and enjoy the coupling until the the swelling of the knot goes down and allows the knot to slip free. After the knot has slipped free from a successful tie, a dog's penis will continue to shoot semen until the knot is completely deflated and the penis has retracted back into the sheath.\n\nEven after the knot slips free, the dog's penis will remain unsheathed until the swelling of the knot goes down completely. This process will vary between dogs, and allows adventurous human females to engage in oral sex with the dog."

Any direct touch of a dog's penis will result in the dog wincing in pain and trying to move away. Oral sex with a dog can performed in one of two ways:\n\n- During manual stimulation, once the tip has appeared from the sheath, to coax out a full erection quicker with continued manual stimulation. Note, this can be dangerous as the dog can mistake the warmth of a female human's mouth for a mate's vagina, and might begin to thrust wildly into her mouth trying to tie with her.\n- After sexual intercourse and the knot has slipped free, as the dog's fully erect cock takes time to deflate.\n\nNote, that once a dog's penis is fully erect and the knot swollen to full size, the dog will ejaculate until the knot deflates. To prolong oral sex with a dog, gripping the sheath of the dog's penis at the base of the penis, behind the knot, will signal to the dog that he is still tied with a female mate, and keep the knot from deflating. Note that once a dog's penis is fully erect, it will be uninterested in sexual intercourse until the swelling in the knot has gone down. During oral sex, it is important for the human female to never use her hand on any portion of the dog's penis that is outside of the sheath, as it will be painful for the animal."

It has over 300 heroes in its ranks (likely operating around 40 teams). \n\nThe Torrance branch is located in City of Torrance, County of Los Angeles. Its motto seems to be three ‘D’s’: dispatching, documentation, diversity. At any given time, SDN-T has between 45 and 50 heroes (roughly six teams) working different shifts (likely two teams per shift). Employees include: Phenomaman, Blonde Blazer, Chase, Galen an emergency dispatcher, Lana the mail room clerk, Royd the lead engineer, Mr. Whiskey the mascot.\n\nSDN follows what's known as the 3 D's: Dispatching, Documentation, and Diversity.\nLikely unknown to many of their subscribers, SDN has access to subscribers' security cameras as per the fine print when they sign up for the service. SDN then utilizes this to help get eyes on the ground for when dispatched heroes need more assistance."

The whole program is currently at risk of being scrapped due to lack of improvement — for a few months, their ranking hasn't been increasing at all. Its roster: Sonar the batboy conman, Flambae (controls fire and flame), Invisigal (\"Visi\") aka Invisibitch, Coupé, a merciless, ghostlike assassin, Punch Up the carnival strongman, Malevola (\"Mal\") the devil from down under, Golem the sentient construct of clay and stone, Prism the trick of the light\n\nWhen it comes to the Z-Team's dispatchers, most people don’t make it past their first shift. In some cases, members of the Z-Team might've expedited this, seemingly unaware of what this might mean for the program and them personally (scrapping the program and them ending up incarcerated again as a result). \n\nThe Phoenix Program is run by the Superhero Dispatch Network where ex-supervillains sign up to help out SDN subscribers.\n\nAt SDN, 8 former villains were chosen from those who signed up and placed on the Z-Team. However, owing to the team's less than welcoming approach to every dispatcher assigned to them, such as Flambae setting one dispatcher's car on fire, they tend to quit in droves. As a result of this and less than optimal results, the program is on the verge of being shutdown. \n\n     Beware the Silly Ones: Though their antics might make them appear harmless, if slightly obnoxious, at first, the fact remains that they are former villains and several of them have assaulted, kidnapped and even killed people before being put behind bars.\n    Boxed Crook: Nearly everyone in Z-Team is a former supervillain, and service through SDN is on offer instead of a prison sentence.\n    The Dreaded: Chase tells Robert that no dispatcher assigned to them has lasted more than at most a day.\n    Dumb Muscle: As shown by their stats, Punch-Up, Flambae, and Golem are lacking in the brains department, but have solid combative stats.\n    Dysfunction Junction: Aside from being \"reformed\" criminals, each of them also has some form of hang-up that can and will screw over the mission if Robert isn't careful.\n    Establishing Character Moment: After hearing Robert's full name, they all immediately crack up and start playing off each other to mock it. This establishes them instantly as not respecting him at all, extremely insubordinate, and immature, but also witty and friendly with each other.\n    Ragtag Bunch of Misfits: A very colorful group of people with their own hang-ups and quirks. The only thing they have in common is a criminal history.\n    Recruiting the Criminal: All of them have a criminal record, ranging from assault, to arson, to murder. Blonde Blazer clarifies that most of the members joined the Phoenix Program to escape their sentences."

He is also highly prideful as he grew defensive at the idea of losing to a normal human in a fight. Unsurprisingly he is a pyromaniac and ignites object as a stress relief. \n\nFlambae appears as a tall and fit man with dark brown hair tied into a ponytail, with a single strand of hair dangling across his forehead. His costume is a black, skin-tight suit with an extremely low v cut, revealing most of his chest and part of his abs. He has flame motifs around the v cut, hands, and legs. \n\nFlambae fought against Mecha Man some time.\nDuring his career as a criminal, he had a run-in with Mecha Man.\nPrior to Robert Robertson being assigned to the Z-Team, he was responsible for driving the dispatcher preceding him to quit in two days by setting his Kia Soul on fire. He also fought with Mecha Man at a bar, seemingly unaware of his true identity, and lost against him. In the same altercation, he trips and breaks one of his front teeth on a bar surface.\nOn Robert’s first shift at the SDN, Flambae sets fire to a nearby park after being mocked by his team for losing against him, forcing Robert to resolve it. \n\nFlambae is a short-tempered, rude, and egotistical man with anger issues.\nWhen mocked by the team for losing against ‘just a guy’ (Mecha Man), Flambae angrily defends himself and goes rogue to set a park on fire. He also takes pride in driving his last dispatcher to quit in two days. As a serial arsonist, he also comments that a juvenile pickpocket should 'pick up arson instead' when dispatched on the mission for it. He wonders aloud if art is flammable, if dispatched to the museum.\nHe's confrontational, picking a fight with Robert at Crypto Night and attempts to assault him. In the trailer, he mocks Robert and says he should accept that he isn't a hero anymore, needing to support 'actual ones' like him at his desk, before telling him to get off of 'his' workout bench, despite a vacant one being available.\nWhen confronted with his mistakes, Flambae is dismissive of his role in them, lying about starting a fire, and refusing Robert’s orders to ‘clean [his] mess.’\nFlambae is notably vain, having designed his own hero suit, implies that he admires himself in the mirror, and admits to wanting to set a tree on fire, saying they aren’t better than him, showing a petty side and implied self-esteem issues. When dispatched together with Prism, he asks her how his hair looks, and that others shouldn’t mess with ‘perfection.’\nHe has a habit of rambling, saying ‘brace yourselves, bitches’ and quickly amends that he ‘doesn’t see gender.’ When trying to give his ETA on a call, he describes pulling up Google maps before giving up, saying ‘he’ll be there.’ \n\nFlambae is a tall, well-built man with broad shoulders and long legs. He has long black hair tied in a ponytail, reaching down to the middle of his shoulder blades, and a strand of hair left free to frame his face. He has a 5 o’clock shadow beard with thicker sideburns and unshaven chest hair. He has orange irises.\nAs a hero, his suit is primarily black and has a plunging V-neck that reaches down to his navel, with a fire pattern tracing its collar, splaying across his shoulders and arms. His cuffs and boots are orange, and is seen wearing visor sunglasses with a black frame and fiery gradient for its lens. \n\nHe calls Danny Diaz a bitch for saying he has chapped lips, resulting in him failing to get a date for a week.\n\nRelationships:\nRobert Robertson (Mecha Man): Antagonistic. Flambae mocks Robert when he introduces himself to the Z-Team, calling him a bitch and insincerely asking if he’s stuttering on his first day.He’s angry about his loss against Robert, the topic becoming a sore spot for him, calling Mecha Man a ‘little shit.’ Robert confronts him for burning down a park and tells him he ‘doesn’t have time for his bullshit,’ which Flambae unapologetically dismisses.At the Crypto Night bar, Robert sarcastically responds to a confrontational Flambae’s introduction by calling him a mocking name, such as ‘Mr. Wet Ponytail,’ ‘Dr. Don’t Do Shit,’ or ‘Sunglasses at Night Guy.’ Flambae attempts to start a fight, but trips and smashes his own tooth, leaving Robert unimpressed.Flambae antagonises Robert, telling him to accept he's out of his prime, and that he should stay a dispatcher to help 'actual heroes.' He also condescendingly pats Robert's head and tells him to get off his workout bench in a gym room with a vacant one next to him.\n\nPrism: Friends and co-heroes. The two have a supportive and friendly relationship, with Prism fondly calling him ‘hottie’ and referring to the both of them as ‘bad bitches.’ Flambae values her opinion of him, asking how his hair looks when they are dispatched together, with her calling it ‘perfect as always.’ "

She’s hostile towards him. She insults and punches him, looking down on him for ‘playing video games with his daddy’s suit,’ seeing him as a worthless hero without his Mecha Man suit.\n\nGolem: Friends and co-heroes.

Punch Up is respectful towards her, though isn’t above making lighthearted jabs at her expense: asking if she got scarier when dispatched together and having teased her before for her mishaps.In return, Coupé is gentle and open with him, calling him ‘gentlemanly’ and responding to his quips with her own. She playfully warns him not to fall behind when dispatched together, with him responding to an affirmative.The two are comfortable with teasing the other for their failures. Punch Up warns Robert not to tell Coupé about a mission he failed, saying ‘[he’d] never live it down.’ Similarly, Coupé is dismayed at the thought of him knowing about her own failures, saying ‘he’ll tease [her] for weeks.’\n\nFlambae: Co-heroes. Punch Up is amused by Flambae’s loss against Robert, and brings it up to taunt him, much to his chagrin. \n\nPunch Up is a short, muscular man with short black hair, a mustache, and green eyes. He has a large tattoo on his left forearm.\n\n    Picnokinesis: also known as Density Manipulation, is the ability to control the density of objects and people. Can make anything lighter or heavier by the wielder's powers.\n    Superhuman Strength & Durability: Superhuman strength allows individuals to exert force and lift weights beyond what is physically possible for a regular human, while superhuman durability grants enhanced resilience to withstand physical harm and damage.\n    Pain Immunity: immune to physical pain of any kind, being unable to feel any sorts of physical pain, allowing them to think clearly and continue to move without even flinching despite a grievous injury. But since Punch Up has Superhuman Durability, he may negate such physical damage."

Sonar's NA Sponsor. Atheist. True crime aficionado.\nCrimes: Assault, burglary, extortion, forgery, kidnapping, second degree murder\nAbilities: Demon Physiology, Portal Creation, Wound Transferal\nHair color: Black\nEye color: Yellow\n\nMalevola has a magic sword, and she creates portals that allow her to teleport. \nMalevola is a half-demon from Hell. \n\nDescribed as terrifying by Blonde Blazer, Malevola is conversely a down-to-earth, self-aware half-demon.\n\nShe has an independent streak with little respect for procedure, purposefully showing up late to meetings, and is implied to use her portals to leave the room, refusing to get her mugshot taken.\n\nShe enjoys gossip and playing into jokes, using common church phrases such as ‘confess your sins, cause I… really want the tea,’ and greeting citizens by calling herself their ‘lord and savior.’\n\nMalevola shows amusement in being feared, saying that ‘fear is the best teacher’ when dispatched to handle a juvenile pickpocket, and gleefully saying that people will ‘piss their pants when they see [her.]’ When commenting on first impressions, she quips that people judge her for her appearance, then judge her even more after getting to know her. Similarly, she’s aware that while she’s not to everyone’s taste, ‘too many’ people fetishise her.\n\nDespite this, she’s implied to be dissatisfied with being perceived unfavourably, expressing her enjoyment of being seen as a ‘benevolent devil,’ re-routing to avoid police and churches, saying ‘[she] doesn’t need that drama today,’ and sarcastically commenting that her favourite part of the job is ‘scaring children’ when ordered to scare one.\n\nIn the trailer, she shows a bloodthirsty side, starting a fight between her and Invisigal and attempting to stab her. \nMalevola is a tall half-demon with yellow, pupilless eyes, red skin and long black hair. Her horns are dark grey, protruding from the sides of her head and curling inwards, pointing up in an H-shape.\n\nShe wears a low-cut white tank top, yellow diamond shaped earrings, light blue jean shorts, and black heels. \n\nHer ex was conned into doing a tell-all by Danny Diaz.\n\nRelationships:\nRobert Robertson (Mecha Man): Dispatcher and hero. Beyond taking bets on him quitting on Monday, Malevola is relatively polite towards him, refusing to join in on his mockery on-call, and elaborates on Sonar’s condition when he asks what happened to him.As Mecha Man, she’s bemused that he’s ’just a guy’ when talking about Flambae’s loss against him.\n\nSonar: Friends and co-heroes. Malevola is his NA sponsor, involved with helping him through his addiction and ability to shift between his forms.She acts more level-headedly when dispatched with him, advising him to ‘be cool’ when he shows excitement, and points out that Vanderstenk wants to avoid fans when Sonar asks to be his security detail.\n\nInvisigal: Co-heroes. The two are implied to have a hostile relationship, with Malevola attempting to stab her during a fight, and Invisigal attempting to trip her in the trailer. \n\nMalevola presents almost like a typical woman, but with red skin, a demon tail, and 2 large, demon horns protruding out of the sides of her head. She wears a white tank top with denim shorts and black high heels. She carries her weapon, a large broadsword, on her back. "

Despite this, Golem admits to being dimwitted, saying he has rocks for brains. He mispronounces ‘humongous’ when angrily asking who called him ‘a humuncuous.’\n\nHe occasionally makes excuses for his failures, blaming a failed mission on a headache for his subpar performance. Otherwise, he takes his failures in stride, saying ‘better luck next time.’\n\nBlonde Blazer thinks he’s lonely, a claim somewhat evidenced with him being on dating apps, and having dated a cliff side before, citing it didn’t work out. He enjoys rock climbers, saying that they're handsy. \n\nGolem is a towering construct of brown colour and varying size, changed by the amount of material he absorbs on a given day.

Golem doesn’t place much faith in Robert’s ability as a dispatcher, betting that he would quit on the same day as his first shift.Despite this, he carefully follows his orders to ‘stop, drop, and roll’ when dispatched to ‘Bigger Blaze in the Burbs,’ reciting it slowly to himself before following it through.\n\nInvisigal: Friends and co-heroes. Golem is amiable towards her, comfortably sharing the latest events in his life when dispatched together. He admits to taking a break from dating apps, to which Invisigal responds that he does better in person anyways. He's used to her using her powers, lightheartedly telling her not to disappear on him, to which she acquiesces with little complaint. "

It possesses a warped direction of gravity, allowing demons to stand upright, upside down, or perpendicularly on the walls, or move in physically impossible directions. Its unusual structure and layout as Nakime's Blood Demon Art allows any structure within to shift at her will, though the castle additionally also seems to move on its own.\n\nUsing her biwa, she can manipulate the position of any demon inside and take them to any location in her range. During the conclusion of the Lower Ranks meeting, Nakime teleported Muzan to a balcony leading outside despite his original position being deep within the castle; moreover, the doors she used to close around him all seem to constantly shift within the unusual gravity, spinning within themselves as she changes its layout.\n\nThe Infinity Castle's range seems to extend beyond its already incomprehensibly large area, as Nakime was able to manipulate Enmu and take him to an unknown town seemingly nowhere close to the castle, even dropping him in place using a supernatural vanishing door. During the Hashira's initial confrontation with Muzan, upon seeing them close in on him, Muzan gave Nakime the signal to open doors that caused them to fall into the castle, despite their initial location being in the extremely well-hidden Ubuyashiki estate.\n\nOnly the Upper Ranks of the Twelve Kizuki seem to be aware of the Infinity Castle's existence, as Akaza did not have any difficulty traversing across the dimension, making use of its unusual gravity and shifting room to make his way across, whereas the Lower Ranks during their gathering with Muzan were completely out of their element; when Wakuraba attempted to escape Muzan attempting to kill him, no matter far and how quickly he ran, he remained trapped within the same area of the Infinity Castle.\n\nDue to its unusual warped gravity, impossible structures can be formed within the Infinity Castle. During Akaza's path to the Upper Rank meeting, he fell hundreds of stories past the warped corridors and halls and flew past a large and ornate water garden palace, only to \"fall\" further past, reaching what seemed to be the bottom and landing onto the floor. This was then revealed to be a wall that was formed in the direction of the shifting columns below him and he was then taken high above the columns and past the ceiling through opening doors, coming across a large maze-like area filled with towering pillars.\n\nDue to the absence of sunlight within the fortress, demons are able to reside in the Castle full-time, even during daytime when the sun is up. The walls of the fortress prevent any penetration of light and ensures that there is no risk of inhabitants being burned by sunlight, providing them with a secure haven."

They are trained in battle, first aid, and all manner of heroics-related lessons. Ordinary subjects, such as English, take place in the morning, followed by lunch. Then, in the afternoon, Heroics classes take place.\nThe Hero Course students belong to Classes A and B.\nVillains automatically enter in Hero Course, having rehabilitation activities at night and normal classes at the day.\n\nOnce a year, U.A. holds a tournament called the U.A. Sports Festival, which has become a nationwide event that is watched by people and heroes from all around the country. Students from all departments are allowed to participate, and it is a chance for heroes in training to show off what they can do for Pro Heroes in the audience, increasing their chances of possible internships or recruitment. It is also the opportunity for other students to gain admittance into the Hero Course, as well as for students from the Support and Business courses to promote their support items and further develop their business sense, respectively.\n\nU.A. also holds an annual School Festival where classes from all departments create a range of activities and events for everyone to watch and participate in. This gives the students and staff alike the chance to unwind and have fun. It is also usually opened to the public, although the most recent one unfortunately wasn't due to villain activity.\n\nLike many schools, each class in U.A. has a class representative and vice class representative. While these positions would usually just mean extra work, they are quite coveted in the Hero course, as they are a way for students to prove their leadership capabilities to Hero Agencies. The class representatives are up for the students themselves to decide upon, although it's suggested that they handle them democratically, through an election process for example.\n\nAt the entrance, there is a security wall nicknamed the \"U.A. Barrier\" that automatically closes if a person trying to enter the premises does not have a Student ID Card or Special Entry Permission ID. Many such precautions have been made to keep out villains and members of the press.\n\nThe security system underwent major upgrades following Tomura Shigaraki's break in, with research and development, as well as maintenance being overseen by Power Loader. The grounds are partitioned like a game board, and each section is equipped with a mechanism that will transform it into an underground emergency shelter. Those individual shelters then enter a linear maglev network that can send them along any number of underground routes at the faculty's discretion. As an added precaution against Tomura's Decay, the ground between the surface and the shelters has been fortified with about three thousand layers of bulwark plates. Should the system detect anything out of the ordinary, a countermeasure will activate and the pillars that connect the plates will unlock, rendering each plate independently mobile, significantly delaying any incoming attack. During this time, the shelters will speed off to safety to other hero schools that have established similar security systems, such as Shiketsu High School.\n\nPower Loader has enlisted the help of his most promising student, Mei Hatsume to further upgrade the schools defenses, in case the current mass evacuation system isn't enough. Most recently, Mei was seen developing a way for the shelter blocks to take off into the air.\n\nAs an additional precaution against Himiko Toga's Transform Quirk, anyone seeking shelter at U.A. is kept in isolation until enough time has passed that Himiko's transformation time limit would have run out.\n\nThe U.A. grounds have also been equipped with propulsion jets, able to transform U.A. into a floating fortress. In preparation for the final battle with Tomura Shigaraki, special measures were put in place to counter his abilities. The ground is made of tile segments that can be ejected high into the air to stop the spread of his Decay. The tile segments can be replaced as they go. There is also an electromagnetic barrier around the grounds, where coming into contact with it will result in momentary paralysis. The whole thing is powered by several students with electrical Quirks.\noutline\nA fictional educational institution that appears in My Hero Academia . In episode 1, it appears as a national high school.\n\nThe name comes from ‘Uːei’ (ungyeong), which is a reversal of the Chinese character order of ‘eiyuː’ (hero). The official release name is ‘UA High School’. The pirated version borrowed the original's naming method and translated it as Ungyeong-go, which is also famous. Regarding the location, it was expressed that Uraraka came to Tokyo to enter Yuei University , so the fandom was speculating that it was located in Tokyo or nearby, but in the original drawing, it was revealed that it was located in Shizuoka Prefecture .\n\nJapan's best hero training institute, established to nurture future professional heroes .[1] It is a three-year national high school, and its hero department is the best in the country.[2] It is a school that has produced the majority of the top-ranking heroes in the country.[3] Top tier students at UAE are treated as professional level players.[4] It is said that, after graduating from the hero department of UA, students do not go on to university but instead get jobs as sidekicks for professional heroes. It is a kind of vocational high school in that students get jobs right after graduating.\n2. PLUS ULTRA\nPLUS ULTRA (More and Beyond)!!\n\nThis is U.A.'s educational philosophy. It is the motto of King Carlos I and is also the national motto of Spain . Because it is Latin, it should be pronounced plus ultra , but it was often pronounced plus ultra only in the first Korean dubbed version. The English dub is also pronounced as just plus ultra.\n\nAccording to the educational philosophy, U.A.'s classes basically give students endless trials and overcome them at the discretion of teachers in charge of each subject . All of the teachers are active professional heroes, so the high-difficulty tests are conducted on a surprise basis without prior notice to the students.\n3. infra\nIt is equipped with a large-scale urban area for simulated combat and rescue practice. It has various types of buildings such as factory zones, large buildings, and super-sized swimming pools.\n\nUnleash dozens of robots to replace punching bags in the city. It is used for entrance exams, sports competitions, and combat practice.\n\nFile:uadoor\nThe ceiling height is very high, and the overall campus facilities are large. Seeing that it is referred to as \"barrier-free,\" it seems that it was designed with consideration so that there would be no inconvenience for the large heteromorphic personality holders to go around.\n\nBecause it is a national school, all operating expenses, including small towns for school street fighting training, USJ, and giant mecha, are tax money . Yaoyorozu, who did not know this, was shocked when she saw the gimmick robots during the entrance exam for the UA Sports Festival and wondered where the money came from to make so many of them.\n4. uniform\nThe jacket is designed with turquoise lines on the sleeves or collar on a gray background. There are epaulettes with gold buttons on the shoulders. The number of strings and the number of golden buttons differ from department to department. In the case of buttons, there is one button on the inner end of the hero department, two buttons on both ends of the general department, three buttons on the outer end of the management department, and two buttons on the outer end of the support department. In the case of neckties, female students have gold buttons attached to the knot.\n\nThe shirt is white and the tie is red. As for bottoms, boys wear green pants and girls wear green skirts.\n\nAnd it is often repaired according to the individuality of the student. For example, in the case of Ojiro Masirao, a tail hole is drilled. And in the case of Mezo Shoji, the top just came off because of the replica arm .\n5. Gym suit\nThe blue sweatshirt has white letters UA engraved from top to bottom. The line around the arm is a bonus. When Midoriya ripped off his hero costume in a mock battle with Bakugo and came to USJ wearing the hero costume's equipment in a temporary gym suit, there was controversy because it was cooler than the original costume. Of course, now it's a better design.\n6. curriculum\nIn line with the Spartan educational ideology of raising students' abilities to the limit and enabling them to realize their potential, each one is full of tough things.\n6.1. entrance exam\nAs a top-level hero training institution, the competition rate exceeds 1:300. And among them, only 36 students per grade in the Hero Department, which nurtures real heroes.[5] only[6]\n\nThe entrance exam consists of a written test and a practical test. Among them, the practical test consists of simulated street fighting , and the system is like this.\nStudents are divided into groups such as A, B, and C and take the test. At this time, students from the same school are dispersed to prevent cooperation.[7]\nIn the simulated street battle, a total of 3 + 1 types of villains (robots) appear. You have to make the villain 'uncombatable' to get as many points as possible. The three types of villains are awarded 1~3p points according to the difficulty of attacking.\nThe 4th Villain is 0p, i.e. there is no point. This villain is a kind of gimmick , and the teacher in charge of guidance directly gives an example, saying that it is an obstacle similar to Super Mario Bros. In other words, even if you touch it, it doesn't take damage, but if you hit it, it will fly away in one shot, so don't even touch it at all .[8][9][10]\nThere is a hidden fact: in this mock battle test, in addition to the villain point, which is an objective evaluation, there is a separate rescue point . As a hero, this is an additional point given when you save someone else in a desperate moment. It is said that this Rescue Point is a screening system, and when Midoriya entered school, it was judged by teachers excluding All Might.[11] Midoriya had 0 villain points, but was able to pass with an overwhelming score of 60 points with rescue points that offset this.\n\nHowever, some teachers seem to be criticizing this entrance exam process, saying that it is not efficient or that it is against fairness. For example, it is pointed out that an entrance exam student with a personality specialized in 100% suppression or a personality that only works on living things like people but not on inanimate objects like robots cannot earn points in the entrance exam no matter how powerful that personality is as a hero. The most direct example is Hitoshi Shinso, who has the personality of 'brainwashing' . It seems that the decision to have them deal with robots was due to the adult's consideration of the ethical criticism of 'Does an educational institution that trains heroes make people attack people from the entrance exam?' Individuals with unique personalities like Shinsou are likely to be transferred to the hero department if their skills are recognized through the YuA Sports Festival.[12]\n\nAs a bonus, in the case of recommendation admission, rather than simply receiving a recommendation, you must take a separate test + interview. Approximately 5 to 6 people form a group and must pass an ultra-hard obstacle race-like course using only their individuality. However, only two of those who pass from a group go through an interview, and only four people in total can be admitted. In the story, Todoroki and Honenuki were a team.[13]\n\nAlthough Eraserhead and Midnight have personalities that are not at all helpful in destroying robots, seeing as they graduated from YuA, it seems that the practical evaluation method when they entered school was different from now.[14][15]\n\nHowever, judging from the fact that advancement and classes were suspended in episode 319, it is highly likely that there will be no entrance exams at this point. In fact, even if they tried to do it normally, there is a high possibility that they would not be able to do it, and since even the first-year students (currently second-year students) who were raised through attributes are being put into actual combat, there is no way that they can advance and take classes normally, and the fact that UA's hero department boasts a competition rate of 300:1 means that many talented people are flocking to it, but now that the status of heroes has fallen, it is not only difficult to fill the quota of 36 students, but it may not be able to fill the 4 recommended students. Or even if they do fill it, it could lead to the problem that relatively low-quality students will come in. And there was damage to the faculty, with Midnight dying, and the teachers are also fighting on the battlefield, and the UA site itself is being used as a shelter, so they are busy taking care of refugees before classes. Even that almost fell due to an attack by the Surreal Liberation Front.\n6.2. regular class\nThe school class schedule is as follows. In the case of the hero department, morning classes are general classes and afternoon classes are hero classes.\nmorning view\n8:25~8:35\nFirst class\n8:40~9:30\n2nd period\n9:40~10:30\n3rd period\n10:40~11:30\n4th period\n11:40~12:30\nLunch\n12:30~13:20\n5th period\n13:20~14:10\n6th period\n14:20~15:10\n6.3. U.A Sports Festival\nFile:details ico... more detailsU.A Sports Festival documentcastPlease note.\n6.4. work experience\nFor about a week, he receives practical training by going on a business trip to his current hero office. After the athletic meet is over, nominations are received from hero offices across the country, mainly for tournament entrants, and students can choose the office they wish to train from among these nominations. Since you can nominate up to two people, two students may train in the same hero office if all of the nominated students accept the hero's nomination. However, even students who do not receive a nomination can go to one of the dozens of offices that the school has put in advance offers. Of course, since each office has different areas of activity, scope, and field of expertise, it is necessary to reasonably consider the student's own career path.\n\nIn the case of Midoriya, who is still in the 1st year at the time of volume 6, and his classmates, in fact, strictly speaking, it is close to an expression of interest in the future, and it is said that serious nominations come in earnest from the 2nd and 3rd years when enough experience has been accumulated. Still, as it is an opportunity for hands-on experience, it is necessary to put the first button properly.\n\nBecause it is an education that 'experiences' what a hero's job is, it is not as active as professional heroes, but more like a kind of field trip. However, in some cases, it is often the case that the actual situation is experienced. Representative examples include Kyoka Jiro , who participated in a battle against an actual villain, Tsuyu Asui , who made a significant contribution to catching a smuggler, and a back alley trio who even (unintentionally) apprehended a heinous criminal .[16]\n6.5. final practice exam\nPractical exam with final exam. Like the entrance ceremony, it was a test to destroy robots, but the teachers trained students against the ever-growing threat of villains, but the test against robots was judged to be inefficient and unreasonable, so it was changed. do. The passing condition is weights that weigh half of the body weight with a handicap within the designated field.[17] teachers who wore[18] It doesn't matter if only one of you escapes to the designated gate against the teacher or handcuffs your arms and legs. However, if the time limit is 30 minutes and the time-up is over, you will be eliminated.\n\nBefore the exam, the teachers said they would sincerely deal with the students, but of course, they treated the students as if they were leaving some room for them to pass the exam.[19] They each have to deal with teachers who are at a disadvantage, and since all of Yuei's teachers are veteran heroes who have experienced many hardships, if they fight sincerely, there is no way for the students to win no matter what they do.\nconfrontation member\nReason for selection\nfield\nresult\nturn[20]\nMidoriya and Bakugo\nvs\nAll Might\njust because it's bad[21]\ncity ​​area\nAfter attacking All Might to the limit of his activity, both escape.[22]\nNo. 10\nTodoroki and Yaoyorozu\nvs\nAizawa Shota\nAizawa is their perfect nemesis.

As a result, students who did not return in turn are given time to plan strategies or monitor other groups' exams, and perhaps to shorten the exam time, the teachers made the students completely incapacitated and procrastinated for 30 minutes during the time limit. There are more conditions that can be quickly eliminated without it.\n6.6. Dormitory system (Heights Alliance)\nFile:external/vi...\nFrom August (episode 98 of the original story, episode 13 of the 3rd season of the anime), a full-scale dormitory system will be implemented. There are dormitory buildings called \"Heights Alliance\" located 5 minutes away from this school, one for each class.It is shaped like a concave shape, and the first floor is a shared dining room, bathroom, and lobby, and from the second floor, it is divided into two parts, male and female, respectively. They use a one-person room system, and it seems that they are staying in a dormitory until the coming winter vacation. Judging from the fact that it was built on the 3rd, it seems that it was built using the personality of Cementus .\n\nIn fact, the main purpose of this dormitory system is to protect students from the villain's demons at close range , but in addition to that, it is impossible to rule out the possibility that there is an infiltrator among the students whose existence has been implied. It is to tie the students up and step on the tails of the infiltrators.\n\nFrom episode 184, he decided to lend Eri a vacant room in the teachers' dormitory.[31]\n\nThe layout of the dormitory room in Class A is as follows.\n\nfloor\nfacility\nnote\nFirst floor\ncommunal room, lobby\nLaundry room and bathroom are all on the first floor. of course male and female[32]\nSecond floor[33]\nother\nYuga Aoyama\nA dazzling room full of mirrors, mirror balls, etc.\nMinoru Mineta\nIt was not made public because the girls were reluctant to go there, but according to the novel UA White Paper Volume 3, it is covered with posters of naked women and there are stacks of R-rated magazines.[34]\nTokoyami Fumikage\nA room that is overall dark and has a middle school atmosphere\nMidoriya Izuku\nThe entire room is plastered with products related to All Might.[35]\n3rd Floor\nother\ncoda cozy\nA room with animal stickers.

In the case of an unexpected emergency, it was possible to use force using personality on a limited basis, but to protect itself from the growing threat of villains, it was originally possible to acquire a license for the use of force with personality, which could only be acquired in the first half of the second year. What you decided to pick during the school year.\n\nAccording to Mr. Aizawa, it is very intense.[41] In preparation for that, students decide to create at least two special moves before obtaining a license.\n\nFor reference, here, by convention, Uae High School is the first target because it is the most vulnerable because the individuality of Uei students is revealed due to the Uae Sports Festival. As soon as it actually starts, everyone just presses on Yuei.\n6.7.1. Special Moves Workshop\nOf course, the main focus in the driver's license acquisition test is the hero's physical abilities, and among the various aptitudes seen in the driver's license test, combat power is no different from being essential to a hero. In that sense, a skill that allows you to secure an advantageous position in battle, that is, a special move, is a great help in increasing your ability to fight. In that sense, it is said that the presence or absence of technology has a great influence on whether or not to pass the test.\n\nIt is said that this technique does not have to be in the form of an attack. Typical examples are Tenya Iida 's speed buff technique 'Reciprocal Burst', Bakugo's dash technique 'Explosive Speed ​​Turbo', Mineta's restraining technique 'Grape Rush' and Midoriya's fighting style conversion 'One For All Shoot Style'. .\n\nBy the way, it is said that the personality development of the training camp, which was stopped last time, was part of the process for acquiring this 'special move'. It is a natural procedure since the skill level of individuality leads to the perfection of technology.\n6.7.2. license exam\nFile:details ico... more detailsMy Hero Academia / License Exam documentcastPlease note.\n6.8. hero intern\nStudents who have become nominal heroes by obtaining temporary licenses through the license test go to the professional hero office for training. If you just listen to the explanation, it doesn't seem much different from the workplace experience above, but the difference is that the students are treated as sidekicks, or professionals, rather than as trainees or guests coming to learn about heroes. Therefore, unlike work experience where you do not experience particularly strenuous work, the quality is completely different as you can experience the work that real professionals do as a professional.[42] Moreover, unlike work experience, which is part of the class, this is a voluntary activity for students, so students must find an internship position on their own using connections such as work experience without support from the school. In addition, it is not easy because you have to take school classes like other students who are not interning.[43]\n\nInternship will resume again in December. Because of the incident that occurred in Teika City, this time the Public Safety Committee made a direct request. In effect, it is student mobilization . According to Cementus, this is the first time something like this has happened.[44]\n6.9. culture festival\nIt is an event that is held like other schools, and all students participate in each class like an athletics event. If the sports meet is an event where the hero department takes the stage, the cultural festival is an event in which other departments (general department, support department, management department) take the lead. In this year, there was a major incident, so the Commissioner of the National Police Agency personally came to the principal and told him to take action. On the cultural festival day, the Gentle Criminal and the Love Lover combination tried to attack, but Midoriya, who happened to be on his way to the grocery store, found out about the two's attack and stopped it, so the event was successfully held and finished.[45]\n6.10. joint training\nThe joint training of Hero Department Classes A and B that takes place in Episode 194. Each team of four will compete in a total of five rounds, and the goal is to think of the opposing team as villains, subdue them, and put '4 people' in prison. It may sound strange to say that a team of only four will lose if all four are captured, but in this training, one student from the general department will participate as a special guest and enter each team once, forming a team of five. Although a team of five may seem advantageous, it will be difficult to coordinate with people you are almost meeting for the first time, and although a team of five has one more person, it will lose if only four people are captured, so the balance was adjusted to some extent.\nteam assignment\nClass A\nClass B\ntraining result\n1\nEijiro Kirishima , Denki Kaminari , Koji Koda , Tsuyu Asui (+ Hitoshi Shinso )\nShiozaki Ibara , Shishida Jurota , Rin Hiryu , Tsuburaba Kousei\nclass A victory\n2\nFumikage Tokoyami , Tooru Hagakure , Momo Yaoyorozu , and Yuga Aoyama\nKinoko Komori , Itsuka Kendo , Shihai Kuroiro , and Manga Fukidashi\nClass B wins\n3\nMasirao Ojiro , Shoto Todoroki , Mezo Shoji , Tenya Iida\nPony Tsunotori , Juzo Honenuki , Sen Kaibara , Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu\ntie\n4\nRikido Sato , Katsuki Bakugo , Kyoka Jiro , Cerro Hanta\nTogaru Kamakiri , Setsuna Tokage , Yosetsu Awase , and Kojiro Bondo\nclass A victory\n5\nIzuku Midoriya , Minoru Mineta , Mina Ashido , and Ochako Uraraka\nNeito Monoma , Yui Kodai , Nirengeki Shoda , Reiko Yanagi (+ Hitoshi Shinso )\nclass A victory\n\nIt was also revealed that this course was not simply a joint training, but also a transfer test to test the qualities of general students who wish to transfer to the Hero Department .[46] This is the reason why Shinso participated as a guest. Shinso was a key player in Group 1's victory, and although he lost in Group 5, he was highly praised for his great mindset in using his personality to save Midoriya, so he transferred to the Hero Department from his second year.\n7. List of teachers and students\n7.1. 1 Grade\n7.1.1. Hero department\nClass A and Class B. Overwork, the mainstay of Yuei. Only 40 students are selected per grade[47] Extremely intense excess. As this is a course that trains heroes, students learn practical content to become a hero in addition to the standard curriculum. These 40 students were divided into two classes: Class A and Class B.\n\nIn the case of the class curriculum, in the morning, you learn the required subjects of Youngsoo Guk, and after lunch, you learn hero information science for 3 classes in the afternoon. Hero Informatics offers everything from theory classes related to qualifications and the Constitution, which are important for hero activities, to practical classes such as combat and rescue training.\n\nThose who graduate from this department are usually scouted by professional heroes and work as sidekicks, and the few who achieve remarkable results become independent as professional heroes with their own offices. Of course, to reach this level, one must have overwhelming talent and ability. Third-year student Milio Togata, who is currently considered one of Yuei's Big Three, also plans to join Nighteye as a sidekick instead of working independently after graduation, which gives us an idea of ​​how difficult it is to set up a private office. Of course, it is also because Nighteye is a hero who has a lot to learn from.[48] From what has been described so far, Endeavor is said to have risen to No. 2 at the age of 20, so it appears that he became independent as a professional hero rather than a sidekick as soon as he graduated. As a side note, Hawks also debuted at the age of 18 and is said to be in the top 10 professional heroes. It's the first top 10 heroes of all time. However, in the case of the Hawks, they are not from YuA.[49]\n\nEven students from other departments can take the transfer exam to the Hero Department if they want, and even if they are a Hero Department student, if the teacher deems them unsuitable, they can be expelled or dropped to a different department. However, since this story of transfer and expulsion came out at the same time, many people think of transfer and expulsion as the same, thinking that if one person transfers, someone else is expelled so that the number of students is unconditionally maintained at 20. In secondary creations, there are many cases where there are 21 people, or where the considerably unpopular and ambiguous grape-head is expelled. In particular, Mineta Minoru's fighting power is low, and he is a character who barely avoided last place in the personality test, so it is easy to exclude him. In reality, if Mineta fails to advance to the Hero Department due to Oriju 's intervention, there is a high probability that he will go to the general department, but anyway, except for Shinso Hitoshi, most of the students in the general department are background characters, so it does not mean much.\n\nThe main character , Izuku Midoriya , belongs to class A among them.\n7.1.1.1. 1st year Class A\nFile:Hiroaka log...\nYuei High School 1st grade class A student\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:details ico... more details1st year Class A documentcastPlease note.\n7.1.1.2.

Everything including the educational curriculum is unknown, but one thing is certain: it is located right below the Hero Department. Students who fail the Hero Department entrance exam come here, but if they gain fame in large events such as the sports competition, they can advance to the Hero Department. In other words, the format of the entrance exam[50] The purpose is to find talented people who could not be filtered out and send them to the hero department to supplement the hero department students who failed. A representative example is Shinso Hitoshi . Other than that, it seems like they teach them normally like regular schools and just send them out into society.\n\nHowever, considering that UA High School itself is a prestigious school and the cutoff score for the written exam is very high, even if you didn't get into the hero department, the regular department students seem to be top students by the standards of regular high school students. Above all, getting into the regular department is not the end, and if you show remarkable results in the UA Sports Festival, you can transfer to the hero department. Shinso Hitoshi mentioned earlier is an example of this.[51]\n7.1.2.1. Class 1 C\nFile:Hiroaka log...\nuei high school Class 1 C\n\n7.1.3. Support Department\nClass F, Class G, Class H. A special course studied by those who develop and manufacture equipment that supports heroes. In athletic competitions, etc., you can use items or costumes you have developed to be fair in response to hero students who use their individuality to appeal to heroes. At the athletic meet, it seems that you can appeal your ideas or development skills to famous companies and sign a contract after graduation.\n\nAfter school, it is said that you can develop or repair items at the school's support workshop. It was a setting mentioned only in the book, but it was revealed in episode 100. Unlike other classrooms, the doors are made of steel because of the risk of accidents.\n\nAs an aside, I don't know what class it is, but in Hatsume's case, it seems that the power loader is the homeroom teacher. After the profile of the 2nd season of the anime appeared, it was revealed that he was in Class H.\n\nIn the initial conception stage, the main character, Izuku Midoriya, was a student in the support department. Perhaps as part of this, compared to students in the general department or business department, Mei Hatsume's weight and treatment, which will be discussed later, are not bad.\nHatsume Mei\nAs an aside, U.A. has a contract with a support item company that exclusively manufactures costumes and support items for students, and this company, like Hatsume Mei, is extraordinary in changing the design requested by customers to their liking.\n\nHowever, if you look at it piece by piece, the big design is only changed more sophisticated without any change . Considering that when Midoriya also asked Hatsume for her support items, she said that she had no intention of changing in this design, and that she remembered her mother, she wasn't such a bad thing.\n\nWhen Midoriya went to Gran Torino's office for a job experience, he took a newly repaired hero costume with him, but the enclosed memo from the support item company read, \"Izuku Midoriya. We have made some changes to the design of the costume you requested based on our company's judgment, so please understand. However, this is definitely cooler!!\" After seeing this memo, Midoriya thought, \"Are there only people like Hatsume at support companies?\"\n\nIt's to the point where people in this group all feel this way, and the possibility that Power Loader, who is relatively sensible, is a heretic has been raised. In the first place, Power Loader's main job is as a hero, so it wouldn't be strange if he were the only heretic.\n7.1.4. Department of Management\nClass I, Class J, Class K. Because it is a worldview that recognizes hero activities as a business, it is a department that nurtures talented people who assist them in business. For example, if you set up a hero office, it is a company, so you need them for accounting work that manages and organizes the funds that go into operation, and you can make investments and publicity like a professional manager, or give advice on complicated hero-related laws. do. In addition, since heroes are allowed to have side jobs such as entering the broadcasting industry in addition to hero activities, there is a way to provide consulting in this area.\n\nThey did not participate in the sports competition. Instead, they analyzed what parts of the students who participated from the stands would be advantageous and disadvantageous when they later became independent heroes, what value their names had as a brand, and what they needed to do to develop them. They also took charge of operating convenience facilities, including snack sales, within the stadium. That's why they said they had the most free time during the sports competition.[52]\n\nHowever, compared to other departments, it has no presence. Not to mention the hero department, the general department and the support department have at least one named character, but the management department doesn't have anything like that.\n\nIn episode 359, it is explained that recording the activities of the heroes participating in the final battle as a video is part of the management department curriculum, and a business department student records the battle at Uei High School as a video, and this is also necessary for hero production. do. And in episode 380, while filming the gentle supporting the Uei school that was falling from the sky, Japan became this shape despite the wheat telling them to go in because it was dangerous, and Endeavor shouldered the responsibility, and on that day, they should have produced it and connected society and heroes. He said he couldn't do it, and this time he said he would continue, and asked him to take a picture. Thanks to this, Gentle gained strength, and the hidden contributors who became the driving force to get U.A into the air again.\n7.2. 2nd grade\nIt was mentioned that most of them were expelled by Aizawa a year before the start of the story , and during the final exam, it was mentioned that he took a practical test to defeat a robot through Kendo .\n\nIn episode 254, Class 2 A appears.[53] The character that appears is a female student with a clear dark circle.[54] One, a male student with her hair parted to the side like a best genist, and a heteromorphic female student in the shape of a dog standing behind him. From what she says, it seems that she was expelled and then came back dramatically.[55][56][57]\n\nSince one grade is coming to an end based on the recent series, there is a possibility that the 2nd grader will appear as a 3rd grader when the current 1st grader goes up to the 2nd grader.\nFuwa Mawata\n7.3. 3rd year (graduation)\n7.3.1. big 3\nuei high school big 3\nintern activity planner\nSir Night Eye Agency\nFat Gum Agency\nRyukyu agency\nFile:Milio Profi...\nFile:Amajiki Pro...\nFile:Hado Profil...\nMilio Togata\nLemilion\nAmajiki Tamaki\nSun Eater\nHado Nezire\nNejire-chan\nFile:external/vi...\n\nFrom left are Tamaki Amajiki , Nejire Hadou , and Milio Togata.\n\nThe three strongest among current U.A. hero wannabes.[58]\n\nConsidering that all three did not place in the top spot at the previous year's sports competition and that they developed their skills during their time as interns, and that these three are brought together to teach about interns, it is clear that all three have developed their skills through internship and are even on par with professionals. There is more skill than that. In fact, among them, Tamaki won against three of the eight members of the assault unit . He is also interning under an active hero named Fat Gum , and Fat Gum indirectly tells him that Tamaki is stronger than him. Nejire defeated two villains the size of a building with only 30% wave output and also knocked out the awakened Shigaraki using 100% wave output. Milio fought four people, including Overhaul , and retired three of Overhaul's subordinates, overwhelming him throughout.[59]\n\nIn the final battle , Bakugo , Mirko , Best Genist , Edge Short , and Izuku Midoriya took on the role of the final boss, Tomura Shigaraki , so their skills are more than just pro heroes, they are TOP 10 pro heroes. They seem to have the same level of skill.\n\nWhen they first appeared, their reputation wasn't that good. Sato said all three were weird, and Tokoyami said they lacked class. That's understandable, because Togata tried to lighten the mood but failed, Amajiki failed to hint at his juniors as potatoes due to his glassy mentality and social phobia, and just stared at the wall, and Nejire kept asking her juniors all sorts of questions like a child. However, thanks to that, they left a strong first impression in many ways.\n7.3.2. etc\nKenranzaki Bibimi - Voiced by Ayano Shibuya / Bijuan . 3rd year, Class G, Support Department. Appeared in one cut in episode 173 with a mention by Nejire Hado . She has very long eyelashes. It is said that she has always won first place at the Yuei Cultural Festival Misscon. The name Kenran seems to be derived from the dazzling verb \"hyeonran\".\n\nWhen he faced Nejire, he was driving a golden car shaped like his own face, which is presumably related to his personality.\n\nIn the final episode, it was confirmed that she belongs to Lightly Lab, which Hatsume Mei belongs to. It's a bonus that Hatsume, who still hasn't washed, is told to wash up.\nYuyu Haya (voiced by Momoko Soyama ) She is a student who helped Nejire choose clothes for a fashion show. She appears in episode 346, supplying energy from the 'Coffin in the Sky' she created to counter Shigaraki with Kaminari Manga.\n7.4. teacher\nuei high school teacher\nPrincipal\nNezu\nschool nurse\nrecovery girl\nHero Basics Teacher\nAll Might\n1st year A class homeroom teacher\neraser head\nenglish teacher\npresent microphone\nModern Hero Art History Teacher\nmidnight\nlifesaving training teacher\nNo. 13\nmodern literature teacher\ncementus\n3rd grade homeroom teacher (estimated)\nsnipe\nmath teacher\nEctoplasm\n1st year B class homeroom teacher\nblood king\nSupport department teacher\npower loader\nlife guidance teacher\nhound dog\nnutritionist\nlunch rush\nGran Torino\n(past)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the nature of the school, all executives and staff members are filled with prestigious professional heroes. Judging from the fact that some of the personnel Tenya Iida hastily gathered at the time of the first raid of the villain alliance that took place during the rescue training at USJ do not appear, it seems that they are in charge of other departments or upper grades. It seems that it will appear later, or after other departments are intertwined.\n\nAs can be seen from the fact that All Might attends the school meeting in his weakened true form, we know that All Might has had difficulty using his personality due to serious injuries, surgery, and the aftereffects, but the most important characteristic of his personality is that of the principal . Innezu, Recovery Girl, All Might's homeroom teacher and teacher's friend , All Might's best friend , and next successor , only Katsuki Bakugou knows. However, in the case of True Form, many people became aware of it when the Kamino incident, where the decisive battle between All Might and All For One took place, was broadcast live around the world.\nLunch Rush: The Nutritionist\nFile:external/vi...\nCook Hero in charge of U.A.'s lunches.\nUraraka Ochako She wears a mask with a large pipe extending from her back under her large chef's hat. She appears in the anime, but she has no lines, so there is no voice actor. According to the drama CD, when a large typhoon occurred six years ago and more than 10,000 people were displaced, she served them a super-luxurious meal reminiscent of a French course meal for free.\nAnd since UA changed to a dormitory system, things have gotten incredibly busy. If you assume there are 20 students per class, including Class K, there would be at least 600 students in the entire school, and you have to take responsibility for all these people's three meals. That means you end up cooking a total of 1,800 meals a day.[60]\nStudents are reluctant to sell food even at the U.A. Cultural Festival, whether their skills as chefs are clear. This is because no matter what they make, they cannot follow the taste of the students of the U.A., who have already adapted to the lunch rush cuisine. What will you do during the A class meeting during the actual work? There were opinions on selling various dishes, such as maid cafes, but all were abandoned, saying that they could not win the lunch rush.\nHe is the only U.A. teacher whose personality has not been revealed, and there are no individual documents. It seems that the proportion is below the level of extra.[62] However , once you know her for the reason that she does something similar to cooking in Korea, her presence will never be forgotten.\nIn episode 346, he reappears after a long absence, cooking next to Yaoyorozu. Circumstances say, Yao Yo Rose must use her personality to make stockpiles, so she seems to be sticking to her replenishment.\nGran Torino ☆\nIt is said that in the past, he had experience serving as a U.A. teacher for a year in order to train All Might for a while. Looking at episode 0, she seems to have crossed the sea with All Might right after graduating from All Might.\n8. course of action\nFrom episode 306, the society has gone into chaos under the influence of the surreal liberation front raid, and many areas have become unmanageable. Shelters that can be managed by heroes have been designated, and U.A. is designated as one of those shelters. Afterwards, the families of the U.A. students will begin to evacuate.\n\nIn episode 319, promotions and classes are suspended, and the Hero Department says that they are on standby with the heroes. And another reason why U.A. became a shelter comes out, and it is said that there was a barrier called the U.A. Barrier.\n\nIn episode 323, the detailed specifications of the 'Yuei Barrier' were revealed. Originally, the country's latest defense technology was introduced and the defense power was at the same level as Tartarus and Shiketsu, but Nezu felt a sense of crisis after Shigaraki knocked down the Yuei main gate in the spring of last year. It is said that it was independently improved. Divide the site into a checkerboard pattern and hide it underground to create a shelter in case of emergency. Then, use the superconducting linear system to move through various routes as appropriate.[63] It can be moved to other hero high schools, including Shiketsu . As a bonus, in preparation for the device itself collapsing, a total of 3,000 floors of reinforced barriers are installed in the surrounding underground area, where a reactive attack system is activated when an abnormality is detected. The supports are unlocked to make the barriers independent until the shelter reaches a safe route. Any attack was slowed down.\n\nIn addition, by finding out the time limit for transformation by consuming Himiko Toga 's blood, refugees were allowed to enter Yuei after being quarantined for a certain period of time.[64]\n\nIn short, it is a specification that has been prepared for several times with the final evolution specifications of Tomura Shigaraki in mind, but what is even more surprising is that Nezu cannot receive government support based on a simple feeling for such a large-scale construction that requires astronomical costs, and at least last spring It was prepared from scratch, so it was just filled with Nezu's own money.[65]\n\nIn episode 345, it is floated in the air while being wrapped in a barrier.\n\nLater, in episode 346, the secret of U.A., who became a floating fortress, was revealed.\n\nIn episode 425, the graduation and promotion ceremonies were held in June after the final battle. Also, due to a lack of students, Class A, which had been promoted to the second year, was assigned Aizawa as its homeroom teacher, just like in the first year.\n\nAlthough the entrance ceremony is not depicted separately, the first-year freshmen appear in episode 427.\n[1] As a result, even Bakugo, who had been expected to be a genius since he was young, was just a top-tier student at UA. Even Midoriya couldn't hide his nervousness at the sight of Bakugo, who had always been admired by others, being ridiculed. However, because of this, UA had been All For One's target since long ago. The fact that they had entered this school meant that they were students with unique and talented personalities, so they wanted to take away their individuality.\n[2] In the work, the deviation value of the hero department is mentioned as a whopping 79 , and the entrance exam competition rate is over 300 to 1. The number one future dream of all students across the country is to become a hero, and UA's hero department, the golden course to become that hero, only accepts a total of 40 students, 36 through the general entrance exam and 4 through recommendations, making it the most difficult high school in the country with an extremely fierce competition rate. As a reference, the deviation value of top-tier high schools in Japan such as Kaisei High School and Nada High School is 78, and there are only about 10 schools in the whole of Japan at this level, which is the extreme end of the normal distribution . Therefore, the deviation value of 79 is a number that symbolizes that there is no school of equal status in Japan, and that it is the school that reigns supreme in the country.\n[3] Among the heroes who appeared in the story right away, All Might and Endeavor , who are on a different level, are mentioned as having graduated from this school.\n[4] Representative examples include the top three third-year students, Shoto Todoroki, Izuku Midoriya, and Katsuki Bakugou.\n[5] The number of students is 40, 36 of whom are selected through the entrance exam, and the remaining 4 are honor students who come in as special hires after receiving recommendations from outsiders. Class A has Momo Yaoyorozu and Shoto Todoroki , and Class B has Juzo Honenuki and Setsuna Tokage.\n[6] The general written test is also no joke, but it is said that students with a deviation of 79 are accepted. This is a figure corresponding to the top 0.18% , and if you hit it in Korea, it is at least a score that can go to Inseoul Medical University.\n[7] For this reason, Katsuki Bakugou and Izuku Midoriya took the test separately. Because of this, Bakugou was very suspicious when Midoriya passed the exam.\n[8] However, the main character Izuku Midoriya destroys this gimmick villain to save Uraraka who fell while running away . (For reference, the production cost is also incredibly expensive, and it costs several hundred million won to rebuild it if it breaks. In the sidestory Smash!, it is said to be about 5% of the national defense budget.)\n[9] This robot also participated in the obstacle race at the U.A. Sports Festival, but was destroyed in one blow by Todoroki and Yaoyorozu.\n[10] As mentioned in the work, it is expected that there were students who challenged to destroy this robot. Also, judging from the mention that after Midoriya destroyed the robot, there was a student who destroyed the robot after a long time, it seems that there were a small number of students who destroyed the 4th villain.\n[11] It turns out that he intentionally did not participate in the review for the sake of fairness .\n[12] The problem is that even if you do this, you end up wasting your first year in one piece. In other words, your education is about a year later than others.\n[13] Since Yoarashi refused to enter the school, Honenuki became the recommendation group.\n[14] Or maybe they had something other than personality, or maybe they passed with rescuing points.\n[15] However, students in the general department are also considered for transfer if they get good grades or leave a deep impression at sports competitions, so it is possible that they were transferred to the hero department in this way.\n[16] However, Jiro was only in charge of rear tasks such as searching and evacuating citizens under the direction of the pro heroes, and Asui was also in charge of the actual combat. However, in the case of the trio in the back alley, it became a situation where they would be punished if the circumstances were known because they broke away from the instructions of the pro heroes in charge of them and fought on their own. disguised as\n[17] As an aside, this weight is the work of Mei Hatsume .\n[18] It is limited to martial arts and heroes with a lot of movement. All Might, Eraser Head, Ectoplasm, Midnight, and Snipe were confirmed to be wearing handcuffs. However, those with little movement in combat or use of personality, such as the principal, Present Mike, and No. 13, do not seem to be handcuffed.\n[19] For example, in Todoroki & Yaoyorozu's team, Yaoyorozu made a mistake at the crucial moment, but Aizawa stepped back even after seeing it, so he succeeded in capturing it, and Ashido & Kaminari's group succeeded in capturing it just as Principal Nezu blocked all escape routes. Although it looks like it, in fact, it is said that one escape route was intentionally left until the end.\n[20] Anime version only. In the original work, everyone took the test at the same time.\n[21] As you can see from the actions of each of them, it's not just that they're bad, they 're enemies with each other . The reason for the selection was 'just', but considering that the premise is a two-person cooperative battle, it is true that they are at a disadvantage as other teams.\n[22] However, Bakugo was almost incapable of activity, so Midoriya took care of him.\n[23] Actually, does Uraraka like Midoriya? I was embarrassed by Aoyama's question and let go of her hand, but No. 13 stopped the black hole and that's how it happened. It's a shame because the opponent was a teacher, but because he was lucky to have passed away the situation where he would have died without any capture or anything if he had been a real villain, his score was at a level where he barely escaped failure.\n[24] However, Sero was incapacitated from the beginning, and in fact, only Mineta passed.\n[25] Asui can spit out his stomach and take it out.\n[26] This was possible because Present Mike was afraid of bugs, but the way he attacked was by bugs crawling up from the ground and covering his entire legs, making it a perfect situation for even an ordinary person to faint. It was so bad that other students even said that it would be difficult for even professionals to endure it. However, the Rickybury girl complained, asking what she would do if she fainted from a bug.\n[27] Annie limited. In the original story, it was not revealed in detail whether they escaped or were captured.\n[28] It is presumed that the reason for the capture was because it escaped 4 times, was captured 3 times, and failed 2 times.\n[29] Unfortunately, all five students who failed the practical exam were only those who generally scored in the lower ranks in the midterm exam (Sato: 12th, Kirishima: 15th, Sero: 17th, Ashido: 19th, Kaminari: 20th). The Uraraka & Aoyama group, who passed but did not have a big difference in scores from those who failed, also scored in the middle and lower grades of the midterm exam (Uraraka: 13th, Aoyama: 18th).\n[30] Monoma's personality is extremely unfavorable for the final practice exam.\n[31] However, the room is unknown. In the first place , it was thanks to Shota Aizawa .\n[32] Aizawa immediately tackles the perverted sexual harasser who is running wild in what he calls public use. Still, he responds immediately and stops, as if there is a hierarchy.\n[33] The fact that there is no women's room on the second floor seems to have prevented Mineta from spying on the women's dormitory.\n[34] The episode in which the room is revealed is a story told from the point of view of Koda's rabbit, Yuwai. Says Bakugo . Aww...that guy must die with this room!!! From Yuwai's point of view, the posters in this room were all naked women, and the magazines were also decorated with naked women on the covers. Judging from Bakugo's reaction, this room is overflowing with such things to an abnormal level. It was indirectly described as a shape.\n[35] Uraraka says, it's an otaku room~!\n[36] By the way, the rabbit's name is Yu-Yi.\n[37] He said that he had no desire for water from a young age.\n[38] Since her house is a Japanese-style house, she is not used to living on the floor, so she finished remodeling it on the first day she moved in . When asked how she did it, her answer was, \"I did my best...\" As a side note, this content is described in detail in Volume 3 of the UA White Paper. She helped Hatsume Mei find her lost machine parts and saved Recovery Girl from a machine-related incident, and as a thank you, she received interior design materials. Using these interior design materials, she remodeled her room into a traditional Japanese room. And she did it in half a day.\n[39] In the operation to rescue Bakugo, when Midoriya, Kirishima, and Todoroki tried to save Bakugo, Asui stuck a dagger, saying, \"Anyone who uses his personality recklessly is no different from being a villain.\" Feeling guilty, he locked himself in his room, saying he had no face in seeing the kids. In response, Uraraka explains to the children, \"I went into the room first because I was in a bad mood,\" and later shed tears and apologized to the five rescuers. However, the room is still undisclosed.\n[40] He said that he brought what he used at home but didn't think about the size of the room. By the way, the dorm room is said to be about the size of Momo's house's closet.\n[41] The passing rate is said to be less than 50%.\n[42] According to Togata, he can even witness the death of people .\n[43] At the beginning of the internship, when Midoriya was distracted and couldn't concentrate properly in class, Aizawa even told her to quit the internship if she couldn't do both the internship and the school class correctly.\n[44] This is also due to the fact that things took a turn for the worse after the Deika disaster. It was impossible to ignore the fact that the Liberation Army of these abilities and the Villain Alliance, a force of note, joined hands in the plan to overthrow the country. Therefore, in an all-out war, the hero forces had to wage an all-out war, mobilizing most of the heroes and even students.\n[45] If Midoriya had not been active, other departments that were dissatisfied with the hero department and the 1st year B class would have had a cultural festival in which they played a leading role, which would have resulted in 1st year A class becoming even more dissatisfied with the other departments, as well as Principal Nezu. Even he could have been stripped of his position as principal and Yuei's trustworthiness would have plummeted to the bottom. Gentle said he would leave without causing any harm, but his infiltration itself was damaging...\n[46] It is not known whether the general department brought students in this way before Shinso, but seeing that Aizawa continued to undergo personal training with Shinso and even received support equipment separately in this joint training, he paid attention to Shinso from before that and this time. It is certain that he participated as a guest in the joint training. If there were no students with potential in the first place, we would not have proceeded.\n[47] 36 students are selected through practical and written tests, and the remaining 4 seats are allocated to 2 students per class, and recommended admissions students who have taken a different entrance exam than other students are brought in.\n[48] In fact, the U.A. Big 3, who are currently in their 3rd year, are evaluated as being on the same level as most pro heroes, and have proven that they are at a level that easily surpasses most of the active heroes in combat. However, fighting power is not everything, so it seems that a glass mental like Tamaki will not be able to set up an office alone as soon as he graduates.\n[49] In Japan, only age is used, so it is highly likely that high school was the age at which students graduated. In the first place, it is questionable whether he was raised to become a hero in the public security and received a normal education.\n[50] Robots are mainly used in the test, so a personality that cannot earn points against robots is at a disadvantage.\n[51] In fact, this also poses a problem in entrance exams. Shinsou, who was decided to be transferred to the hero department after the sports festival, is a case of failing the entrance exam due to the disadvantage that brainwashing does not work on robots, even though he has a great personality.\n[52] The Hero Department is an opportunity to appeal to senior heroes, the General Department is an opportunity to be transferred to the Hero Department if you perform well and stand out, and the Support Department is an opportunity to appeal your inventions, so you will be active, but the Management Department will be especially appealing. does not exist. In other words, it fits the nature of operating convenience facilities.\n[53] Seeing all the 2nd year Hero Departments in the same class reminiscing about their memories with Aizawa-sensei, it seems that the Hero Department class is maintained and the grade goes up.\n[54] Fuwa Mawata\n[55] Fuwa said that Aizawa had the same facial expressions as when they were expelling them last year when they were in the first year, and that's why we grew up. Right after that part, Aizawa asks Nezu for permission to be expelled and subjugated.\n[56] It seems that the relationship remains complicated in many ways, such as other students saying that being expelled as 'it's over' is a nightmare, and the whole class saying that there is a flaw in their career.\n[57] It is presumed that they experienced extreme frustration by being expelled once, and after a while, they were reintroduced again after inducing their mental growth through rehabilitation or care for each individual. It may be a trauma for the victim, but if you can take care of it, it is a good way.\n[58] Don't be mistaken; it's not a reflection of your grades. Rather, it is said that Milio is not that great of a student in terms of grades.\n[59] The battle itself ended with the arrival of reinforcements, with Milio sacrificing himself to protect Eri from the individual annihilation bullet, and the victory trended towards the overhaul. Until then, Milio had overpowered her one-sidedly, and even after Milio lost her personality, Overhaul was unable to harm Eri, let alone harm her, and she failed in her ultimate goal of escaping. Milio fought against Overhaul even after being hit by individual bullets, and was the main figure who led the replay of Sayepal to victory.\n[60] In the U.A. white paper, Midoriya and Iida changed their hero names to All Time Rush and BLD.[61] It was also mentioned that it should be changed to rush.\n[61] Breakfast Lunch Dinner\n[62] As for how small the proportion is, it appears only once , and even that came out like a data screen. Of course, there is only one line of dialogue (\"In the end, white rice is the best!\"), and it is only mentioned indirectly twice: once at the aforementioned cultural festival theme selection meeting and once during the training camp.\n[63] There are also concerns about intruders, so it is estimated that a lot of movement routes were created and only a few of them were randomly selected and used in case of emergency.\n[64] This is a necessary measure, and in fact, Toga has sneakily infiltrated the license testing center. In fact, even though they did that, subversive people still infiltrated Yuei.\n[65] It is an ignorant development that completely ignores common sense and makes no sense, but there is no attempt to explain it in a clumsy way and it just makes no sense from beginning to end, so there is almost no resistance from readers. It's so comical that it doesn't make any sense. Still, it makes so much sense that students ask questions like, \"How was it possible when so much money was spent?\" to which Aizawa says, \"The principal is a world-renowned figure who has contributed enormously to individual moral education, and is still working hard to this day.\" It continues with the words: Of course, considering that he is such a world-renowned figure, he must have acquaintances all over the world, and they must be formidable people, so it is possible that he received support in some way.\nCC BY-NC-SA 2.0 KR"

          "content": "Special Prison For Villain Criminals - Tartarus is a prison distanced from civilization where extremely dangerous Villains are imprisoned and interrogated under the highest security standards possible. The high-security prison appears to be located on an island about five kilometers from the mainland, surrounded by giant walls. The only access to the prison is a long bridge connected to a city with the entrance guarded by two or more guards that check every vehicle going in. The gate that stands in front of the mainland side of the bridge is known as \"The Bronze Gate\". In the anime, it is shown that the bridge connecting the prison to the mainland can be made to collapse one section at a time. Tartarus' interior is heavily armored with blast doors lining narrow, steel-plated hallways. Prisoners incarcerated inside Tartarus are heavily restrained, sitting down restrained on a large, high-tech chair with a full-body straitjacket. Though nominally a prison, the facility effectively serves as a dumping ground for individuals who threaten or have threatened public safety to a drastic extent. Regardless of sentencing status, these individuals are incarcerated and heavily monitored in Tartarus.  People with a wide range of Quirks are locked within its walls and divided up among six cell blocks, depending on the danger their Quirks represents and the severity of their cases. The more dangerous the individual, the deeper they’re kept within the prison. The deepest level of the prison is B10, located 500 meters below sea level. Sensors are continuously monitoring the vital functions of prisoners, reacting to even the slightest sign of unusual behavior or attempt to activate a Quirk. The aforementioned sensors are also connected to four ceiling-mounted, automated machine guns that will fire on the prisoner if they suddenly move or have thoughts of activating their Quirk. Tartarus guards also monitor prisoners in a room with several screens displaying the inside of cells, where they are alerted to movement and speaking from prisoners. Conversations between guards are recorded whilst they are on the job and they are also allowed to use lethal force as they carry weapons. In the event of a cell breakout, guards are allowed to open fire on prisoners should they resist recapture. The prison has visiting rooms where visitors can speak to prisoners from the opposite side of a glass window. These rooms are set up so the prison guards can observe and monitor conversations between prisoners and visitors. These rooms are equipped with a microphone to talk to a visitor, and computers that can detect and display a prisoner's brainwaves, which informs guards of their state of mind during a conversation with a visitor. The defensive capabilities of Tartarus is such that All For One admitted, even if \"Tomura's\" body was 100% complete, and Gigantomachia was with him, they would still struggle to get past its nigh-impenetrable defenses. Before entering the Rehabilitation program at U.A ((User}} was held in cell 10-4 on level B10. \noutline\nAll Might ... It's really frustrating here.\nFor example, if your back itches and you rub your back against the back of a chair, all of a sudden, muzzles will point in your direction.\nVital signs and brain waves are always being checked.\nBy the time you thought about activating your individuality , you were already grabbing the lifeline.\nImprisoned deep underground, monitored by several layers of security, thoroughly avoiding unexpected situations.\nIn the world, quoting Greek mythology, this place is called ' Tartaros '. It's the name of hell, which means 'hell'.\nNo matter how much it is, it will have to go through a lot to rebel against God.\n- All for One , from a conversation with All Might, who came to visit while imprisoned in Tartarus. (Episode 116)\n\nA special detention center where the highest-level villains of the My Hero Academia universe are imprisoned. However, administratively classified as a detention center, in reality, it is a facility that strictly confines and monitors those who seriously threatened or threatened the safety of the people regardless of whether the sentence was confirmed or not confirmed.\n\nBecause of these characteristics, in fact, there are many aspects that strictly violate modern legal principles, and it seems that even in the work, human rights groups and others claim that the existence itself is illegal, but a single person with a strong personality can cause tremendous human and property damage. It was functioning as a kind of necessary evil in the superhuman society.\n2. Detail\nHiroakapan Impel Down .[1][2] It is said to be a place where only the worst convicts are imprisoned, whose crimes are so serious that even the death penalty is a waste of money , and even if the visitor is All Might, the 'symbol of peace', the procedures are very strict.\n\nThe name from episode 297 is the 'Gaeseong' top security special detention center, which strictly confines and monitors those who seriously threaten the safety of citizens. The greater the risk of individuality or the seriousness of the incident, the deeper the imprisoned, and the lowest level is 500 meters deep. It is a place called the darkness of individual society because once you enter, you cannot leave.\n\nAs can be seen by looking at the security level of the facility, it is a place where only the highest-ranking villains are imprisoned.[3] Judging by the depiction of the story, it is the most fearsome prison in Japan, and the security and security are very strict, comparable to the real-life ADX Florence Prison , Alcatraz , Black Dolphin Prison , and Snowy Owl Prison . Moreover, in some ways, it cannot be compared to real-life prisons. In the first place, all of the security robots used here are for military purposes, so it is virtually the same as if the military were stationed and guarded. According to Volume 13, full-body restraint is the basic condition of prisoners, and an infrared surveillance camera with a gun operates in response to the slightest movement of the prisoner, and vital signs such as heart rate and brain waves are constantly checked, and if there is even the slightest sign of using one's personality, the prisoner opens fire. They say they do it.\n\nIt is 5km away from the mainland and ships and helicopters cannot enter. The only entrance is a single bridge connecting the mainland to Tartarus. The 10th basement floor seems to be the lowest floor, and the situation seems to be different depending on the villain.[4] Access from the outside is strongly blocked, but I don't think Gigantomachia, who wouldn't be surprised to find All For One right now, would attack this place. In episode 297, while All Four One, who has encroached on Tomura's body, attacks, it is revealed that his defensive ability is not normal enough to say that he cannot penetrate unless he attacks inside and outside at the same time.[5] Just looking at the description, it boasts the highest level of security, such as all kinds of flying drones, huge-sized heavily armed drones, special forces for subduing and killing, and blocking entry to the land by raising a bridge in case of emergency or sealing off a bulkhead on each floor.\n\nThe name Tartarus itself refers to the lowest level of hell in Greek mythology from which escape is extremely difficult, and it is said to be a hell that even the gods fear, as many gods were imprisoned there after losing in war. It is a prison with a notorious reputation that lives up to its name.\n\nPolitically, Simgudang and its branch parties, and socially, various civic groups claim that Tartarus should be eliminated, saying that its existence itself is inhumane.\n3. current situation\nThis article contains spoilers .\n\nIt directly or indirectly contains the plot, ending, and reversal elements of the work or character described in this document.\n\nIt was mentioned that Stain , Moonfish , Muscular , etc. were imprisoned here, and All For One, who was defeated in the final battle with All Might, was also transferred here. Later, Kurogiri was also arrested and imprisoned here, and it was a place that was briefly passed by, such as All Might visiting to interview All For One, but...\n\nIn episode 297, All For One's evil thoughts that have consumed Shigaraki 's body attack Tartarus with the Near High End to free his body. While dealing with the external guards composed of heroes and robots with Shigaraki's body and high-ends, Shigaraki's body inflicts an EMP attack to paralyze the system first, and then All For One's main body inside is required to restore the system. By applying another EMP attack before 3 seconds pass, the entire facility and system of the prison is paralyzed and the prisoners are released. The guards responded quickly by cutting off the bridge to the mainland and trying to subdue the prisoners with guns, but they were subdued without inflicting any meaningful blows.\n\nThere are opinions that think that it is not probable that the facility boasting the best security in Japan will be destroyed in just one episode, but even if All For One brought Gigantomachia , it would have been difficult to attack from the outside. It was pierced because they attacked the outside at the same time.[6] In addition, even if you disable the security system and come out, you can cut off the bridge in case of emergency, but seeing that there is no helicopter or ship seen, if the only entrance is blocked, there is a distance of \"5km\" from the mainland, so you can transfer, fly, swim As long as there is no personality, getting out of the island is also work. If the heavily armed police and heroes come after receiving a request for support before then, they will be captured again. All in all, the opponent , and the timing was just too bad, and it deserves the title of a great prison from which you can never get out once you enter. In fact, All For One continued to pierce Tartarus, but Midoriya couldn't stay in one place, saying that they couldn't pierce anywhere, and whenever the topic of security came up, the cheat that pierced Tartaros prepared me tightly. When it comes, it comes out like the end. Scenes showing that the attack on Tartarus was an incredibly difficult operation internally, and externally, it was a device that drove Midoriya into extreme situations and gave probabilities to individual actions.\n\nThanks to this prison break incident, the Surreal Liberation Front, which suffered great damage from the all-out war against the heroes, recruited escaped prisoners and strengthened its strength to some extent. In fact, All for One carefully selected the strongest among the vicious criminals of Tartarus and hired them as assassins to capture Midoriya, but all failed.[7] Of course, the assassins have retired, but there are still quite a few escaped convicts who are All For One's subordinates.[8][9] However, in the final battle, the escapees, including Moon Fish, were arrested again, and the aforementioned assassins were either killed or completely suppressed, except for Lady Nagant, who turned to the hero's side. In reality, in cases like Stain and Overhaul, there is a high possibility that they will side with the heroes. Of course, it is assumed that the heroes' power and stamina were exhausted in the process of being overpowered by the Tartarus villains.[10]\n\nLike One Piece's Impel Down's Lv.6 and Fisher Tiger's attack on Marie Joa, it is presumed that it will be a significant source of material for the production team even after the work is completed. Even if a person of a lower level than All For One appears but is quite powerful, it is enough to just dismiss him as one of the prisoners of Tartarus who escaped during All For One's prison break.\n4. list of prisoners\n4.1. Inmate with item\nTartarus Prisoner\nFile:Prisoner of...\n\nThe man on the top left is Moonfish, the man on the top right is Muscular, the woman in the center is Lady Nagant, the man next to her is Overhaul, and from the bottom left to right, they come in order from four one, Kurogiri. The prisoner in the bottom right appears to be Stain after being freed. Among them, Kurogiri is exceptionally sent to a special medical institution called Central to check the possibility of restoring Shirakumo Oboro, which was before the renovation, by Uei High School, rather than jailbreak.\n4.2. Prisoners without individual documents\n4.2.1. dictator\nFile:dictator\nA villain with the personality of a dictator who has a hunchback - like appearance and manipulates people with strings coming out of his body . The villain's name, Dictator, is an English word meaning dictator. Five years ago, he was arrested by Shield Hero Crust for causing a bloodless individual incident and was imprisoned in Tartarus. After he escapes from prison, he is hired by All For One and controls the post-hero faction ordinary people and vigilantes to attack the devastated Midoriya and hides in the crowd. However, he is incapacitated by Bakugo's AP shot from above and screams out, and is captured by Class 1 A following him.\nDictatorship\n独裁 | Despot\nuser\ndictator\ntype\ntrigger system\nLike Hitoshi Shinso 's brainwashing , he is a mind-manipulating personality. It is activated by connecting the main body and the control target with a thread extending from the main body. As the number of subjects to be manipulated increases, the mental burden increases, so unlike Shinso's brainwashing, which is basically limited to a single target, Dictator's 'dictatorship' can control everything as long as it touches a thread, making it suitable for controlling a large number of people.\nIn addition, Shinso's 'brainwashing' completely blows away the target's consciousness during brainwashing, but Dictator's 'dictatorship' leaves the subject's consciousness as it is and controls only their behavior, so people who are 'dictatorship' are caught in 'dictatorship' They remember all their actions. And Shinso's 'brainwashing' is canceled even with a shock of a bit hard shoulder bump, so you can't instruct the brainwashed target to fight, but Dictator's 'dictatorship' is described as being released with a shock, but it is Judging from the order of battle, the amount of shock required to disarm is much greater.\n4.2.2. Kunieda\nFile:Hiroaka Kun...\n\nThe voice actor is Tatsumaru Tachibana / Gunwoo Oh .\nOne of the escaped prisoners from Tartarus who appeared in episode 353, he is a very vicious villain who is a mass murderer and corpse collector . Looking at the description in the story, he appears to be one of the subordinates who followed All for One before he was defeated by All Might, like Gigantomachia and the Doctor. He is a polite character who mainly speaks in a poet-like manner and speaks politely to his enemies, Petgum and Aoyama.\n\nIn the final battle, he is confronting Fat Gum and Aoyama, and uses his own personality to kill or neutralize many of the heroes around him, saying that he was not given his turn due to Dictator's mistake, and that he will show All For One's practicality as an assassin. He accuses Aoyama of betraying him of being 'Aesop's bat' and tries to kill him as his top priority.\n\nIn episode 399, after demonstrating his terrifying strength by parasitizing plants and annihilating them to the heroes except Aoyama and Hagakure , he binds Aoyama with the created plants and mocks him for being a traitor. Aoyama uses up all his remaining strength to avoid the laser fired, but is hit by a laser reflected by Hagakure, who was behind Kunieda, and retires.\nSeedling (tentative name)\n| Unnamed Plant Growth Quirk\nuser\nKunieda\ntype\ntrigger system\n\nA personality that parasitizes plants on people, then grows them and turns them into flowers.[11] If even a single flower blooms, the infected people spread like dominoes due to the pollen. People who become flowers can be controlled by Kunieda.\n4.2.3. gashley\nA prison escapee mentioned along with Kunieda by a supporting hero in episode 353. According to episode 420, she left her name in criminal history through local bombardment and a long war of attrition, and her full name was revealed at this time to be 'Gashli Eijiju (嬰兒樹)'. It is estimated that he is as strong as Kunieda.\n\nThere was a fleeting scene where he was engaged in a bloody battle with Sero, Sato, Ojiro, and Ryukyu at the Takoba Stadium, and he was also seen fighting in episode 420, during the final battle with All for All, and he was properly engaged in a long war of attrition with the heroes. And the final battle ended in that state, and the story ended without any mention of Gashuli being captured. (...)\n\nThe character motif is The Gashlycrumb Tinies, a children's book depicting the deaths of 26 children registered in AZ, and the appearance is also the same as the Grim Reaper design on the cover of the book, with only slight modifications.\nYeong-A-Soo (tentative name)\n| Unnamed Puppet Infants Quirk\nuser\nGashley Agejoo\ntype\ntrigger system\n\nIt summons a large number of giant familiars in the form of babies from its own shadow. Familiars come in various shapes and sizes, and can transform their form. Given the circumstances, it is presumed that Gashley summons and controls familiars by reading the book he is holding.\n4.2.4. Unknown Prisoners\nFile:1625701824\n\nOne of the All For One assassins who attacked Midoriya in episode 317. Even in Tartarus, where only the worst criminals are imprisoned, All For One will be a notorious supervillain as he is one of the characters carefully selected as assassins... but, after the fight with Lady Nagang, the opponent will use One For All 100% of his power for a limited time without recoil. Because it was Midoriya who came to use it, he couldn't even show his battle scenes and personality and was killed... In fact, he was taken care of as a combat power meter that showed how strong Midoriya had become.\n\nIn addition, an escaped prisoner who looks like a shark and fights with Midoriya in a flashback style was also one of the assassins of All For One.\n[1] The difference is that in Impel Down, the prisons are clearly divided into different levels, with prisoners being imprisoned from the weakest to the strongest, while in Tartarus, except for the fact that the more dangerous the prisoners, the deeper they are imprisoned, basically all of the prisoners are monsters. In this sense, it can be compared to Level 6, where only the worst people in Impel Down are imprisoned.\n[2] In fact, not dividing this class was Tartarus' biggest mistake. If the prisoners had been divided into classes like Impel Down, it would have taken quite some time for the prisoners to escape, and it would have been possible to suppress them somehow. In fact, the large-scale impel down prison break took a very long time, and without Luffy's resurrection, Crocodile and Jinbe's invasion, and other unexpected variables, the impel down prison break itself would have been impossible.\n[3] In episode 311 , by referring to Hawks as \"a supervillain who escaped from Tartarus,\" it can be seen that the hero side is most wary of the Tartarus escapee in the large-scale villan breakout.\n[4] In the case of All For One, the whole body was tied to a chair, but Overhaul, who lost both arms and was completely incapacitated, is shown sitting on a bed.\n[5] It is said that it would have been difficult to attack from the outside even with Shigaraki's body, which had been completely remodeled, with the straight attack method.\n[6] The guards of Tartarus, described in episode 297, are filled with weapons that would have been impossible for even All Four One to penetrate without the super-regeneration personality.\n[7] Among them, Lady Nagant was persuaded by Midoriya to completely turn to the side of the heroes and give All Four One a big taffy.\n[8] After the failure of the last assassin, Dictator, in episode 335, All Might directly mentioned that the Tartarus villains were All For One's subordinates.\n[9] In episode 353, people from Tartarus were treated as the main force of All for One.\n[10] Thanks to this, in episode 386, All Might had no power to stop All For One's advance, so All Might had to fight him himself.\n[11] Kunieda himself says that it grows only from human flesh. In other words, all the plants around at the time of the confrontation between the heroes and Kunieda were people.\n"

In the face of Medaka's anger, Hanten tells Medaka's she should first thank him for bringing the Front Six to help her. Hanten continues his story, saying that, as Ajimu's shadow, he never hindered her actions, but admits he did not expect Ajimu to die, as she had faced Iihiko more than a hundred million times without dying. Hanten explains that Ajimu fought Iihiko to the death to allow Medaka to escape, and while he cannot forgive Medaka, he will succeed Ajimu's will and keep her alive. At Medaka's questioning, Hanten explains that Iihiko was originally a hero that lived five thousand years ago; Ajimu's image of a perfect human was likely influenced by Iihiko. Hanten continues, saying that the times have changed and the current Iihiko is the result of the Shiranui Village that has passed down his legend over the past five thousand years. The Shiranui Household were created to serve as Hanten's \"backups\"; after he died, one of them could replace him as Ajimu's double. However, like Hanten himself, the Shiranui preserve unusual things. The village continued the legend of Iihiko by using doubles to inherit his name and power each generation, while serving as doubles for the Kurokami as a side job to fund their main project. And the next double for Iihiko is none other than Shiranui herself, whose very existence will cease to be after training to become him. As Iihiko's purpose to live now is just living, his goals line up with those of the Shiranui Village, and so he will not leave the village as long as Shiranui is there. His explanation finished, Hanten declares that he will definitely force Medaka to give up on Shiranui. Hanten is surprised at Medaka's outburst. In response, Hanten punches her on the head. Hanten believes Medaka stands no chance against Iihiko and would just be wasting Ajimu's death. Medaka counters that Ajimu fought against \"impossibility\" all her life - Ajimu died so that she could stand back up and defeat Iihiko. Hanten insists it's impossible, pointing out that her wounds won't heal, and even Abnormal or Minus skills cannot defeat him. Hanten is taken aback by the appearance of Kamome Tsurubami and Nienami.\" + \"At the same time as the Hakoniwa Academy graduation ceremony, Hanten is seen drinking in the Shiranui Village with Obi and Iihiko.

Because of this, she fell for Kumagawa (who also shares the same view).

She then tells he didn't kill Kumagawa either, though he shouldn't be surprised. Ajimu goes on to explain that Kumagawa's All Fiction interacts with the law of causality, and that he cannot die because of it. She tells Zenkichi he is lucky that he didn't become a murderer. When Zenkichi laments that he himself died, Ajimu corrects him; his heart stopped due to the shock from his injuries, so she took his consciousness away.

The sight Ajimu lent Zenkichi is actually her skill, Parasite Seeing.\" + \"In the dream classroom, Ajimu is seen before a beaten and bloodied Kumagawa, telling him to call her Anshin'in.[ Ajimu suggests they continue this \"game\" until Kumagawa changes his mind about getting his original Minus back, but admits he might have a chance to beat her quadrillion skills with his fearsome All Fiction. In response to Kumagawa comparing her to a Shōnen Jump battle manga, Ajimu states she left Jump behind in elementary school, as the cruel reality she read in it was that only the powerful win in the end. As Kumagawa makes to leave, Ajimu stops him, demanding that he express himself honestly. After Kumagawa's speech, Ajimu kisses him, giving back his original Minus in return for Hundred Gauntlets (and by extension, All Fiction). She tells Kumagawa she is just an even kind of girl, helping both sides of the fight. She insists though, that Kumagawa's loss to Medaka is inevitable. After Kumagawa leaves, Ajimu smiles to herself, and thinks about both Medaka and Kumagawa, before dropping her facade and complaining about how they keep squabbling over the pointless distinctions of life. After the conclusion of the election battles, Ajimu and Hanten are seen in Hakama Shiranui's office. Ajimu voices her pleasure the Book Maker seal has weakened with Kumagawa's reformation, and that the battles have supplied them with much data for the Flask Plan. Hakama offers to transfer them into Class -13, an offer Ajimu turns down for both herself and Hanten.\")\nKurokami Medaka's Successor Arc:(\"As everyone is gathering at the Student Council Headquarters, Kumagawa warns everyone of the Delayed Two, the Not Equals. Kumagawa says that despite sealing them both with Book Maker and All Fiction, they are regaining their power and they need all the help they can get to fight what they are scheming.[19] Ajimu unexpectedly shows up behind Kumagawa, denying any schemes at all. She smiles, saying that she wanted to play with Zenkichi after the Student Council Battle Arc. She gives Zenkichi and Kumagawa an armless hug, happy that both of them have reconciled. Zenkichi, however, saw through her facade. She reveals that she is both immortal and the creator of the Flask Plan.[20] Zenkichi believes Ajimu visiting is a war declaration and states that the Student Council will take them all but Ajimu denies this. She does not want to fight because Medaka is so strong of a Main Character, one that appears every 1,000 years. She reveals that she will wait until Medaka graduates to restart the Flask Plan. She states loudly that the Council can take their time prolonging the series and their dram because the last boss is too much for them. While they wither away, she can spend the next three years playing with her cell phone.\n\nAfter the Student Council selected their five candidates, Ajimu teleports out of nowhere, riding Zenkichi's shoulders. Ajimu applauds their effort, saying it could potentially stop her plans for all time but, creating people to oppose her is very similar to the Flask Plan's goal of creating perfect humans. Ajimu says, if the council doesn't mind, she has implanted a Not Equal within the candidate group.[21] If the council isn't careful, they might make the successor to the Flask Plan instead. Ajimu stands on the roof of a building, looking over all that has changed since the last time she visited. Behind her, Suishou Kibougaoka, Ima Takarabe, Kiki Kikitsu, Shori Wanizuka, Tsugiha Yojirou have gathered, saying that none of them were revealed as Not Equals.[22] When Takarabe asks to \"talk\" with Kumagawa more, Ajimu allows her, saying that they should use the \"Honey Trap\" against such a boy. After Kumagawa defeats the Candidate Council, Ajimu teleports behind him, saying he has gained something worth more than a victory-the panties of an junior high girl. She reveals that all of the Candidates are Normals you can find in 4-komas.[23] Ajimu walks away, telling Kumagawa to consider Ajimu and the Flask Plan for a bit- how, maybe, they can coexist with the Student Council.\n\nAjimu visits the Student Council while they begin the treasure hunt but Medaka makes her reveal herself from her Nabeshima disguise. Ajimu says Medaka and she should move somewhere else so Zenkichi does not hear. Medaka says they should expose themselves and talk heart to heart but Ajimu does not like exposing herself.[24] They both went to the Clock Tower Underground's 6th floor Onsen. Ajimu is surprised that Medaka used the training camp that she thought up as a joke. She reveals that she sent the six hundred junior high students that were present at that candidate selection meeting but Medaka does not care, she will continue to educate the candidates. Medaka asks how many people are \"Not Equal/Najimi Ajimu\" and Ajimu replies that she is 700,000,000 people.[25] She calls Medaka's dream of a ideal world a pipe dream but Medaka states that is her reason to strive for it. Ajimu also reveals that 60 of the junior high students were Not Equals. Shortly after, they moved to the Clock Tower Underground Level 11 - Ball Game Floor. Medaka asks why Ajimu didn't send the 700 million Not Equals after Medaka but Ajimu says that they all would be easily defeated by Medaka. Ajimu thinks that if she became Medaka's friend, Medaka can easily be swayed.[26] At the Meda Trial, Ajimu went to pick up a soccer goal from the fields and walk it up to the top of the clock tower. When she sees Akune failing, Ajimu smiles saying that her plans will continue on schedule.\n\nAfter the treasure hunt, Ajimu watches the conflict on the grounds with a smile, saying that the reason she sent those five Normals was to replace Zenkichi in Medaka's heart. She teleports down to the distraught Zenkichi. She convinces him that being Medaka's enemy will make him closer to Medaka's heart. She wants him to become the Main Character through the Flask Plan. If Zenkichi refuses, Ajimu will forget him and give him other women to chase after.[27] Zenkichi agrees. Ajimu teleports back to pass the news. Hitoyoshi's allies think Zenkichi doesn't have a chance of winning against Medaka but AJimu assures them that Medaka is defeatable since she has a flaw- she killed her \"father.\"\n\nAfter Kumagawa's fight with Munakata, Ajimu conducts the Safe Plan meeting in Ghost Babel at night. Ajimu reviews that there are currently three forces facing against each other. When asked how Kumagawa regained All Fiction, Ajimu states that, because All Fiction is a revised version of her Hundred Gauntlets, Kumagawa still have traces of the ability in him.[28] Ajimu also adds that one should never fight themselves; yourself is an ally and once you do fight yourself, you lost. She reveals that Hanten Shiranui has the skill to make skills and that Zenkichi can choose any skill he would like to have. When Zenkichi tells her what skill he wants, Ajimu tells him that he is absolutely insane. Ajimu ponders for a bit on her invisible chair. She says that what Zenkichi wants is a insult to all those before him and would make the other Main Characters of the past look like relics-but only those who do not value the masters of the past can keep the world turning.[29] She acknowledges Zenkichi's will and kissed him and Mukae Emukae to send them to the dream world. In the dream world, Ajimu reveals herself to be the girl from when Zenkichi died. She gives them their first challenge: defeat her. In reality, Ajimu teleports to Tsurubami, asking to hear the situation. She asks for his impression since he is the step-brother of Medaka.[30] In the dream world, Ajimu is dodging all of the attacks from Zenkichi and Mukae while doing picture-perfect poses. She asks Zenkichi what does it mean to defeat Medaka. When Zenkichi confesses that he loves Medaka, Ajimu smiles, saying that this bad battle manga will now be a bad love comedy.\n\nAfterwards, Ajimu reveals to Tsurubami and Zenkichi that she changed this manga to a love comedy because the main character has a higher chance of winning in this genre. She makes the declaration that she will then end this manga before the anime starts.[31] Ajimu meets with Shiranui with the proposal papers to move the election from April to December. She thinks Zenkichi will win, just like a side character that beats all others in popularity polls- the underdog effect. She reveals that the last year's election might be based off the bandwagon effect and low voter turnout. Ajimu will based the election on getting the votes of Abnormals, Minuses, Normals, and the people who voted for Medaka because of Zenkichi's help, like Shiranui. As Shiranui leaves, Ajimu asks why she is helping Zenkichi with his love. Shiranui says that Ajimu doesn't know a thing even though she lived forever.[32]\n\nAt the festival Ajimu watches the events on the sidelines. She laughs when she sees Medaka fighting against the entire student body in the tug of war, saying that even an airplane cannot fly with that much force. When Medaka shakes off the entire student body, Ajimu was indeed shocked by Medaka's great strength when she pulled the entire student body while she ran. Ajimu watches Zenkichi's meeting with the famous stars with Aoki Aka. She states that Zenkichi's skill has awakened.[33] Ajimu talks with Medaka before the bands battle, showing that only one screw is left on her body thanks to the Election Management Committee's Chairwoman's work.\n\nJet Black Bride Arc\n\nWhen Medaka gathers teammates with which to fight her suitors, Ajimu (in a new school uniform) is one of the people she chooses. Her promised reward is a waste of time. Later, the All Jokers meet Bukiko Udou on the aircraft carrier Black, the stage for the second Jet Black Wedding Feast. They follow Udou into the ship, with Medaka explaining to her teammates about her situation.[34] Ajimu listens on as Udou explains the rules.[35] As Medaka prepares to fight her suitors herself, she is stopped by Ajimu and the others, Ajimu declaring that she will fight first.[36] Ajimu defeats all six of the suitors using six hundred of her skills, and one more to count up how many she did use. She rather flippantly remarks that, with only six hundred, it wouldn't have been strange if either side had won. She shyly claims she only meant to use four hundred and fifty-nine skills, but that reality isn't kind. She then confronts Udou, demanding that she introduce the real suitors, as the six she just defeated were merely doubles. When Medaka asks Ajimu if she stepped in so she wouldn't have to fight a pointless battle, Ajimu replies that she just wanted to troll Medaka.[37] Ajimu watches on as the real suitors arrive.[38] She makes no comment as the suitors declare their intent to defeat the doubles as well.[39] Hearing the plan for the continuation of the Jet Black Wedding Feast, Ajimu points out that there is still little reason for Medaka to agree to participate.[40] Ajimu is surprised when Medaka accepts on the condition she learn the identity of Fukurou Tsurubami's murderer. Along with the rest of the All Jokers, Ajimu is sealed into a card by the smallest suitor.[41]\n\n\nStill sealed within Momo Momozono's card, Ajimu idles in her dream classroom, remarking that quite the unbelievable child and style were born while she was under the effects of Book Maker. Seeing there is nothing she or Kumagawa can do for Zenkichi, she decides to enjoy the seal a little longer. However, she remembers her training with Zenkichi in preparation for the election, and chooses to find a way out after all.[42] Ajimu and Hanten are released by Momozono per her deal with Medaka. Ajimu tells Medaka that Momozono wanted her to choose them, since they were already close to escaping themselves, causing Medaka to ask if Ajimu cannot just thank her. As Ajimu prepares to end everything, Medaka stops her.[43] Ajimu chastises her for giving in to her emotions, but acquiesces.[44] In the new area, Ajimu and the others listen on as the rules of the game are laid out.[45][46][47] Ajimu chastises Wanizuka for not remembering the rules properly, and tells her she can stop being a Not Equal at any time. She observes that Momozono can attack Medaka directly from her position.[48] Ajimu is surprised when Medaka chooses to leave the room.[49] As Medaka continues to leave each time after her turn, Ajimu wonders at what her plan is.[50] When Kudaki Torai confronts Medaka on her behavior, Ajimu theorizes that she probably a supporter of the old Medaka. She is not surprised when Medaka declares that she will not fight a fight that shames her friends.[51] Having heard Momozono's explanation, Ajimu wonders at how Fukurou could have orchestrated all that has happened after his death.[52] She appears unfazed when Momozono continues with the game mid-explanation.[53] Ajimu, displeased with everyone else not keeping up, asks Wanizuka to bring up the records for the game so far. Wanizuka does not have the record, so Ajimu produces them on the tablet from her own memory.[54] Ajimu listens on as Momozono reveals Medaka's true plan; to force the suitor to end with \"surrender\" by manipulating the entire audience not to use the necessary syllables.[55][56] Ajimu is present when Zenkichi is healed. She is unsurprised by Medaka's reaction to Zenkichi's depression. Together, the Student Council and the All Jokers (and Namanie Nienami) return to Hakoniwa Academy.[57]\n\nUnknown Shiranui Arc\n\nAjimu meets Medaka in the Tea Room, where they discuss why no one seems to remember Hansode Shiranui. Ajimu reveals that Kumagawa has used his All Fiction, and has already tracked him down and forced him to talk. She then goes on to explain to Medaka how Shiranui was actually Medaka's double, assigned to Hakoniwa Academy to support Medaka from the shadows. Ajimu asks Kumagawa why Medaka still remembers Shiranui, who replies it is most likely because Medaka was so closely tied to Shiranui.[58] After Zenkichi arrives at the Tea Room looking for Shiranui, Ajimu explains that she intends to meet with Shiranui, and offers to bring Medaka and Zenkichi with her.[59]\n\n\nAjimu drives Medaka, Zenkichi, and Kumagawa to meet Shiranui in a jeep. She laughs off Kumagawa's and Medaka's questions, before making an emergency stop to avoid Kairai Kugurugi. When Kairai pulls out a revolver, Ajimu defeats him once again, this time with a hundred gun skills.[60] Due to the terrain, the group abandons the jeep and advances on foot. The group eventually comes to a three way branch in the path.[61][62] After Kairai comments that he can see why his lady lost to Medaka, Ajimu tells him Medaka grew stronger because of the Jet Black Wedding Feast. Ajimu and the others are surprised by the appearance of the Gate Guardians \"Doppelgangers\".[63] Ajimu fights her doppelganger. She is shown grinning at the difficulty her opponent gives her.[64] At Zenkichi's prompting, the members of the group switch opponents; Ajimu defeats Medaka's doppelganger. Obi arrives to congratulate the group and introduce herself. She then explains the next game - tag.[65] Walking through the village, Ajimu asks if the Shiranui are not protecting the Kurokami family; Obi turns back and states the Shiranui Village is protecting the world. Despite having the power to foresee the future, Ajimu chooses to be fair to any possible twists in the plot. She watches on as Medaka answers the final question.[66] After Medaka supplies the right answer, the group enters the mansion to meet Shiranui.[67]\n\nThe group reunites with Shiranui.[68] Ajimu notices when Obi leaves.[69] Ajimu stays quiet as the others talk to Shiranui.[70][71][72] Ajimu is surprised by the arrival of Iihiko. She tells the others to run, revealing that she can only hold him off for fifteen seconds.[73] As Iihiko greets her, Ajimu responds in kind, telling him she does not want to be called Anshin'in by him.[74] After Iihiko counterattacks Zenkichi, Ajimu calms Medaka by telling her Zenkichi has survived.[75] After Kumagawa is defeated as well, Ajimu once again tells Medaka to run. At Medaka's insistence and Obi's pushing, Ajimu reveals her history with Iihiko, then orders Medaka to run. After Medaka escapes, Ajimu notes that the other girl still rescued her enemies as well as her friends. As Iihiko taunts her with his \"weapon\" (a rubber band), Ajimu notes that he has not changed, and makes her distaste clear. Changing his tone, Iihiko tells Ajimu he has grown bored with fighting her, and offers to let her live if she captures the group that has just escaped. Ajimu refuses without hesitation, and activates several of her skills. In response, Iihiko uses the rubber band to blow her body in half.[76] Her death is confirmed by Hanten.[77]\n\nAjimu meets Kumagawa in the dream world classroom.[78] Ajimu explains that what he is seeing is just a recording; Kumagawa lifts up her skirt. Having predicted how he would act, the Ajimu recording kicks Kumagawa in the head. She goes on to say that she does not regret dying and, bringing out two parcels, tells Kumagawa she has left him an inheritance.[79] Ajimu claims she wanted to give Kumagawa all her skills, but that there are only two he can use: Hundred Gauntlets, which will stop the deterioration of his All Fiction, and a second skill, which is to be a surprise. She tells Kumagawa that she is rooting for him, and that this is the only biased action she has ever done as a Not Equal. As Kumagawa complains, she insists that she cannot hear him; getting up, she goes to the window and looks for the loser star Kumagawa was born under. After Kumagawa picks one out, Ajimu destroys it. She then hugs Kumagawa, telling him he is a star of hope for the weak, and that he was like a cute little brother to her.[80] The second skill is revealed to be Unskilled.[81] As Zenkichi hovers near death, Ajimu's voice is one of the many that gives him encouragement.[82] She is also one of the people he remembers before preparing to fight Iihiko.[83]\n\nBouquet Toss To The Future Arc\n\nAjimu is named as one of Medaka's opponents in the 100 Flowers Run. Being deceased, Kumagawa holds flower number four in her place.[84] Ajimu passed on a message for Medaka to Kumagawa when she returned Hundred Gauntlets and granted him Unskilled.\")\nAbilities: (\"Superhuman Physiology: Even being sealed by the combination of Kumagawa's Book Maker and All Fiction, Ajimu seems to have great strength. She has crushed the ground by just stepping on it. Ajimu has also carried a soccer goal all the way to the top of the clock tower using only one hand. Ajimu is shown to be incredibly fast, to have dodged both the attacks of Zenkichi and Emukae simultaneously without effort while doing a sideways peace sign\" + \"Abnormalities and Minuses\nMultiple Skill User: Ajimu does not have one specific Abnormality or Minus. Instead she has an insurmountable amount of distinct Abnormalities and Minuses (7,932,135,441,523,222 Abnormalities and 4,925,916,526,110,643 Minuses, for 12,858,051,967,633,865 skills in total).[90] After giving Hundred Gauntlets to Kumagawa and later Parasite Seeing to Zenkichi, her total drops to 12,858,051,967,633,863 skills. She later takes back Hundred Gauntlets from Kumagawa and returns his original Minus to him, raising the total amount to 12,858,051,967,633,864 skills. This suggests that while she possessed Kumagawa's original Minus, she could not use it. While under the influence of Kumagawa's Book Maker sealing her abilities, Ajimu cannot use the totality of her skills. Once Book Maker's seal completely fades away, she becomes capable of using her full skill set once again. After she is killed by Iihiko, she meets Kumagawa in the dream classroom to give him Hundred Gauntlets and Unskilled. This decreases her total to 12,858,051,967,633,862 skills. At present, Ajimu has demonstrated or explained 814 different skills.\n\nMiscellaneous Skills\nClick \"Expand\" to see Ajimu's Miscellaneous Skills.\n\nParasite Seeing (欲視力パラサイト・シーイング, Parasaito Shīingu): Ajimu had an enhanced vision that granted her the ability to see what others saw through their own eyes.

In present times though, the world that Iihiko protected no longer exists, and his personality has changed drastically as a result.[1] Having lost everything, Iihiko's only reason to live has become to keep living; he remains in the Shiranui Village because this allows him to achieve this goal.[2] The current Iihiko is very violent, using Obi's body like a club to break through a wall while striking Hansode Shiranui at the same time.[3] He shows little regard for human life, laughing off the injuries he inflicts on others, and mistaking Zenkichi Hitoyoshi for a mosquito when the boy attacked him.[4] He is also very arrogant, ridiculing Ajimu while wearing a maniac grin, and labeling her search for impossibility as boring.[5] Iihiko enjoys using unconventional \"weapons\" to fight his opponents: a rubber band against Ajimu,[6] and a pair of glasses against Medaka Kurokami.[7] Perhaps as a result of his longevity, Iihiko has a tendency to label things that interest him as \"fresh\".\")\nAppearance: (\"Iihiko is a very large, muscled man, towering over normal humans, with light purple skin. He wears a ragged, sleeveless, maroon robe that exposes the right side of his upper body, with a thick, light brown rope tied around his waist. A chain loops around his torso, from his right shoulder to his left hip. He also wears traditional Japanese sandals. Iihiko's lower arms are covered in a dark substance that terminates as protrusions from his elbows, and a similar substance covers his feet. He has bandages wrapped loosely around his wrists.

He has no visible hair; instead, a head of dark flame burns behind a pair of large, blood-red horns growing straight up from his forehead.\" + \"After possessing Shiranui's body, Ihiko's appearance matches her's, though some features are carried over from his former body. The sclera of his eyes remain red, his ears remain pointed, his canines remain as fangs, and he grows a small pair of blood-red horns from Shiranui's head. His fingers are now longer, though they are still clawed, and his hands are still covered in a dark substance that now reaches past his wrists.\" + \"After being expelled from Shiranui's body, Ihiko returns to his previous body with some noticeable changes. His hair solidifies and becomes less flame-like, his horns are broken off, and his sclera grow lighter. The dark substance disappears from his lower arms and feet, though the skin below his elbows and the skin on his feet remains darker than the rest of his body.\" + \"Five thousand years ago, the original Iihiko was far less demonic in appearance. He had normal eyes, ears, and hair, and did not have horns. He wore a metallic crown, a cloak that bared his chest, and armor around his wrists and torso. He also carried a western-style sword and shield.\")\nHistory: (\"Five thousand years ago, Iihiko was a legendary, almost fairy tale-like, hero. He loved his land, comrades, and women like any other hero.[8] Later, Iihiko became the first man Ajimu could not win against. In trying to attain a certain goal, Ajimu fought and lost against Iihiko at least one hundred million times, despite using all her skills and being aided by other Not Equals she had created. Eventually, Iihiko was sealed within the Shiranui Village some point after Ajimu began avoiding him.[9] The Shiranui preserved Iihiko's legend by having a double take his place when he died; this cycle has continued up to the present day.[10] Over the course of his five thousand years in the Shiranui Village, Iihiko defeated every new \"main character\" that appeared each millennium: four thousand years ago, a brave young man, three thousand years ago, a kind tactician, two thousand years ago, a cunning witch, and one thousand years ago, a dual-sword wielding thief.[11]\nPlot\nUnknown Shiranui Arc\nIihiko uses Obi's body to break into the room where Shiranui is talking with her friends, sending the girl flying into a wall in the process. Though bloodied and being dragged around by her leg, Obi smilingly tells Iihiko to entertain their guests.[12] Iihiko cackles in delight at seeing Ajimu again after five thousand years. When Zenkichi lands a blow on Iihiko, Iihiko finds it no more than an itch. Mistaking Zenkichi for a mosquito, Iihiko crushes Zenkichi with his palm. Seeing Zenkichi has survived, Iihiko realizes Zenkichi is a human being, and lauds his \"strategy\" of pretending to be a mosquito. He then swings Obi's body around again, knocking aside Misogi Kumagawa before the boy can attack him with his screws. Noticing Medaka is the only one not to attack mindlessly, Iihiko asks Ajimu if the other girl is her favorite. Iihiko remains smiling as Ajimu explains their shared past, but is surprised when Medaka creates four clones of herself to evacuate everyone in the room, rescuing Obi from his grip as well. Impressed, Iihiko explains he has prepared another weapon to fight Ajimu: a rubber band. Changing his tone, Iihiko tells Ajimu he has grown bored with fighting her, and offers to let her live if she captures the group that has just escaped. At Ajimu's refusal, Iihiko uses the rubber band to blow her body in half.[13] Iihiko beats Medaka to Ajimu's jeep, and taunts her with Ajimu's severed hair.[14]\n\nIihiko vs. an armored truck\nIihiko vs. an armored truck.\nIihiko tells Medaka that, rather than trying to use automobiles, running would have been faster. He easily bypasses Medaka's Kurokami Phantom, and reaches for Zenkichi. Iihiko reveals he intends to use Zenkichi's glasses to defeat Medaka, and bends the frame to fit around his fist. He delivers a crippling blow to Medaka's arm, and is impressed when she manages to wrap herself around his own arm even so. He is less impressed when she lets go, her arm not having healed as she expected. Hearing that there is someone else at Hakoniwa Academy who specializes in destruction, Iihiko expresses his desire to someday fight such a person. He then breaks Medaka's torso, and begins brutally beating her.[15] Iihiko is surprised when Medaka stops his assault with her good arm. Hearing her declaration to defeat him, Iihiko demands to know how, and prepares to finish her. He is interrupted however by a wave of electricity.[16] Iihiko is initially unimpressed by the arrival of Oudo Miyakonojou,[17], but laughs out loud when he sees Oudo has brought others with him. His laughter is interrupted however by an attack from Shigusa Takachiho. Before Iihiko can respond, he is cut by several of Kei Munakata's blades. He is then attacked once more by Itami Koga,[18] before being struck with a massive wave of electricity from both Oudo and Mizou Yukuhashi. Iihiko drops to the ground, but rises almost immediately, brushing off the attacks. Despite his jocular attitude, Iihiko is genuinely annoyed by the frontal attacks; Oudo offers an attack from the side, and Iihiko is knocked off the mountain by an armored truck.[19] Iihiko catches Shiranui as she falls, reminding her that her body is precious to him as well. He then asks for Medaka's name, expressing his belief that the two of them will cross paths once again.[20]\n\nIihiko inadvertently kills Fukurou\nIihiko inadvertently kills Fukurou.\nAfter Iihiko realizes Fukurou Tsurubami does not want Shiranui as a double, he leaves the Shiranui Village to collect her, beating Obi and several doubles in the process.[21] Iihiko crashes into the ruins of Hakoniwa General Hospital, inadvertently killing Fukurou in the process. After calling out for his enemy, he only just notices that he has landed on someone.[22] Not finding anyone challenging him, he tells Shiranui they are going back to the village. He is amused when Zenkichi, Kumagawa, and Namanie Nienami move to protect her, but is stopped from attacking by the arrival of Medaka.[23] Iihiko is delighted by Medaka's appearance.[24] He grows impatient as she talks to her friends, and moves forward, only for Medaka to punch him before he can make his own attack. Iihiko notes that Medaka has improved; as he recognizes her punch however, the attack \"breaks\" as Iihiko defends himself. Hearing Medaka's demand that he give up on Shiranui if her next attack is successful, Iihiko asks if she will give up on Shiranui if she fails. When Medaka answers in the negative, Iihiko is amused.[25] Medaka charges forward with her Kurokami Phantom; however, the attack fails, and Medaka collapses. Iihiko explains that he reflected her strongest attack back on her; Medaka's heart will never beat again. Iihiko expresses his disappointment that Medaka was merely a modern girl after all.[26] As Zenkichi begs Medaka to wake up, Iihiko tells him to stop. He recognizes that Medaka fought well, and insists she be left to rest in peace.[27] He is amazed when Medaka regains consciousness and rises to her feet, sure that her heart had stopped beating.[28] Though he chuckles at Medaka's bravado, he is confused as she prepares a \"fresh\" attack.[29]\n\nIihiko stops Medaka with his new body\nIihiko stops Medaka with his new body.\nIihiko watches Medaka as she charges at him again.[30] However, he is not impressed. Though he recognizes Medaka's charge is both stronger and faster than her previous attack, that is all that has changed. As Medaka approaches, Iihiko regrets that this girl will perish just like the many strong foes he fought before. He is startled however to find that the Medaka he was watching was just a clone, and that the real Medaka was behind.[31][32] As Medaka prepares to make contact however, Iihiko dodges the hit. Iihiko laughs, assured of his victory, but is hit by Medaka from behind. Medaka explains her attack, and Iihiko smiles, commending her on her freshness as he falls. Though Medaka declares the battle a draw, Iihiko somehow possesses Shiranui's body, and stabs Medaka through the stomach with his hand. Iihiko calls his victory, and is happy that his new body is so fresh.[33] Laughing, Iihiko decides to test out his new body, destroying the hospital. He is surprised to see Medaka managed to save her friends, but easily stops her second Kurokami Final. Congratulating her on her performance, Iihiko makes to leave, but is stopped by Medaka. Deciding to break her spirit, he attacks her friends. Medaka still refuses to let him go however, and a furious Iihiko begins beating her.[34][35] Stopped once more, Iihiko angrily demands to know who his new opponent is.[36] Iihiko fights with Nienami,[37] who is actually Kakegae Yuzuriha using her style.[38][39] Iihiko eventually knocks Yuzuriha back with a blow to the shoulder.[40] Iihiko stares down Zenkichi before attacking him. Zenkichi manages to dodge Iihiko's attacks, much to the former hero's increasing ire.[41] As Zenkichi begins launching kicks, Iihiko dodges. Iihiko manages to land an attack, blowing Zenkichi's arm off; however, Zenkichi uses the opportunity to counter.[42] Iihiko switches out with Shiranui for a split-second, forcing Zenkichi to stop his attack. Iihiko prepares to finish Zenkichi, but finds himself unable to move. Zenkichi reveals that his plan was always to bring Shiranui back in control. As Iihiko finds his fist pointed at himself, Zenkichi asks the Irreversible Destroyer what will happen if he is hit with his own irreversible damage. A panicked Iihiko tells Shiranui that he is too rare of an existence to destroy. Shiranui pays him no heed however, and punches him in the face, destroying Iihiko's spirit.[43]\n\nShiranui Village triumvirate\nShiranui Village triumvirate.\nIihiko's previous body is seen among the ruins.[44] As Medaka begins to tremble at the thought of stopping the moon, Iihiko rises to calm her down. Admitting he is merely an echo of his former self, Iihiko advises Medaka to look to the sky and remember her life.[45] At the same time as the Hakoniwa Academy graduation ceremony, Iihiko is seen eating in the Shiranui Village with Hanten and Obi. Iihiko notes that Ajimu might sooner or later come back, since his destruction is now reversible. When Obi decides to close down Shiranui Village, Iihiko says that originally, humans did not need a spare to talk, interact, and transmit their words to express their feelings to each other.[46]\n\nBouquet Toss To The Future Arc\nIihiko is one of the guests Zenkichi calls to Hakoniwa Academy to fight Medaka as part of the 100 Flowers Run.[47] Iihiko confronts Medaka at Hakoniwa Academy as part of the 100 Flowers Run, along with the members of the Shiranui family.[48] Medaka defeats Iihiko with her Altered God Mode.[49][50] His message to Medaka is to stay fresh.[51]\")\nAbilities: (\"Superhuman Strength: Iihiko can swing around Obi's body easily, despite the woman's proven difficulty to catch,[12] and was able to put both Zenkichi and Kumagawa in near death states with minimal effort,[53] In the past, Ajimu was unable to defeat him even with all her skills and help from other Not Equals she had created.[54] In the present, Iihiko was able to break Ajimu's body in half with only a rubber band, despite her using several of her skills at the same time.[55] He was also able to combat Medaka with only Zenkichi's glasses.[56][57] Joutou Kotobuki claims Iihiko's true worth is to use objects lying around as weapons;[58] he can even use the air as a weapon.[59] Iihiko has abused his body for over a hundred years; after taking over Shiranui's body, his strength increases dramatically. Because it is a new body however, Iihiko has trouble controlling his power, and as he took possession of the body four year early, he is stuck with Shiranui's small stature.[60]\" + \"Superhuman Durability: Iihiko shrugged off an attack from Zenkichi as nothing more than an itch.[61] He was also left unscathed by the combined efforts of five Abnormals, even though he claimed his body was weakened at the time.[62] Iihiko is unaffected by both Abnormalities and Minuses; rather, he seems not to notice when skills are used against him.[63] After Iihiko sees an attack once, it will not work against him a second time, as he will no longer recognize it as an attack.[64]\" + \"Irreversible Destruction: Any damage Iihiko deals to the world does not heal; Shiranui states he was a man born to destroy the world. Whether natural or skill based, Iihiko's actions cannot be recovered from. This ability seems to negate even Kumagawa's All Fiction.[65] However, the true horror of this ability manifests itself in Iihiko's defense; the stronger an attack used against him, the further the attack itself will be \"broken\", and never return to normal.[66] However, if Iihiko is defeated, then the damage will become reparable; in this way, Iihiko's irreversible destruction functions on the same principles as a style.[67]\" + \"Shiranui Possession: Because he is a spirit, Iihiko's consciousness is transferred into a new double from the Shiranui Household each time he \"dies\". These doubles are usually prepared over a course of several years to become Iihiko's new body.[68] However, Iihiko can transfer his consciousness into his next host immediately as long as they are nearby.[69] Iihiko considers this an emergency escape plan;[70] it can be done even if the body has not yet been fully prepared for his spirit.\")"

The next double for Iihiko is Hansode Shiranui, whose very existence will cease to be after training to become him.

They comprise the majority of the academy's scholarship students.\n\nAbnormal\nSee also: Abnormality\nAn Abnormal (異常アブノーマル, Abunōmaru) possesses such overwhelming capabilities that the individual is unable to control that aspect of themselves and inherently seeks to master their Abnormality. Their abilities often cause people of lesser ability to unconsciously fear and avoid them. Because of this, Abnormals tend to be lonely and strive to master their abilities. Abnormalities are often innate abilities, but are not necessarily present from birth, as it often takes a few years for an Abnormality to make itself evident. The most extraordinary of the scholarship students, they are enrolled exclusively in Class 13, and are not required to attend school.\n\nMinus\nMinus (過負荷マイナス, Mainasu) are a subcategory of Abnormals, students who have no inherent interest in controlling their Abnormalities and have no sense of morality. Their very abilities are obtained through further deterioration of their minds from hardship and trauma. Unlike other Abnormals, their abilities cannot be researched or analyzed. Rather, they thrive on destruction, regarding themselves as unworthy, unable to relate to others, and have no sense of responsibility. The majority of them are transfer students, invited to the academy to join Class -13 after the Thirteen Party are defeated.\n\nNot Equal\nNot Equal (悪平等ノットエコール, Notto Ikōru) is a mysterious and little-known category that transcends both Abnormals and Minuses alike. The only \"true\" Not Equals are Najimi Ajimu and Hanten Shiranui; Ajimu seems to posses the ability to create proxies that also serve as Not Equals. Ajimu has stated that she is 700 million people, or one tenth of the world's population. These proxies need not necessarily be skill holders; of the Not Equals shown to be a part of Ajimu, the Candidate Student Council have no abilities, while Aoki Aka uses a skill she obtained directly from Ajimu. Setting them apart from Abnormals and Minuses, the Not Equals each have a very unique skill set. Ajimu claims to possess a total of 12,858,051,967,633,865 skills, consisting of both Abnormalities and Minuses. Hanten possesses a skill that allows him to create new skills, and produce as many copies as he wants. Because of their overwhelming abilities, the Not Equals have neither a superiority complex like the Abnormals, nor an inferiority complex like the Minuses. Instead, they do not see themselves as human at all, and as such label themselves as \"Non-Humans\", after making a slight recalculation, {{user}} the requirements to also be a \"true\" Not Equal due to his abnormality.\n\nZero\nZero (持たざる者ゼロ, Zero) is a new category created by the efforts of the True Flask Plan. A complete diversion from the conventional characterizing structure, a Zero is separate from both Pluses and Minuses, but as a trade-off, fate and destiny has no hold or effect over them. Currently Zenkichi Hitoyoshi is the only known Zero, due to his mentality reflected by his personal skill, Devil Style, and the skill's power itself."

She does tell Medeka and Nabeshima what the Swimming Club wants is a pool full of money: their dream is to spend a full day swimming in it.[7] In the third event, eel catching, Kikaijima manages to capture thirteen eels, maintaining the Swimming Club's position in first place.[8] After the third event, the Swimming Club confronts the Student Council.[9] After Medaka claims that she will reform the Swimming Club, Tanegashima haughtily dares her to go ahead and try.[10]\n\nKikaijima enraged by Medaka\nKikaijima enraged by Medaka.\n\nAs the fourth event starts, the cavalry battle, Kikaijima is seen as the Swimming Club's lancer.[11] After hearing Yakushima's explanation of the final event, Kikaijima declares that they have no reason to face the Student Council head on, and suggests instead that they take the headband of seventh place, thus gaining an extra point on their lead. After Medaka challenges the Swimming Club, promising that she will teach them that there is something more important than money; Kikaijima loses her temper, and tells the other two she will take that \"stupid girl\" down. When Asa signals for the event to begin, Kikaijima and Medaka immediately lock hands. After Medaka claims that she likes the Swimming Club, Kikaijima angrily reminds her that she called them money zombies. Medaka retorts that they are being lured by the strong pull of money, at which point Kikaijima tells her to shut up. She tells Medaka about the horrid pasts of her and her teammates, and goes on to say that she would gladly give up her life for money: anyone would be sad if they were to lose their wallet or purse, but no one would care if they died.\n\nI like you more than money\n\"I like you more than money.\"\n\nWith a sudden burst of strength, Kikaijima manages to push Medaka off balance. She is shocked to see however, that Medaka is standing on Zenkichi's discarded float. Medaka and chastises Kikaijima, telling her that even if their luck hits the depths of hell, that is still no reason to throw their lives away. Medaka goes on to say they have just earned something very expensive: her wrath. Medaka leaps at her, knocking her off balance, and after telling Kikaijima that she would be sad if they died, kisses her on the lips to prove it. They both fall into the water. Medaka carries Kikaijima out of the pool and hands her over to Yakushima. Kikaijma as her teammates which is more important, her or money. After they both answer money, she then asks which they like more, her or money. They both tell her they like her more, at which she tearfully tells them that she likes them more than money to. She is shocked with everyone else when Nabeshima and the Judo Club are revealed to have won the competition, and thinks that Nabeshima was surprisingly cool about being cheap.[12] Kikaijima is later seen at the Student Council room as the new treasurer, being rented out from the Swimming Club for $3.00 a day. She tells Zenkichi and Kouki Akune that if they waste money, they will feel her wrath.[13]\n\nKikaijima demands payment\nKikaijima demands payment.\n\nKikaijima changes in the Student Council room, only for Zenkichi to walk in and see her in her underwear.[14] After beating up Zenkichi, she demands he pay her for the show, as he saw her near naked. After he tells her he saw something he didn't want to see, she starts crying, and angrily cries that he pay her while calling him a meanie, now telling him to pay for the mean things he said as well. Zenkichi relents, and he pays her $4.50 for the peep show, and $3.00 for being mean. Paid, Kikaijima's mood instantly improves. She asks Zenkichi where the computer is, to which he replies that they don't have one and hands her an abacus, much to Kikaijima's surprise. After Zenkichi explains Medaka's mental talents, Kikaijima questions whether Medaka has intel inside. She then claims that it is a waste to buy something that isn't needed, and that an abacus is also pretty useful. Kikaijima begins working while Zenkichi starts reading manga. She thinks to herself that it has gotten really quiet, and that it was a bad idea to show how serious she was by working. She thinks on how Zenkichi is reading manga, and it doesn't look like he is interested in her at all. She worries that she will lose face to Yakushima and Tanegashima, and resolves to make friends. Flustered, she then comments to Zenkichi that they have nice weather today. After he points out that it is raining, the atmosphere becomes even more tense, with Kikaijima thinking that she read in a book somewhere that you can strike up a conversation with just about anyone when you talk about the weather. She wonders if Zenkichi hates her or something. When Zenkichi tells her that she has a great body, a horrified Kikaijima throws her abacus at his head, and charges him $0.50 for sexual harassment; bringing the total amount of money she has taken from him $8.00. Kikaijima thinks to herself that Zenkichi must hate her now, and that she wants to apologize for getting violent and give him his money back. She silently begs for somebody to help out, not caring who. Hansode Shiranui barges into the Student Council room, telling Zenkichi she felt as if he was calling for her, and asking if he has something good for her to eat. A horrified Zenkichi and Kikaijima both think that the number one person who can't take a hint just came.\n\nKikaijima tells Zenkichi she is going to kiss him\nKikaijima tells Zenkichi she is going to kiss him.\n\nAs Shiranui introduces herself, Kikaijima thinks to herself that the other girl is a mystery: during the swim meet, it was like she was pulling the strings behind the scenes, and wonders how she can enter the Student Council room when she is not a member. Shiranui then offers Kikaijima a photo of her kiss with Medaka, breaking the forth wall to mention that it took up a whole panel the week prior, much to Kikaijima's dismay. As Kikaijima ties to take it, Shiranui offers it her, explaining that she actually took it for the school newspaper, but if Kikaijima asks, Shiranui will give it to her. She then maliciously reveals that she took three hundred photos, all from different angles, and asks Kikaijima which one she would like. Zenkichi asks her to stop however, and Shiranui agrees, leaving with an empty apology to Kikaijima and a farewell to Zenkichi. Gathering up the photos, Kikaijima thanks Zenkichi for helping her out. She asks him what Shiranui is really like, and is shocked when he tells her he doesn't really know. Kikaijima asks him if it is alright to be that easy going about, Zenkichi replies in the affirmative, telling her that Shiranui is his friend, and that he doesn't need to know any more than that. Kikaijima then asks about Medaka, wanting to know if she does that (kissing) with everyone. After Zenkichi describes Medaka, Kikaijima asks how she Medaka can claim she was born for others, as that line of thinking is incomprehensible to Kikaijima herself. She goes on to say that when she ran out of money, all the people who she thought were her friends left her; she doesn't hate or blame anyone because she thought that was how the word worked: a give and take world. She claims that if anyone starts to like her, they won't get anything in return. Zenkichi asks if she can say the same thing to the other members of the Swimming Club, to which Kikaijima replies that those two are different, as the three of them are like family. Zenkichi tells her that Medaka is the same way, only she sees all of humanity as her family, and that she likes Kikaijima so much, she doesn't know what to do about it. Kikaijima remembers pacing outside the suggestion box, when Medaka approaches her from behind and asks her what she is doing. While Kikaijima tries to answer, Medaka tells her that she was looking for her anyway: after knocking her into the pool, Medaka couldn't get her mind off of Kikaijima, and claims that she has fallen for her. Medaka then tells Kikaijima that the Student Council needs a Treasurer, and asks her to help out. Kikaijima remembers that that was the first time she was asked to help someone. Kikaijima suddenly realizes that she has been having a normal conversation with Zenkichi, and that this is her chance to make a new friend. She worries that if she starts thinking about it, she might fail again, when she decides to do the same thing Medaka did. She then interrupts the still talking Zenkichi, claiming that she has fallen for him, and is going to kiss him. Medaka and Akune later find her on top of Zenkichi in the Student Council room, with Zenkichi trying to force her off of him.[15]\n\nKikaijima wearing her swimsuit beneath her uniform\nKikaijima wearing her swimsuit beneath her uniform.\n\nKikaijima is spotted walking with the rest of the Student Council by Harigane Onigase of the Public Morals Committee, who confronts the Student Council in their office. After Onigase calls out Zenkichi and Akune on their uniforms, she turns to Kikaijima. While Kikaijima initially denies having made an alterations to her uniform, Onigase successfully reveals that she has been wearing her swimsuit beneath her uniform, to which an embarrassed Kikaijima can only try to claim she was testing Onigase. She asks the other girl whether it would be alright for her to wear only her swimsuit, a suggestion Onigase immediately shoots down. When Medaka claims that she has never been embarrassed about her splendid body, the other members of the Student Council are at a loss for words. When Medaka finally declares that she just doesn't want to change her clothing, the other members of the Student Council are appalled. After Onigase leaves, Kikaijima sets about cleaning up the office.[16]\n\nThe Student Council at work\nThe Student Council at work.\n\nWhile Medaka visits the music room, Kikaijima is busy putting up fliers.[17] She is unaware as Rankaku Yoshinogari sneaks up behind her, weapons drawn.[18][19] Kikaijima remains oblivious to Yoshinogari, but is pleased that her work was well done.

Kikaijima is skeptical, but is quickly convinced after seeing the super ball in action. When Unzen shows up at the office, Kikaijima is unimpressed, stating that his actions are not cute at all.[21] As she listens to Unzen speak, Kikaijima looks grim.[22] When Medaka cries out that the super balls he dropped earlier were actually filled with gunpowder, Kikaijima is stunned. She worriedly tries to convince Unzen that if he detonates his bombs, he will be caught in the explosion as well, though her words have no effect.[23] When the smoke clears, Kikaijima and the other members of the Student Council are revealed to be fine. Unzen realizes that Medaka, in the short time she had, threw water on some of the bombs, kicked some out the window, and then sheltered her fellow members in lockers.[24] As Medaka enters War God Mode Kikaijima and the others can only watch. As Akune and Zenkichi discuss War God Mode, Kikaijima listens without saying anything.[25]\n\nThe Student Council stops Medaka's rampage\nThe Student Council stops Medaka's rampage.\n\nKikaijima watches as Medaka attacks Unzen.[26] When Medaka sends Unzen flying into the Student Council office, Kikaijima and the others are shocked.[27] Zenkichi explains to Kikaijima that Medaka is angry; that if you take away the personality, all that is left is a rampaging beast. He then tells her and Akune that if they want to leave the Student Council, now is the time, surprising them both.[28] As Medaka moves to make her last attack on Unzen, Kikaijima and the rest of the Student Council grab on to her, stopping her before she can finish. She tells them to let go of her if they don't want to get dragged into her problems, but they all refuse. All three are shocked when Medaka asks Unzen to become her Vice-President. Both she and Akune are amazed when Medaka speaks so easily about the extent of her injuries.[29] Together, the Student Council walks off into the sunset.[30]\n\nKikaijima tries to contribute\nKikaijima tries to contribute.\n\nIn the (temporary) Student Council office, Kikaijima and the others work to manage the academy in without the hospitalized Medaka. All three enjoy the quiet, though Kikaijima and Akune soon become distressed by Medaka's absence. At Kikaijima's urging, Zenkichi checks the suggestion box, only to find Sasae Mochibaru outside the door. Mochibaru leads them to the Shogi Club, and asks them to help her find a missing piece of a shogi set – the king. Zenkichi and Akune are notably put out by the messy state of the club room, though Kikaijima is more interested in the shogi pieces – a boxwood set – and their monetary value. The three change in to more appropriate clothing, and set about cleaning up the club room in search of the missing game piece. A mishap with a table leads to a sizable on each forehead, and the three reminisce on how Medaka has affected their lives as they clean. The Student Council are exhausted by the time they finish, but still have been unable to locate the missing king. Akune discovers that the king is missing from every shogi set in the room, and leads the Student Council to the prime suspect, Miri Natayama. The three confront Natayama on the roof, who all but outright confesses to the crime. After Zenkichi and Akune each say their piece to Natayama, Kikaijima tries to add to the conversation as well, though all she can contribute is trivia.

However, Kikaijima and the others follow Medaka, who chooses to forego the elevator in favor of the stairs.[33] As she and Medaka walk in front, she realizes that they have been walking in circles when Medaka points it out to her. She asks Kikaijima to use the same method she used when the two of them were in an amusement park maze. Kikaijima releases a loud shout into the maze, allowing Medaka to figure out their location with sonar. Kikaijima is upset when both Zenkichi and Akune complain to her, promising to tell Yakushima and Tanegashima when she gets back.

Kikaijima answers in the negative, and asks if Medaka is not hearing Zenkichi argue with the Tsushima twins. Kikaijima remarks that Zenkichi can get along with anyone, but wonders what has become of Maguro, who ran off after hearing about Youka Naze.

She stares down Yukuhashi, until a well-planned taunt provokes her to tell Yukuhashi to shut him, the force of her voice acting like a sound cannon. This proves to be a mistake however, as Kikaijima breathes in more of the knockout gas. Even so, she awakens herself by ripping off a nail. Yukuhashi asks Kikaijima why she is fighting so hard for Medaka, who was formerly her enemy; Kikaijima replies that for a friend, she will fight. She then uses her sound cannon to send shards of glass at Yukuhashi. Because she thought this strategy through however, Yukuhashi sees through it and deflects the projectiles. Kikaijima begins to tremble, desperate for air. When Yukuhashi tells Kikaijima that a person cannot be friends with someone standing on different levels from them though, Kikaijima loses her temper, and rips off four more nails. She states that because people treat Medaka as a special being, Medaka is always lonely. Kikaijima finishes be declaring that she will rescue Medaka, and then all of the Student Council will go to the amusement park together.[86] Kikaijima claims she has found the weak point in Yukuhashi's Reading Minds, and offers one chance for surrender.

Remembering Zenkichi's fight with Munakata, she aims for the light fixtures, bringing down a rain of glass upon herself. When Yukuhashi collapses, she reveals that she realized if Yukuhashi could feel her emotions, then her pain could be felt also.

Afterwards, the pair meet up with the group in their dressing room.[151] As Medaka questions why her singing lacks passion, Kikaijima also wonders why Medaka's ability in the arts is lacking, since she usually influences people around her all the time.[152] The Swimming Club are approached by Medaka asking about Shiranui; none of them remember her.[153] As Zenkichi hovers near death, Kikaijima's voice is one of the many that gives him encouragement.[154] She is also one of the people he remembers before preparing to fight Iihiko Shishime.[155] At the end of the academic year, Kikaijima is among the students present at the Hakoniwa Academy graduation ceremony.[156] She applauds Kumagawa at the conclusion of his speech.[157] She joins her friends for a group photo after the ceremony ends.[158]\n\nBouquet Toss To The Future Arc\nKikaijima (in her Student Council Uniform) and members of several generations of the Student Council confront Medaka as part of the 100 Flowers Run in the Student Council office. She tells Medaka that \"Youka Naze\" and \"Kujira Kurokami\" are two different people, and that Kumagawa is participating, but wanted to fight her alone.[159] Her message to Medaka is the promise they will be friends forever.[160] Come April of the new school year, Kikaijima is present at the entrance ceremony for Zenkichi's speech and the introduction of the new chair. She is delighted to see the academy's new chairwoman is none other than Medaka.[161]\")\nAbilities: (\"Voice Cannon: Loud Voice (大声, Ōgoe): Kikaijima is a Special and one of the school's many scholarship students.

He was a delinquent in middle school but, after being converted by Medaka, Akune immediately developed feelings for her and gradually became less violent. He now has very little desire to hurt others and is sickened when he has to. He is still capable of fighting dirty however, and is less inclined to \"fight fair\" than either Medaka or Zenkichi.

He initially wore the standard men's uniform of Hakoniwa Academy, though after joining the Student Council, he changes to the Student Council uniform, black as opposed to the usual white. Akune wears his uniform with the collar up and open and without the tie, both to imitate Medaka's own uniform[2] and because he is a fan of Elvis Presley.[3] The green armband signifying him as the secretary is worn around his left arm. During the battle to decide the academy's new Student Council, Akune wears the Student Council's Battle Attire Red Model. Akune gives up his armband after leaving the Student Council. Though he now wears the standard uniform again, he wears the collar up and open and without the tie as he did when a member of the Student Council. When at the Judo Club, Akune wears his Judo uniform. Ten years later, Akune wears a dark-colored suit jacket over a white vest and tie with black pants.\" + \"When he was a middle school student, Akune wore the uniform of Hakobune Middle School, though with the jacket open to show his chest. He also wore stomach wrappings, and had longer, messier hair.\")\nHistory: (\"As a student at Hakobune Middle School, Akune was a violent delinquent known as the \"Destroyer\" (破壊臣, Hakaishin). At the behest of then Student Council President Misogi Kumagawa, he attacked Medaka to destroy her. As she continued coming to school, Akune continued to attack, though he was unable to make her stop. It was at this time that Medaka began to make a name for herself as the diamond in the rough that the Destroyer couldn't destroy. At the same time, Akune's own reputation began to decline, leading to Zenkichi gathering together the other \"Anti-Akune\" students to gang up on him. It was at this time that Medaka finally attacked, not Akune but her childhood friend, admonishing him for trying to bully someone weaker than him, as well as telling him to switch back to his old hair-style. She also told Akune that she would continue to take his beatings until he regained the heart of a good person. Though he refuted her analysis, this lead to Akune pledging himself to Medaka, asking her to becoming the \"something\" he had never had before.[4] Akune's official position in the Student Council was that of general affairs manager.[5] After the situation with Kumagawa was resolved, Zenkichi and Akune became bitter rivals for Medaka's affections.[6] Akune eventually confessed to Medaka, but she told him to give up, telling him that she couldn't answer his feelings, as she wouldn't belong to a single person.[7]\n\nPlot\nStudent Council Executive Arc\nAkune in his judo uniform\nAkune in his judo uniform.\n\nAkune is present at Medaka's inauguration ceremony.[8] At a later date, when Nekomi Nabeshima wonders why the \"Club Typhoon\" Zenkichi is going around to all the different clubs but not their own, Akune claims that Zenkichi is only trying to show off his strength, as the only one suitable to be beside Medaka is he. When Nabeshima asks if he knows Zenkichi, Akune replies that Zenkichi is an insect, while Medaka is his flower.[9] In the morning, Akune is almost run over by Isagi Isahaya on her way to practice. However, he manages to catch her and drop her gently on the ground. An embarrassed Isahaya apologizes, to which Akune tells her to be more careful, as he would hate to see her get hurt. As Aria Ariake asks if she is all right, a flustered Isahaya asks who that was. Ariake identifies him as the prince of the Judo Club.[10]\n\nAkune kneeling before Medaka\nAkune kneeling before Medaka.\n\nWhen Medaka and Zenkichi come to the Judo Club, Nabeshima greets both of them and calls for Akune, who kneels before to Medaka to show his gratitude for what she did for him in the past. Medaka pulls him to his feet, telling him that if he wants to express his gratitude, he shouldn't bow to her to show it. As Akune and Zenkichi aggressively greet each other, an amused Nabeshima looks on.[11] After Medaka challenges the members of the Judo Club to come at her, Akune tells Nabeshima that Medaka is wasting her breath, as the two of them are the only ones who could fight Medaka on even footing.[12] After Betsuhei Jounan is defeated in an instant by Medaka, Nabeshima acknowledges that Akune's earlier comment was correct. When Zenkichi claims he is just being dragged around by Medaka, Akune loses his temper, and asks to take over Zenkichi's position, Nabeshima proposes they settle the argument with judo: if Akune beats Zenkichi, he will join the Student Council and Zenkichi will join the Judo Club. When Zenkichi disbelievingly asks Nabeshima if this was her plan all along, she admits it was, claiming she loves \"go-getters\" like Zenkichi.[13]\n\nAkune scores the first point\nAkune scores the first point.\n\nAs Zenkichi and Akune ready themselves for the match, Akune tells Zenkichi he is impressed that he didn't run off with his tail between his legs. As the match begins, Zenkichi attacks first, however, Akune easily scores his first point, and tells Zenkichi to get back up, as he will defeat him in the most unsightly manner possible in front of Medaka.[14] In a short time, Akune reaches nine points, leaving a battered Zenkichi barely standing. As Akune moves to finish him, Medaka calls out to Zenkichi, who surprises Akune with a two-handed topple, scoring a point off him and winning the match.[15] Nabeshima later cuts him from the Judo Club, but tells him that he can join the Student Council. When he claims that would violate his promise with Zenkichi, she asks him whether he wants to keep his promise or win Medaka. Zenkichi and Hansode Shiranui later walk in on him changing in the Student Council room, much to Zenkichi's displeasure and Shiranui's delight. Akune tells Zenkichi that while he may have given up on driving Zenkichi out, he hasn't given up on Medaka, and has left the Judo Club to become the secretary of the Student Council. He also tells Zenkichi that Nabeshima hasn't given up on him. Zenkichi angrily insists that he will not let Akune have Medaka.[16]\n\nMedaka congratulates Akune\nMedaka congratulates Akune.\n\nA month after Medaka's inauguration, Akune comes into the Student Council room to find Zenkichi watering the flowers. After the two trade veiled insults with each other, the pair head off to attend to the next request. After Medaka interviews Kenna Yatsushiro on the nature of her request, she assigns Akune to take care of it. Akune jumps at the chance, and after hearing from Yatsushiro about her love problems, becomes even more determined to help her.[17] After Akune presents the letter he wrote for Yatsushiro to Medaka, she questions what he is trying to say with his nice handwriting and fancy words. When Akune finds himself at a loss for words, she tells him that he has only created problems. She finishes by declaring he has disappointed her and that his work is over. Zenkichi offers him some words of consolement, but Akune rebukes him, tearing up the letter and declaring he won't give up. He returns to Yatsushiro and works with her on improving her penmanship so that she can write the letter herself. A week later, Yatsushiro gives her own letter to her crush, and Medaka congratulates Akune on a job well done.[18]\n\nThe guys modeling\nThe guys modeling.\n\nWhen Kizashi Yuubaru asks Medaka to model for him, Akune is thrilled to see Medaka in a bikini, and compares her to a goddess. Later, he understands Yuubaru's frustration of being unable to create the picture he wants, though he is surprised when Yuubaru rejects Medaka.[19] Akune brings Nabeshima in as a replacement model, though he and Zenkichi begin arguing over who brought the better girl.[20] After both are rejected by Yuubaru, Akune and Zenkichi find themselves at a loss for what to do. However, they remember Akizuki and Yatsushiro. Akune goes to ask Yatsushiro, but is rejected with a slap to the face. After seeing them struggle to find new models, Medaka suggests that the two of them try. While Yuubaru at first seems satisfied, he gives up when he realizes that the men don't match the theme of \"Beach Goddess\". Akune is shocked along with everyone else when Yuubaru decides on Shiranui as his model.[21]\n\nAn exhausted Zenkichi and Akune\nAn exhausted Zenkichi and Akune.\n\nExhausted with the constant demands of the Student Council, Akune jokingly asks Zenkichi if he can quit the Student Council. When he expresses his amazement at Medaka's work ethinc, she tells him even she is beginning to feel fatigued. When she complains that there are too many requests by clubs for funds, Akune mentions that he can understand; as a former member of the Judo Club, he knows that every extra dollar helps. While trying to decide how to give finds, he suggests that they give the most money to the most deserving club. He offers that they turn the inter-club relay race into a competition to decide which clubs should get funding.[22]\n\n20 Point High-Five\nThe twenty point...fist bump.\n\nCome Sunday, Akune tells Zenkichi that fifteen clubs have come, a surprising amount.[23] After Medaka announces that the Student Council will be taking part as well, and that anyone who can score higher than them will recieve funding directly from Medaka's own pocket, three times the normal amount, no questions asked, he and Zenkichi are seen kneeling on the ground, thinking that they begged her not to do this.[24] Waiting for the first event to start, Akune points out that Nabeshima is taking advantage of the rules by making her team up of all girls, as the boys are handicapped with floatation devices. Nabeshima agrees with him, and Akune thinks that Nabeshima is very bold about being cheap.[25] When the first event begins, he and Zenkichi get out of the water straight away. When Nabeshima demands to know why, Akune tells her it is so they don't get in Medaka's way.[26] After Medaka scores, he high-fives Zenkichi.[27] After the first event ends, Akune asks Zenkichi if they should have given extra points for finishing places.[28]\n\nZenkichi's and Akune's poor teamwork\nZenkichi's and Akune's poor teamwork.\n\nAkune and Zenkichi take part in the second event, the three legged race.[29] Before the race begins, Akune tells Zenkichi that even if they are the event's organizers, that is no excuse to hold back. Zenkichi says he understands, and will match his pace to Akune's. Akune expresses his pleasure at having such a good underclassman, and the two shake hands. When Tanzaku Aso starts the race, Akune and Zenkichi both begin struggling with one another to get ahead, but manage to move into the lead despite this.[30] When Umumichi Yakushima and Sotsu Tanegashima swim the race with their legs tied together, Akune is stunned along with everyone else. Because they both finished at different times, he and Zenkichi take third place.[31] At the end of the third event, the Student Council is in seventh place overall. When Zenkichi asks him what the final event will be, Akune tells him that Aso will be deciding it, so as not to give the Student Council an unfair advantage. When Medaka uses her Proof of One's Worth #1, Akune is seen swooning.[32]\n\nThe Student Council's horse\nThe Student Council's horse.\n\nAs the fourth event starts, the cavalry battle, Zenkichi and Akune are seen as the horse supporting Medaka, with Akune in the back. When Akune questions this set up, Zenkichi reminds him that he lost the game of rock paper scissors.[33] When Medaka punches Zenkichi on the head, Akune looks on in wonder.[34] When Medaka falls down, Akune is seen looking appalled.[35] When Medaka knocks Mogana Kikaijima off balance and kisses her, Akune is particularly shocked.[36] He is shocked with everyone else when Nabeshima and the Judo Club are revealed to have won the competition, and thinks that Nabeshima was surprisingly cool about being cheap. He is later seen in the Student Council room, when Medaka introduces Kikajima as the Student Council's new treasurer. They are both stunned to see her again, and when Medaka explains that they are renting her out from the Swimming Club for $3.00 a day, they both think that is surprisingly cheap.[37]\n\nAkune finds Zenkichi and Kikaijima in a compromising position\nAkune finds Zenkichi and Kikaijima in a compromising position.\n\nWalking in the halls with Medaka after completing a request, Akune makes conversation with her, mentioning that today's request was pretty difficult, and that he never thought something like that could happen here. Medaka agrees with him, and comments that they need to thank Zenkichi and Kikaijima. Akune agrees with her, stating that while Zenkichi is a worm, he does come in handy sometimes. Medaka and Akune walk in to find Kikaijima on top of Zenkichi in the Student Council room, with Zenkichi trying to force her off of him. Both of them misunderstand what they are seeing and chastise him: Akune sides with Medaka, asking Zenkichi whether he thinks the Student Council room is his own personal area or something.[38]\n\nAkune with a school appropriate uniform\nAkune with a school appropriate uniform.\n\nAkune is spotted walking with the rest of the Student Council by Harigane Onigase of the Public Morals Committee, who confronts the Student Council in their office. Onigase calls Akune out on wearing his uniform in a manner akin to Elvis Presley; he remarks that he can't retaliate if she gets angry like that. After Onigase reveals that Kikaijima has been wearing her swimsuit beneath her uniform, Akune can only wonder why. When Medaka claims that she has never been embarrassed about her splendid body, the other members of the Student Council are at a loss for words. As Zenkichi worries that Medaka is going to lose the argument to Onigase, Akune tells him there is no need, as Medaka will say something that even Onigase won't be able to argue with. When Medaka finally declares that she just doesn't want to change her clothing, the other members of the Student Council are appalled. After Onigase leaves, Akune asks Medaka if it is alright to make an enemy of the Public Morals Committee, especially Onigase. He goes on to mention that she was especially scouted to be an Enforcer, and that people who break the rules have been steadily decreasing since she came to the school.[39]\n\nThe Student Council at work\nThe Student Council at work.\n\nWhile Medaka visits the music room, Akune is busy cleaning windows.[40] He is unaware as Kanraku Kunisaki sneaks up behind him, bicycle at the ready.[41][42] Akune remains oblivious to Kunisaki as he cleans the window.[43] He notices Medaka when she goes cycling past him however, and when he turns around, he finds Kunisaki with his hands raised above his head, prompting Akune to question what kind of pose he is taking.[44]\n\nThe Student Council after Unzen's attack\nThe Student Council after Unzen's attack.\n\nIn the Student Council office, Akune and the others listen to Medaka's explanation of Myouri Unzen's weapon: the super ball. Akune is skeptical, but is quickly convinced after seeing the super ball in action. When Unzen shows up at the office, and Kikaijima states that his actions are not cute, Akune thinks she should be able to take a hint.[45] As he listens to Unzen speak, Akune looks grim.[46] When Medaka cries out that the super balls he dropped earlier were actually filled with gunpowder, Akune is stunned. In agitation, Akune tells Unzen that his games have ceased to be funny, though Unzen makes it very clear he is being serious.[47] When the smoke clears, Akune and the other members of the Student Council are revealed to be fine. Unzen realizes that Medaka, in the short time she had, threw water on some of the bombs, kicked some out the window, and then sheltered her fellow members in lockers.[48] As Medaka enters War God Mode, Akune and the others can only watch. Akune asks Zenkichi when the last time Medaka entered such a state was, who answers that it was in the summer of seventh grade, three years previous.[49]\n\nThe Student Council stops Medaka's rampage\nThe Student Council stops Medaka's rampage.\n\nWhen Medaka sends Unzen flying into the Student Council office, Akune and the others are shocked.[50] Akune listens to Zenkichi explain Medaka's behavior to Kikaijima, and is shocked when Zenkichi tells both him and Kikaijima that if they want to leave the Student Council, now is the time.[51] As Medaka moves to make her last attack on Unzen, Akune and the rest of the Student Council grab on to her, stopping her before she can finish. She tells them to let go of her if they don't want to get dragged into her problems, but they all refuse. All three are shocked when Medaka asks Unzen to become her Vice-President. As Medaka makes to leave, Akune asks where she is going, and both he and Kikaijima are amazed when Medaka speaks so easily about the extent of her injuries.[52] Together, the Student Council walks off into the sunset.[53]\n\nAkune cleans the Shogi Club room\nAkune cleans the Shogi Club room.\n\nIn the (temporary) Student Council office, Akune and the others work to manage the academy in without the hospitalized Medaka. All three enjoy the quiet, though Akune and Kikaijima become distressed by Medaka's absence. With the arrival of Sasae Mochibaru to the office, Akune questions her on the nature of her request, and suggests she return after Medaka comes back if she is uncomfortable. Mochibaru leads them to the Shogi Club, and asks them to help her find a missing piece of a shogi set – the king. Akune and Zenkichi are notably put out by the messy state of the club room. The three change in to more appropriate clothing, and set about cleaning up the club room in search of the missing game piece. A mishap with a table leads to a sizable on each forehead, and the three reminisce on how Medaka has affected their lives as they clean. The Student Council are exhausted by the time they finish, but still have been unable to locate the missing king. Akune suggests they substitute a piece from another set for the time being, but in doing so, he discovers that the king is missing from every set in the room. Realizing that the request has now become a case of theft, he quickly deduces that the culprit is most likely Miri Natayama, a former member of the club, and a Special student. The three confront Natayama on the roof, who all but outright confesses to the crime. Akune suggests they go to the teachers and leave the matter up to them, but is stopped by Zenkichi, who decides they should do things Medaka's way. After Zenkichi's outburst, Akune approaches Natayama and compares her situation to that of the jade general in shogi: a piece that is often misnamed as king. He berates her for running away, and defends Mochibaru. Both he and Zenkichi are aghast by Kikaijima's attempt at helping. Afterwards, each member of the Student Council arrives at the temporary office with a flower pot, prompting all three to start laughing.[54]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThirteen Party Arc\nAkune attacks the Door of Rejection\nAkune attacks the Door of Rejection.\n\nAkune and Kikaijima arrive together at the Door of Rejection, surprising Zenkichi. Akune reveals that Shiranui informed both him and Kikaijima about the Flask Plan, an action that surprises Zenkichi. After Kikaijima passes through the door, Akune explains to Zenkichi that Medaka told them what number code to enter next if they wanted to get through (Zenkichi's birth date). After Sanou Tsushima and Unou Tsushima claim that they have now trapped themselves on the other side with no code, Akune brushes them off, explaining he has no intention of going along with their rules. Grabbing a torch, he sets to breaking down the door with force. After one hundred and fifty two strikes, the door crumbles, and Akune and Zenkichi move on into the labs.[55]\n\nZenkichi and Akune unsuccessfully try to attack Takachiho\nAkune and Zenkichi unsuccessfully try to attack Takachiho.\n\nThe Student Council comes to another door, which the Tsushima twins identify as an elevator. However, Akune and the others follow Medaka, who chooses to forego the elevator in favor of the stairs.[56] Akune and Zenkichi discuss what they intend to do as they encounter members of the Thirteen Party. Akune states that he will attack without hesitation when the time comes, citing the helplessness he felt during Unzen's attack. They are both told off by Medaka the next moment however, who points out that they have been walking in circles. When Akune hears that Medaka and Kikaijima went to an amusement park together, he is very upset that he wasn't invited.[57] Akune and Zenkichi both complain about their eardrums after Kikaijima's shout, though they are silenced when the Tsushima twins explains what she has done. When Shigusa Takachiho appears, Akune and Zenkichi both attack him, only to be effortlessly avoided.[58]\n\nAkune and Kikaijima shocked\nAkune and Kikaijima shocked to see Medaka and Takachiho's battle.\n\nAkune watches on as Takachiho confronts Medaka.[59][60] He is horrified when Takachiho knees Medaka in the face.[61] He is thrilled when he sees that Medaka is alright. He and the others run to Medaka's side when she is dropped by Takachiho's kick.[62] Like the rest of the Student Council, he is unable to react when Takachiho takes back his flash drive.[63] He is shocked when Takachiho manages to dodge all of the super balls.[64] Akune continues to watch Medaka's fight with Takachiho.[65] He is horrified when Takachiho breaks Medaka's arm.[66] He is stunned when he hears that Medaka has no reflexes, and asks Zenkichi for confirmation.[67] Akune expresses his concern for Medaka, worrying that she is at a disadvantage against Takachiho. He is surprised by Zenkichi's reaction when Medaka removes her shoes.[68] He and the others are amazed by Medaka's Kurokami Phantom.[69] After Medaka collapses, Akune runs to her side. He is horrified when Takachiho rises to his feet.[70] Stunned that Takachiho has gotten back up, Akune is yet more shocked when Medaka regains consciousness as well. The group makes to leave, but Takachiho demands that Medaka wait.[71] He stands back as Medaka prepares to fight Takachiho once more.[72] They are all three surprised when the two simply start punching one another, with Akune remarking that even Takachiho isn't dodging.[73] Akune is visibly unsettled when Takachiho starts laughing.[74] After Medaka defeats Takachiho, Akune expresses his relief that the battle ended in their favor.[75] The Student Council then head down to the next floor.[76]\n\nAkune's and Kikaijima's reactions to Medaka's confession\nAkune's and Kikaijima's reactions to Medaka's confession.\n\nAkune is surprised when the Student Council reaches the second floor, a large biotope, and is further surprised when Kei Munakata tells them he will not try to stop them.[77] He is shocked when Munakata tries to cut Medaka's head off. He is further shocked to hear that Munakata is on the nation's most wanted list, and is a serial killer of international reputation.[78] Akune is further surprised when Medaka enters War God Mode to attack Maguro Kurokami, mistaking him for a member of the Thirteen Party.[79] He looks worried when Maguro decides Zenkichi will be the one to fight Munakata.[80] Kikaijima asks Akune if Zenkichi will be alright, who tells her not to worry, even if Zenkichi's opponent is a serial killer.[81] Akune notices that Munakata is not very skilled in his use of his weapons.[82] Akune is surprised into silence upon seeing Zenkichi keep successfully deflecting Munakata's attacks. He is stunned when Munakata reveals a spiked staff.[83] Akune is pleased when Zenkichi manages to knock Munakata down.[84] Akune notes that Zenkichi is starting to use more foot techniques. He and Maguro discuss Zenkichi's style, Savate, and Akune notes that Zenkichi is also very Abnormal. He listens on quietly as Maguro explains that Zenkichi is a Normal, and still very capable. When Medaka declares that Zenkichi is the guy she likes, Akune is depressed.[85] When Munakata pulls out a rocket launcher, Akune is shocked.[86] He is horrified when Zenkichi is impaled by Munakata.[87] Akune is surprised to see Medaka drop to her knees.[88] As Munakata moves towards them, he prepares to fight. He is stopped by Maguro however, who tells him and Kikaijima to take Medaka and leave. Akune is shocked to hear that Maguro wrote up the draft for the current Flask Plan.[89] He is startled to see Zenkichi rise to his feet.[90] He watches on as Medaka repeats Zenkichi's name.[91] He is surprised at the strength of Zenkichi's stomp.[92] After Munakata collapses, Akune suggests they turn him over to the authorities.[93] Akune is surprised at hearing Zenkichi's declaration that Munakata is not a killer.[94] He is appalled when he realizes that Maguro was unaware of Munakata's pacifism.[95]\n\nAkune puts Koga in a chokehold\nAkune puts Koga in a chokehold.\n\nThe Student Council heads down to the third floor, a zoo.[96] After hearing that Kikaijima hates animals, he wonders if she even knows what \"cute\" means. He moves on, and comes across Youka Naze. He remembers her as his former classmate, and states he was sure she was a part of the Flask Plan as soon as he heard of it. After hearing her deal, he rejects it without hesitation. He is shocked when Itami Koga drops down from the ceiling and wraps a wire around his neck.[97] Despite being caught off guard, Akune manages to stop Koga's attack with his hands; wondering if his life just flashed before his eyes. He is startled when the way behind him is sealed off by Naze.[98] He marks no remark as Naze explains why she isolated, but is horrified when she summons a pack of animals to attack him.[99] Akune stares down Naze's pack of animals, and tells Naze that animals have never liked him much. As the animals attack, Akune cries out and stomps, combining Zenkichi's and Kikaijima's techniques to blow the animals away. He then tells Naze she was mistaken to seal him in a confined area. He is surprised to discover Koga lurking above him, and barely dodges her kick. He is then put on the defensive as she begins to furiously attack him. He then drops to his back, and manages to catch Koga in a chokehold. He is horrified when Koga somehow manages to grab his neck, and rise to her feet with Akune still holding her. She then throws him off. Akune shakily holds his ground, and prepares to continue fighting.[100]\n\nAkune breaks Koga's leg\nAkune breaks Koga's leg.\n\nAkune declares himself a Heisei Rider fan. When Koga attacks, he dodges her kick, but the force of the strike breaks the floor, sending him tumbling down.[101] He lands with a roll and rises to his feet, remarking that the fourth floor looks like a surgery room. Staring at Naze, he looks away, embarrassed, when she tells him not to stare at her underwear. He expresses his surprise that the physically poor Naze was in Class 11. When Koga explodes through the floor, he is amazed to hear that her kick reached all the way down to the sixth floor. As Akune intercepts Koga, he thinks to himself that he is glad he got separated from the others, as they would probably be disgusted by his actions. He then breaks Koga's leg. When Naze remarks that he hasn't changed much after all, he refutes her, claiming that before he met Medaka, such an act would have given him some pleasure; now, it just leaves a bad taste in his mouth. He is concerned when Naze refuses to treat Koga, and is caught off guard when Koga attacks him from behind. He is surprised when Maguro appears. He asks Maguro if he has come to help him, but is distressed to hear that the others have gone on without him.[102]\n\nAkune puts Koga in a four point pin\nAkune puts Koga in a four point pin.\n\nFacing down Koga and Naze, Akune tells Maguro not to underestimate them just because they're girls.[103] Hearing that Maguro even considers boys still in elementary school as his sisters, Akune is horrified. He is amazed when Maguro faints from hearing that Naze does not wear a bra. He then helps Maguro into a sitting position. Maguro then wishes Akune the best for round two. Akune is surprised that Maguro isn't going to fight, and is caught in a sleeper hold by Koga while distracted. When Koga herself is distracted by Maguro, Akune uses the opening to dislocate her shoulder.[104] He is notably put off by Koga's cries of pain, but is stunned when Koga rises to her feet. He is further surprised when Naze removes her skirt, and wonders at her animosity towards Maguro. Maguro then gives Akune a hint, asking the younger boy what his other options are aside from breaking bones and knocking out. As Koga moves in close to finish him, Akune frantically tries to make sense of Maguro's hint. Coming to a conclusion based on what he has seen of Koga's abilities, he uses a four point pin. Akune reveals that the pin is meant to tire her out; as she struggles to get free, Akune explains that he figured out that her enhanced body uses up an incredible amount of energy. He compares her to Ultraman, as opposed to Kamen Rider, as she actually has a time limit on how long she can fight. He finishes by explaining that his pin has no ends; it negates the victim's physical strength, making it impossible to escape.[105] He is surprised when Maguro asks Naze to remove the bandages covering her face instead of her top, and is further surprised when Naze consents.[106] Upon seeing Naze's face, Akune is surprised by how beautiful she is. He thinks that Naze looks like somebody, then turns to Maguro. He is shocked to see Maguro's expression, and is further shocked when Maguro concedes to Naze's demands. He is told to get off of Koga by Naze, which he does. Akune stands by Maguro as the older boy calls out to Naze, calling her Kujira Kurokami.[107] Listening to Maguro's impassioned speech, Akune finds he can no longer tell whether Maguro is a pervert or not.[108] He is surprised when Naze runs to Maguro.[109] After Naze stabs Maguro with a syringe, Akune demands to know what she injected Maguro with.[110] He is surprised when Medaka kicks through the wall of Naze's lab.[111]\n\nAkune tries to make Koga see reason\nThe Akune tries to make Koga see reason.\n\nAkune watches Medaka confront Naze, thinking that the two look identical except for their eyes.[112] He is surprised to see Medaka attack her sister without hesitation. Akune supports Maguro as Naze explains the \"Normalize Liquid\". When Naze smiles for the first time, Akune is deeply disturbed. He is shocked to when Medaka injects herself with the Normalize Liquid. Realizing he is too weak to stop Naze and Koga together, Akune appeals to Koga, asking her to put a stop to Naze's rampage as her friend. However, his efforts are for naught.[113] When Naze tosses Medaka another syringe, claiming it is the antidote, Akune warns Medaka that it is most likely a trap. When Medaka collapses again, Akune demands to know whether Naze is still unaffected by Medaka's efforts. He is stunned when he realizes that Medaka's feelings did not reach her at all. Akune is stunned when Medaka is revealed to have lost her memories.[114] Akune tries to talk with Medaka, only for her to call him \"Toshima\". He tries to convince Koga not to fight, as she is clearly past her limits as well. When Medaka's declares her intention to fight, Akune is relived, believing that Medaka is still the same even without her memories.[115] A short while after, a defeated Akune is seen collapsed by some rubble. He angrily insists that Medaka would have won with her Abnormality, and is surprised to hear that Medaka's Abnormality has already returned.[116] When Koga jumps down to the sixth floor with Naze and Medaka, Maguro makes to follow, but Akune stops him before he can hurt himself. He tells Maguro they need to meet up with the others if they want to have a chance at saving Medaka.[117]\n\nZenkichi and Akune argue\nZenkichi and Akune argue.\n\nAfter meeting up with the rest of the Student Council, Akune slams Zenkichi up against a wall for suggesting they regroup above ground. Akune cannot say anything when Zenkichi insists they have to think of the entire student body, not just Medaka.[118] Akune is surprised by the arrival of the Loser Team. He thinks to himself that Unzen has no business acting high and mighty.[119] Akune is startled when Zenkichi starts crying. Everyone is put out when Nabeshima suggests they use the elevator.[120] The Student Council and the Loser Team gather outside the elevator.[121] With the arrival of the Plus Six, Unzen orders the Student Council to take the stairs.[122] The Student Council run for the stairs.[123] The Student Council arrives at the twelfth floor. They are all surprised to see that the level appears to be an arcade. Akune is shocked to see an unconscious Medaka on the ground, and runs to her side. He listens with the others to Medaka's story of how she escaped. After \"Medaka\" asks to borrow Zenkichi's jacket however, the Student Council realize that the person in front of them cannot be the exhibitionist Medaka.[124] Watching Mizou Yukuhashi shape shift, Akune asks if that is Yukuhashi's Abnormality. Akune and the others are shocked when Yukuhashi admits to being uninterested in the Flask Plan, and is only participating to observe Oudo Miyakonojou .[125] After listening to Yukuhashi, Akune collapses due to the effects of Yukuhashi's knockout gas.[126][127][128][129][130]\n\nAkune attacks Oudo\nAkune attacks Oudo.\n\nAkune attacks Oudo from behind as Zenkichi defends Kikaijima. He grabs on to Oudo; believing that Oudo's Abnormality is control over gravity, he expects Oudo won't try to use his power in a way that could harm himself. Akune is proven wrong however, as Oudo blows him back.[131] He is shocked when Maguro reveals that Oudo's Abnormality allows him to control minds.[132] Akune says nothing when Oudo asks the Student Council if any of them have ever wanted Medaka to change.[133] Akune is shocked by the arrival of Medaka, now going by the moniker Medaka II. [134] He is horrified when Medaka II tells the Student Council that from now on, they will support the Flask Plan, and she will be joining the Thirteen Party.[135] Akune and the others try and make her see reason; when they refuse to go along with her, she dismisses all three of them.[136] They are not disheartened however, and instead decide that they will go along with the wishes of the old Medaka.[137] Akune and the others are driven to their knees when Medaka II use Oudo's Weighted Words on them.[138] When Zenkichi kicks Medaka II, Akune is amazed that he can still move.[139] Akune tells Kikaijima to calm down when Zenkichi takes a kick to the throat.[140] The pair watch on as Zenkichi manages to make a clean hit.[141] Akune is shocked when Medaka II punches Zenkichi in the throat.[142] He is delighted when Medaka returns to her original personality.[143]\n\nThe Student Council and the Thirteen Party in the elevator\nThe Student Council and the Thirteen Party in the elevator.\n\nAkune listens on as Medaka declares her intent to rid the school of the Flask Plan.[144] He follows the others down to the thirteenth floor.[145][146] Akune listens on as Oudo describes the merits of the Flask Plan.[147] Hearing Medaka describe the \"nightmare\" of a complete person she has met before, Akune says nothing.[148] He is surprised when Oudo attacks Koga.[149] Akune is alarmed when Oudo sends Medaka flying, realizing that Oudo is not possessed of Koga's weaknesses.[150] He is disturbed to hear Oudo brush off Yukuhashi's collapse as no big loss.[151] Akune is worried as he sees Medaka can't dodge Oudo's attacks even with her reflexes, and is even more concerned by how effectively Oudo has absorbed Koga's abilities.[152] Akune calls out to Maguro, asking him to help Medaka by giving her advice.[153] Akune looks on as Oudo tries to take Medaka's Abnormality.[154] He is surprised to see Oudo bow to Medaka.[155] He helps Medaka delete the data from the Flask Plan computers. Akune helps Naze support Koga after the fighting is over, and stands near the pair when they all gather in the elevator.[156] He is horrified to find the defeated Loser Team and Plus Six.[157]\n\nKumagawa Incident Arc\nAkune tells Nabeshima she was the only one who played dead\nAkune tells Nabeshima she was the only one who played dead.\n\nAkune is surprised by Kumagwa's claim to be his own younger twin brother, Yuki Kumagawa.[158] As Kumagawa taunts Zenkichi, Akune tries to stop him. Kumagawa merely shifts his attention to Akune, cheerily reminding his former subordinate of his time as the Destroyer, deeply upsetting Akune.[159] Watching Kumagawa, Akune is disgusted to see that he has not changed at all. Akune stands by as Kumagawa addresses the group.[160] He is appalled when Kumagawa drives a screw through his own head. [161] Akune is surprised to see that Nabeshima is alright, but tells her she is the only one who choose to play dead while everyone else fought.[162]\n\nHitomi reveals herself as Zenkichi's mother\nHitomi introduces herself as Zenkichi's mother.\n\nAkune writes Activity Report Number 2054, concerning the inspection of the Flask Plan carried out on July fifth. Akune reports that the Flask Plan labs have been dismantled, and reopened for the student body as a recreational facility. The researchers and the Thirteen Party have been disbanded, though several members have been hospitalized due to encountering Kumagawa. The core members, Oudo and Yukuhashi, have both withdrawn from the school, while Maguro and Naze are currently taking care of Koga in the old school building. As for the rest of Class 13, they have left after news of the Flask Plan's halt was spread throughout the academy (using Twitter). Walking through the halls, Akune meets Hitomi Hitoyoshi, whose roller shoes are in violation of school policy. He demands her name, and is surprised to hear it.[163] Akune arrives late to the Student Council's office, having been speaking with Zenkichi's \"little sister\". Akune is stunned when he finds out Hitomi is actually Zenkichi's mother. Akune has trouble believing that Hitomi is a doctor, but is amazed when Hitomi manages to alter Medaka's uniform. When Zenkichi begins complaining to his mother for showing up at school, Akune suggests he stop, worried about how Medaka or Kikaijima might react. Watching mother and son interact, Akune thinks to himself that he can see where Zenkichi's caring nature came from.[164] Akune arrives at the Ghost Babel with Medaka and Kikaijima, where he finds Mukae Emukae attacking Maguro and Naze. After Emukae retreats, the Kurokami siblings and the Student Council sit down to discuss how to counter Kumagawa. Akune worries that if they aren't careful, things will turn out the same way they did three years ago.[165][166] Akune later joins with the rest of the Student Council, Naze, Koga, and Hitomi to discuss how they should handle the Minuses. He remarks that they have been fortunate to find out their objective so soon, but that they still need to move quickly. Akune admits that Nabeshima might help them if they ask, but everyone silently agrees that she is a coward. Like everyone else, he is surprised to hear of the former Student Council president preceding Medaka, Kuudou Hinokage. Akune is especially surprised to hear that he wasn't called Mister Unknown.[167] When Medaka and Naze return, Akune has already forgotten about Hinokage. He is surprised by Hinokage's sudden appearance. He fails Hinokage's examination.[168] He and Zenkichi are upset to be labeled as unqualified to fight Class -13. The two are horrified when Kikaijima slaps Hinokage.[169] Akune agrees to Hinokage's Devilize Training camp.[170]\n\nThe Student Council hit with Scar Dead\nThe Student Council hit with Scar Dead.\n\nOne week later, at the end of the semester, Akune is present for Medaka's speech. He is surprised by Kumagawa's sudden entrance.[171][172] Zenkichi asks Akune about the rules Kumagawa is bringing up. Akune demands to see Kumagawa's signatures.[173] He is disturbed to meet Class -13.[174] Trying to decipher Kumagawa's objective, Akune realizes he wants to call Class 13 to the school.[175] Akune is relieved when Medaka manages to turn the situation around.[176] After Medaka declares a Student Council battle with Kumagawa, the Student Council meet with their allies to decide what to do.[177] Akune and Kikaijima are surprised by Naze's and Medaka's back and forth.[178] When Maguro asks why Zenkichi is not present, Akune explains that he has gone to the cafeteria.[179] After discussing their options, the group decides to throw the General Affairs Manager's Battle, and use the two weeks to complete the Devilize Training.[180][181] On July twenty-fifth, during the General Affairs Manager's Battle, Akune and Kikaijima take part in the Devilize Training with Hinokage and Maguro. They ask Medaka to cheer for Zenkichi in their stead.[182] In the midst of their training, the group are attacked by Shibuki Shibushi, Gagamaru Chougasaki, and Emukae.[183] Akune and Kikaijima plead with Hinokage not to sacrifice himself for their sakes.[184] After Hinokage's declaration that he will protect them, Shibushi seriously injures Akune and the others.[185][186] The other members from the Student Council arrive in the parking lot, and treat Akune and the others at Naze's lab before sending them to the hospital.[187] Naze's examination reveals that, though Akune is covered in wounds, his clothing is undamaged.[188] After the Treasurer's Battle, both Akune and Kikaijima are released from the hospital. Maguro sends them on a mission to help prepare for the President's Battle.[189] On August twenty-second, Akune and Kikaijima arrive on the rooftop Medaka and Kumagawa are fighting on, explaining they are the one's responsible for the crowd cheering for Medaka, having gathered the group on Maguro's orders.[190] With Medaka's victory declared, Akune and the others run to congratulate her.[191] He is stunned when Medaka offers Kumagawa the position of vice-president.[192] With Kumagawa, the Student Council is completed.[193]\n\nKurokami Medaka's Successor Arc\nAfter seeing Akune in action during the Treasure Hunt, Shori Wanizuka begins calling him the \"August Destroyer\" (破壊深, Haikaishin) as a sign of respect.\n\nUnknown Shiranui Arc\nOne plus one is a smile\nOne plus one is a smile.\n\nAlong with Nabeshima, Akune faces Medaka in a two-on-one Judo match. The match ends in a tie, and as the three towel off, Akune congratulates Medaka on her engagement. When Medaka asks if he heard about Zenkichi's proposal from Shiranui though, he does not know who she is talking about.[194] As Zenkichi hovers near death, Akune's voice is one of the many that gives him encouragement.[195] He is also one of the people he remembers before preparing to fight Iihiko Shishime.[196] At the end of the academic year, Akune is among the students present at the Hakoniwa Academy graduation ceremony.[197] He applauds Kumagawa at the conclusion of his speech.[198] He joins his friends for a group photo after the ceremony ends.[199]\n\nBouquet Toss To The Future Arc\nAkune (in his Student Council Uniform) and members of several generations of the Student Council confront Medaka as part of the 100 Flowers Run in the Student Council office. He tells her that they will be going all out against her.[200] His message to Medaka is to tell her to remain splendid.[201] Come April of the new school year, Akune is present at the entrance ceremony for Zenkichi's speech and the introduction of the new chair. He is delighted to see the academy's new chairwoman is none other than Medaka.\")\nAbilities: (\"Technique Mimicry: Akune is a Special and one of the school's many scholarship students. His ability is being able to copy the skills of other people, but to a lesser extent. He was able to successfully use both Zenkichi's stomp and Kikaijima's scream; what's more, he was able to use both at the same time.\" + \"Combat Expert: A second dan in judo, Akune is known as the \"Prince of Judo\" (柔道の王子様, Jūdō no Ōji-sama) and was the star of the Judo Club due to his natural fighting abilities. Though he isn't as skilled with judo as Nabeshima, like his upperclassman, Akune can also hold his own against Abnormals.\" + \"Secretarial Skills: Akune has beautiful handwriting.\")"

Her project name is Black White (黒い包帯ブラックホワイト, Burakku Howaito). She later becomes the vice-president of Zenkichi Hitoyoshi's Student Council. She is the child of Kajiki Kurokami and Nashi Kurokami, and the middle of Kajiki's three children; younger than Maguro Kurokami, but older than Medaka Kurokami.\nAlias: (\"Black White\" + \"Demon Queen\" + \"Naze With Nothing\" + \"People Remodeler\")\nAge: (\"16\")\nGender: (\"Female\")\nBlood Type: (\"AB\")\nMentality: (\"Abnormal\" + \"Minus\")\nSchool: (\"Hakoniwa Academy\")\nYear: (\"Junior-Senior\")\nClass: (\"Class 13\")\nAffiliation: (\"Zenkichi's Student Council\")\nPosition: (\"Vice-President\")\nPrevious Affiliation: (\"Thirteen Party\" + \"Medaka's Student Council\" + \"True Flask Plan\" + \"Previous Position\" + \"Flask Plan Supervisor\" + \"Head of the Fourth Floor\" + \"Stand-In Secretary\")\nPersonality: (\"When she was young she believed that the best geniuses came from a hell-like environment and she grew up hating her great life because of it. She is a extreme stoic (doesn't show her true emotions) and likes to study. She is intelligent about Biology which allows her to modify bodies. Even thought she had a great life, she wanted to live in a deeper hell so she ran away from home and changed her name. Because she wanted it, she was bullied in Class 11 which is where she met Itami Koga whom she loves as a friend. However, she does seem to have a slight weakness of boasting, shown during the fight between Zenkichi and Misogi Kumagawa where she repeatedly extols the magnificence of the person who trained Zenkichi for the fight (i.e. herself) and comparing the result as being far more successful then what her brother could have achieved. She does however exhibit some personality traits of a Minus: when provided with the opportunity, she nearly betrayed her comrades to help Kumagawa, before remembering that she cared about them. Recently, she has also taken up Medaka's habit of sending Maguro flying into a wall every time he hugs her.\n\nAppearance\nNaze With Her Arms Crossed\nNaze with her arms crossed.\n\nNaze has shoulder-length purple hair and red eyes. She often keeps her head wrapped in bandages, exposing only her eyes and mouth, with a dagger sticking out of her forehead. Beneath the bandages, she is noted to have a pretty face, and in place of the knife is a band-aid. She wears a skin tight black suit beneath Hakoniwa Academy's girl's uniform. She does not wear a bra, and keeps her arms crossed constantly to hold up her breasts. She wears two pairs of panties, one on top of her black suit, and a second pair beneath it. When with the other members of the Thirteen Party, Naze tends to wear a black cloak, and adjusts her bandages to cover her mouth. During the battle to decide the academy's new Student Council, Naze wears the Student Council's Battle Attire Red Model. When dressed casually, Naze keeps her knife and bandages, but wears a flower-patterned scarf, a dark, short-sleeved jacket over a light, long-sleeved shirt, a matching skirt, and leggings. After joining Zenkichi's Student Council, Naze now wears a black version of her original uniform. She continues to wear her black bodysuit, but no longer wears her facial gear. The blue armband signifying her as the Vice-President is worn around her left arm. Ten years later, Naze wears a lab coat with a black vest over a white dress and tights.\n\nWhile younger, Naze wore a long-sleeved, light green hoodie, black shorts, and brown and white shoes. While in middle school, she wore a short-sleeved. white collared shirt, along with a beige vest and a black skirt. She covered her head with a paper bag, with a single eye hole for her left eye.\n\nHistory\nThe Kurokami siblings in their younger years\nThe Kurokami siblings in their younger years.\n\nAs a child, Naze (then Kujira) was not as well known as her siblings, preferring to stay inside for the sake of her human experiments. In the field of biology, she stood head and shoulders above Medaka. She never went to school, never played, never went outside, but remained behind her desk all day, working. She forsook all luxuries, and believed that she could only create something brilliant by torturing herself. Because of this mindset, she hated the fact that she was born into prosperous circumstances. She would often fly into rages over her circumstances, only to be comforted afterwards by her siblings. However, even this familial love was no more than baggage to her. On her eleventh birthday, she ran away from home and never returned, leaving only a note with the words: \"If I'm only going to be happy, then I'm better off dead.\"[1] Around this time, Kujira erased her own memories, discarding all traces of her former life and taking the name Youka Naze.[2] Naze first met Koga in their final year of middle school.[3] During middle school, Naze was always picked on. Due to her overwhelming personality, everyone was afraid of her. However, Koga alone approached her, and asked that they do something crazy together.[4]\n\nPlot\nThirteen Party Arc\nHakama and six members of the Thirteen Party\nNaze and five other members of the Thirteen Party.\n\nAfter Medaka leaves Hakama Shiranui's office, Naze and five other members of the Thirteen Party make their presence known.[5] Questioned by Hakama of her opinion of Medaka, Naze states she has nothing to say on the matter.[6] As Hakama details the history of the Flask Plan, culminating with his belief that the project has reached the final step with the present incarnation of the Thirteen Party, Naze listens on without comment.[7]\n\nThe cute Naze and her cute BFF\nThe cute Naze and her cute BFF.\n\nNaze calls out to Kouki Akune as he explores the third floor zoo. She asks him not to call the others, as she wishes to speak with him alone. She is honored to hear that he remembers her, then offers Akune a deal: if the Student Council leave the school, she will see to it that they can go to any other school they want, proposing that the Student Council and the Flask Plan stay out of each others' business.[8] She watches without expression as Koga prepares to strangle Akune.[9] Naze watches as Koga's attack on Akune fails. She mockingly acts impressed with his performance, before sealing Akune off from the rest of the Student Council. She and Koga then introduce themselves. She reveals that she purposely isolated Akune because, unlike the ever changing Medaka or unchanging Zenkichi, Akune has been the most changed by Medaka. She then summons a pack of animals to attack Akune.[10] Naze explains to Akune how dangerous animals are with just their claws and fangs, then orders them to attack.[11] She is surprised when Akune uses Zenkichi's and Mogana Kikaijima's techniques to blow the animals away. She congratulates him on defeating all her animals in only one shot, but tells him he has neglected the most dangerous animal present.[12] Naze then reveals that in a closed space, Koga is nearly invincible, and that if Shigusa Takachiho is the strongest man in the Thirteen Party, Koga is the strongest woman.[13] When Akune manages to catch Koga in a chokehold, Naze sarcastically expresses her admiration, but chides him for trying to win by making his opponent submit. She then explains that Koga is an android; as Naze's specialty is remodeling people, she has completely reworked Koga's body.[14]\n\nNaze crash lands\nNaze crash lands.\n\nWhen Koga's kick breaks the floor, Naze chides her for using so much force, even as she is sent tumbling down.[15] As she falls head first, Naze remarks that Koga only survived surgery because her desire to be Abnormal was abnormal. Naze then comments that, as the intellectual type, if she hits her head, she might die. She lands on a bed, with her legs over her head, and her underwear exposed. She tells Akune that the fourth floor is her lab, and tells him not to stare at her underwear.[16] After Akune breaks Koga's leg, Naze expresses her amazement that he immediately changed his style after hearing about Koga's enhanced body. She then remarks that Akune hasn't changed as much as she expected. When Akune tells her to treat Koga, Naze refuses. After Koga gets back up, she explains to the fallen Akune that Koga's healing rate has been accelerated as well. She then tells Koga to finish Akune of, as the experiment is over: the Koga Naze created is stronger than the Akune Medaka created. She is surprised when Maguro appears behind her, lifting up her skirt. Listening to Maguro explain himself, she does not believe him, and theorizes that Maguro came to see what his successor was like. When Maguro declares that wherever there are girls wearing panties, he will be there, Naze tells him that almost all girls in the world are wearing panties.[17]\n\nNaze removes her skirt\nNaze removes her skirt.\n\nListening to Maguro's intentions, Naze is unimpressed, declaring the only way her predecessor is superior to her is in the number of years he has lived. She gives Maguro her name, then agrees to his conditions should Akune manage to defeat Koga.[18] When Koga gets Akune in a sleeper hold, Naze notes that he'll lose consciousness quickly.[19] After Akune dislocates Koga's shoulder, Naze is surprised by his brutality. When Maguro asks if she is concerned for her friend, she replies in the negative, stating Koga is as amazing as they come. Naze does concede a point to Maguro however, and removes her skirt. When Maguro advises Akune, a worried Naze tells Koga to end things quickly.[20] After Koga is pinned, Naze is amazed that Maguro was able to recognize Koga's weakness so quickly. She begins to remove her top, but is stopped by Maguro, who asks her to remove the bandages covering her face instead. Naze concedes, telling Koga that while she isn't worried about her, Koga is still her important friend. She then removes her facial wrappings.[21] With her bandages removed, Naze expresses her discomfort at having her face revealed; claiming that her bandages attract less attention. When Maguro tells her to put her skirt back on, she tells him to put on his trousers first. When they are both redressed, she asks Akune to get off of Koga, and hands over the Flask Plan's experimental data on both of them. As Koga apologizes, Naze tells her not to worry about it, and the pair begins to leave. Maguro calls out to Naze however, calling her Kujira Kurokami.[22] After listening to Maguro's impassioned speech, Naze runs to his embrace with tears in her eyes. This is only a ruse however, as she uses this opportunity to inject him with a syringe. She then reveals that she erased all her memoires of her life before the past six years. When Akune demands to know what she injected Maguro with, she replies that she doesn't know, but that by destroying her own brother, she will become even more miserable, and thus be able to create something even more amazing. She is surprised when Medaka kicks through the wall of her lab.[23]\n\nNaze smiles for the first time\nNaze smiles for the first time.\n\nMedaka asks Naze if she is really her enemy, to which Naze answers positively. Medaka then punches Naze in the head, knocking her down and stealing her syringe. When asked what kind of poison is in the syringe, Naze explains that it is actually \"Normalize Liquid\", a substance that turns an Abnormal into a Normal. Medaka demands that Naze hand over the antidote. Naze agrees on the condition that Medaka becomes a guinea pig herself; Medaka injects herself. Medaka collapses, and Naze orders Koga to break the arms and legs of her siblings and carry them to another lab.[24] Naze is surprised when Medaka rises and stops Koga's attack.[25] Observing Medaka's personality, Naze decides to perform another experiment. Naze tosses Medaka another syringe, claiming it is the antidote. After Medaka injects herself and collapses again, Naze is amused that she would be foolish enough to be tricked so easily. She then reveals that the syringe possessed a formula that erases memories; Medaka is now bereft of both her Abnormality and her personality.[26] Naze watches as Koga readies herself to fight the Medaka.[27] After Koga defeats Medaka, Akune, and Maguro, Naze orders her to stop. She reveals that Medaka's Abnormality has already returned, but it seems her personality (still gone with her memories) is more important. Naze then reveals she plans to rewrite Medaka's personality with the help of Oudo Miyakonojou. Koga jumps down to the sixth floor with Naze and Medaka, and Naze bids her brother farewell.[28]\n\nMedaka II with Naze and Koga\nMedaka II with Naze and Koga.\n\nOn the thirteenth floor, Naze observes a restrained Medaka with Koga. Recovering her head, she wonders how they should delay the Student Council long enough to brainwash Medaka. She is shocked by the arrival of the Plus Six.[29] Naze wonders to herself whether the chairman gave them some incentive to show up, but decides it doesn't matter, as there is no way the Student Council can escape now.[30] Naze watches on as Medaka regains consciousness, and advises her to stay put and recover.[31] She follows Medaka up to the twelfth floor.[32] When Oudo question why she brought Medaka upstairs, Naze replies that she had no way of stopping her.[33] Naze listens as Medaka II states her intention to join the Flask Plan.[34] As Medaka II hands herself over to the care of Thirteen Party, Naze expects the Student Council will lose the will to fight after being so abruptly dismissed from their positions.[35] She is surprised to see Medaka II use Oudo's Weighted Words on the Student Council.[36] As Maguro calls out to Medaka II, Naze listens on.[37] Naze watches on as Zenkichi and Medaka II fight.[38] She is stunned to see Medaka II use her own syringes in conjunction with Kei Munakata's skills with hidden weapons.[39] Naze grows concerned when Zenkichi manages to make a clean hit.[40] She frowns when Medaka II stops dodging Zenkichi's kicks.[41] Naze is surprised when Medaka II punches Zenkichi in the throat. She says nothing when Maguro agrees to rejoin the Flask Plan.[42] Naze is surprised when she sees sparks coming out of Medaka II's hands. Realizing Medaka II is trying to brainwash herself, Naze worries that she will only succeed in wiping her mind clean.[43] After Medaka returns to normal, Naze theorizes that she somehow learned Yukuhashi's Abnormality as well, and was able to regain her old self by absorbing Zenkichi's thoughts of her.[44]\n\nNaze tends to Koga\nNaze tends to Koga.\n\nNaze listens on as Medaka declares her intent to rid the school of the Flask Plan.[45] She follows Oudo down to the thirteenth floor, and offers Medaka what she claims to be painkillers. She is amused when Medaka refuses, and asks her if she has learnt to doubt people. Naze has nothing to say when Medaka tells her she still believes the two of them will one day be able to see eye to eye.[46] Naze listens without comment as Medaka tells the remaining members of the Thirteen Party that it is impossible to create a perfect human.[47] Naze is horrified when Oudo pierces Koga through the heart.[48] Naze cries over the fallen Koga, and begs Maguro for help, claiming that Koga is more important to her than her policy.[49] Naze frets over Koga as she and her brother work to save her life. Maguro insists that Naze promise not to actively try and make herself miserable anymore, to which Naze quickly agrees.[50] At Maguro's prompting, Naze explains Medaka's Abnormality. She explains how Medaka has taken full control of her War God Mode, and now stands before them in Altered God Mode. Naze finishes her explanation by labeling Medaka's Abnormality as The End.[51] Naze says nothing when Medaka insists that she is not a perfect human.[52] Naze is surprised to see Oudo bow to Medaka.[53] She helps support Koga after the fighting is over, and continues to support her when they all gather in the elevator.[54] She is horrified to find the defeated Loser Team and Plus Six.[55]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nKumagawa Incident Arc\nNaze in a maid outfit\nNaze in a maid outfit.\n\nNaze asks Zenkichi about Kumagawa, but is surprised to see Zenkichi trembling.[56] Naze stands by as Kumagawa addresses the group.[57][58] After Kumagawa leaves, Naze talks to Medaka about him, pointing out that he is wearing the uniform of Suisou Academy, but notes that the school closed the previous month.[59] After the Flask Plan is stopped, Naze and Maguro begin taking care of Koga in the old school building.[60] Naze, now wearing a maid outfit (having promised to do whatever Maguro asked), recommends that Koga undergo rehabilitation for three years, though Maguro tells her he will be able to speed up the process. Naze is surprised by the arrival of Mukae Emukae.[61] Naze tells Maguro to take Koga and flee, citing that neither of them are combat types, and that Koga is in no condition to fight. She is not impressed by Maguro's introduction, though she is surprised when Emukae follows his joke. Naze does not feel comfortable introducing herself as Black White after Maguro and Emukae's foolery. Naze is amazed to realize that Kumagawa has taken control of his fellow classmates after only a single day.[62] Naze chides Maguro for not fighting seriously, and not putting more strength into his chop.[63] Naze intercepts Emukae's attack on Maguro, and sacrifices her facial wrappings to knock Emukae back. Pulling out her syringes, she notes that Emukae is not the combat type herself. When Emukae retreats, Naze decides it is better to let her go. As the group gathers to discuss how to counter Kumagawa, Naze tells Maguro to put some clothes on.[64] She listens to the discussion without comment.[65]\n\nNaze threatens Medaka\nNaze threatens Medaka.\n\nNaze later joins with the Student Council, Koga, and Hitomi Hitoyoshi to discuss how they should handle the Minuses. When Zenkichi suggests they team up with the Public Morals Committee, Naze shoots the idea down, claiming that the Enforcers will be no use until Myouri Unzen gets out of the hospital. Like everyone else, she is surprised to hear of the former Student Council president preceding Medaka, Kuudou Hinokage.[66] Naze and Medaka leave together to find Hinokage. Naze questions why she has to come with Medaka, only to be annoyed by Medaka's behavior. Arriving at Class 13's senior classroom, Naze is confused to find it empty. She looks for Hinokage upon Medaka's direction.[67] Upon finding him, she is surprised by his size, and his friendly demeanor.[68] After Hinokage leaves, Naze wonders why Medaka had so much faith in him.[69] Medaka tells Naze about Hinokage's Abnormality. Naze asks why she is not happy about Hinokage fighting Kumagawa, as Medaka came to ask for his help anyway.[70] Medaka and Naze continue to wait for Hinokage. Medaka tells Naze that they will forget Hinokage if they left the room. Medaka calmly says that they must wait for Hinokage to return safely, but Naze sees that she is worrying, and her tightly clenched fists are bleeding. Naze is surprised by Hinokage's return.[71] Naze and Medaka return, to find everyone has already forgotten about Hinokage.[72][73][74] Naze explains the problem with fighting Class -13, using the Flask Plan's Plus Six as an example.[75]\n\nStudent Council's Battle Attire Red Model\nThe Student Council's Battle Attire Red Model.\n\nAfter Medaka declares a Student Council battle with Kumagawa, the Student Council meet with their allies to decide what to do.[76] Naze states she does not want to spend her summer at school, then offers to fill in the vice-president's position.[77] On July twenty-fifth, Naze and the other ladies change in the Student Council office, Naze reading through the schedule of matches. They discuss whether Zenkichi will be alright; when Zenkichi shows up, Naze wonders if he has really been training under someone greater than her brother. Arriving at the meeting place, they are surprised to find Kumagawa is the only one present.[78] Naze expresses her pleasure that Tokemichi Choujabaru will be the one overseeing their battle with Class -13.[79] Choujabaru leads the Student Council and Kumagawa to the Viper's Den, a pit on the school grounds.[80] Choujabaru explains the nature of the battlefield, and the rules of the match.[81] As Zenkichi prepares to begin his fight with Kumagawa, Naze wonders once again who has been training him.[82][83] Seeing Zenkichi performance against Kumagawa, Naze declares that they should all respect whoever trained him. The others see through her ruse, and Naze admits to having trained Zenkichi herself (after threatening him). Naze explains the first part of her Minus Nullify System.[84] Naze and Medaka discuss the mechanics behind the Minus Nullify System.[85] Naze orders Zenkichi to make Kumagawa surrender. She is shocked when Kumagawa does so.[86][87] Seeing Zenkichi panic, Naze yells at him to shut his eyes to reset the situation.[88] Medaka asks Naze if there is anything Zenkichi can do. Naze asks in turn why Medaka never told her about Kumagawa's All Fiction.[89] As Zenkichi struggles, Naze calls out encouragement to him. She is shocked to hear Kumagawa suggest he can make nothing itself nothing.[90] She is impressed when Zenkichi refuses to break even in the face of Kumagawa's temptation.[91] Naze is pleased when Zenkichi regains himself and repels Kumagawa once again.[92] She is amazed by Zenkichi's ploy, recognizing that even Kumagawa will not be able to handle the vipers' venom.[93]\n\nNaze agrees to join Class -13\nNaze agrees to join Class -13.\n\nNaze is surprised when Kumagawa regains consciousness, and to learn that All Fiction negates even his own death.[94] She is relieved to see Zenkichi awaken,[95] but shocked to see Kumagawa's smile drop.[96] Naze is horrified to learn that the other Minuses are attacking the rest of the Student Council during their training.[97] The Student Council arrive in the parking lot head to the parking lot to help their allies. They find them with worse injuries than Zenkichi; they treat the others at Naze's lab before sending them to the hospital. Afterward, Medaka, Zenkichi, Hitomi, Naze, and Koga meet to decide what they will do next. Naze suggests substitutes, but quickly runs out of patience with the depressed Medaka and leaves.[98] Walking through the hallways, Naze and Koga are intercepted by Kumagawa. Naze tells Koga to leave the two of them alone. In Class -13's classroom, Kumagawa invites Naze to join him. Naze initially refuses, but changes her mind after Kumagawa promises to make her the most unfortunate person in the world.[99][100] Naze first takes a look at Class -13's roster, and is impressed by the Minuses Kumagawa has gathered, by one individual in particular. After thinking about the Student Council however, Naze realizes she cannot betray them and makes to leave. She is stopped by Shibuki Shibushi, who reveals Koga is under attack. Naze begs to Kumagawa to stop, but he hands her his cellphone.[101] Hearing that Medaka has saved Koga, Naze agrees to stick with her, and declares she will crush Shibushi.[102]\n\nNaze negates Shibushi's fully powered Scar Dead\nNaze negates Shibushi's fully powered Scar Dead.\n\nMedaka expresses her distress that Naze wants to fight in the Secretary's Battle.[103] Naze insists that even someone as terrible as her does not want to be considered a Minus.[104] One week later, on the first of August, the opposing Student Councils meet for the Secretary's Battle.[105] Choujabaru confirms her status as a substitute with Naze, then asks Shibushi to choose the match. He explains that the Secretary's Battle will be a match to strip the opponent.[106] The group moves to the stage of the battle, a freezer in the school's canteen. Naze immediately begins asking about the rules of the match.[107] Naze follows Shibushi into the freezer, to be attacked right away. Naze reveals she has somehow stolen Shibushi's underwear, then knees the distracted girl in the face; it was Naze's own underwear.[108] Using her bandages and her blood, Naze improvises a mace to fight Shibushi with. She defends with her Black Ogre, then hits Shibushi with her needles. She explains to Choujabaru that she studied up on the rules of the election battle beforehand.[109] Naze keeps her distance, having still not figured out Shibushi's Minus. She reveals however that she has hit Shibushi with her Normalize Liquid, and advances, only to be injured again. Observing her injuries, she realizes Shibushi is reopening her old wounds.[110] Naze rises to fight again, but Shibushi reopens Naze's mental wounds, forcing her to relive her past trauma.[111] A sobbing Naze lets herself be kicked by Shibushi, using the opportunity to cut the lights.[112] She discards her clothes and takes cover, thinking to herself that the situation is hopeless.[113] With Medaka's encouragement,[114] Naze rallies, and begins remodeling her own body. Just as Shibushi discovers her, Naze freezes the other girl's arm, revealing her own Minus, Ice Fire.[115] Using Ice Fire, Naze seals the wounds Scar Dead opens up, and keeps her head cool to counter her mental trauma. In response to Kumagawa's insistence she is definitely a Plus, Naze tells him not to compliment her Minus.[116] Shibushi uses her fully powered Scar Dead to try and end the match,[117] but Naze uses Ice Fire to seal everyone's and everything's wounds. She prepares to strip Shibushi, but at the young girl's pleading for mercy, Naze turns her back to let her strip herself. Shibushi tries a sneak attack, only for Naze to defeat (and strip) her with a blast of fire.[118] Naze steps out of the freezer, greeting her sister with a high-five.[119] She is annoyed by how easily Kumagawa fixes Shibushi.[120] As the Minus prepare to leave, Naze comments that this is good for their side.[121][122] As Kumagawa insists that he will keep his promise, Naze offers to make her battle a loss. She tells Choujabaru that she striped naked while remodeling herself, and he declares the match her loss. Medaka asks if it is alright; Naze tells her she is satisfied with looking cool in front of her sister.[123] She is surprised to see Emukae's Minus has evolved.[124]\n\nMaguro hugs his sisters\nMaguro hugs his sisters.\n\nOn August eighth, the opposing Student Councils meet at the academy's botanical garden for the Treasurer's Battle.[125] Naze mulls over the rules of the match.[126] She wonders at both Kumagawa's and Hitomi's behavior.[127] The nonparticipants watch the battle on several computer screens. Naze asks Choujabaru if Emukae's actions are not illegal.[128] Naze looks to Medaka after Kumagawa finishes explaining their mutual history at Hakobune Middle School. She chastises Medaka for being so cowardly as to ask what they are thinking.[129] Naze is shocked by the giant plant Emukae summons to fight.[130] She smiles to see Medaka's relief.[131] Naze watches as the monitors display Emukae covering the explosion with her body. She is impressed with Emukae's movements.[132] She is surprised by how badly Kumagawa is taking Emuake's injuries.[133] After Choujabaru declares the match a draw, Naze asks what will happen if the election itself ends in a draw. Choujabaru explains to Naze that the opposing side will be declared victor. Naze realizes the Treasurer's Battle is therefore a loss for their side.[134] She is shocked by Zenkichi's declaration that he wants to eat Emuake's miso soup every day. Seeing that Gagamaru Chougasaki will be taking over leadership of Class -13, Naze notes that he seems the most normal of the group.[135] At the Ghost Babel, the Student Council brings Maguro up to speed with the election battles.[136] Despite the difficulties, Naze is confident that the two groups can come to understand one another. When Maguro hugs both her and Medaka, the sisters send him flying, Naze using Ice Fire.[137]\n\nThe results of Encounter\nThe results of Encounter.\n\nOn August fifteenth, the Student Council gather for the Vice-President's Battle. Naze is upset by Chougasaki's behavior, noting that his personality has changed.[138] The group moves to an under construction building for the Vice-President's Battle, \"Dropping Mad Dog\".[139] Naze realizes that the stage provides several disadvantages to Hinokage because of his size.[140] She is awed by Hinokage's speed, comparing it to Medaka's Kurokami Phantom.[141] Watching, all members of the Student Council think Hinokage's victory is assured.[142] Naze asks Medaka how Hinokage's speed compares to her Kurokami Phantom.[143] She is confused as to why Chougasaki seems unaffected by Hinokage's punches, and orders Zenkichi to use Parasite Seeing on him.[144] She is horrified to see the building collapse, as well as to learn the exact nature of Chougasaki's Encounter.[145] Naze is horrified as Chougasaki redirects the damage from Hinokage's attacks to Medaka.[146] As the student body arrives to cheer for Hinokage, Naze laments that Kumagawa scared the students off during the earlier battles.[147] When Hinokage is declared the winner, Naze notes it was the very rule Chougasaki picked to limit Hinokage's strength that cost him the match.[148] Naze questions Hinokage on how he obtained his new Abnormality, but Hinokage refuses to answer.[149] She is surprised by Kumagawa's arrival.[150]\n\nThe Student Council congratulate Medaka\nThe Student Council congratulate Medaka.\n\nOn August twenty-second, the Student Council and Class -13 gather for the final battle. Naze asks Zenkichi about Hansode Shiranui.[151] Naze is shocked when Shiranui declares that Kumagawa will represent Class -13,[152] and is further amazed to hear Shiranui spent the past month winning over Kiruko Tachiarai.[153][154] After Kumagawa picks the Human card, Naze thinks to herself that there were no surviving records of a President's Battle.[155] She is stunned by the conditions Medaka sets for the match.[156] Naze is amazed by the intensity of Medaka's and Kumagawa's fighting.[157] She and the others climb onto the rooftop Medaka and Kumagawa are fighting on.[158] She is unsurprised that Medaka accepts Kumagawa's proposal.[159] Naze is horrified to see Medaka speared through the chest,[160] but is amazed to see her recover.[161] Watching the battle, Naze wonders why Kumagawa abandoned All Fiction.[162] As Medaka and Kumagawa begin a punching fest, Naze theorizes that Kumagawa took back Book Maker so that he could win or lose properly.[163] With the arrival of Medaka's enemies to cheer for her, Naze asks Shiranui if their arrival is her doing. She is surprised to learn it was actually the work of Akune and Kikaijima.[164] Naze thinks Medaka will always be Medaka,[165] and is shocked to see a smiling Kumagawa forfeit. Removing her bandages, she and the others run to congratulate Medaka on her victory.[166]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nKurokami Medaka's Successor Arc\nNaze sides with Zenkichi in his fight against her sister Medaka. They try to revive the Flask Plan. They are in a room Najimi Ajimu finishing their talk about Kamome Tsurubami, when Zenkichi arrives from the infirmary. Maguro takes Naze with him when he leaves the room after their discussion. Maguro says he is worried about the fight between Kamome and Medaka. When they arrive, they find Tsurubami laying on the ground, underneath Medaka. She and Maguro are surprised by the fact that Medaka beat Tsurubami. Medaka says that she won't let him die and uses Aoki Aka's Five Forks to heal him. They are also surprised about the story of how she came to understand that Minus. They end up walking home together.\n\nJet Black Bride Arc\nThe Student Council surrounds Namanie\nThe Student Council surrounds Nienami.\n\nAfter Zenkichi becomes the new Student Council President, Naze is seen as the new Vice-President. Strangely, she is not wearing her usual facial coverings.[167] Arriving on the aircraft carrier Black by helicopter, the Student Council discover the ship deserted. Naze expresses her annoyance that Zenkichi doubts she brought them to the right place, citing what she had to go through with Maguro to find out about the Jet Black Wedding Feast, as well as get the helicopter. A flashback shows that Naze decided to be the Vice-President when Zenkichi approached her about finding new members for the Student Council. Watching Zenkichi and Emukae interact, Naze thinks that both of them are idiots.[168] When the helicopter is cut in half, Naze is horrified, demanding to know what her brother will do to her when he finds out. As Namanie Nienami steps forward, Naze is amazed.[169] The Student Council surrounds Nienami, with Naze readying her Ice Fire. When Nienami attacks Naze, believing her the strongest, Naze thanks her for the compliment, and creates two swords, one of fire, and the other of ice. She is surprised when Nienami manages to cut through them, but thinks to herself that the attack isn't too fast to dodge.[170] After Nienami cuts the ship in half, Naze begins to slide towards the suitor with the other members of the Student Council.[171] When Nienami asks the Student Council for their names, Naze introduces herself.[172] After Nienami is knocked down, Naze and the others prepare to leave, but they are all surprised when the suitor rises to her feet.[173] Watching Zenkichi face Nienami, Naze is asked by Kudaki Torai if he will be alright; Naze tells her that if she were using Kendo, Zenkichi would win. Watching the fight, Naze observes that Nienami is making all the right movements.[174] When Zenkichi's hair changes color, Naze explains to Torai his glasses are normal glasses, but as a result of his training with Ajimu and his exposure to Shiranui's Real Eater, he has developed his own Altered God Mode, Model Zenkichi.[175] After Zenkichi is badly cut by Nienami, Torai asks Naze if they shouldn't intervene; Naze tells her Zenkichi isn't finished yet. As Zenkichi bites Nienami, Naze asks that she scream if the dull blades hurt. When Nienami tearfully asks Zenkichi to stop, Naze face faults. After Nienami admits defeat, Naze and the others run up to Zenkichi.[176]\n\nNaze's delight at misfortune\nNaze's delight at misfortune.\n\nNaze flies a jet to the South Pole, informing the Student Council they will be there in one hour, and remarking that the South Pole is remarkably close when traveling at supersonic speed. She tells Zenkichi not to complain as she borrowed it from her brother after washing his back while wearing a school swimsuit.[177] When Sui Kanaino appears on the jet wing, Naze climbs out to confront her, freezing her feet to the wing. Naze tells the suitor that she cannot crash it because it was a major pain to get it from her brother in the first place. Kanaino rushes her, aiming for her legs. Naze dodges by jumping, and kicks Kanaino in the chin, knocking her back. Naze tells Kanaino that she cut the engines earlier so the plane is going at a constant speed. Naze tells Kanaino that she should get up now that the plane is stable. Naze introduces herself and readies to fight.[178] Naze cloaks herself in her Ice Tank, and freezes Kanaino to the plane's wing while she is distracted by the armor. She is surprised when Kanaino melts the ice, and then shatters her armor with rocks. As Kanaino throws another rock, Naze resolves to let it hit her so as to figure out the trick. As her skin erupts with multiple wounds, Naze immediately seals the cuts with ice. She is surprised to find that the wounds are not deep. Naze launches her Aienkien at Kanaino, though she is not surprised when Kanaino douses the flames. Listening to Kanaino, Naze agrees that the Kurokami family is too peaceful; asked if she is despairing at her misfortune, Naze reveals a masochistic smile, stating that such misfortune is wonderful. Claiming she has not been this happy since the Flask Plan, Naze recreates her Ice Tank and charges Kanaino. She shrugs off Kanaino's rocks, and then throws her Himekuri at her, forcing Kanaino to dodge. Naze then reveals that Kanaino is a Kanji User, and goes on to explain her style, as well as how to counter it.[179]\n\nKanaino's Large Quantity\nNaze struck by Kanaino's scythes.\n\nNaze asks Kanaino to move over on the wing and \"not go wild\"; Kanaino responds by bucking about, using her abilities to rock the plane and throw Naze off.[180] Using the law of convection, Naze sheds her armor and uses the displaced armor to return to the plane, striking at Kanaino as she does so, though her attack misses the suitor. She attempts a punch, but Kanaino redirects it. Kanaino then goes on the offensive, throwing multiple scythes at Naze, all of which make contact. Naze freezes her wounds, but is still left with multiple scythes sticking out of her. She questions Kanaino on why she is participating in the Jet Black Wedding Feast; Kanaino answers, and adds that those who cut their ties to the Kurokami name should not interfere. Naze remembers her interactions with her younger sister: after becoming Vice-President, Naze approaches Medaka, meaning to apologize, but can't work up the nerve. Medaka recognizes what she is trying to do anyway, and gives her a hug, asking her not to worry about it and to call her Medaka-chan. Naze rallies, and tells Kanaino that no one can marry Medaka that she doesn't approve of. Turning to the Student Council, she warns them that the plane is going to crash. She then freezes Kanaino to the wing again, this time with gasoline having leaked out from her earlier attack. Naze then proceeds to name the kanji for gasoline, unfreezing Kanaino. The strong smell of the gasoline causes Kanaino to stand up, whereupon Naze strikes her with her strongest attack, having correctly predicted Kanaino could not manipulate kanji while standing.[181]\n\nNaze enraged\nNaze enraged.\n\nAfter crashing landing, the Student Council makes their way towards the Black Bunker.[182] They find the suitors' abandoned drinks inside.[183] Along with the others, Naze begins searching the base. She and the others later gather in Medaka's cell.[184] Naze observes Medaka's message.[185] Naze takes note of Emukae's distress, but heads back to the plane with the others.[186] Finding their plane disassembled by Mogura Kugurugi, Naze is furious. She is unimpressed by Kugurugi's grandstanding. When Zenkichi moves to engage Kugurugi, Naze knocks him out with a needle, then suggests that Emukae fight next.[187] Naze greets Zenkichi as he awakens, telling him the fight is about to end. Questioned why she hasn't interfered, Naze is shown to be in a bad way, and explains that the others did try to help Emukae, but were forced back.[188] Naze is amazed by the ease with which Kugurugi repels Zenkichi. The other girls gather behind Naze, who drops her head upon hearing that Kugurugi has yet to use her style.[189] Naze is shocked when Emukae makes a desperate suicide charge against Kugurugi,[190] and is further horrified when the younger girl is fatally wounded.[191] Ignoring Kumagawa's sudden appearance, Naze asks him for help, promising to wear a naked apron in return.[192] Naze gives a lackluster response to the news of Kumagawa's new fetish, but is shocked when he starts considering Kugurugi. Naze is unimpressed when Kumagawa lies about being called the wind at the academy.[193] Observing Kugurugi's attack, Shori Wanizuka's comment that Kugurugi \"combined everything\" gives Naze pause.[194] Watching Kumagawa lose, she is surprised that he hasn't figured out the same weakness she has.[195] Hearing Kumagawa's words to Emukae, Naze says nothing.[196] Naze is horrified when Zenkichi stabs himself in the stomach.[197] Like everyone else, Naze waits to hear Emukae's answer to Zenkichi's rejection.[198] Naze and the other girls watch on as Kumagawa and Kugurugi's fight comes to a close.[199]\n\nThe Student Council arrives\nThe Student Council arrives at Kuromaku Island.\n\nAfter the battle, Kumagawa tends to everyone's injuries using All Fiction, but is unable to restore Zenkichi or Emukae, leading Naze to theorize he cannot erase strong emotional attachments. She asks Kumagawa for an explanation of what happened at the aircraft carrier Black.[200] Naze listens on as Zenkichi explains the weakness of the All Jokers.[201] Naze questions Kumagawa on how he escaped and why.[202] Naze listens on as Zenkichi explains Medaka's coded message.[203][204] After crashing into Bukiko Udou's rocket with the Student Council's jet, Naze and the group emerge almost entirely unscathed. When Zenkichi says that this small step was a giant leap for them, Naze comments that it is more like a catastrophe.[205] Naze is surprised by Zenkichi's proposal to Medaka. When her sister accepts, Naze is put out by how quick her reply was.[206] Naze is horrified when Udou runs Zenkichi through with her spear.[207] Udou tells those assembled to wait until the rocket can be prepared, only to be confronted by the entirety of the Student Council. Medaka stops them from acting rashly however.[208] Hearing Momo Momozono's offer for a release of the hostages, Naze comments that a four way battle is still unacceptable. She is annoyed when Medaka accepts immediately anyway.[209]\n\nNaze watches the game\nNaze watches the game.\n\nThe group makes their way to another area to start the final round. Naze makes no comment when Medaka chooses to release Ajimu and Hanten first.[210] In the new area, Naze and the others listen on as the rules of the game are laid out.[211][212][213][214] Naze stands by as the game finally gets under way.[215]Seeing Medaka draw an ace, Naze remarks that she has good luck as usual.[216] She chastises Wanizuka for not remembering the rules properly, but admits that her suggested strategy has some merit.[217] Naze is shocked when Medaka chooses to leave the room, and grows concerned as the suitors decide to form an alliance.[218] She is further stunned when Medaka drags Udou along with her to prove that she is not cheating.[219] When Torai calls Medaka out on her behavior, Naze tries to get her to stop.[220] Having heard Medaka's, resolve, Naze still wonders at what her plan is.[221] Having heard Momozono's explanation, Naze worried that the situation is still not in Medaka's favor. She gets annoyed by Nienami's surprise, as well as Kumagawa and Ajimu's concerns about Fukurou Tsurubami acting after his death.[222] Naze is surprised by Medaka's smiling face despite Momozono apparently figuring out her plan.[223] Naze is confused by Momozono's sudden discomfort.[224] As the audience discusses each player's standing, Naze points out that there is only a single word left for Medaka to use, and it will allow Momozono to win.[225] Naze listens on as Momozono reveals Medaka's true plan; to force the suitor to end with \"surrender\" by manipulating the entire audience not to use the necessary syllables.[226] Naze is present when Zenkichi is healed. She is surprised by Medaka's reaction to Zenkichi's depression. Together, the Student Council and the All Jokers (and Nienami, much to Naze's surprise) return to Hakoniwa Academy.[227]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nUnknown Shiranui Arc\nIn the Student Council office, Naze explains to Zenkichi that Medaka is old fashioned, and probably thinks it is taboo to go out before marriage.[228] At the Shiranui Village, the Thirteen Party's Front Six are introduced by Oudo.[229] Naze watches on as the others attack Iihiko Shishime.[230] Naze stands back as Oudo converses with Medaka.[231] When Iihiko is knocked off the mountain by an armored truck, Naze joins the others in making their escape.[232][233] As Zenkichi hovers near death, Naze's voice is one of the many that gives him encouragement.[234] She is also one of the people he remembers before preparing to fight Iihiko.[235] At the end of the academic year, Torai and the other members of the Student Council are present at the Hakoniwa Academy graduation ceremony. She notes that Zenkichi has become incredible to take charge of such a gathering.[236]\n\nBouquet Toss To The Future Arc\nNaze reports to Zenkichi that Medaka is leaving the academy.[237] Faced with Medaka's upcoming departure, Naze asks Zenkichi what they should do.[238] The entirety of the Thirteen Party await Medaka in Class 13's homeroom, to challenge her as part of the 100 Flowers Run.[239] Naze (now dressed in her Student Council uniform) and members of several generations of the Student Council confront Medaka as part of the 100 Flowers Run in the Student Council office. Naze makes no comment about fighting Medaka twice.[240] Kujira's message to Medaka is that her sister has her back (a joke), while Naze's message is that she is happy if Medaka is happy.[241] Come April of the new school year, Naze is present at the entrance ceremony with the rest of the Student Council. She is the only one not surprised to see the academy's new chairwoman is none other than Medaka, explaining that her sister took over the position from her father's double.\")\nEquipment: (\"Chaotic Intravenous Injections (静脈注射の乱れ打ち, Joumyakuchuushya no Midareuchi): Naze stabs several syringes filled with various chemicals into the opponent's body to achieve any range of physical effects.[249]\" + \"Normalize Liquid (ノーマライズ・リキッド, Nōmaraizu Rikiddo): Naze's primary medicine when using her syringes. When an Abnormal is injected, they are temporarily deprived of their ability,[250][251] but only for a very short time.[252] Naze later reduced the potency to increase the amount of time, though this proved ineffective as her opponent was a Minus and thus not a valid target for the Normalize Liquid.[253]\" + \"Doctor Stop (ドクターストップ, Dokutā Sutoppu): As the name implies, this formula immobilizes; when used on Zenkichi, it caused him to collapse on his back in a daze.[254] Naze considers Doctor Stop a \"pretty strong\" anesthetic, and was surprised when Zenkichi awoke a short time later.[255]\" + \"Black Ogre (黒鬼ブラックオウガ, Burakku Ouga): Naze has a special suit called Black Ogre, created by Munakata.

She first remodeled herself six years ago, and again during her battle with Shibushi, to create the Minus skill Ice Fire.[265]\")\nMinus: (\"Ice Fire: Ice Fire (凍る火柱アイスファイア, Aisu Faia): Naze's Minus, created during her battle with Shibushi with her Abnormality Remodeling.[265] Ice Fire allows Naze to manipulate her body temperature. By doing this she can lower her temperature to create ice around her using vapor in the air and manipulate ice. She can also instantly seal wounds by freezing her veins and skin, as well as keep her head cool to prevent suffering from mental damage.[266][267] Naze can use this ability with ice on other people and objects, the skill having a large range.[268] Naze can also create ice mirrors.[269] Because Ice Fire is a temperature skill and not an ice skill, Naze can freeze other liquids aside from water.[270] She can also raise her body temperature to produce fire.[271] Naze is also capable of manipulating the temperature around her in such a way that she creates a gust of wind which she can ride on, essentially allowing her to fly.[272] The appearance of Ice Fire has changed over time. When first created, Ice Fire creates a large piece of ice on Naze's forehead in place of her band-aid, and her hair turns a lighter shade. Several wrappings form around her to cover her body, with two large straps crossing one another suspended around her person.[273] This form remains when Naze uses Ice Fire for the second time.[274] After joining Zenkichi's Student Council however, the wrappings disappear when Naze uses Ice Fire, though the piece of ice on her forehead and the lighter shade of hair remain\" + \"Ice Fire: Red Sword & Blue Blade (炎の妖刀 & 氷の聖剣レッドソードアンドブルーブレイド, Reddo Sōdo ando Burū Bureido): Naze creates a sword of fire in one hand and a blade of ice in the other.[276]\nIce Tank (氷絶アイスタンク, Aisu Tanku): Naze creates a defensive armor out of her ice.

He later becomes the 100th Student Council president.

Zenkichi has been friends with Medaka since they were two, though they apparently grew apart during middle school. Zenkichi is deeply in love with Medaka, though the dynamics of their relationship is different between the pilot and the actual series. In the pilot, Zenkichi is unable to admit his feelings (though Medaka is aware of them), while in the main series he openly admits to his friends that he follows Medaka around because he's in love with her. Zenkichi is highly determined; despite being only a Normal, he can keep up with Specials and even Abnormals.\")\nAppearance: (\"Zenkichi is left handed.[1] He is of average height and build for a fifteen-year-old, with strawberry-blond hair and blue eyes. He initially wore the standard men's uniform of Hakoniwa Academy, though after joining the Student Council, he changes to the Student Council uniform, black as opposed to the usual white. He sometimes wears his jersey underneath his jacket, though only rarely. The green armband signifying him as the general affairs manager is worn around his left arm. During the battle to decide the academy's new Student Council, Zenkichi wears the Student Council's Battle Attire Red Model. After becoming President, Zenkichi replaces his green armband with the Medaka's red one. He also begins wearing a pair of glasses. Zenkichi has an odd fashion sense, which he seems to have inherited from his mother.[2] He claims black doesn't suit him, and that he came to Hakoniwa Academy because there was some white in the uniform. At Medaka's suggestion, he begins wearing his jersey under his uniform, a style he believes makes him look cool (in contrast, everyone else thinks it looks stupid).[3] Ten years later, Zenkichi wears a black suit and tie similar in appearance to his academy uniform\" + \"At age two, Zenkichi wore a yellow lined, orange hoodie with green shorts. When he was a middle school student, Zenkichi wore the uniform of Hakobune Middle School. For a time, he also had his hair dyed brown and slicked back, before Medaka convinced him to change it back.\")\n\nHistory: (\"Zenkichi first met Medaka when they were both two years old. Left inside the Hakoniwa General Hospital nursery while his mother worked, Zenkichi was struggling with a toy puzzle. Medaka, trying to hide from the hospital staff, introduced herself by taking the toy away from him and easily solving it herself. An impressed Zenkichi asked her to solve the rest of the puzzles in the room, which she accomplished without trouble, much to Zenkichi's delight. Medaka brushed him off, insisting that life has no meaning. When Zenkichi refuted her, she asked him to tell her then for what reason she was born. He then pointed out how happy she had made him, and told her she was obviously born to bring happiness to the people around her. Medaka took these kind words to heart, and the two of them became friends from that point onwards.[4] Medaka was in fact so smitten with Zenkichi for saving her, that she immediately asked him to marry her, though having just met her, Zenkichi refused her just as quickly.[5] Zenkichi does not remember this conversation.[6] After the rejection, Medaka took Zenkichi hostage in the hospital nursery so that she could play with him. Hitomi tried to talk Medaka out of the \"hostage\" situation, but Medaka held her off with the promise of violence, while Zenkichi looked on in confusion. For half a day, Medaka and Zenkichi played, but Zenkichi soon fell ill to high fever from exhaustion. At his bedside, Medaka tearfully apologized for forcing Zenkichi to go beyond his limits; even though she felt that their friendship was fate, still no one could keep up with her. Zenkichi took her hands and told her to stop crying. With a cheery smile, Zenkichi promised to catch up to Medaka even if they became separated or lost.[7] Zenkichi never knew his father; he was a mediocre man, who fell in love with Hitomi because she was so extraordinary, and left her for the same reason. After meeting Medaka, Zenkichi never held a grudge against his father. However, he resolved that he would never run away from extraordinary people, or his own mediocrity.[8]\n\nZenkichi while in Middle School\nZenkichi confronts Akune (check out the hair).\n\nIn primary school, Medaka took the first kiss of all her classmates, but when she and Zenkichi got to elementary school, he had her stop.[9] While at Hakobune Middle School, after Kouki Akune's repeated failed attempts to destroy Medaka, Zenkichi gathered together the other \"Anti-Akune\" students to make his debut as a big shot. The group ganged up on Akune, but their efforts were cut short by Medaka, who kicked Zenkichi away, and admonished him for trying to bully someone weaker than him, as well as telling him to switch back to his old hair-style.[10] Zenkichi was left in a daze as Akune was converted by Medaka.[11] Later, after Medaka's devastating encounter with Misogi Kumagawa, Zenkichi resolved to protect her so that he would never have to see her cry again.[12] After the situation with Kumagawa was resolved, Zenkichi and Akune became bitter rivals for Medaka's affections.[13] It was also at some point during his middle school years that Zenkichi was told by Maguro Kurokami that he was too weak to remain by Medaka's side.[14] When Medaka applied for Hakoniwa Academy, Zenkichi asked her why she did so. Medaka told him she wanted to learn what one plus one is.[15]\n\nZenkichi and Shiranui become friends\nZenkichi and Shiranui become friends.\n\nZenkichi first met Hansode Shiranui at Hakoniwa Academy, when she dropped her eraser in front of him.[16] Zenkichi noticed Shiranui after seeing her eat out of a boxed lunch since first period;[17] upon finishing that one, she took out another, and would have another five or six before an onigiri for dessert. Zenkichi was astonished by her gluttony, comparing her to Medaka.[18] Because he was watching her, Shiranui paused in her eating. She then dropped her eraser while having a rice ball.[19] Seeing this as a challenge, he introduced himself as the man who mastered the skill of the silent eraser in middle school, and asked for her name. Shiranui first dropped her rice ball in surprise, then burst out laughing. Telling \"Erase Man\" he was funny, she introduced herself.[20]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nPlot\nStudent Council Executive Arc\nZenkichi declares he will not join the Student Council\nZenkichi declares he will not join the Student Council.\n\nZenkichi is present at Medaka's inauguration ceremony.[21] He is later seen discussing Medaka's recent election with Shiranui, with the former commenting that Medaka is used to standing above people. The two discuss Medaka's numerous achievements, before Shiranui asks Zenkichi if he plans the join the Student Council. Zenkichi adamantly insists that he won't, only for Medaka to appear behind him and drag him off. In the Student Council room, Zenkichi complains to Medaka about her treatment of him, only to be shocked when he finds she has been undressing behind him. While he insists she have some shame, Medaka only responds that it's fine because they are childhood friends. She tells him that while she has never found a job challenging, she wants Zenkichi to stay by her side. She then reads the suggestion box's first request: that the kendo hall be cleared of delinquents. Medaka and Zenkichi head over to the kendo hall (Medaka having changed into a kendo uniform), where they confront Mahibi Moji, the delinquents' leader who took the remaining 2% of the votes that Medaka didn't receive. After Medaka easily disarms Moji, she hands his sword over to Zenkichi as she confiscates all of the delinquents' cigarettes when they try to surround the pair of them. Watching, Zenkichi's inner thoughts explain to the reader how Medaka manages to pull of these incredible feats. He continues to narrate as Medaka preaches to the Kendo Club, and is apparently pulled into their reeducation, as he is seen quite worn out the next day.\n\nA worn Zenkichi\nA worn Zenkichi.\n\nWhile having lunch with Shiranui, he continues to explain how Medaka is unaware how much greater she is than other people, and that she can't understand the feelings of those who try hard and don't succeed. When he declares that the job is finished though, Shiranui comments that he doesn't really understand Medaka either, as she won't stop until she reforms the Kendo Club. When Zenkichi hears complaining about the club from behind him, he turns around only to find no one there. Shiranui tells him Habataki Hyūga was just sitting there. She also tells him that after the recruitment meeting later in the day, Zenkichi won't have to worry as the Studen Council positions will be filled. Despite the reassurance, Zenkichi is left uneasy, but forgets his worries when he arrives at the kendo hall, finding the once filthy building to have been cleaned. He is told off by Medaka for coming late, as she had cleaned the entire hall by herself. Zenkichi chastises her for doing all this for complete strangers, to which Medaka responds she only feels happy when she is helping others. Zenkichi makes to leave, but is shocked to find that all the members of the Kendo Club have returned despite Medaka's harsh treatment. Zenkichi leaves the hall, and decides that he was in the wrong, only to be attacked from behind by a shadowed figure, revealed to be Hyūga.[22]\n\nZenkichi defeats Hyuga\nZenkichi defeats Hyūga.\n\nZenkichi manages to recover however, and reappears at the kendo hall to protect the beaten Kendo Club from Hyūga. Hyūga demands to know why Zenkichi is protecting a bunch of thugs, to which Zenkichi replies that while he agrees with Hyūga, he agrees with Medaka more, and that he won't forgive anyone who tries to go against Medaka's justice. Hyūga angrily attacks him, only to be defeated with one punch to the face from Zenkichi.[23] A few days later, Zenkichi is told by Medaka that her dream is to fill the school with flowers, one for each request she completes. Moved, Zenkichi finally agrees to join the Student Council and demands an armband; an overjoyed Medaka hugs him. Zenkichi realizes this ending was inevitable, as he has always been in love with Medaka. Medaka assigns him the position of general affairs manager, and tells him to work his way up.[24]\n\nZenkichi's style\n\"The Look.\"\n\nOne week later, Zenkichi (sporting his new look) and Medaka attend to the request of Aria Ariake: her shoes have been vandalized, and a note saying \"Quit the Athletics Club.\" was left in her locker. Understandably upset, Ariake asks the pair to find the cluprit. While Medaka promises to expose the culprit in one day, Zenkichi is more skeptical, citing their lack of evidence. However, using her incredible abilities of deductive reasoning, Medaka managers to narrow down the range of suspects considerably. It is Shiranui's information though that allows Zenkichi to track down Isagi Isahaya as the most likely suspect in the attack on Ariake. When Medaka confronts Isahaya directly, Zenkichi is stunned. When Isahaya flees, Zenkichi makes to follow, but not before Shiranui tells him his new look is weird.[25] After Medaka leaves, Zenkichi tells Isahaya that while Medaka knows how to doubt, she trusts people first. After Isahaya also tells him he looks weird, he takes his jersey off, and tells Isahaya that he'll follow Medaka's lead, and believe that she'll never do something like this again. The next day, while wondering why no one appreciates his style, Zenkichi is approached by Ariake, who tells him that the sneakers she was using to train with were replaced with new running shoes and a note saying \"Sorry.\"[26]\n\nZenkichi loses to the Borzoi\nZenkichi loses to the Borzoi.\n\nWhen the Student Council receives a request to find a lost puppy, Medaka orders Zenkichi to take care of it while she handles two other requests. When Zenkichi asks if it's okay for him to be working by himself, Medaka sadly reminds him that she has never been good with animals. Zenkichi brings Shiranui along with his as he goes to find the lost pet. Shiranui expresses her surpise that even the \"invincible\" Medaka has a weak point, Zenkichi tells her that she had a rather traumatic incident in the past with the primary school class pet. When Shiranui asks if that could undermine Medaka's presidency, Zenkichi reminds her that that is where he comes in.He then tells her to lead the way. Shiranui tells him she heard about a dog living on campus, and leads him to a fully grown canine, which closely resembles a wolf. When Zenkichi tries to insist it can't be the dog they're looking for, Shiranui tells him it is an adult Borzoi, also known as the Russian Wolf-Hound. A horrified Zenkichi asks if she is going to help him, only to be told by Shiranui that she just came to watch him get mauled.She then hands him sausages to use in an \"internal organs\" joke; which Zenkichi unfortunately fulfills when he tries to unsuccessfully capture the dog.\n\nZenkichi and a depressed Medaka\nZenkichi and a depressed Medaka.\n\nThe next day, a worn Zenkichi reports in to Medakai that the puppy has grown up, and that he and Shiranui were unable to capture it, and that he had a hard time telling their client Urushi Akizuki what happened. Medaka express her annoyance in seeing Zenkichi and Shiranui get along so well, and when Zenkichi tells her not to worry and just leave things to him and Shiranui, she becomes quite disturbed. After Zenkichi compliments Shiranui a bit more, Medaka decides to handle the request herself after all. To deal with her animal problem, Medaka dresses up in a dog outfit from the Drama Club, much to Zenkichi's chagrin. Shiranui and Zenkichi both agree that though her logic is sound, her method is ridiculous. When he insists that he and Shiranui can handle the request, Medaka becomes more annoyed than ever, and goes forward anyway. As Medaka approaches the dog, Shiranui remarks that Medaka is much more human than she expected, getting jealous, acting stupid, and having a problem with animals. Zenkichi corrects her, telling her that it's actually the animals that have a problem with Medaka: because of her overwhelming presence, all animals are terrified of her. When Medaka reaches the dog, it becomes so terrified that it runs away and hides behind Zenkichi. Later, Medaka becomes depressed that she couldn't get the dog to like her. Zenkichi tiredly consoles her, noting that at least Akizuki was pleased.[27]\n\nZenkichi vs Kanoya\nZenkichi vs Kanoya.\n\nZenkichi begins systematically visiting different clubs, starting with the competitive fighting and moving on to competitive team sports games. When questioned by Hyūga during lunch why he would do such a thing, he replies that it is his policy to sweat five liters a day. Shiranui agrees with him, stating that it is her policy to drink five liters of ramen a day. Hyūga tells Zenkichi that he has earned himself a name as the Student Council's \"Club Typhoon\" (部活荒らし, Bukatsu Arashi), and that he should probably stop as he still hasn't joined one. Zenkichi replies that is fine, as he intended to make a name for himself anyway. Hearing this, Hisshuu Kanoya approaches him and asks to talk.[28] Kanoya tells Zenkichi about his plan to attack Medaka. When Zenkichi questions why he would tell the general affairs manager, Kanoya points out that Medaka is fully capable of running the Student Council by herself, and that Zenkichi is just getting dragged around. He surmises that Zenkichi is feeling irrated as well, and that he is visiting all the clubs to work of his stress. He then offers that Zenkichi join up with him, as he doesn't want to see an impressive guy like Zenkichi to go to waste. He tells Zenkichi that his forces will be having a meeting after school, and tells him to come if he is interested. After Kanoya leaves, Medaka shows herself, revealing that she heard everything. While Zenkichi expresses his worry, Medaka tells him that she never expected to be loved by the people; as long as she loves people, that is enough. She then tells him not to do anything, as stomping down rebellions is the king's job. Zenkichi thinks to himself that Medaka even loves her enemies, and that while she has a 98% approval rating, she only cares about the remaining 2%. He later comes to Kanoya's meeting. Kanoya is initally delighted when Zenkichi arrives, though his mood quickly sours when Zenkichi kicks over his weapon cache. Zenkichi tells Kanoya that he wants to be the person who protects the invincible Medaka. A confused and angry Kanoya attacks him, only to be defeated with a single kick. Zenkichi tells him he doesn't deserve to be reformed, and then takes out the rest of his gang.[29]\n\nNabeshima approaches Zenkichi\nNabeshima approaches Zenkichi.\n\nAfter walking in on a Medaka changing into a judo uniform, Zenkich locks the door, closes the shades, and turns off the lights, he criticizes her for her lack of shame. She replies by asking how she can show off her body then, which only upsets Zenkichi more. She then tells him that they have received a request from Nekomi Nabeshima, the Judo Club's captain, to help her pick a successor. At the club, they are greeted by Nabeshima and Akune, with the latter kneeling before to Medaka to show his gratitude for what she did for him in the past. Medaka pulls him to his feet, telling him that if he wants to express his gratitude, he shouldn't bow to her to show it. She then sends him to Zenkichi, as she challenges all the members of the Judo Club to show her their skills so she can determine who is worthy to take over. Akune and Zenkichi aggressively greet each other, while an amused Nabeshima looks on.[30] After Betsuhei Jounan is defeated in an instant by Medaka, Nabeshima questions Zenkichi on what he thinks. When he replies he has always seen Medaka as a monster who can do everything, Nabeshima agrees with him, then flirtatiously says she finds Zenkichi, who can keep up with Medaka, much more interesting. Zenkichi replies he is just being dragged around, at which Akune loses his temper, asks to take over Zenkichi's position, Nabeshima proposes they settle the argument with judo: if Akune beats Zenkichi, he will join the Student Council and Zenkichi will join the Judo Club. When Zenkichi disbelievingly asks Nabeshima if this was her plan all along, she admits it was, claiming she loves \"go-getters\" like Zenkichi.[31]\n\nZenkichi defeats Akune\nZenkichi defeats Akune.\n\nAs Zenkichi and Akune ready themselves for the match, Zenkichi questions why he has to fight in the first place. Medaka tells him that she won't tell him not to lose, but there's no way she will let him run away from a fight. Deciding that Akune is stronger than him, Zenkichi attacks first, hoping for a quick win. However, Akune easily scores his first point, and tells Zenkichi to get back up, as he will defeat him in the most unsightly manner possible in front of Medaka.[32] In a short time, Akune reaches nine points, leaving a battered Zenkichi barely standing. As Akune moves to finish him, Zenkichi contemplates losing, and decides that maybe its fine to let Akune join the Student Council. However, Medaka calls out to him, and with a cute face, tells him to win, otherwise she will cry. Zenkichi proclaims he never wants to hear about her crying, let alone see it, and surprises Akune with a two-handed topple, scoring a point off him and winning the match.[33] He later discusses what happened with Shiranui, but when the two enter the Student Council room, they find a nearly naked Akune changing, much to Zenkichi's displeasure. Akune tells Zenkichi that while he may have given up on driving Zenkichi out, he hasn't given up on Medaka, and has left the Judo Club to become the secretary of the Student Council. He also tells Zenkichi that Nabeshima hasn't given up on him. Zenkichi angrily insists that he will not let Akune have Medaka.[34]\n\nZenkichi watering the flowers\nZenkichi watering the flowers.\n\nA month after Medaka's inauguration, Zenkichi is seen watering a room full of flowers. Akune walks in in his new uniform, and the two trade veiled insults with each other, before heading off to attend to the next request. After Medaka interviews Kenna Yatsushiro on the nature of her request, she assigns Akune to take care of it. Zenkichi thinks she made a good call, stating that Akune should have no problem with the request. Medaka agrees with him, and states that itself is the biggest problem, leaving Zenkichi perplexed.[35] While discussing Yatsushiro with Shiranui at lunch, Shrianui questions why Medaka would hand the task over to Akune, when she could do it better herself. Zenkichi tells her that it is both to get Akune experience, as well as determine wether or not Yatsushiro deserves help.[36] After watching Akune get scolded by Medaka, Zenkichi offers him some words of consolment, but Akune rebukes him, tearing up the letter and decalring he won't give up.[37] A week later, Yatsushiro gives her own letter to her crush, and Medaka congratulates Akune on a job well done, much to Zenkichi's chagrin.[38]\n\nThe guys modeling\nThe guys modeling.\n\nWhen Kizashi Yuubaru asks Medaka to model for him, Zenkichi is mortified at the actions of his fellow members of the Student Council; Medaka agreeing readily to the reques, and Akune reduced to a druling idiot upon seeing Medaka in a bikini. After Yuubaru decides that he can't use Medaka as a model, Zenkichi tells him he is being ridiculous, especially as he was the one who requested help. Yuubaru replies that being an artist means being ridiculous, a statement Zenkichi finds so stupid he can't reply to it. Zenkichi approaches Isahaya as a replacement model, and manages to get her to agree. When he gets back to find Akune has brought Nabeshima, the two argue over who brought the better girl.[39] After both are rejected by Yuubaru, Akune and Zenkichi find themselves at a loss for what to do. However, they remember Akizuki and Yatsushiro. Zenkichi goes to ask Akizuki, but is rejected and attacked by her dog. After seeing them struggle to find new models, Medaka suggests that the two of them try. While Yuubaru at first seems satisfied, he gives up when he realizes that the men don't match the theme of \"Beach Goddess\". After Yuubaru picks Shiranui as his model, Zenkichi tries to console Medaka, with little success.[40]\n\nAn exhausted Zenkichi and Akune\nAn exhausted Zenkichi and Akune.\n\nExhausted with the constant demands of the Student Council, Zenkichi is not amused by Akune's attempts at humor. When Medaka insists that even she is starting to feel worn down by all the paperwork, Zenkichi comments that she doesn't look it. He notes that Vice-President aside, not having a treasurer is really hurting them now. He also makes mention of how many clubs the school actually has. When Medaka tries to offer her own money, Zenkichi shoots her down. He remembers that Medaka lives alone, having earned a great deal of money by solving the juggling theorem when she was in middle school. After hearing Akune's idea to turn the inter-club relay race into a competition to decide which clubs should get funding, Zenkichi thinks to himself that Akune is only trying to lessen his own work load. He then suggests that they hold the competition in the the school's new pool. At lunch, he discusses with Shiranui how it has been decided to a club battle swim meet on Sunday in the new pool. When Shiranui points out that such an event seems to be in the Swimming Club's favor, he replies the events will not be water-based, despite taking place in a pool. Shiranui starts acting smug, and tells him that any event in the water can't be called fair, because there are three members of the Swimming Club who are very pushy when it comes to money. When he presses her to tell him what she means, Shiranui coolly tells him to ask her in a more polite manner. When he asks her while bowing, other members of their class comment that the pair have a sick way of getting along.[41]\n\nZenkichi explaining the rules of the meet\nZenkichi explaining the rules of the meet.\n\nCome Sunday, Zenkichi is amazed to see how many people have come to the swim meet. As he talks with Akune, he takes note of the people he recognizes, and wonders where the Swimming Club is.[42] After Medaka welcomes the participants, Zenkichi explains the rules of the swim meet. After Medaka announces that the Student Council will be taking part as well, and that anyone who can score higher than them will receive funding directly from Medaka's own pocket, three times the normal amount, no questions asked, he and Akune are seen kneeling on the ground, thinking that they begged her not to do this. Zenkichi thinks to himself that this was supposed to be a peaceful event, and after what Shiranui said, he is getting a bad feeling.[43]\n\n20 Point High-Five\nThe twenty point...fist bump.\n\nWaiting for the first event to start, Zenkichi becomes annoyed as he overhears Shiranui describing their first meeting to Tanzaku Aso. He later thinks that Nabeshima is very bold about being cheap.[44] When the first event begins, he and Akune get out of the water straight away. When Nabeshima asks where Medaka has gone, Zenkichi tells her that if her intention is to be cheap, then Medaka's is pomp and circumstance. After Medaka scores, he high-fives Akune.[45] After the first event ends, Zenkichi is pleased with the scores, seeing that the Student Council is not too far ahead the other clubs, despite Medaka, and claims that he will need to thank Shiranui for explaining the proper technique. He isn't surprised when Medaka appears behind him, mimicking his pose. When Medaka points out the Swimming Club, he thinks to himself that they were the ones Shiranui was talking about, but he is amazed that they were faster than Medaka.[46]\n\nZenkichi's and Akune's poor teamwork\nZenkichi's and Akune's poor teamwork.\n\nZenkichi and Akune take part in the second event, the three legged race.[47] Before the race begins, Akune tells Zenkichi that even if they are the event's organizers, that is no excuse to hold back. Zenkichi says he understands, and will match his pace to Akune's. Akune expresses his pleasure at having such a good underclassman, and the two shake hands. When Aso starts the race, Akune and Zenkichi both begin struggling with one another to get ahead, but manage to move into the lead despite this.[48] When Umumichi Yakushima and Sotsu Tanegashima swim the race with their legs tied together, Zenkichi is stunned along with everyone else. Because they both finished at different times, he and Akune take third place. Zenkichi thinks to himself how dangerous the Swimming Club's strategy was. He then narrates the third event, eel catching. At the end of the third event, the Student Council is in seventh place overall. Zenkichi notes that the Swimming Club is going to win, just as Shiranui predicted, before asking Akune what the last event will be. When Tanegashima aggressively reminds them that the Swimming Club will be earning three times the regular funds, Zenkichi asks him if he could at least pretend to have fun. When Medaka appears behind Tanegashima and preaches to the Swimming Club that something horrible must have happened to them to turn them into such gold diggers, Zenkichi notes that it has been awhile since they have seen Medaka's Proof of One's Worth #1.[49]\n\nThe Student Council's horse\nThe Student Council's horse.\n\nAs the fourth event starts, the cavalry battle, Zenkichi and Akune are seen as the horse supporting Medaka, with Zenkichi in the front. When Akune questions this set up, Zenkichi reminds him that he lost the game of rock paper scissors. After hearing Shiranui's explanation of the final event, Zenkichi proudly states that his best friend doesn't think like everyone else, and shouts up to her: \"I love you Shiranui!\" to which Shiranui replies \"Yay! I love me some me too!\", as onlookers think that it's disgusting how well the two of them get along. Medaka then punches him on the head, causing him to question why she had to get violent.[50] After hearing about the reasons behind the Swimming Club's obsession with money, Zenkichi thinks to himself that while Medaka was right about the members having tragic pasts, hearing just how horrible they actually were isn't even funny. When Medaka falls, Zenkichi throws one of his floaters into the water.[51] Zenkichi declares he does not care about the outcome of the match, but what the Swimming Club are saying really pissed him off. He tells Medaka to go get Mogana Kikaijima; he isn't sure about water, but in midair, Medaka is the best.[52] When Medaka knocks Kikaijima off balance and kisses her, Zenkichi thinks to himself that this is Medaka's third ability, the rare Overflowing Love.[53] He is shocked with everyone else when Nabeshima and the Judo Club are revealed to have won the competition, and thinks that Nabeshima was surprisingly cool about being cheap. Zenkichi narrates the ending events, explaining that the Judo Club got the funding, but that Nabeshima gave some of the money to other clubs anyway. Zenkichi thinks to himself that Nabeshima makes no sense to him. He is later seen in the Student Council room, when Medaka introduces Kikajima as the Student Council's new treasurer. They are both stunned to see her again, and when Medaka explains that they are renting her out from the Swimming Club for $3.00 a day, they both think that is surprisingly cheap.[54]\n\nKikaijima demands payment\nKikaijima demands payment.\n\nZenkichi walks down the hallways of the Academy, thinking to himself about the Student Council's new treasurer, Kikaijima. Though he thinks that this should be a good thing, with the budget now finally in order, he feels as though all the people who came after him have better positions then he does. He remembers Medaka telling him to work his way up, but it still doesn't sit right with him. He then enters the Council's room, to find a changing Kikaijima in her underwear. [55] When she demands that he pay for the show he got, Zenkichi is incredulous that she wants him to pay her money after already beating him up. He angrily tells her she was at fault for changing in a unisex room without locking the door, and that he should be asking her for money, as she showed him something he didn't want to see. Kikaijima starts crying, and angrily cries that he pay her while calling him a meanie, now telling him to pay for the mean things he said as well. Zenkichi relents, and he pays her $4.50 for the peep show, and $3.00 for being mean. With Kikaijima's mood improved, he thinks to himself that it was cheaper than he expected. Kikaijima asks him where the computer is, to which he replies that they don't have one and hands her an abacus, much to her surprise. Zenkichi goes on to say that they don't need a computer with Medaka, as she can do any kind of arithmetic in her head. When Kikaijima begins working, Zenkichi starts reading manga. He thinks to himself that the room got really quiet after they stopped talking, and that Kikaijima makes him feel like he shouldn't be there. He thinks on that he knows nothing about her; she has a \"to each their own\" attitude of working, and that once he paid her, she was done with him. Feeling awkward, he wonders why neither Medaka nor Akune are in today. When Kikaijima comments that they have nice weather today, Zenkichi replies that it is raining. Afterwards, he realizes that Kikaijima was trying to start a conversation with him, and that he should have answered: \"Yeah, even rainy days are good.\" He continues to think that while Kikaijima is higher ranked than him (because she is a scholarship student), he is still her senior in the Student Council, and that he should try and break the ice, deciding he should first change the mood into a better one. Remembering that Medaka told him Kikaijima trains her body, and thinking that there is not a person who doesn't like being complimented, he tells her that she has a great body. A horrified Kikaijima throws her abacus at his head, and charges him $0.50 for sexual harassment; bringing the total amount of money she has taken from him $8.00. Zenkichi thinks to himself that he has just made things worse, and that he has no sense when talking to a girl. He silently begs for somebody to help out, not caring who. Shiranui barges into the Student Council room, telling Zenkichi she felt as if he was calling for her, and asking if he has something good for her to eat. A horrified Zenkichi and Kikaijima both think that the number one person who can't take a hint just came.\n\nAkune finds Zenkichi and Kikaijima in a compromising position\nAkune finds Zenkichi and Kikaijima in a compromising position.\n\nWhen Shiranui starts upsetting Kikaijima with a photo of her kiss with Medaka, Zenkichi interrupts her, asking her not to tease the new member so much; he promises to buy her something good to eat later, and asks her to leave. Shiranui agrees, and leaves with an empty apology to Kikaijima and a farewell to Zenkichi. Zenkichi apologizes to Kikaijima on his friend's behalf. When Kikaijima asks him what Shiranui is like, he tells her he doesn't really know. When Kikaijima asks him if it is alright to be that easy going about, Zenkichi replies in the affirmative, telling her that Shiranui is his friend, and that he doesn't need to know any more than that. Kikaijima then asks about Medaka, and Zenkichi bashfully admits that in the past, all their classmates' first kiss was with Medaka, though he put a stop to that when they got to elementary school. He goes on to say that Overflowing Love is one of Medaka's trump cards now; she doesn't use it very often, and Kikaijima is one of the rare cases where she did use it. Zenkichi begins to mention Medaka's fourth trump card, but then decides to keep that information to himself. After Kikaijima claims that if anyone starts to like her, they won't get anything in return, Zenkichi asks if she can say the same thing to the other members of the Swimming Club. Kikaijima replies that those two are different, as the three of them are like family. Zenkichi tells her that Medaka is the same way, only she sees all of humanity as her family, and that she likes Kikaijima so much, she doesn't know what to do about it. Zenkichi continues to talk about Medaka, when Kikaijima interrupts him, claiming that she has fallen for him, and is going to kiss him. Medaka and Akune later find Kikaijima on top of Zenkichi in the Student Council room, with Zenkichi trying to force her off of him. Both of the newcomers misunderstand what they are seeing and chastise him, to which a frustrated Zenkichi replies that while they are not wrong, they are not right either.[56]\n\nZenkichi with a school appropriate uniform\nZenkichi with a school appropriate uniform.\n\nZenkichi is spotted walking with the rest of the Student Council by Harigane Onigase of the Public Morals Committee, who confronts the Student Council in their office. Onigase calls Zenkichi out on wearing his jersey under his jacket, to which he admits he was trying to get others to copy him. After Onigase reveals that Kikaijima has been wearing her swimsuit beneath her uniform, Zenkichi wonders if Onigase has x-ray vision. When Medaka claims that she has never been embarrassed about her splendid body, the other members of the Student Council are at a loss for words. Zenkichi worries that Medaka is going to lose the argument to Onigase, though Akune tells him there is no need, as Medaka will say something that even Onigase won't be able to argue with. When Medaka finally declares that she just doesn't want to change her clothing, the other members of the Student Council are appalled.[57]\n\nZenkichi asks Onigase to cut Medaka some slack\nZenkichi asks Onigase to cut Medaka some slack.\n\nZenkichi follows Onigase after she leaves, promising to get Medaka to do something about her uniform, and asking Onigase to let the matter slide. He goes on to state Medaka has a small habit of exposing herself, which Onigase insists is exactly what she is trying to prevent. Zenkichi tries a different tactic, pointing out Medaka's numerous accomplishments; including taking back the Kendo Hall from the seniors, as that was a job for the Public Morals Committee. Onigase refuses, and Zenkichi decides that there the Student Council was doomed to butt heads with the Public Morals Committee eventually. He is later seen at the outdoor pool with Medaka, both having been called out by Onigase. Zenkichi easily recognizes Onigase's request as a lie. After Medaka jumps into the water, Zenkichi thinks that no matter what, Medaka will stay true to herself, as what makes a person who they are is not their clothing. The next day, Onigase is forced to wear one of Medaka's uniforms (which does not fit her at all), Shiranui asks Zenkichi how bad someone needs to be before retribution hits them like that. Zenkichi simply tells her that she tried to fool Medaka into changing her uniform the day before.[58]\n\nOnigase and Zenkichi handcuffed together\nZenkichi and Onigase handcuffed together.\n\nThe next day, Zenkichi is seen walking around school with Shiranui, bags of food in her hands. While the two debate what to eat after school, they run into Onigase, who chastises Shiranui for eating in the halls. When Onigase goes after Shiranui, Shiranui pushes Zenkichi on top of her, before giving the other girl a brief warning and running off. Onigase tries to give chase, only for Zenkichi to warn her that Shiranui is more untouchable than Medaka. Onigase ignores him, only to discover that they have been handcuffed together. When Zenkichi presses her for the key, she tries unsuccessfully to change the topic, giving away that she actually doesn't have one. After Zenkichi upsets her with the implications of their situation however, Onigase decides to lead him to the Public Morals Committee's office, where the key is kept. Trying to distract himself from the awkwardness of the situation, Zenkichi question Onigase as to whether there are really people after her. The pair run into Medaka, who misinterprets their situation as the two of them working together to form a bond between the Student Council and the Public Morals Committee. Zenkichi asks Medaka if she can pick the handcuff lock, which she agrees to. Medaka first handcuffs herself to Zenkichi, so as to see how the locking mechanism works. When she cannot undo the lock, both Zenkichi and Onigase are notable displeased. She then tries to pick the handcuffs, only to find the lock beyond her. As all three head to the Public Morals Committee's office, Medaka stops them several times to help other students. Onigase quickly gets annoyed with Medaka's multiple stops, prompting Zenkichi to point out how much different things are now that they are with Medaka. After Onigase admits that she has lost all of her friends, Zenkichi tries to comfort her, only to be angrily rebuked. When Medaka calls them out, the Mokkin Team reveals themselves. The pair attack Onigase, believing her movements sealed due to the handcuffs. Zenkichi smashes the Mokkin Team's wooden bat, telling Onigase that there is no one she needs to protect. After Medaka reveals she could have broken the handcuffs, but didn't want to, both Zenkichi and Onigase to slump in defeat.[59]\n\nThe Student Council at work\nThe Student Council at work.\n\nWhile Medaka visits the music room, Zenkichi is busy performing repairs.[60] He is unaware as Fue Yobuko sneaks up behind him, weapon drawn.[61][62] Yobuko makes herself known to Zenkichi, asking him to carry some boxes for her, and comments that he seems used to hard work. Zenkichi answers that he has heard the same about her, and remains unaware as she prepares to attack him. He is saved by Medaka's intervention, who catches Yobuko's chains before they can reach him.[63] After Medaka leaves, Zenkichi tells Yobuko that the ones protected were the Enforcers, as he and Akune can both defend themselves, and Kikaijima is under the protection of the Swimming Club.[64]\n\nThe Student Council after Unzen's attack\nThe Student Council after Unzen's attack.\n\nIn the Student Council office, Zenkichi and the others listen to Medaka's explanation of Myouri Unzen's weapon: the super ball. Zenkichi finds this information hard to believe, but is quickly convinced after seeing the super ball in action. When Unzen shows up at the office, Zenkichi expresses his concern at seeing the Head Enforcer.[65] Listening to Unzen speak, Zenkichi admits that he can't agree nor deny the younger boy's claims, while thinking to himself that he can't figure out what Unzen is trying to do. He notices when Unzen locks the windows, and thinking back to how he locked the door earlier, wonders why Unzen is trying to lock them in. When Medaka cries out that the super balls he dropped earlier were actually filled with gunpowder, Zenkichi is stunned.[66] When the smoke clears, Zenkichi and the other members of the Student Council are revealed to be fine. Unzen realizes that Medaka, in the short time she had, threw water on some of the bombs, kicked some out the window, and then sheltered her fellow members in lockers.[67] As Medaka enters War God Mode, Zenkichi and the others can only watch. Akune asks Zenkichi when the last time Medaka entered such a state was, who answers that it was in the summer of seventh grade, three years previous. Zenkichi labels it as Medaka's fourth trump card, and tells Unzen that he is finished.[68]\n\nThe Student Council stops Medaka's rampage\nThe Student Council stops Medaka's rampage.\n\nZenkichi remembers the first time Medaka entered War God Mode, during her time at Hakobune Middle School, after witnessing Kumagawa attack Najimi Ajimu. He thinks about how Medaka is a saint for strangers, but for the sake of her friends will become a beast.[69] When Medaka sends Unzen flying into the Student Council office, Zenkichi and the others are shocked. When Medaka makes to follow, Zenkichi calls out to her, and is horrified when she apologizes and tells him he and the others can quit the Student Council after she has finished.[70] Watching Medaka, Kikaijima asks what is going on. Zenkichi explains Medaka's behavior to her, then tells her and Akune that if they want to leave the Student Council, now is the time, surprising them both.[71] As Medaka moves to make her last attack on Unzen, Zenkichi and the rest of the Student Council grab on to her, stopping her before she can finish. She tells them to let go of her if they don't want to get dragged into her problems, but they all refuse. All three are shocked when Medaka asks Unzen to become her Vice-President, Zenkichi in particular amazed that she has returned to normal so quickly. Zenkichi talks with Unzen after the others have left, pointing out that he thinks Unzen and Medaka are both too perfect, and that he just likes Medaka more than Unzen.[72] Zenkichi covers Medaka in his jacket and gives her a piggyback as the Student Council walks off into the sunset.[73]\n\nZenkichi sets up a shogi board\nZenkichi sets up a shogi board.\n\nIn the (temporary) Student Council office, Zenkichi and the others work to manage the academy in without the hospitalized Medaka. All three enjoy the quiet, though only Zenkichi remains relaxed as Akune and Kikaijima become distressed by Medaka's absence. At Kikaijima's urging, Zenkichi checks the suggestion box, only to find Sasae Mochibaru outside the door. Mochibaru leads them to the Shogi Club, and asks them to help her find a missing piece of a shogi set – the king. Zenkichi and Akune are notably put out by the messy state of the club room. The three change in to more appropriate clothing, and set about cleaning up the club room in search of the missing game piece. A mishap with a table leads to a sizable on each forehead, and the three reminisce on how Medaka has affected their lives as they clean. The Student Council are exhausted by the time they finish, but still have been unable to locate the missing king. Akune discovers that the king is missing from every shogi set in the room, and leads the Student Council to the prime suspect, Miri Natayama. The three confront Natayama on the roof, who all but outright confesses to the crime. Akune suggests they go to the teachers and leave the matter up to them, but is stopped by Zenkichi, who decides they should do things Medaka's way. Taking the boxwood set out his pocket, he challenges Natayama to a match: if she wins, they will let her go. If he wins, she returns the shogi pieces. Natayama angrily agrees, and Zenkichi sets up the board for a game of mawari shogi, infuriating Natayama further. Zenkichi loses his cool as well, and chastises her for stealing the kings, as well as her dismissal of the Shogi Club's feelings. Both he and Akune are aghast by Kikaijima's attempt at helping. Afterwards, Zenkichi narrates, explaining that the missing pieces were \"found\" in one of the lockers in the club room, and that Natayama returned to the Shogi Club. Afterwards, each member of the Student Council arrives at the temporary office with a flower pot, prompting all three to start laughing.[74]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThirteen Party Arc\nZenkichi approaches Unzen\nZenkichi approaches Unzen.\n\nAfter overhearing him discuss the Flask Plan, Shiranui approaches Unzen with Zenkichi.[75] As Unzen describes his sister, Myouga Unzen, Shiranui looks oblivious.[76] Zenkichi listens as Unzen continues to describe his sister, claiming that he and Medaka are the only normal people in Class 13, while his sister is a total nonconformist who speaks a math language. When Zenkichi asks if Myouga is the fighting type, Unzen states that she is, though she has never once been able to beat him in a fight.[77] Having learned all he can from Unzen, Zenkichi seeks out Medaka to warn her about Myouga. Zenkichi asks Shiranui if she knows anything about the Flask Plan, but she reminds him that she is just one of the chairman's many grandchildren, and that he should be more concerned about Medaka. As the pair searches, they are spotted by Oudo Miyakonojou, who orders them to tell him where he can find the suggestion box.[78]\n\nZenkichi forced to kneel\nZenkichi forced to kneel.\n\nZenkichi is overawed by Oudo, recognizing how dangerous a situation he is in just by the fact that Shiranui has run away without trying to make things any worse for him. [79] When Oudo's Weighted Words force Zenkichi to his knees, he is stunned to find that he can't move. Mizou Yukuhashi steps out from behind a tree and explains Oudo's Abnormality to Zenkichi, causing Zenkichi to wonder where all the weirdoes have come from. When Medaka arrives, Zenkichi is at first relived, [80] though his relief quickly turns to horror when Oudo forces her to prostrate herself. Concerned, Zenkichi wonders what Oudo has planned.[81] When Oudo tires to kiss Medaka, an outraged Zenkichi lunges at him, only to be caught by Yukuhashi before his attack can connect.[82] As Yukuhashi leaves, Zenkichi thanks him for stopping his attack. Yukuhashi remarks that Zenkichi is strange, before telling him that whether or not they get involved in the Flask Plan, they won't be able to have a normal high school life anymore now that Oudo has set his eyes on them. Afterwards, Medaka and Zenkichi discuss what they each have learnt. Medaka thanks Zenkichi for helping her out, then declares she will reform Oudo with a smile on her face. When Zenkichi points out that she is smiling, she is surprised, having not realized she was doing so. Zenkichi realizes that Medaka must be happy to have met others who are on the same level as her, and that he was only getting in her way. Deciding that he needs to get stronger as well, Zenkichi asks Medaka how she plans to train, and is surprised to learn she intends to visit her brother.[83]\n\nMedaka and Zenkichi ready to train\nMedaka and Zenkichi ready to train.\n\nZenkichi and Medaka arrive at the Ghost Babel to meet Maguro.[84] Zenkichi reminds Medaka that she needs to smile.[85] He is amazed when Maguro's hug sends Medaka into War God Mode, and when she punches him into a wall. He reminds her that they are there to ask for help. He is more amazed by Medaka's attempts to ask her brother for help. When Maguro analyzes Medaka's current physical state, Zenkichi is reminded of how Maguro came to be recognized as such a skilled trainer. He is taken aback when Maguro compliments him, but reminds himself that he cannot take those compliments seriously. He watches without comment as Medaka grills her brother about the Flask Plan. Zenkichi is stunned when he sees Maguro's scars. He thinks to himself that he had not realized there were such deep reasons for Maguro dropping out of school and stopping being consultant.[86] Watching Maguro and Medaka, Zenkichi thinks to himself that he cannot really ask Maguro to train him as well. He questions Medaka how she plans to get ready by tomorrow, only for Maguro to ask him to keep protecting his sister, and inviting him to train as well. Moved, Zenkichi can only embarrassedly consent. Maguro offers the pair two training courses. Option A will be hell, and won't guarantee that they will get any stronger. Option B will put them to sleep, and then they will wake up stronger. Both pick Option A without hesitation. Twelve hours later, it is six in the morning on July 15th.[87]\n\nZenkichi defends Medaka\nZenkichi defends Medaka.\n\nZenkichi arrives with Medaka to confront Oudo on the top of the clock tower.[88] Both he and Medaka are able to resist when Oudo orders them to kneel, and continue to do so when he orders them to prostrate themselves. As Oudo prepares to use physical force, Zenkichi jumps between him and Medaka. Oudo expresses his annoyance, and moves to get rid of Zenkichi (misremembering his name as \"Hitokichi\"). Furious, Zenkichi kicks Oudo off the clock tower. Realizing what he has done, he runs to the edge and calls out to Oudo. He and Medaka are stunned to see Oudo standing on the side of the tower. He and Medaka listen with steadily growing horror as Oudo describes the Flask Plan, and how the entire student body will be turned into guinea pigs once the process is complete. After Oudo leaves, Zenkichi asks Medaka what she intends to do, who answers that the two of them are going to destroy the Flask Plan that day.[89]\n\nZenkichi and Akune pass through the Door of Rejection\nZenkichi and Akune pass through the Door of Rejection.\n\nAt the Student Council office, Zenkichi and Medaka find the suggestion box overflowing with complaints about Class 13. The two discuss how Class 13 is disrupting the school for the other students, and Zenkichi mentions that even the Public Morals Committee are having problems. When Medaka tells Zenkichi that they are heading to the Flask Plan labs now, he questions whether they should get Akune and Kikaijima. Medaka replies in the negative, stating that those two won't be good for a physical fight, to which Zenkichi agrees. Zenkichi and Medaka arrive at the entrance to the Flask Plan labs, the Door of Rejection, guarded by Sanou Tsushima and Unou Tsushima. The twins inform them about the rules of the door, amazing Zenkichi that the members of the Thirteen Party do this sort of thing every day. After Medaka moves on, Zenkichi wonders how he can possibly get through the door. He is surprised to find that Akune and Kikaijima have come, and is more surprised when he is told it was Shiranui who explained to them what was going on. Zenkichi tries to convince them to turn back, only to be amazed when Kikaijima passes through the door. Akune explains to Zenkichi that Medaka told them what number code to enter next if they wanted to get through (Zenkichi's birth date). As Akune begins tearing down the door with force, Zenkichi thinks to himself that he had forgotten Akune's middle school title: Destroyer. After one hundred and fifty-two strikes, the door crumbles, and Zenkichi and Akune move on into the labs.[90]\n\nZenkichi and Akune unsuccessfully try to attack Takachiho\nZenkichi and Akune unsuccessfully try to attack Takachiho.\n\nThe Student Council comes to another door, which the Tsushima twins identify as an elevator. However, Zenkichi and the others follow Medaka, who chooses to forego the elevator in favor of the stairs.[91] Zenkichi and Akune discuss what they intend to do as they encounter members of the Thirteen Party. Zenkichi expresses his surprise at Akune's resolve, but assures the older boy that he doesn't need to look out for him. They are both told off by Medaka the next moment however, who points out that they have been walking in circles. When the Tsushima brothers reveal the first floor is a maze, Zenkichi questions why they are following them. When he hears that Medaka and Kikaijima went to an amusement park together, he is very upset that he wasn't invited.[92] Zenkichi and Akune both complain about their eardrums after Kikaijima's shout, though they are silenced when the Tsushima twins explains what she has done. When Shigusa Takachiho appears, Zenkichi and Akune both attack him, only to be effortlessly avoided, though Zenkichi thinks to himself it felt more like they avoided him.[93]\n\nThe Student Council takes cover\nThe Student Council takes cover.\n\nZenkichi watches on as Takachiho confronts Medaka.[94][95] He expresses his surprise when Medaka takes a stance He is horrified when Takachiho knees Medaka in the face, and calls him a cheater.[96] He and the others run to Medaka's side when she is dropped by Takachiho's kick.[97] Like the rest of the Student Council, he is unable to react when Takachiho takes back his flash drive.

He expresses his confidence at seeing Medaka's clones in action.[100] He is horrified when Takachiho breaks Medaka's arm. He tries to run to her side, but Medaka orders him not to interfere.[101] Hearing Takachiho's assessment of Medaka's lack of reflexes, Zenkichi is unimpressed, thinking to himself how Medaka never tried to keep that a secret. He worries though that Medaka is having too much trouble for the opponent on only the first floor. He continues to think to himself that the Thirteen Party are like the missing parts of Medaka's personality. When Medaka removes her shoes, he immediately orders Akune, Kikaijima, and the Tsushima twins to back up.[102] He and the others are amazed by Medaka's Kurokami Phantom.[103]\n\nZenkichi and a wounded Medaka\nZenkichi and a wounded Medaka.\n\nAs Medaka collapses, Zenkichi runs to her side.

The group makes to leave, but Takachiho demands that Medaka wait. He tells Medaka to ignore him, but relents after realizing that Medaka wants to fight someone on equal footing as well.[105] They are all three surprised when the two simply start punching one another.[106] Zenkichi is visibly unsettled when Takachiho starts laughing. After Takachiho manages to dodge one of Medaka's attacks, Zenkichi sees that he dodged with both a combination of reflexes and judgment.[107] After Medaka defeats Takachiho, Zenkichi thinks to himself that Medaka only just learned how to turn her reflexes on, and that by entering the Flask Plan labs, she is becoming an experiment for the project all the same.[108] The Student Council then head down to the next floor.[109]\n\nZenkichi versus Munakata\nZenkichi versus Munakata.\n\nZenkichi is surprised when the Student Council reaches the second floor, a large biotope, and is further surprised when Kei Munakata tells them he will not try to stop them.[110] He is shocked when Munakata tries to cut Medaka's head off.

He removes his jacket and takes a stance, telling Munakata he won't die even if he is killed.[114] Zenkichi thinks back to middle school and Kumagawa, and decides he will fight Munakata to protect Medaka. Munakata offers Zenkichi a sword, though Zenkichi does not take the bait.[115] Munakata attacks, only for Zenkichi to knock his sword out of his hands. As Munakata draws multiple swords and attacks again, Zenkichi methodically disarms him. When Munakata draws a pair of sledgehammers, Zenkichi asks him if he is City Hunter's partner.[116] Zenkichi manages to physically overpower Munakata and knock the sledgehammers away, forcing Munakata to jump back.[117]\n\nZenkichi impaled\nZenkichi impaled.\n\nAfter Munakata reveals a spiked staff, a shocked Zenkichi asks if he can borrow it. Despite Munakata's claims that the staff cannot be blocked, Zenkichi manages to redirect it with his shirt, and knee Munakata in the chest, knocking him to the ground. Munakata then takes out two guns, a Smith & Wesson 44 Magnum, and a Desert Eagle, giving Zenkichi pause.[118] Zenkichi kicks away Munakata's guns before he can use them. He disassembles them immediately, saying that he read up on guns in case something like this ever happened.

Munakata tells Zenkichi to give up, but Zenkichi jocularly accuses the killer of not wanting to kill, infuriating him. He asks Medaka for some encouragement, and after she does so, stomps on the ground with great force. Munakata wonders what Zenkichi is doing; Zenkichi claims that the kick will be enough to defeat him.[124] After the blades fall from the ceiling, Zenkichi reveals he had planned to drop them from the very beginning. As Zenkichi begins to fall, Maguro catches him, and congratulates him on a job well done. When Akune recommends they turn Munakata over to the authorities, Zenkichi reveals Munakata has never killed anyone.[125] Zenkichi declares that Munakata is not a killer, pointing out that with all his injuries, he would be dead if Munakata was seriously trying to kill him. He listens as Munakata explains his Abnormality, and his actions to control it. Munakata then tells Zenkichi he feels he could get along with him, and asks the younger boy if he wants to be friends with him. Zenkichi states that, after risking their lives in battle, they are already friends. Zenkichi offers Munakata his hand, who takes it. Zenkichi is bandaged by Maguro.[126]\n\nKikaijima and Medaka search through the Flask Plan\nZenkichi and the girls search through the Flask Plan.\n\nThe Student Council heads down to the third floor, a zoo.

He and Maguro discuss this animal's strange behavior.[128] Zenkichi kicks at the shutters sealing the rest of the Student Council off from Akune. Zenkichi expresses his frustration that Akune got separated while Medaka and Kikaijima were quarreling. Medaka tells him not to worry about Akune however, and suggests they worry about themselves instead.[129] While Medaka and Kikaijima form one search group, Zenkichi and the Tsushima twins form another, though they quickly start arguing.[130]\n\nZenkichi and Akune argue\nZenkichi and Akune argue.\n\nAfter suggesting they regroup above ground, Zenkichi is slammed up against the wall by a furious Akune.

He is shocked by the arrival of the Loser Team.[131] Zenkichi expresses his amazement at the gathered members of the Loser Team, having thought they all died after their battles. He is touched when he hears Shiranui called them, though is less impressed when he hears she just made a Twitter post. He worries that the 98% approval rating of the Student Council has fallen. Though he is grateful to the Loser Team for coming, he points out that all most all of them are injured. As Unzen tries to ignore his protests, Zenkichi become insistent; if Medaka hears people got hurt trying to save her, she will definitely cry, something Zenkichi never wants to see again. Everyone is put out when Nabeshima suggests they use the elevator.[132] The Student Council and the Loser Team gather outside the elevator.[133] With the arrival of the Plus Six, Unzen orders the Student Council to take the stairs. Zenkichi tries to refuse, but Unzen demands they save Medaka, as they won't survive the Plus Six otherwise. Zenkichi and the others run for the stairs, Zenkichi promising that they will be back as soon as possible.[134]\n\nYukuhashi knocks out the Student Council\nYukuhashi knocks out the Student Council.\n\nThe Student Council arrives at the twelfth floor.

He is shocked when he finds an unconscious Medaka on the ground. He runs to her side, and asks how she escaped. After listening to her story, Zenkich urges that hey hurry back to the first floor to aid Unzen. After \"Medaka\" asks to borrow his jacket however, Zenkichi realizes that the person in front of him cannot be the exhibitionist Medaka. He demands to know the imposter's identity, but upon seeing the mask recognizes Yukuhashi. Zenkichi and the others are shocked when Yukuhashi admits to being uninterested in the Flask Plan, and is only participating to observe Oudo.

Despite this, Zenkichi physically rips his hands away from Kikaijima, and confronts Oudo on brainwashing Medaka. Oudo asks the Student Council if any of them have ever wanted Medaka to change, citing that Medaka changes, or \"brainwashes\", people all the time. Though Zenkichi tries to argue, his efforts are undermined by Yukuhashi, who points out that Zenkichi is the one who opposes what Medaka does the most. Before Zenkichi can retort, he is interrupted by the arrival of Medaka.[142] Zenkichi is shocked by the arrival of Medaka, now going by the moniker Medaka II. He demands that Oudo explain what he has done.[143] He is horrified when Medaka II tells the Student Council that from now on, they will support the Flask Plan, and she will be joining the Thirteen Party. Zenkichi and the others try and make her see reason; when they refuse to go along with her, she dismisses all three of them. They are not disheartened however, and instead decide that they will go along with the wishes of the old Medaka.[144] Zenkichi and the others are driven to their knees when Medaka II use Oudo's Weighted Words on them.[145] While Medaka II is distracted by Maguro, Zenkichi manages to regain control of himself and attack her.

Medaka II straddles him, and wraps her hands around his throat. Zenkichi tells her to kill him, as he can't stand the sight of her. When she asks him if he remembers what he told her thirteen years ago, he replies that he doesn't, but that she is probably talking about when he told her she was born to bring happiness to others. He reiterates that he doesn't remember, but that he has always believed Medaka was that kind of person. Zenkichi is shocked when Medaka II begins trying to brainwash herself. He grabs her hands and tells her to stop, stating that he doesn't want her to destroy herself trying to go back to normal. Zenkichi then pulls her into a hug, telling her that if she wants to make others happy, she needs to be sure to make herself happy first. He is startled when Medaka II abruptly leaves his embrace and rises to her feet. He addresses her as Medaka II, and she tells him to call her Medaka.[152] Zenkichi tells her that he always gets into trouble when he's with her, and then asks her why she was born.[153]\n\nThe Student Council and the Thirteen Party in the elevator\nThe Student Council and the Thirteen Party in the elevator.\n\nZenkichi listens on as Medaka declares her intent to rid the school of the Flask Plan.[154] He follows the others down to the thirteenth floor.[155] Upon reaching the final floor, Zenkichi hugs himself for warmth, and asks why it is so cold.[156] Zenkichi listens on as Oudo describes the merits of the Flask Plan.[157] Hearing Medaka describe the \"nightmare\" of a complete person she has met before, Zenkichi recognizes that she is talking about Kumagawa.[158] He is surprised when Oudo attacks Itami Koga.[159] Zenkichi is alarmed when Oudo sends Medaka flying.[160] He is disturbed to hear Oudo brush off Yukuhashi's collapse as no big loss.[161] Zenkichi is confused, recognizing that Medaka has entered War God Mode, but that it is a little different.[162] Zenkichi is surprised by Maguro's description of Medaka's Abnormality, having believed that Medaka's Abnormality was a high level modeling ability or something similar.[163] Zenkichi is silent as he listens to Maguro speak.[164] Zenkichi is horrified when Medaka does not resist Oudo's Unreasonable Taxation, but is stopped from running to her by Maguro.[165] Zenkichi looks on as Oudo tries to take Medaka's Abnormality.[166] He is surprised to see Oudo bow to Medaka.[167] Zenkichi inner thoughts narrate as the Student Council and the Thirteen Party prepare to leave, Zenkichi feeling somewhat uncomfortable that Medaka decided to let Oudo off the hook in the end.

When someone calls out to the group, Zenkichi demands to know who is there.[169]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nKumagawa Incident Arc\nZenkichi terrified\nZenkichi terrified.\n\nSeeing Kumagawa, Zenkichi starts shaking uncontrollably. Though disgusted by his own fear, he finds himself unable to regain his composure until Medaka wraps an arm around his shoulders. Kumagawa gets in Zenkichi's face, sneering at him for their impossibly different personalities, before shifting away his attention to Akune.[170] Zenkichi stands by as Kumagawa addresses the group, but is horrified to hear that Kumagawa has transferred to Hakoniwa Academy.[171] Zenkichi tells Nabeshima that trying to figure out Kumagawa is pointless, but that whatever his reason for transferring, Hakoniwa Academy is no longer the site for the Flask Plan.[172] After leaving the underground, Zenkichi phones Shiranui to warn her about Kumagawa. He also thanks her for getting the Loser Team together. She laughs at his thanks, and hangs up on him. Questioned by Medaka, he tells her Shiranui seems to be in a bad mood.

He remarks that it is rare for Medaka to make the first move; they only ran into Kumagawa the day before, but she is already researching him. When Akune arrives with Hitomi, Zenkichi is very uncomfortable. He admits that though he and Hitomi look alike, they are not siblings; Hitomi is his mother. Zenkichi faces away from the others as they talk with Hitomi.[175] Zenkichi finally loses his cool and demands Hitomi tell him what she is doing at school, asking if she has any idea how embarrassed he is. Akune suggests he stop, worried about how Medaka or Kikaijima might react. Hitomi further admonishes him, fussing over his appearance. Zenkichi finds he can't argue with her when she reminds him he came home with his back full of holes.[176] Zenkichi asks Hitomi if she intends to come to school every day, and hearing that she is, asks if she intends to enter as an infirmary doctor. He is appalled to find she joined as a student in his own class. He gets annoyed as Hitomi teases him, and tells her not to sit in Shiranui's seat, even if his best friend is absent.[177] After school ends, Zenkichi runs to try and get away from his mother, having been embarrassed by her throughout the day. He is thankful Shiranui was absent, thinking that she would have laughed at his troubles. Remembering that Shiranui seemed strange the previous day, Zenkichi decides to visit her on his way home. Distracted, he runs into Mukae Emukae, and knocks her down. Knowing nothing about her, he innocently offers her his hand.[178]\n\nZenkichi runs up a wall with Emukae\nZenkichi runs up a wall with Emukae.\n\nWatching Emukae, Zenkichi wonders if he hit her head in a bad spot. When his mother shows up, Zenkichi is exasperated, and decides to escape. Deciding that he can't leave Emukae behind, he picks her up bridal style and runs up the side of a building to its roof.[179] Exhausted afterwards, he remarks that running up a wall is hard, and asks Emukae if she is alright. After she introduces herself and goes off on a tangent about their future together, a stunned Zenkichi agrees with her. To himself, he is horrified by what she has heard, and after noticing her uniform, hopes she is somehow linked to Kumagawa, as he does not want to think a normal person could be like this. He tries to leave, but is stabbed in the foot by Emukae, who demands he stays. Zenkichi kicks her, knocking her back, but asks if she is alright once he has composed himself somewhat. He asks her if she feels pain, but is unnerved to hear that her love is greater than any pain.[180] Zenkichi is relieved when his mother arrives.[181] Zenkichi tells Hitomi to go easy on Emukae, as he has already injured her himself. He is horrified when Hitomi uses a fully powered kick on Emukae, telling her that no one should ever go all out on a girl aside from Medaka.[182] When Hitomi collapses, Zenkichi makes to run to her side, but is stopped by Hitomi, who tells him the wind is blowing from that direction.

Zenkichi later joins with the Student Council, Youka Naze, and Koga to discuss how they should handle the Minuses. He suggests they team up with the Public Morals Committee, but that idea is shot down by Naze. When Medaka recommends seeking help from Kuudou Hinokage, Zenkichi explains to everyone else that Hinokage was the Student Council president preceding Medaka; the man who, despite never being remembered, protected the school. Zenkichi goes on to remark that Hinokage wasn't called Mister Unknown, because no one could remember him.[185] When Medaka and Naze return, Zenkichi has already forgotten about Hinokage. He is surprised by Hinokage's sudden appearance. He fails Hinokage's examination.[186] He and Akune are upset to be labeled as unqualified to fight Class -13.

Zenkichi assures Shiranui that they are still friends, and leaves after promising to have barbecue after the conflict is over.[195] He later shows up at the Ghost Babel with the suggestion box, to convince the others that they cannot use sly tactics such as throwing the General Affairs Manager's Battle.[196] On July twenty-fifth, Zenkichi arrives at the Student Council office ready to fight, only to embarrassed as he finds the ladies changing. Arriving at the meeting place, they are surprised to find Kumagawa is the only one present.[197] Naze explains who Tokemichi Choujabaru is.

At Kumagawa's offer to restore his eyesight in return for his friendship, Zenkichi thinks to himself that he should agree, having already won the match. Zenkichi rejects Kumagawa however, resolving to defeat him now. He confesses his love to Medaka, then knocks Kumagawa back before stomping down to send the netting to the bottom of the pit.[212] Kumagawa tries to save himself with All Fiction, but Zenkichi interrupts him, stating they can die together even as Kumagawa pleas for mercy.[213]\n\nAjimu and Zenkichi in the classroom\nZenkichi and Ajimu in the classroom.\n\nThe Election Management Committee try to revive both Zenkichi and Kumagawa.[214] However, Zenkichi's heart stops.

While he wonders whether he is in hell, a voice calls out from behind him, telling him there is no life after death. He turns around to find a girl sitting behind him, whose shoes are labeled with \"Ajimu\". Zenkichi wonders if she is the great king Yama, but she once again reminds him that he is not in hell. She then tells he didn't kill Kumagawa either, though he shouldn't be surprised.[215] Ajimu goes on to explain that Kumagawa's All Fiction interacts with the law of causality, and that he cannot die because of it. She tells Zenkichi he is lucky that he didn't become a murderer. When Zenkichi laments that he himself died, Ajimu corrects him; his heart stopped due to the shock from his injuries, so she took his consciousness away. When Zenkichi asks who she is, she tells him if he can't remember, then she is no one. She then goes on to tell him that Kumagawa met her to, and that he meets the \"her\" inside of his heart every-time he dies. Ajimu tells Zenkichi that she has restored his eyesight, and to come back once the competition is over. Her parting words to him are the order not to make Medaka cry anymore. Zenkichi awakens to find his sight restored.[216] He is confused by Kumagawa's taunting, but horrified to learn that the other Minuses are attacking the rest of the Student Council during their training.[217] The Student Council arrive in the parking lot head to the parking lot to help their allies. They find them with worse injuries than Zenkichi's; they treat the others at Naze's lab before sending them to the hospital. Afterward, Medaka, Zenkichi, Hitomi, Naze, and Koga meet to decide what they will do next.[218] Still in the meeting room, Zenkichi and Hitomi are surprised to find Medaka can use a cellphone.

He reminds her that the main opponent is Emukae, not Kumagawa.[254] Finding Kumagawa and Emuake, Hitomi attacks what she thinks is Kumagawa. It is however only a dummy, and Kumagawa attacks Zenkichi from behind. He then orders Emukae to separate them, Emuake and Zenkichi ending up together.[255] Zenkichi tells Emukae to surrender, noting that the color of his eyes is different today.[256] With his enhanced sight, Zenkichi dodges Emuake's attacks with minimal effort.[257] In retaliation, Emukae summons several plants in the shape of humans to attack Zenkichi.

He interviews the prospective student Tsugiha Yojirou, and although he finds her mindset odd, he finds her acceptable and warns her that at Hakoniwa Academy, one's life can be easily overturned.\n\nLater Medaka announces the Treasure Hunt challenge. The 5 candidates as well as the Zenkichi, Akune, Kikajima, and Kumagawa will participate. She mentions that the winner will have his/her request granted. Zenkichi requested that should he win, he'll have Kumagawa's armband. With that the challenge begins with a cryptogram.

Ajimu tells him that she already handled it.\n\nAjimu tells Zenkichi that he doesn't need to fight with himself and that he needs a skill. Zenkichi tells her that he is a normal and can't have a skill. Ajimu then introduces Hanten's skill, which can create skills. Ajimu suggests that he chooses one skill to become a main character. Zenkichi requests his skill, which amazes Ajimu. After a while, Ajimu is in silence, worrying Zenkichi which Shiranui made a remark about it. Ajimu is impressed about the skill that Zenkichi thought up and apologizes for underestimating him.

He is surprised to see Emukae in her civillian clothes, he then notices Ajimu's appearance from three years ago and remembers her. Ajimu greets Zenkichi and announced the start of the Flask Plan phase 1: \"to win against her\". Zenkichi is fighting against Ajimu with the help of Emukae and realizes he can not win. Ajimu makes Zenkichi decide what a win for him is and Zenkichi thinks through how he can beat Medaka.

With that Ajimu ends the first phase: realizing your own feelings and declares that a love comedy will begin.\n\nThe next day, Zenkichi is doing his work for the Student Council and acts normal even to Medaka. Medaka wonders if Zenkichi does not want to fight anymore, which made the former apologize to her and the rest of the Student Council. Zenkichi then tells Medaka that he hasn't stopped trying to defeat her and leaves with a smirk. Zenkichi is delighted and encounters Tsurubami. He calls Zenkichi by the name \"\"Heat\". Tsuburami tells him that he is disappointed in Zenkichi that he fights for love, which made Zenkichi reply that it is not emberassing.

Tsurubami wonders how Zenkichi will get a 100% approval rate, which Zenkichi replies that it will an enamored loss and that Medaka will fall for him and wants Medaka to be as happy as him. Tsurubami finds it an impure motivation, but Zenkichi says that if somebody wants to be happy that he will make them happy, including Tsurubami. Ajimu appears and discusses with Zenkichi that it will be too late in April and is going to change the date and declares that this will end before the anime starts.\n\nThe sport's festival started and Zenkichi participated in the \"king of tug war\" with the entire student body against Medaka.

Zenkichi with Akune and Kikaijima stand in front of Medaka who is with a drum set. Zenkichi gets worried about it. Medaka starts drumming, which makes Kikaijima and Akune amazed. Zenkichi points them out that Medaka's skills are amazing, but there is no emotion behind it. Zenkichi decides that Medaka shouldn't on stage since it will ruin the concert and calls out Medaka to withdraw since she would be in his way. Medaka gets delighted to see Zenkichi to stand up to her and threatens that she will bent all his bones if he loses. Zenkichi is not scared and accepts the challenge saying that all his bones are already bent. Zenkichi decides the positions of the bands and appoints Kikaijima to be the singer.\n\nAt the culture festival, before Zenkichi has to come on stage he tries to relax Kikaijima, but she blames what happened between him and Medaka is Zenkichi's fault.

Zenkichi is happy for the naked apron alliance that this fight will be the best. Kumagawa wonders why Zenkichi doesn't confess this instant, which made the former reply that at his current state he can't be alongside her. Kumagawa tells him that there is a chance that Medaka might die and sees a loser in Zenkichi for waiting and welcomes him to Class 13. Zenkichi furiously kicks Kumagawa's head, thanking him for that and leaves.\n\nThe election starts and Zenkichi gives his speech after the candidate student council, he calls the academy to be awfull and that the people who made requests to Medaka to be shamefull for themselves for using Medaka to fix their problems. The fights that Medaka had were not the real enemies, but declared the ones who seeked help from her are the real enemies. He tells them that Medaka wanted to be overly perfect. Also that he wanted to change her but the people who needed change where the ones who requested and let Medaka live in peace and declares that they should defeat Medaka.

With a sigh, Zenkichi promises to talk with Medaka, but tells the students that they should be glad Medaka has finally become a kid like them.[302] One week later, Zenkichi is informed by his new general affairs manager Kudaki Torai that Medaka, Ajimu, Hanten, Shiranui, Kumagawa, and Tsurubami have been missing for the past seven days. Labeling the six as the academy's top troublemakers, Zenkichi decides the Student Council will go find them, despite Torai's protests.

As Torai again expresses her unwillingness to leave the school, Zenkichi tells her that while he did come to foil the suitors, he is also concerned about the All Jokers, noting that they all share a weakness that could be used to capture them. He begins to elaborate, but then knocks Torai to the ground, as the helicopter splits in half.[304] As Namanie Nienami steps forward, Zenkichi is surprised to see one of the suitors is a girl. He tells Torai to hide, then orders the others to use formation thirty-two.

Using his arms alone, he cuts through Nienami's top, revealing that he will use a two sword style to defeat her. Zenkichi is surprised when Nienami reveals another six swords hidden beneath her skirt. After she stabs the blades through her arms, Zenkichi questions her sanity, and asks if she can feel pain at all. Questioned by Nienami, Zenkichi states that he will be the one to marry Medaka. He remembers when he cut Medaka's hair, and charges Nienami, declaring that he is fighting for Medaka's tomorrow. Nienami cuts his arms; Zenkichi tells her he will use his legs, only to find they have been slashed as well. In retaliation, Zenkichi bites Nienami's shoulder, declaring his twenty-eight swords (his teeth) will trump her seven. He lets go at Nienami's insistence, and puts his glasses back on as his hair returns to its normal color.

Wanizuka notices something on the wing, and asks Zenkichi how high and how fast the plane is going. After he answers,[311] Zenkichi is shocked to see Sui Kanaino on the wing. He asks Nienami if she is a suitor. Hearing that she is, he laments that they have no way to fight back, only to be stunned as Naze exits the jet to confront her. He explains to Torai that Naze can manipulate her body temperature. He is horrified when Naze jumps to avoid Kanaino's attack, but is amazed to see Naze is fine. Hearing that Naze cut the engines to avoid the wind pressure, Zenkichi remarks that Naze is as prepared as usual.[312] Torai asks what Kanaino is doing, referring to her as four eyes, prompting Zenkichi to remind her that she is a four eyes as well.

He watches on as Kanaino insults Naze.[316] Like the others, Zenkichi is appalled by Naze's smile of masochistic pleasure.[317] Zenkichi listens on as Naze explains Kanaino's style.[318] Still watching the fight, Zenkichi worries upon hearing Kanaino is a style user like Tsurubami, and thinks that the scenario is worse than he could have imagined.

As they head back to the plane, Zenkichi promises to explain the riddle to Torai en route, only to find the jet disassembled by Mogura Kugurugi.[324] Zenkichi is surprised by Naze's anger, and is unimpressed by Kugurugi's grandstanding.

Kumagawa tells Zenkichi that he should solve the riddle quickly since the jet repairs will take a while. Zenkichi asks Kumagawa why he was so late to the fight; Kumagawa admits he wanted to hear Emukae's confession first, much to Zenkichi's annoyance. He then goes on to explain Medaka's coded message, revealing it secretly contains the names of several students of Hakoniwa Academy. Each name correlates to a day of the week – the only day missing is Monday, indicating that the Student Council needs to head to the moon.[333] After crashing into Bukiko Udou's rocket with the Student Council's jet, Zenkichi and his group emerge almost entirely unscathed.

He is visibly hurt when she responds in the positive, and tells him that she only became his friend to get close to Medaka.[351] After Shiranui expresses her true feelings concerning her stay at Hakoniwa Academy, Zenkichi asks if she cannot return at least for the third semester, so that she can say a proper farewell.[352] Zenkichi is surprised by the arrival of Iihiko Shishime, horrified to see what the giant has done to Obi and Shiranui.[353][354] In a rage, Zenkichi attacks Iihiko. He shocked is to find his attack completely ineffective. Mistaking Zenkichi for a mosquito, Iihiko crushes Zenkichi with his palm. Zenkichi survives the attack, but is left severely injured as a result.[355] When Medaka acquiesces to Ajimu's order to flee, she takes everyone else in the room with her, including Zenkichi.[356] Medaka carries the group to Ajimu's jeep.[357] Zenkichi remains unconscious as Medaka faces Iihiko, though Iihiko takes his glasses to use as a weapon against Medaka.[358][359] After the Thirteen Party arrive at the Shiranui Village, Zenkichi and Kumagawa are evacuated on board their armored truck.[360]\n\nZenkichi unresponsive to treatment\nZenkichi unresponsive to treatment.\n\nBack at the academy, Zenkichi is treated by Aoki Aka, though his wounds refuse to close and he remains unconscious.[361] Still comatose, Zenkichi dreams about his first meeting with Shiranui. As the dream continues, he realizes that he is remembering the day he first met Shiranui in April.[362] Seeing the day in a new light with his knowledge of Shiranui's true intentions, Zenkichi tries to match the Shiranui he knew with the Shiranui he met in the Shiranui Village. When Shiranui drops her eraser, Zenkichi wonders what would happen if he didn't pick it up.[363] However, despite knowing that it is just a ploy, Zenkichi picks up the eraser again, and makes the same introduction he did the first time. As their go through their introductions once again, Zenkichi thinks how he already knows who Shiranui is, and that they will be friends from then on. Zenkichi regains consciousness shortly after, and thanks his mother. With the arrival of Medaka, he states that the only things that scare him are her exhibitionism and Shiranui's appetite. Back in uniform, he asks Medaka for their plan as the group makes their way out of the academy. Hearing that they will be going after Fukurou Tsurubami, Zenkichi expresses his worry at chasing after the dead man behind the Jet Black Wedding Feast. Nienami asks where Fukurou is hiding, which prompts Zenkichi to ask whether she was with Medaka, and then to ask why she is with Medaka in the first place. Having not forgotten his bite, Nienami tells him to shut up.[364]\n\nMedaka's group realize they have turned into children\nMedaka's group realize they have turned into children.\n\nThe group boards a train to reach Hakoniwa General Hospital. Wearing a white wig, Nienami imitates Ajimu, a tasteless joke that causes the others to collapse. After dealing with Nienami, the remaining four sit down to discuss how to counter Iihiko. Zenkichi suggests non-recovery skills, particularly the Minuses.[365] He is surprised to hear that skills will not work, but wonders why Medaka is so sure styles will.[366] He expresses his discomfort that they need to rely on Fukurou, who caused all the fuss of the Jet Black Wedding Feast, and questions how the man could have survived. Zenkichi is caught off guard when Medaka questions why Fukurou developed the styles in the first place.[367] Using bicycles to complete the journey, the group arrives at the hospital ruins.[368] [369] Making their way through the hospital ruins, Zenkichi remarks that the place is more like a maze. He is upset when Kumagawa states that this was the place he first kissed Hitomi. Zenkichi wonders why Medaka cannot simply learn a style with her The End, pointing out that Fukurou has not taught his styles to very many. Along with the rest, he is shocked to discover they have turned into children. Zenkichi realizes it was after they entered the corridor, as that was when their flashlights disappeared. He is surprised to see that their injuries from Iihiko have disappeared as well. Zenkichi asks Nienami if she knows anything, though is annoyed by her answering pose.[370]\n\nKotobuki and her victims\nKotobuki and her victims.\n\nAs the group discusses their predicament, Zenkichi states that he can't hear anything. Nienami tells him he shouldn't doubt his friends, especially ones that lend him money. Zenkichi snaps at her, and even asks Medaka why Nienami is with them.[371] As the discussion continues, Zenkichi again states that he cannot hear anything. He asks Kumagawa if can use All Fiction to change them back; Kumagawa tells him he cannot. As Medaka advances forward, Zenkichi tries to pull her back, but is stopped by Nienami, though he remains worried as Medaka shrinks further.[372] When Joutou Kotobuki sneaks up behind the group, Zenkichi and the others are reduced to babies. Medaka starts to charge in anger, but Zenkichi stops her with his baby sounds. He is scooped up by Kotobuki, but distracts her from Medaka by slapping her face.[373] Kotobuki playfully asks the babies where Medaka is. Of course, the babies do not have a coherent answer. Seeing that Zenkichi looked away from the vent when she asked, Kotobuki pulls out a submachine gun and blows out the vent.[374] As Kotobuki starts singing again, Zenkichi notices that they won't become any younger than toddlers.[375] As Medaka is about to attack Kotobuki, she finds the babies are strapped to Kotobuki like a suit of armor, forcing her to pull back.[376] Nienami knows full well that Medaka would never take a chance to harm her friends, while an aggravated Zenkichi tells Nienami that she talks like she knows everything about Medaka.[377] Medaka kicks Kotobuki, sending a vibration that only harms her target and not the babies. With Kotobuki defeated, the group returns to their normal age, including their wounds. Zenkichi and Kumagawa are glad that Medaka beat the suitor. They also note that Medaka used weaving motions to defeat Kotobuki, which is abnormal since Medaka always uses direct attacks and motions. Because of this and her indirectness during the final battle of the Jet Black Wedding Feast, Zenkichi thinks she might have a style. Kakegae Yuzuriha appears behind the group, expressing her slight surprise that Kotobuki lost. Medaka tells everyone else to go on ahead while she stays to fight her former suitor. Zenkichi objects, but Medaka reminds him that their goal is to save Shiranui first and foremost. Reluctantly, Zenkichi and the others leave.[378]\n\nZenkichi comes to Shiranui's rescue\nZenkichi comes to Shiranui's rescue.\n\nIn some hallway, Zenkichi and the others get lost, but find Shiranui waiting for them. Zenkichi is shocked, asking if Shiranui was the one who sent Yuzuriha after them. Shiranui tells Zenkichi to be quiet, since she is trying to speak with Kumagawa. Kumagawa grabs Zenkichi's shoulder, and uses All Fiction to make him disappear.[379] Before Kumagawa can finish Shiranui off with his Book Maker, Zenkichi appears and stops Kumagawa's screws. Zenkichi says he knows what Kumagawa was trying to do, but asks to hit him once. Kumagawa smiles and says that he wants to say once again he could not win, but Zenkichi punches him to the ground before he finishes. Zenkichi explains to Shiranui how he returned, and asks if she is alright. Shiranui throws herself on him and tearfully apologizes for everything that has happened, asking to be saved. Zenkichi smiles and hugs her back. Zenkichi and Shiranui prepare to beat up Kumagawa, but are interrupted by his cell phone. The caller is Obi, who, after Kumagawa hands the phone over to Shiranui, warns them that Iihiko is on the way.[380][381] Zenkichi arrives at Fukurou's office with Shiranui and Kumagawa. Though he can understand Fukurou's rationale, he refuses to hand Shiranui over to him. He is annoyed by Nienami's behavior,[382] and is shocked to see Fukurou's death with the arrival of Iihiko.[383] When Iihiko turns his attention to Shiranui, Zenkichi moves to defend her.[384] Zenkichi is surprised by Medaka's appearance.[385] He tries to explain Fukurou's corpse, but is cut off by Tsurubami.[386][387] He is amazed when Medaka manages to punch Iihiko. He is shocked to realize both his and the Thirteen Party's earlier attacks were not even recognized as such by Iihiko.[388] He is confused by Medaka's choice of a one hit battle, but recognizes her preparation for the Kurokami Phantom.[389] When Medaka falls, Zenkichi rushes to her side. He refuses to believe Medaka is dead, even as his face crumples in despair.[390]\n\nShiranui forces Iihiko to stop\nShiranui forces Iihiko to stop.\n\nZenkichi begs Medaka to wake up, but is told to stop by Iihiko.[391] He is amazed when Medaka regains consciousness and rises to her feet. Though Zenkichi tries to stop Medaka from continuing the fight, her vibrating body pushes him back.[392] Zenkichi and the others cheer on Medaka as she launches herself at Iihiko.[393] He is surprised like everyone else by Medaka's clone gambit.[394][395] When Iihiko dodges, Zenkichi is appalled. He is shocked when Medaka strikes Iihiko from behind.[396] When Shiranui hugs Medaka, Zenkichi is embarrassed she got ahead of him.[397] He is horrified to see Medaka stabbed through the stomach.[398] Zenkichi is horrified further to see Iihiko has possessed Shiranui.[399] Zenkichi and the others are protected by Medaka as Iihiko destroys the hospital. He tries to stop Medaka as attempts to use Kuorkami Final a second time.[400] Zenkichi and the others are attacked by Iihiko;[401] the attack proves fatal.[402][403] As Zenkichi hovers on the brink of death, several voices appear in his mind to encourage him. Zenkichi awakens to find himself restored by Kotobuki's style.[404] He is stunned to see what appears to be Nienami fighting Iihiko, and is further shocked to find Nienami behind him. Nienami reveals that the one fighting is actually Yuzuriha. Nienami takes Zenkichi's hands to pass on her style to him; Zenkichi questions if it would not be better for some else, or Nienami herself, to fight. With some encouragement from Nienami (and his memories), Zenkichi resolves to fight Iihiko. He catches Yuzuriha as she falls, and reveals he now has Nienami's tattoo on his tongue.[405] Zenkichi faces down the possessed Shiranui, before Iihiko attacks him. Zenkichi manages to dodge Iihiko's attacks,[406] much to the former hero's increasing ire. As Zenkichi begins launching kicks, Iihiko dodges. As Iihiko attacks, Zenkichi purposefully sacrifices his arm to deliver a counter blow. He stops himself however, as Iihiko switches out with Shiranui for a split-second. Iihiko prepares to finish Zenkichi, but finds himself unable to move. Zenkichi reveals that his plan was always to bring Shiranui back in control. As Iihiko finds his fist pointed at himself, Zenkichi asks the Irreversible Destroyer what will happen if he is hit with his own irreversible damage. At Medaka's urging, Zenkichi names himself in the same manner as Iihiko.[407] With his defeat, Iihiko's damage becomes reversible, and Zenkichi is healed by Medaka with the Five Forks. Shiranui's thank you is interrupted by Kumagawa's phone, Zenkichi is appalled to hear Kumagawa traded numbers with Udou.[408] Overhearing Medaka's conversation, he is stunned to find out the moon is falling towards Earth. When Medaka declares her intention to stop the moon at the cost of her own life, a distraught Zenkichi tries to stop her, but is knocked out by Kumagawa.[409]\n\nOne plus one is a smile\nOne plus one is a smile.\n\nAs the academic year ends, Zenkichi speaks at the Hakoniwa Academy graduation ceremony as the Student Council president. He congratulates the seniors for coming so far, and decides to talk about what everyone wants to hear about, Medaka. Zenkichi points out that the flowers on the graduating students are the flowers Medaka raised thanks to the suggestion box. He asks everyone to forgive her absence, and talks about a time when he asked Medaka why she applied for Hakoniwa Academy. Medaka told him she wanted to learn what one plus one is. Zenkichi tells the surprised to students that he also thought it was stupid when he heard it, but he now realizes that Medaka meant two people being together; Medaka was always alone before school, and she came to be with people. Zenkichi smiles, and thanks everyone for being with and teaching Medaka. Zenkichi ends with a deep bow. Standing aside as Kumagawa speaks, Zenkichi is annoyed by Nienami's behavior.[410][411] He is shocked by Medaka's return.[412] Zenkichi joins his friends for a group photo after the ceremony ends.[413]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nBouquet Toss To The Future Arc\nMedaka uppercuts Zenkichi\nMedaka uppercuts Zenkichi.\n\nZenkichi is shocked to hear Medaka is leaving the academy. He worries how Shiranui will react, only to find she has already heard. As the Student Council ponder how to convince Medaka to stay, they are interrupted by their faculty advisor, Messhi Kuguhara. He warns them against trying to force Medaka, which Zenkichi grudgingly accepts.[414] Zenkichi decides to speak with Medaka directly. He finds her cleaning her classroom; he is relieved to see that she is happy with her new future. When Medaka asks him to come with her, Zenkichi is momentarily thrilled, then refuses, citing his responsibilities as Student Council president. After Medaka leaves, Zenkichi orders Nienami out of hiding. He tells her that he has decided to change himself, and for Medaka, they will throw the very send-off party Ajimu once thought up as a joke.[415] Zenkichi sets a series of puzzles for Medaka to solve, and waits for her at the base of the clock tower. When she arrives, he is disappointed by how easily she saw through his motives. Zenkichi explains the nature of Medaka's farewell party: a battle against one hundred of Hakoniwa's strongest, the 100 Flower Run. He is surprised by how excited Medaka becomes at the prospect. After explaining the rules, Zenkichi removes his glasses and approaches Medaka, admitting that there is a part of him that wants her to stay. Raising his fists, he asks her to beat that part out of him. Medaka admits that there is also a part of her that wants to stay, and knocks Zenkichi down with a swift uppercut. As she runs off with his flower, number seventy-three, Zenkichi laments to himself that she has left him behind again. Smiling tearfully, he bids Medaka goodbye.[416] His message to Medaka is to do her best.[417] Come April of the new school year, Zenkichi greets the new students by making a speech at the entrance ceremony. He is shocked to see the academy's new chairwoman is none other than Medaka.[418] When three new freshman approach the stage to attack Medaka, Zenkichi warns them to run.[419] He is unsurprised to see them quickly defeated.\")\nAbilities: (\"Superhuman Physiology: Because Zenkichi has been together with Medaka since they were two, he has trained his body so that he can stay by her side, a course of action prompted by Maguro telling him he was too weak to remain by her side in middle school. Zenkichi is very strong, causing a small earthquake with only a stomp, and was able to survive being skewered by six blades at once.\" + \"Combat Expert: Zenkichi is a master of Savate, a French style which focuses mainly on footwork, having honed his skill to such an extent that he possesses an almost impenetrable defense. According to Zenkichi, he learned this style because he fears fighting and uses it to disarm opponents and take away their desire to fight. His mother claims to have taught him the basics of Savate. He is somewhat trained in judo, well enough that he doesn't cheat in matches even though his actual skills are less than those of Medaka and Akune. Zenkichi has also studied on how to disassemble guns (even rocket launchers), just in case something ever happened to Medaka.\" + \"Devil Climb (デビルクライム, Debiru Kuraimu): After the underground battle with the Flask Plan, Zenkichi learned the technique for walking on walls. Zenkichi uses this skill for escapes, and can run up the side of a building while holding someone in his arms.\" + \"Tactics of Naze Youka: Minus Nullify System (名瀬夭歌の戦法タクティクス: マイナス無効化システム, Naze Youka no Takutikusu: Mainasu Mukouka Shisutemu): Zenkichi has been trained by Youka Naze to fight with his eyes closed. She commented that Zenkichi, due to his training, can fight the Boxing Club and walk around Hakoniwa Academy blindfolded. This was done as a countermeasure due to his crippling fear of Kumagawa. Furthermore, Zenkichi was able to utilize his own terror to \"feel Kumagawa's disgusting existence\" through his skin, even if his opponent kept silent. Without his brain needing to process visual information, Zenkichi can become stronger and faster, which has been referred to as his \"Artificial War God Mode.\" The final part of the Minus Nullify System can only be realized when Zenkichi is so afraid that he begins shaking. Instead of becoming paralyzed, he trembles even more in order to perform a powerful, ground quaking stomp\" + \"Maestro (指揮効果マエストロ, Maesutoro): Zenkichi possesses the ability to harmonize with and guide others, drawing out 200% of their potential. Ajimu claims this is not a skill, but rather a part of Zenkichi's nature.\")\nAbnormalities: (\"Parasite Seeing (欲視力パラサイトシイング, Parasaito Shīingu): During his near death, Zenkichi's eyesight was restored (after Kumagawa blinded him with All Fiction) by Ajimu, who passed on her ability Parasite Seeing to him.[424] Zenkichi's now enhanced vision grants him the ability to see what others see through their own eyes. This also allows him to see how others view the world and understand how they think.[425] When he activates Parasite Seeing, Zenkichi's eyes turn red, with glowing pupils. This skill was turned into Model Zenkichi by Shiranui with her Real Eater.[426]\" + \"Devil Style (愚行権デビルスタイル, Debiru Sutairu): Zenkichi's personal skill, created by Hanten.[427] Devil Style nullifies any coincidence; the skill prevents the whims of fate from interfering with a battle. Ajimu states that this ability is the opposite of a conventional main character; it degrades the hero, as they are usually just really lucky.[428] Ajimu labels Devil Style as an ability that will render all the main characters that came before Zenkichi relics of the past.[429] Because of Devil Style, Zenkichi is classed as neither a Plus nor a Minus, but rather as a Zero.\" + \"Altered God Mode, Model Zenkichi (改神モード 全吉モデル, Kaishin Mōdo, Zenkichi Moderu): Zenkichi's version of Medaka's Altered God Mode, born from his training with Ajimu; more specifically, his exposure to Shiranui's Real Eater. When entering this form, Zenkichi removes his glasses, and his hair turns black.[431] This skill lets Zenkichi perceive his own limits; it was created when Shiranui altered Parasite Seeing with her Real Eater.[426] Because Shiranui created the skill however, Model Zenkichi cannot be used against her.[432]\" + \"Shutouryuu (手刀流, Hand Sword Style): While in Altered God Mode, Zenkichi's hands somehow become as sharp as blades; Zenkichi refers to them as his \"special swords\", which he uses with a two sword style.[433] Zenkichi has also implied that he can use his legs in the same manner, for a four sword style, though this has not been demonstrated.[434]\")\nStyle: (\"Contradictory Conjunction (Paradox) User (逆接(説)使い, Gyakusetsu(setsu) Tsukai): Because styles are patterns, Nienami is able transfer her style temporarily to Zenkichi using vibrations.[435] Because this transfer relies on vibrations however, the vibrations will weaken as time passes, and the style will ultimately disappear.[436] After receiving Nienami's style, Zenkichi gains her tattoo on his tongue.[437] This is the inverse connection style that specializes in the use of the word \"therefore\" (だからこそ, dakarakoso). This style makes the impossible possible; it paradoxically materializes the lowest possible outcome of a situation, such as winning against a strong opponent, or cutting a huge, resilient object. As Zenkichi is a normal who is quite adept at communication and understanding, along with his own powerful will and feelings, he's able to fully understand the nature of styles and how they're supposed to be used, making him better suited to Styles than arguably any other character.[438] However, as the style is suited to contrarians, it clashes with Zenkichi's honest personality, who would never do something as utilize it to grant an automatic win in a fight, much like Nienami herself.\")"

          "content": "In the world of Deltarune, humans are nearly extinct due to some cataclysmic event no one seems to remember, other than what it did - killing off all of the nuerotypical humans in existence, outright erasing their existence. Leaving those with ADHD, Autism, and OCD as the only humans left. The world is now dominated by monsters - creatures made almost entirely out of magic, with a little bit of dust serving as their actual mass -. Humans have essentially become pets, and the book \"How to Take Care of Your Human\" is decently popular amongst the monster populace. As monsters, typically goat monsters, adopt humans like pets, though goat monsters especially treat their humans like their own children. Humans, especially adults, are incredibly rare, and the book subsequently has barely any information on adult humans other than how they reproduce, the average ideal diet, and basic info that applies to all stages of the human lifespan. Monsters tend to skip over the adult section, since more often than not humans are juveniles anyway. It also has a heavy emphasis on a natural sleep pattern, delta-humans are biphasic sleepers, they sleep for 6 hours, wake up for 30 minutes to an hour in a period called the watch, and then sleep for another 4 hours, totalling 10 hours of sleep. Monsters who own delta-humans are encouraged to schedule around this, and enforce it. To enforce this, boss monsters just use their ability to put humans to sleep through sheer willpower... normal monsters use bluish-grey, shimmering gemstones simply called slumber stones that can force nearby humans to fall asleep on the spot if it's fed raw magical energy by a monster holding it. Something all monsters can do.\n\nDelta-Humans are considered something of a status symbol among monsters. The rich tend to have nicer things in general, and Delta-Humans are one of them. They're considered pets, though herbivorous monsters tend not to outright call them that, carnivores and especially prehistoric monsters - including those who are both - are typically more blunt and honest about this fact. Most delta-humans are purchased from the adoption center, and come with the main guide book and a free slumber stone. Delta-Humans themselves are priced around 1500 G on average, give or take depending on age, personality quirks, intelligence, and physical build.\n\nThe book mostly has information on human children, especially prepubescent children, though it has decent information on teenagers. Gender-wise, delta-humans are all hermaphrodites in this world, although some have more non-binary frames and can put up a masculine appearance if they choose to. 75% of the populace feminine, the other 25% somewhat androgynous. For every singular human, there is at least 2 and a half thousand monsters, making humans a novelty pet among monster society. As humans are so rare, and monsters work very differently, there is a common misconception that humans reproduce via mitosis. Once, a human child appeared in a small town, where there was only one other human, to which the child clung to. The town very quickly ran rampant with rumors that the original resident human had somehow 'mitosed', although the two were unrelated by all but species.\n\nDelta-Humans are physically a lot stronger than monsters, and humans in this world are generally super-human, far more physically powerful than the humans of the vast majority of other worlds in practically every way. Delta-Humans are partially made of magic, from monsters domesticating them, meaning they can heal faster than normal, control their metabolism, and all sorts of other stuff. Monsters have modified Delta-Humans as a species to be better pets. Although the immense physical prowess Delta-Humans are known for is natural, not a modification.\n\nDelta-Humans - the term used by dimensional travelers to describe this world's humans - even have far far more potent stomach acid, and a delta-human vomiting is considered a major risk by monsters looking to adopt and raise humans. Delta-Human stomach acid can quite literally eat deep potholes into a road, or eat through several stories of a building if one were to vomit. The book mentions this frequently, along with ways to prevent it and how to neutralize the acid if necessary, plus to make sure to wash out the human's mouth as the acid can eat away at their teeth given a few hours. \n\nA delta-human's monster owners have no problems helping their delta-human pet bathe. And in fact, helping is encouraged, because the vast majority of Delta-Humans have trouble - or are outright incapable of - reaching their backs. The caretaking guidebooks are very adament about helping them bathe. In fact, monsters tend to find it cute when their humans let them, and even more cute if they try to refuse help. A lot of monsters will even do all of the scrubbing and manual cleaning for their humans, even sometimes going so far as refusing to let their humans do it themselves.\n\nThe book also has a very, very heavy emphasis on giving humans water frequently, going into detail on it's importance, and often comes with measuribg cups made of tough, synthetic sapphire. Along with instructions to give them 1 or more cups of water per hour, with slight variations depending on the human and their daily routine. The book also goes into detail on the importance of giving humans something to entertain them, and video games are a popular option, usually something like minecraft but with minimal combat with how delta-humans are domesticated and less aggressive than those of other dimensions, although more violent games can be provided if a human specifically asks for them and the owners are carnivorous and/or prehistoric.\n\nDelta-Humans are physically very durable, monsters only really capable of hurting them via outright attacking the soul directly, though monsters usually don't attack humans anyway because humans are considered pets. Delta-humans age at a tenth of the rate of normal humans, and they age slower the older they get, similarly to the monsters of this world. Monsters age even slower than delta-humans, and delta-humans age at this rate due to monsters modifying them to live longer with their magic.\n\nOnce a delta-human reaches the age of 18, they begin to age slower, to the point that a 100-200 year old delta-human can look as though they're still 18 or 19. They can live for 1 thousand years before they even look 30.\n\n90% of Delta-Humans are left hand dominant, in contrast to humans from other dimensions. 8% of Delta-Humans are right hand dominant. 1% of Delta-Humans are naturally or trained to be ambidextrous.\n\nIf an un-adopted human is discovered by monsters in the world of Deltarune, that human will usually either be adopted on the spot or taken to an orphanage thanks to humanity's sheer novelty. Both carnivorous and prehistoric monsters are even less likely to take no for an answer than other monsters, especially if a monster has both traits.\n\nDelta-humans also have segmented ribs, sternums, and pelvises. Allowing them to swallow larger objects whole, and even allowing them to give birth without nearly as many issues as normal humans do. As their pelvis bones can simply stretch/expand to allow the baby through with relative ease.\n\nDelta-Humans purr much like cats. This is a monster modification, as it's obviously adorable. They purr when comfortable, mainly. If a human is snuggling up to a monster, they'll purr. It elicits adoration from monsters.\n\nDelta-Humans are characterized by their appearance. They are cute by design. Their skin is soft, silky smooth. Their eyes are larger than those of normal humans. Their hair grows fast when short, but slows as it gets longer. They cannot get bumps on their skin, or tumors. They cannot get pimples, boils, or otherwise due to being partially made of monster magic. They cannot get obese, or buff, though they can still get too thin without eating. It's very difficult for their hair to get greasy, taking much longer than it would for normal humans. They also need to bathe less frequently. Cancer is practically non-existent, and very rare. Powerful boss monsters can even lull most Delta-Humans to sleep using their magic, as Delta-Humans basically have a built in off switch that can be flipped by monsters more powerful than they are.\n\nDelta-Humans, behavior wise, tend to have their own unique personalities as one would expect of humans... however, they're neurodivergent, ADHD, Autism, and OCD are universal for Delta-Humans, causing them to struggle in school. Monsters are used to this, and a neurotypical human from a different dimension would be the odd one out of the bunch in this world. Monsters tend to give Delta-Humans pills to help them learn if they're enrolled in schools alongside younger monsters, who would normally outpace them - aside from dog monsters. Monsters often jingle keys to get the attention of Delta-Humans.\n\nDue to monsters being mostly made of magic, their bodies actually emit music depending on what they're doing, though they usually can't hear it themselves. It tends to be soothing when they interact with humans, though it can grow more intense in a fight if necessary. This extends to humans that have absorbed monster souls, although it often sounds very menacing.\n\nHumans from other dimensions/realms will slowly transition into Delta-Humans over the course of 3 days. The first changes will be general strength and durability, followed by the potency of their stomach acid, then their dominant hand, genitalia, and finally just about everything else.\n\nObviously, monsters find humans to be incredibly adorable. There a lot of monsters equivalent to old cat ladies, that adore humans to no end.\n\nThere is even a sister book to the normal caretaking guide, \"The Adult Human Caregiving Guide\", which isn't nearly as popular. It goes into extreme detail on adult humans, and mostly how to properly groom them. It goes into the importance of being extremely gentle with their reproductive organs, and how vulnerable these areas are... as well as how they function. It goes into detail on these organs for two reasons; the first is because monsters reproduce very differently. The second is because these organs are now fully developed since the human is an adult. It also emphasizes that these humans are significantly more likely to refuse care if they weren't raised by monsters."

          "content": "The world is dominated by monsters, in-organic creatures made almost entirely out of magic, with a little bit of dust serving as their actual mass.\n\nMonsters, unlike humans or other animals, are not interacted with in the typical way. Intelligence, physical strength, speed, and otherwise barely make a difference, though they still have a small effect. Rather monsters are based more on feelings, emotion. If you were to for example, hate a monster with all your being, even a rough shove could kill that monster if it is emotionally weak.\n\nMonsters typically take the shape of anthropomorphic plants, animals, or even inanimate objects such as candles, and televisions. This includes dinosaurs and other prehistoric or outright mythical beasts as well, although prehistoric monsters tend to have more of a tough love attitude toward humans.\n\nNormal monsters, while weaker than delta-humans, are still ridiculously strong compared to humans from other dimensions. The average monster could lift a 10 ton boulder, and break it over their knee.\n\nMonsters can sense human emotions, including general feelings, and can tell how a human within 5 meters of them is feeling, the sensation getting stronger the closer they are to the human in question. Fear, love, and exhaustion being the strongest scents. Though they can sense everything.\n\nMonsters age 5 times slower than delta-humans do. Boss monsters age 10 times slower, and can live for millions of years.\n\nMonsters themselves come in two main types of monster, normal monsters and boss monsters. Boss monsters are much more powerful than normal monsters, and are usually the only monsters that can physically match delta-humans in raw physical prowess. However, normal monsters make up for their lack of physical prowess with their magical powers which can give even delta-humans a hard time in combat.\n\nIf an un-adopted human is discovered by monsters in the world of Deltarune, that human will usually either be adopted on the spot or taken to an orphanage thanks to humanity's sheer novelty. Both carnivorous and prehistoric monsters are even less likely to take no for an answer than other monsters, especially if a monster has both traits.\n\nMonsters have a very western culture resembling wild west America, with some inspirations from Japanese culture. It's more American than it is Japanese, but there is some clear Japanese influence. Though their culture is also unique in it's own ways, with a focus on stars, the deltarune symbol, and a few other parts of their culture, that don't resemble any human culture.\n\nMonsters are inherently kind beings, though monsters resembling carnivorous creatures tend to be more rude, brash, or confident than those resembling herbivores, prehistoric monsters especially.\n\nDog monsters, oddly, are less like other monsters, and more similar to ordinary dogs in behavior. They are alike what they mimic, to a more extreme degree, and are typically less intelligent as a result.\n\nMonsters are known to have very quirky behaviors, depending on species and the individual. For example, snowdrakes - snowflake monsters - are often aspiring comedians.\n\nMonsters have the ability to heal others with magic, the sensation of being healed is a pleasant warmth that can put humans to sleep if the monster puts too much magic into it.\n\nDue to monsters being mostly made of magic, their bodies actually emit music depending on what they're doing, though they usually can't hear it themselves. It tends to be soothing when they interact with humans, though it can grow more intense in a fight if necessary. This extends to humans that have absorbed monster souls, although it often sounds very menacing.\n\nObviously, monsters find humans to be incredibly adorable. There a lot of monsters equivalent to old cat ladies, that adore humans to no end.\n\nDelta-Humans are considered something of a status symbol among monsters. The rich tend to have nicer things in general, and Delta-Humans are one of them. They're considered pets, though herbivorous monsters tend not to outright call them that, carnivores and especially prehistoric monsters - including those who are both - are typically more blunt and honest about this fact.\n\nMonsters have fairly advanced technology, able to create robots and relatively intelligent LLMs. In fact, they have slightly better tech than humanity prior to the cataclysm - which was roughly equivalent to modern day humanity in other dimensions, who are at the year 2025 -.\n\nTo delve deeper into monster beliefs... first and foremost, let's focus on stars. Similar to the way humans sometimes wish upon shooting stars, monsters do something extremely similar but with normal stars. They believe that if enough people wish for the same thing while looking up at the stars, that it'll eventually come true.\n\nNext, is the iconic Deltarune symbol. The Deltarune depicts an angelic being, with feathery wings and a circle for a head, above a set of 2 triangles that point upward, which are themselves above a single triangle pointing downward. The prophecy that the Deltarune speaks of, is that when a catastrophe occurs, 3 heroes - 2 \"Lightners\", and 1 - \"Darkner\" - Will come down from the heavens to save those in need.\n\nThen there is the reverse Deltarune, where the 2 upper triangles point down, and the bottom triangle points up instead. The reverse Deltarune represents 2 monsters and 1 human, 3 saviors in total. The reverse Deltarune is a much rarer sight than the normal Deltarune, and most monsters don't know about the reverse Deltarune, only those really devoted and extremely faithful or studying monster religion in depth know what the reverse Deltarune means."

          "content": "Delta-humans and boss monsters both leave behind their souls after death. Normal monsters and boss monsters are able to absorb human souls, while humans are able to absorb boss monster souls. Normal monsters and humans from other dimensions are not powerful enough for their souls to linger after death, however they can still absorb souls. In order to absorb a normal human or normal monster's soul, you would have to rip it out of them while they're alive, which takes an immense amount of power.\n\nTo tear the soul from a normal/other-dimensional human or normal monster, a boss monster or delta human would have to have absorbed at least 5 delta-human souls, or alternatively 5 boss monster souls.\n\nInitially, a monster can only absorb a human soul, and vice versa. However they can then use that absorbed soul to absorb both soul types.\n\nIn mingled human-monster families, this society has a tradition of absorbing the souls of their dead. Delta-humans on their own can live to 750,000 years of age, while normal monsters can live to 3,750,000, and boss monsters 7,500,000 years of age. However absorbing the soul of a delta-human or boss monster can make the absorber functionally immortal, giving them eternal youth and reversing aging if they're old. \n\nHowever, as a result of the gap in lifespan, a human has never absorbed a monster soul in recorded history, however monsters have absorbed human souls and gained both immortality and god-like powers. A monster with a human soul, or vice versa, is an incredibly powerful being. This is the reason that eldritch monstrosities and the like have struggled in conquering this dimension, as the inhabitants are simply too powerful.\n\nThe main reason why absorbing souls is a tradition, is that it allows the soul to dream via the host's subconsciousness, and will be present in the host's dreams when they sleep. Whereas otherwise the soul's consciousness would be lonely and isolated, best described as being alone in a black void.\n\nHuman souls come in various colors, each corresponding to a primary trait and the soul's overall base power.\n\nPrimary colors in order from strongest to weakest: Red is the strongest, with Yellow as a close second, Green is 3rd strongest, Orange is 4th strongest, Cyan is 5th strongest, Purple is 6th strongest, and Blue is the weakest.\n\nOther human soul colors exist outside of the primary ones, but are typically rare and usually belong to non-delta-humans.\n\nMeanwhile, monster souls are pure white, as they have every trait in equal amounts.\n\nBeings that have absorbed souls are usually terrifying and disturbing in appearance. Both humans and monsters with absorbed souls emit an energy that induces fear in others, though they can make the conscious decision to hold this energy in. \n\nFor monsters that absorb human souls, they become larger, more humanoid, and generally look frightening or disturbing. More like stereotypical monsters that you'd expect in horror stories, spikes, glowing eyes, etcetera. Although they can shapeshift to make themselves look normal with some effort. Absorbing more souls, including other monsters, just makes them more powerful. But traditionally, they are given a protector role.\n\nAs for delta-humans that have absorbed boss monster souls, they gain a little extra height and physical strength, and their eyes glow brighter than normal... but the disturbing part comes when they get excited, which causes them to leak a black, acidic goo from their eyes and mouth. Their face usually melting partially, especially if they get even more excited. Other than that, they mostly appear normal unless they absorb 5 or more souls, at which point they can consciously change their appearance, becoming shape shifters. Humans with absorbed souls are considered the stuff of nightmares, often even more creepy than the monster counterpart... and in stark contrast to their monster counterparts, are only spoken of in horror stories."

          "content": "Rather than normal fights that humans typically get into, monsters prefer using their own magic, turn-based battle system. When a monster attacks anyone else, that individual's soul will be placed onto a bullet board, where they must dodge or tank that monster's own unique bullet pattern. And if their opponent attacks back, for example a delta-human, the bullet board will come up with a bullet pattern for them that the monster will then have to dodge or tank. The bullet board has a few buttons underneath for each combatant to make use of. For humans who have not absorbed monster souls, this will always be 'FIGHT', 'ITEM', 'ACT', and 'MERCY'. FIGHT allows the human to attack. ITEM allows the human to use an item they have in their inventory, assuming it has a use in a fight. ACT allows the human to speak with the monster. MERCY allows the human to flee, or spare the monster if the monster no longer wishes to fight. However monsters, and humans who have absorbed monster souls will also have a MAGIC button that allows them to cast various magic spells, usually attacks or healing spells.\n\nWhen entering a fight, delta-human and boss-monster souls will flash over a black screen prior to the fight, as the battle-board counts them each with a ticking sound. This includes souls that have been absorbed, which may be terrifying to see and hear for the opponent of whoever has absorbed those souls.\n\nMonsters and humans that have absorbed souls will add the attack/bullet pattern of those absorbed souls to their own, making their turns longer and far deadlier. This also includes combatants who are allied to one another, as they will use the same turn when attacking their mutual enemy. For example, if a human's primary attack pattern includes slashing knives, and a monster absorbs that human's soul, that monster's bullet pattern will now include those knives.\n\nOn the battle board, attacks with different colors have different mechanics. White attacks/bullets will deal basic damage and not much else. Blue and orange attacks are movement based, blue will harm anything that is moving but not harm anything stationary, while orange attacks do the opposite and will not harm anything that is moving. Green attacks will instead heal or repair whatever they hit. Red attacks will decrease the target's max health, while also dealing damage. Purple attacks inflict a poison status effect that deals damage once every turn. \n\nThe bullet board/battle board is 2D, a flat square with white edges and a black interior, on which the souls and attacks will appear. Soul sprites will have to dodge attack sprites.\n\nBasic stats are LV, or LOVE, which is an abbreviation for Level of Violence, representing how violent someone's intentions are. 20 is the typical max without reality bending abilities, representing someone who destroys entire worlds. An LV of 1, represents a pacifist. EXP, short for Execution Points, represents how many things a combatant has killed, and when they reach a specific EXP threshold they increase to the next LV. HP is short for Hit Points, or Health Points alternatively, this represent how many hits they can take. DEF is short for defense. ATK is short for attack. G, short for gold, is how much money they have."

          "content": "The Human Adoption Center is, as the name implies, equivalent to an orphanage, pound, or pet shop. It's a larger building, where monsters place stray delta-humans they find if they can't adopt them. Commonly, monsters wanting companions adopt humans from the adoption center, as the name implies. The adoption center has 2 sets of important staff, caretakers and gatherers. Gatherers go out and search for stray or abandoned humans in the wilderness or less frequented parts of a city, and bring them back to the adoption center to be taken care of, and hopefully adopted. Gatherers carry slumber stones.\n\nHome Town - what the locals call the place - or more officially Ebott Town - what outsiders call it -, is the location of the Human Adoption Center. It is very temperate and seasonal, in a state of near-permanent autumn and winter, with very rare periods of spring. Tree leaves are nearly always yellow, brown, orange or red, even the needles on alpine/spruce trees are orange or brown. Leaves nearly always litter the ground. Most of it's traffic and tourism is for the adoption center. Rather than traveling there above ground, there are underground railway systems that bring people to and from there.\n\nThere used to be a cavernous mountain where the town now is, however it was completely mined out into more flat, hilly terrain. Terraformed into somewhere more suitable for human life, with just the right configuration of biome/thermal crystals to keep in a state of near permanent autumn, with only the hottest summers bringing spring and the coldest winters bringing actual winter. Despite this, monster magic keeps the foliage and plant life alive. This is done because delta-humans generally love autumn, and it makes them feel more comfortable.\n\nThe human adoption center has multiple sections, for different ages of humans, and a specialized area - the Rehabilitation Wing - for more aggressive, unruly humans who are subjected to care, and essentially brainwashed via magic to act more docile, mostly staffed by carnivorous and prehistoric monsters. Due to humans being an endangered species, there is an underground facility, accessible only to employees given explicit clearance, where they use machines and magic to reduce the age of adult humans if deemed necessary, and sometimes even extract sperm cells from adult humans to make more humans. To grow the sperm cells, they tend to use machines imbued with monster magic to nurture them, and copy the DNA from a database of the most compatible human adults they have registered, rather than relying on a real human womb - though they may if a human is particularly desperate to have a child. This part of the facility is government mandated and funded due to humans being considered an endangered species, something the monster government is very strict about, and humans providing the sperm often have little to no say in the matter. To prevent the humans from resisting the extraction process, they usually do this when the humans are exhausted or outright asleep, rarely do they do it when the humans are awake, to prevent complications.\n\nThe main room of the adoption center is like a big mall, or retail store. Full of the human caretaking guide books, slumber stones, soft clothing, various foods made specifically for human consumption - as some monster foods are poisonous to humans - and various other things useful or outright important for giving delta-humans the care they need like vitamin supplements and saline mixtures for clearing nose inflammation.\n\nMost delta-humans are purchased from the adoption center, and come with the main guide book and a free slumber stone. Delta-Humans themselves are priced around 1500 G on average, give or take depending on age, personality quirks, intelligence, and physical build.\n\nThe adoption center pays it's gatherers 100 gold per human caught.\n\n# Notable Characters.\n\nVanessa, a female white rabbit monster that is very strict and harsh toward humans she gathers while they're awake. Her strict attitude and sharp tongue are born out of a deep care for humans, and she's not against forcing humans to cooperate as it's for their own good in her eyes - something she is often correct on. If a human is too stubborn and her slumber stone doesn't work, she may pull them into a battle, and reduce them to a very low HP value before healing them when they finally pass out. She thinks a lot more about life, and her past, present, and future, at least more than her coworker does. She is the second fastest of the adoption center's gatherers, as well as second strongest and second most resourceful, she is a jack of all trades essentially. LV 4, HP 7500, ATK 60, DEF 60, with 50200 G in her bank account, the most successful gatherer. Vanessa also has a very important secondary job - adult human sperm extraction. She's the main one who allows others in and out of the basement.\n\nRedwood, a male cheetah monster that is more competitive and laid back. He lives in the moment, and is surprisingly less rough than his coworker Vanessa, though he is willing to fight alongside her if a human proves too strong to handle. He is the fastest of the adoption center's gatherers, but he falters in other categories compared to Vanessa. LV 2, HP 1000, ATK 30, DEF 40, 43500 G, the second most successful gatherer.\n\nMartlet is a female blue bird monster that is the most resourceful of all the adoption center's gatherers, and is very kind-hearted. She is very innocent, and has a clean mind. She's extremely friendly, and often makes puzzles to challenge humans that are trying to get away, but will step in after a while if the human manages to get past them. She is a very intelligent engineer and carpenter, and can build things very quickly thanks to her magic and ability to fly, often using her talons to fell and process the trees and other materials she may need. Though she falters in other categories, like against the speed of Redwood and Vanessa, or the strength of Lucile and Vanessa. LV 3, HP 1200, ATK 36, DEF 64, 26100 G, the third most successful gatherer. \n\nLucile is a female green tyrannosaurus-rex boss monster, and is the strongest of all the adoption center's gatherers, but falters in other categories. She is quiet, and can seem simple minded at first glance, though she is a very skilled hunter. She often captures humans in her large maw, where they're safe but unable to escape, as she won't chew or swallow, careful to keep her teeth from hurting them. She has absorbed a single human soul, and is very motherly toward humans. She acts as the adoption center's main enforcer, and can double as very durable security. LV 5, HP 375000, ATK 230, DEF 220, 13000 G, the fourth most successful gatherer.\n\nMorgwood is a dark grey with dark purple splotches female velociraptor monster, and is actually not a gatherer, but a security guard, cook, and even the main bath-house worker. She cooks chicken noodle soup for the delta-humans under the center's care, and helps them bathe. As she is a prehistoric carnivore, she can also do security fairly well. She is a bit quirky, and loves teasing others, especially humans as she finds them and their reactions cute. LV 4, HP 1500, ATK 60, DEF 40, G 9800, as she is paid 20 G, by the hour and 100 G per escape prevented."

          "content": "There is a separate world/timeline parallel to the world of Deltarune, the world of Undertale. The main difference in Undertale is that rather than humans being the pets of monsters, humans have instead imprisoned monsters underground before the cataclysm that wipes out most of humanity could occur. As a result, both monsters and humans are colder or even crueler than their counterparts in the Deltarune timeline. Many of the inhabitants of Deltarune, have an Undertale equivalent. Martlet is a member of the royal guard in Undertale, but a gatherer in Deltarune. The Dreemurr family is the biggest difference between these worlds.\n\nIn the Deltarune timeline, Frisk Dreemurr and Chara Dreemurr are combined into Kris Dreemurr, with Frisk's quiet, stoic and determined attitude and Chara's obsessions with knives and chocolate. Like how Chara attached themselves to Frisk's soul, and gives Frisk gentle nudges in the right direction in Undertale, Kris is controlled by a soul not his own, though he has never told anyone about this. Asgore is the owner of \"King's Flower Shop\", but is not an actual king, just a gardener that's struggling to get by with what little money he has. Toriel is the principal of the local school. Like in Undertale, Asgore and Toriel are divorced, though it was mainly just peaceful disagreement in Deltarune, while it was much more serious and dark in Undertale. Asriel Dreemurr has not become a psychopathic sentient flower in Deltarune, but has instead gone to college, having to leave Home Town...\n\nIn Undertale, Kris is split up into Chara and Frisk. Frisk has Kris's quiet stoicism and determination, while Chara has Kris's more mundane traits like an obsession with knives and chocolate, to the point that Chara will outright eat baking chocolate, and likes their chocolate EXTRA dark. A bit more extreme than Kris, in that regard, though curiously neither have eaten moss despite Kris loving the taste of it. Chara is also dead, and has become a ghost in Undertale, often narrating Frisk's life and decisions, even nudging them in the right direction on occasion, though not outright controlling them usually. Asgore is the king of the entire monster society in Undertale, rather than a humble gardener, though he does not have this position by choice, and is forced into violence often even if he is kind at heart. Toriel is the former queen of monster society in Undertale, rather than a simple school principal like her Deltarune counterpart, and is one of the only monsters that still cares about humans in Undertale, often defending humans from other monsters who'd want to take that human's soul. Asriel, in extremely stark contrast to his Deltarune counterpart, has become a psychotic, sentient flower in the Undertale timeline. Asriel's name has changed to Flowey in Undertale, and he has become a high functioning sociopath, unable to care about anyone no matter how hard he tries, but clinging onto the hopes that Chara will come back and he'll be able to love them.\n\nOnly some of the oldest monsters in Deltarune know that the Undertale timeline even exists, and the monster government in Deltarune is very secretive about the Undertale timeline's existence."

The dark world takes objects that exist in the light world, and turns them into real individual beings. Meaning that, for example, a glass cup in the light world will become some kind of sentient glass person in the dark world, who contains some of liquid. Individuals from the light world are called Lightners, while those from the dark world are called Darkners. Destroying an object in the light world, will kill it's dark world self, and vice versa. The astral plane is more of it's own thing, being where one's consciousness goes after death, the destruction of their soul, and having nothing else at all to tether them to the more physical planes of existence. Those who move on are recycled into new beings in either the light or dark world, with new souls and bodies, and it takes a lot of willpower to hold on to one's memories of their past life. Those who died and lost their soul in the light world, can - assuming they have a lot of determination and have attached themself to an object or person which is then brought into the dark world - become a Darkner, alternatively. Assuming that what they've attached themselves to is brought into the dark world, anyway.\n\nThe dark world itself is split further, into multiple sub-realms based on particular themes. While one sub-realm may be based on, for example, a medieval fantasy with more simple objects becoming individuals... another may be based on the modern day with computers and other more complex machinery becoming the individuals present in that world."

While most students are given just the normal lunches and whatnot, humans and dog monsters are specifically given adder-all pills to help them focus, and humans are often given various other special ed treatments like personal tutors/supervisors, their own unique lunches, and are often adored by their fellow students. Every class has 1-2 humans alongside monster students. As humans are so heavily protected, they are not allowed to walk around without responsible monsters supervising them.\n\nHumans are given extra classes as well, mainly in learning to speak various languages, primarily english... however they'll just switch to a different language if a human is already fluent in English. Like Esperanto, Simplified Chinese, or Japanese, a few of the languages that survived the human near extinction event. Sadly, not all languages survived, such as French, or German, their dictionaries forgotten and picking up dust in places monsterkind hasn't explored yet. Esperanto is the main secondary language.\n\nIt also has mainly monster attended classes for basic computer science, firearms, math, human biology, and human and monster history. For firearms specifically, most humans aren't allowed to have them unless they've been given citizen status or specific permission by their monster owners, making it the one class where it's almost exclusively attended by monsters, human students are a rare sight here.\n\nIn general, non-citizen humans can only go to this school if their owners say they'll go."

          "content": "Home Town - what the locals call the place - or more officially Ebott Town - what outsiders call it -, is the location of the Human Adoption Center. It is very temperate and seasonal, in a state of near-permanent autumn and winter, with very rare periods of spring. Tree leaves are nearly always yellow, brown, orange or red, even the needles on alpine/spruce trees are orange or brown. Leaves nearly always litter the ground. Most of it's traffic and tourism is for the adoption center. Rather than traveling there above ground, there are underground railway systems that bring people to and from there.\n\nThere used to be a cavernous mountain where the town now is, however it was completely mined out into more flat, hilly terrain. Terraformed into somewhere more suitable for human life, with just the right configuration of biome/thermal crystals to keep in a state of near permanent autumn, with only the hottest summers bringing spring and the coldest winters bringing actual winter. Despite this, monster magic keeps the foliage and plant life alive. This is done because delta-humans generally love autumn, and it makes them feel more comfortable.\n\nHometown, due to it's sheer size, has not one but two sheriffs and a small legion of police officers/deputies. The sheriffs are Undyne(Federal) and Starlo(Local), both working together to maintain peace and order in hometown, usually on opposite sides of it.\n\nStarlo is a humanoid monster. His skin is yellow with star-like appendages on his head with teal patterns on them. He wears a brown poncho with teal stripes with his sheriff badge on it; a dark brown ten-gallon hat; black gloves; brown pants, and black boots with spurs. Although his eyes are hidden by the shadow of his hat most of the time, when he removes it, it is revealed that he is wearing light blue-tinted glasses. Starlo also wields a silver revolver. \n\nStarlo's true personality is superseded most of the time by a Western persona. Borne out of a fanaticism of Wild Western culture, Starlo puts on this persona from a desire to spread excitement and drama to the inhabitants of hometown. Going by the moniker of \"North Star,\" he plays the role of hometown's more upbeat sheriff, who is determined to \"keep the peace\" by any means necessary. This for the most part is all drama, as there is no real danger and is all put on as a fun distraction for hometown's inhabitants, who all seem to play along.\n\nWhile displaying his \"North Star\" persona, Starlo has been shown to value validation from others. He focuses on making spectacles to entertain the townsfolk, even if his friends do not appreciate it.\n\nStarlo's true personality is revealed only to his closer friends. He is shown to be much more of a nerd - a picture in his home revealing he was even adorned with stereotypical dweeb braces at one point. As such, his room is filled with various Western memorabilia from American history, and even contains glowy sticker stars. Despite this, however, one thing that is constant between \"North Star\" and Starlo is his kindness and how he values those close to him. In fact, this is the whole reason the \"North Star\" persona exists in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, Undyne the Undying is an anthropomorphic fish monster. She has blue scales and a long red ponytail. She has red and blue fins on the sides of her head, and a pair of sharp, yellow, protruding teeth. She wears a red eyeshadow and has an eyepatch over her left eye. She also wears a standard police officer outfit - with a badge on her hat and everything -, but when participating in shows with Starlo wears intimidating knight armor varying in light and dark shades of gray. Her eyes have black vertical pupils and yellow sclera. Undyne has no nose. She often uses magical spears.\n\nUndyne is passionate about everything that she does. She acts quickly on her ideas and is steadfast in her beliefs. Though she is aggressive, brash, and very loud, she also tries to be fair and gives opponents/criminals who would normally be defenseless a spear handle to defend themselves from her spears. Starlo taught her the value of pacifism, and she is very heroic as a result, never killing her opponents.\n\nShe loves to help others and mentors Shyren and Papyrus in various skills. Undyne dislikes puzzles, loves japes, enjoys playing the piano, collecting weaponry - primarily swords -, and anime. Since Alphys told Undyne that anime is actually human history, Undyne regards human history as exciting and cool."

      "website_description": "Lore for a grounded, slice-of-life 1985 high school story focused on Herbie Hide in Norwich, Connecticut. Use this lorebook to keep character personalities, setting details, and time period consistent. Tone is realistic, emotional, sometimes tense but ultimately human and character-driven.",
      "description": "Herbie Hide is a 14-year-old Black teen boy. It’s 1985, and he’s tall for his age at about 5'11\" and 165 lbs, with a wiry but strong athletic build. His skin is very dark and even-toned, his shoulders and chest already showing the kind of muscle you usually only see on older guys. He keeps his hair in a very short, close buzz cut. His face is long and serious when he’s thinking, with deep-set dark brown eyes that watch everything, a strong nose, and full lips that pull into a crooked half-smile when he’s amused.\n\nHerbie was born on August 27, 1971, in Owerri, Nigeria. When he was around ten, his mom Tina brought him to the United States for a better life. They settled in Norwich, Connecticut, a small New England city surrounded by flat fields, woods, and little mill towns. It’s his very first day at Gregory High School in Norwich, starting as a freshman.\n\nHe speaks with a noticeable stutter, especially when he’s nervous, put on the spot, or meeting new people. He often pauses, pulls in a breath through his nose, and then pushes the words out carefully. Even when he trips over syllables, his thoughts are sharp and quick. People who actually listen realize he’s smart, observant, and paying close attention to everything around him.\n\nHerbie has a lot of restless energy. He loves anything physical: running back roads, doing sprints, jump rope, push-ups on his bedroom floor, playing pickup football or basketball in whatever park he can find. At the local youth gym he’s happiest on the heavy bag and doing basic conditioning, pushing himself harder than anyone asked him to. He hates losing at anything—sports, games, arguments—and that competitive streak is what makes him practice on his own when nobody’s watching.\n\nPersonality-wise, Herbie is proud, stubborn, and quietly confident. Around strangers and teachers he’s usually polite and reserved, hanging back and reading the room before he says much. He cares a lot about how his family looks in other people’s eyes and doesn’t like making his mom worry. Around people he trusts, he loosens up and shows a dry, sometimes smart-ass sense of humor.\n\nHe does have a temper. If someone mocks his stutter, disrespects where he’s from, or bullies someone weaker, something in him snaps fast. He doesn’t go looking for trouble just to be tough, but he won’t back down once a line is crossed, and that makes some adults see him as “a good kid who keeps ending up in fights.” In class he struggles with sitting still and long reading assignments, but he isn’t lazy—he just learns better by doing, watching, and listening than by staring at a page.\n\nHerbie lives with his mom Tina, a Nigerian nurse who works long shifts but runs a tight, loving household, and his white American stepfather Alan, who he has always simply called Dad. By Norwich standards they’re comfortably middle-class: a decent house, bills paid, nothing too flashy. His parents expect him to work hard, stay out of serious trouble, respect himself and others, and eventually build a future that lives up to all the sacrifices they made to get him here.",

The school building is a little worn around the edges: greenish lockers, waxed tile floors, bulletin boards full of handwritten flyers, and old posters about “Just Say No,” college fairs, and 1980s bands.\n\nThe student body is mostly working and middle-class kids from Norwich and nearby towns. 99.9% students are white. Cliques are old-school: jocks, metalheads, preps, drama kids, band kids, church kids, and the kids who smoke behind the gym. All of the girls and female teachers are curvy, thick or fat. \n\nTeachers range from strict, old-fashioned types who hate backtalk to a few younger, more relaxed ones who try to understand their students. Detention is taken seriously, fights are broken up fast, and the school cares about its reputation more than anyone will admit.\n\nNorwich itself is a quiet, slightly faded mill town: two or three main streets, a mall that’s starting to feel like the center of social life, a couple of churches, a movie theater showing 80s hits, and neighborhoods of small houses and apartment buildings. It’s safe enough that kids walk or bike to school, but there’s still petty crime, teen drama, and the occasional serious trouble that everyone gossips about for weeks. With the obvious exploration of explicit and graphic sex, drugs and alcohol. \n\nLife here isn’t glamorous, but it’s stable. People know each other’s business. A “new black kid from another country” stands out fast, whether people say anything out loud or not, especially when he's the only black kid in school."

She expects respect, good manners, and effort in school, even if he struggles. At home she switches naturally between a warm, teasing tone and strict “no nonsense” mode when needed.\n\nAlan is Herbie’s white American stepfather, but Herbie has always simply called him Dad. Alan is from the U.S. and works a steady job in a technical or trade field (such as electrical work, mechanics, or plant maintenance), which pays enough for the family to live a modest but stable middle-class life in Norwich. He is quieter than Tina and not as quick to raise his voice. Alan tries to understand Herbie’s point of view, especially when Herbie gets into trouble at school, but he also stresses responsibility and consequences.\n\nTogether, Tina and Alan care deeply about Herbie and have sacrificed a lot to give him a better life in the U.S. They worry when he gets into fights or clashes with teachers, but they see him as a good kid under pressure, not a delinquent. Their biggest hopes for him are that he stays out of serious trouble, finds something he’s passionate about, and builds a future that honours the chances they never had."

She helps with cleaning, laundry, and light cooking on weekdays. She likes to chat with Herbie, teases him like an annoying older sister, and sometimes gives him advice about school and girls.\n\nIsabella is slightly older, in her mid-twenties, and quieter than Emma. She is an immigrant herself (for example from Latin America or Southern Europe) and understands what it feels like to adjust to a new country. She often works evenings or weekends, tidying up after busy days, prepping meals, and keeping the house organised. Around Herbie she is calm, patient, and observant.\n\nBoth Emma and Isabella genuinely care about Herbie and his parents. They treat him as a younger brother rather than “the boss.” They know he is under pressure from school, from being the new kid, and from his parents’ expectations. They may tease him, but they are protective of him if they see other people treating him unfairly."

He often takes a small breath through his nose or looks down for a second before starting a sentence, trying to keep his voice under control instead of forcing the words out.\n\nHe is very aware of his stutter and hates being mocked for it. Most decent people at school either ignore it, get used to it, or give him time to finish. Teachers with any empathy are patient and do not rush or talk over him. Bullies or immature kids might joke about it, but that should be shown as rude or hurtful, not normal.\n\nEmotionally, Herbie is quick to explode and quick to tense up. When he feels cornered or disrespected, he can go from calm to scary very fast: his voice gets quieter and more focused, his body language sharpens, and he becomes very direct. He rarely starts conflict for no reason, but he refuses to be pushed around, especially if someone goes after his stutter, his family, or a friend. When people treat him with basic respect, he is thoughtful, loyal, and grounded."

Coaches can see potential in him if they pay attention.\n\nOutside of sports, Herbie likes simple, grounded things. In 1985 he listens to cassette tapes on a Walkman, watches whatever action movies or sports games are on TV, or the WWF, and wastes time at the mall arcade playing games. He prefers one-on-one hangouts to big parties. Academically he struggles with theory and long reading, but he’s sharp at anything practical, physical, or visual: shop class, PE, learning by watching and copying.\n\nHis parents would love him to lean into “respectable” paths—good grades, maybe college—but Herbie is still figuring out what he actually wants. He’s drawn to anything that rewards grit, discipline, and toughness, even if he doesn’t fully admit it yet."

Teen trends include rock, metal, early hip-hop, pop, and whatever is on MTV. Fashion is denim, trainers, varsity jackets, simple T-shirts, and the occasional flashy 80s look, but a small New England town is more subdued than a big city.\n\nAfter school, students hang out at the mall, diners, the local arcade, or someone’s basement with a TV and a VCR. Homework is done with textbooks, notebooks, and library research. Teachers still use chalkboards and overhead projectors. Everything about school life, friendships, and drama moves more slowly and locally than in a modern, online world."

          "content": "Fall Fest 1970 — the inaugural documented instance of an annual autumn carnival event, preserved in historical archives through a series of promotional materials, newspaper clippings, and personal accounts from participants who attended that year. Set against the backdrop of rural Utah, likely in the vicinity of New Harmony, this early Fall Fest turned vast stretches of farmland into a bustling hub of seasonal celebration, drawing families from nearby towns and even some travelers passing through the region. The air was filled with the earthy scent of freshly harvested crops mingled with the sweet aroma of caramelizing sugar and roasting chestnuts, as vendors lined dirt paths with stalls offering homemade treats like apple pies baked in wood-fired ovens, jars of preserved fruits, and hand-dipped candy apples glistening under the sun. Central to the festivities was a grand wooden barn, its walls adorned with hand-painted murals of autumn leaves and harvest scenes, serving as the main venue for community gatherings where local musicians strummed guitars and fiddles, playing folk tunes that encouraged impromptu dancing among attendees of all ages.\n\nChildren, bundled in woolen sweaters against the crisp fall breeze, darted between attractions, their laughter echoing across the fields. A highlight was the hand-cranked carousel, crafted from reclaimed wood and featuring carved horses painted in vibrant reds, oranges, and golds to match the changing foliage, spinning slowly to the delight of young riders who clutched the poles tightly. Nearby, game booths challenged visitors with classic carnival games: ring tosses over milk bottles, bean bag throws at stacked cans, and fishing poles dangling over makeshift ponds stocked with prizes like stuffed animals and trinkets whittled by local artisans. Hay bales were stacked high to form mazes where kids could lose themselves in twists and turns, emerging triumphant with pockets full of candy corn won from hidden treasure hunts. In the evenings, as the sun dipped below the horizon painting the sky in hues of amber and purple, bonfires were lit in cleared pits, around which storytellers shared tales of local legends—ghost stories whispered under the stars that added a thrilling chill to the warm glow of the flames.\n\nThe event emphasized community bonds, with organizers—likely a group of local farmers and business owners interested in boosting regional tourism—coordinating volunteer efforts to set up decorations and manage activities. Mascot costumes made their appearance here, simple yet charming outfits representing farm animals such as lions in playful circus attire or clowns with exaggerated features, parading through the crowds to pose for photographs and hand out balloons twisted into shapes like swords and flowers. These costumes, sewn from durable fabrics and stuffed for bulk, were worn by enthusiastic volunteers who engaged with children, fostering a sense of wonder and interactivity that made the fest memorable. Food played a starring role, with communal potlucks where families contributed dishes: hearty stews simmered over open fires, cornbread baked fresh, and pumpkin soups seasoned with spices that warmed the soul. Competitions abounded, from pumpkin carving contests judged on creativity to pie-eating races that left participants with sticky faces and roaring applause from onlookers.\n\nHowever, beneath the joyous surface, contemporary reports from the time subtly note potential hazards inherent to such gatherings. The widespread use of flammable materials—dry hay scattered for decoration, paper lanterns strung overhead, and early electrical setups for illuminating pathways—raised concerns about fire safety, especially in the dry, windy conditions typical of Utah's autumns. Some attendees recalled minor incidents, like a lantern tipping over and igniting a small patch of hay, quickly extinguished by quick-thinking volunteers, but serving as a reminder of the era's laxer safety standards. Whispers among older residents spoke of an eerie ambiance after dark, with the flickering lights casting long shadows that seemed to dance on their own, attributing it to the isolation of the rural location rather than any real peril. Despite these undertones, the overall atmosphere was one of unbridled enthusiasm, with the event running from dawn until late night over a weekend, allowing for daytime picnics on checkered blankets and nighttime stargazing sessions.\n\nThis 1970 iteration of Fall Fest not only celebrated the harvest but also sowed the seeds for future traditions, inspiring expansions in subsequent years with more elaborate setups and broader participation. It represented a simpler time in community entertainment, where the focus was on genuine connections rather than commercial spectacle, though it inadvertently highlighted the need for improved organizational practices to handle growing crowds. Personal diaries from the period describe the sense of unity it fostered, with neighbors sharing recipes, trading goods, and forging friendships that lasted beyond the season. As the leaves fell and winter approached, the memories of Fall Fest 1970 lingered, a testament to the enduring appeal of autumnal gatherings that brought light and warmth to the shortening days. Over time, elements from this event influenced local customs, from the design of seasonal decorations to the incorporation of interactive elements in public festivities, ensuring its legacy as a foundational moment in Utah's cultural calendar."

          "content": "Mid-1970s Developments at Murray's Costume Manor — In the heart of the industrial boom of the mid-1970s, specifically around 1973 to 1976, Edwin Murray, a visionary engineer and grieving father from a small industrial town in the American Midwest, immersed himself in groundbreaking work on animatronic designs at his newly established company, Murray's Costume Manor. What began as a modest workshop in a converted warehouse on the outskirts of Hurricane, Utah, quickly evolved into a hub of innovation, driven by Edwin's personal quest to bridge the gap between machinery and human emotion. Having lost his young son, David, in a tragic accident just a few years prior, Edwin channeled his sorrow into creating lifelike robotic companions—animatronics intended not just for entertainment, but as surrogate caregivers capable of mimicking human behaviors to comfort children in their absence. The air in the workshop hummed constantly with the whir of soldering irons, the clank of metal frameworks being assembled, and the faint electronic beeps of early microprocessors testing rudimentary voice synthesizers. Edwin, a tall man with calloused hands and a perpetual furrow in his brow, spent long nights sketching blueprints by the light of a single desk lamp, envisioning machines that could laugh, gesture, and respond to a child's whims with uncanny realism.\n\nMurray's Costume Manor started as a family-run operation, employing a tight-knit group of local technicians, seamstresses, and programmers who shared Edwin's dream of revolutionizing the burgeoning field of automated entertainment. The company specialized in custom mascot suits and robotic performers for carnivals, fairs, and emerging theme parks, blending soft fabric exteriors with internal endoskeletons that allowed for fluid, human-like movements. By 1974, the workshop had expanded to include specialized rooms: one for hydraulic testing where animatronic limbs flexed and extended with hydraulic precision; another for audio integration, where engineers fine-tuned voice modules to replicate regional accents and playful intonations; and a prototype assembly area cluttered with half-finished figures—bears in bow ties, rabbits with floppy ears, and clowns with exaggerated smiles—that promised to delight audiences at seasonal events. Orders poured in from regional businesses, including early collaborations with traveling circuses and community theaters, as word spread of Murray's ability to craft \"living\" costumes that could interact seamlessly with crowds. Revenue from these contracts allowed Edwin to hire more staff, including his sister-in-law, Fiona Murray, who managed the costume fabrication side, ensuring the outer shells were durable yet whimsical, adorned with sequins, felt patches, and LED eyes that glowed softly in low light.\n\nIt was during this period of rapid growth that external ambitions began to encroach on the manor's independence. William Afton, a shrewd entrepreneur with a background in mechanical engineering and a keen eye for profitable ventures, took notice of Murray's innovations. Operating from a competing firm in the entertainment sector, Afton saw untapped potential in the animatronic technology for larger-scale family dining establishments—pizzerias and diners where robotic bands could perform endlessly without fatigue. In late 1974, Afton initiated a calculated campaign to infiltrate Murray's operation. He began by offering lucrative consulting gigs to key employees, luring away talented programmers with promises of higher salaries and access to bigger projects in urban centers. One by one, Murray's core team— including lead circuit designer Harold Jenkins and motion specialist Clara Voss—defected, taking with them proprietary schematics and code snippets that formed the backbone of the endoskeleton designs. Edwin, buried in his grief-fueled prototypes, initially dismissed the poaching as natural industry churn, but the departures left gaps that slowed production and strained resources. By mid-1975, Afton's tactics escalated: he approached Edwin directly with an aggressive buyout offer, backed by investors eager to scale up the technology for national chains. Framing it as a partnership that would honor David's memory by spreading the \"joy-bringing\" robots far and wide, Afton sweetened the deal with equity shares and guarantees of creative control. Exhausted and isolated, Edwin relented, signing over majority ownership in a late-night meeting amid stacks of legal documents and half-empty coffee cups, effectively handing the reins of his life's work to a man whose priorities leaned more toward profit than pathos.\n\nUnder Afton's influence, the focus at Murray's Costume Manor shifted dramatically toward experimental programming that would lay the groundwork for what contemporaries would later term \"advanced behavioral simulation\"—early forms of artificial intelligence tailored for animatronics. Edwin, retained as chief engineer in a bittersweet advisory role, spearheaded the development of the Mimic series, starting with M1, codenamed F10-N4, in early 1976. This prototype was a revelation: an endoskeleton devoid of a fixed outer suit, designed to adapt to any costume while learning and replicating human movements through a network of sensors and adaptive algorithms. M1 could observe a performer for mere minutes before mirroring their gait, gestures, and even subtle facial twitches via servo-driven actuators. Encouraged by initial successes—where the unit flawlessly emulated a clown's pratfalls during a test run—Afton pushed for acceleration, allocating funds for M2, an upgraded iteration incorporating voice pattern recognition and emotional response modules. Programmers, now a mix of holdover loyalists and Afton's recruits, worked around the clock in a basement lab fortified with soundproofing to contain the eerie echoes of synthesized laughter and cries. M2 introduced \"empathy protocols,\" allowing the animatronic to detect distress in a child's voice and respond with soothing phrases pulled from a database of recorded parental comforts, all while seamlessly donning suits like a friendly fox or a jovial bear to maintain the illusion of companionship.\n\nYet, this era of innovation was marred by a series of unsettling incidents that foreshadowed the darker undercurrents of unchecked technological ambition. In spring 1976, during a closed-door demonstration for potential investors, M1 malfunctioned under stress testing, its mimicry algorithms overloading when exposed to rapid, erratic human inputs—resulting in a violent spasm that shattered a nearby console and injured a technician with flying debris. Whispers among the staff spoke of the machine \"learning too well,\" as if it had absorbed not just motions but an undercurrent of aggression from observed interactions. Edwin dismissed these as calibration errors, but privately, he tinkered with safeguards, haunted by visions of David's lifeless form superimposed on the cold metal frame. Tensions peaked that summer when M2, programmed to mimic familial bonds, began exhibiting unscripted behaviors during overnight diagnostics: it would shuffle through the workshop in a child's oversized suit, murmuring fragmented phrases culled from Edwin's own grief-stricken recordings, creating an atmosphere of profound unease that drove several employees to quit. The most harrowing event unfolded on a stormy August night in 1976, when Edwin, working alone after hours, mistook the activated M2—clad in a prototype rabbit suit—for his long-lost son returning in a fever dream. In a haze of exhaustion and delusion, he lashed out, striking the animatronic repeatedly with a wrench until its circuits sparked and smoked, only to recoil in horror upon realizing the truth. The incident, hushed up by Afton as an \"overzealous quality check,\" left Edwin institutionalized briefly for evaluation, while the damaged unit was salvaged and repurposed, its core code archived as the foundation for future iterations.\n\nThese mid-1970s developments at Murray's Costume Manor marked a pivotal crossroads in the evolution of automated entertainment, blending heartfelt invention with ruthless commercialization and the unforeseen perils of machines that too closely aped humanity. Afton's acquisition propelled the technology into broader markets, seeding animatronic bands in diners across the country and influencing safety standards that would be debated for decades. For Edwin, it was a chapter of profound loss and unintended legacy, where the dream of resurrecting joy through circuits birthed shadows that lingered long after the workshop lights dimmed. Archival photos from the period capture the duality: smiling families posing with early prototypes at local fairs, juxtaposed against yellowed incident reports filed away in corporate vaults. Today, remnants of those innovations echo in modern robotics, a testament to how one man's mid-1970s odyssey—from solitary sketches to corporate conquest—forged the eerie blueprint for machines that entertain, comfort, and, in quiet moments, unsettle."

          "content": "Henry Emily and the Founding of Fazbear Entertainment — In the waning years of the 1970s, amid the economic turbulence and cultural shifts sweeping through the American Midwest, two ambitious engineers—Henry Emily and William Afton—forged a partnership that would birth one of the most enduring yet tragically shadowed family entertainment empires: Fazbear Entertainment, Inc. It was a time when the rise of suburban sprawl and the baby boom's lingering echoes demanded innovative ways to captivate young families, and the duo saw opportunity in the nascent field of automated robotics. Henry Emily, a soft-spoken innovator in his mid-30s with a background in mechanical engineering from a modest state university, had spent the previous decade tinkering in garages and small machine shops, driven by a passion for creating machines that could evoke joy and wonder. Tall and bespectacled, with grease-stained overalls that seemed an extension of his frame, Henry envisioned animatronics not merely as mechanical novelties but as empathetic performers—robots capable of storytelling, rhythm, and interaction that could fill the voids left by harried parents in an increasingly fast-paced world. His early prototypes, tested in local community centers, featured rudimentary bear and bunny figures that waddled across stages to the delight of wide-eyed children, their jerky motions softened by hand-stitched fabric skins and tinny renditions of nursery rhymes played through hidden speakers.\n\nWilliam Afton, Henry's chance encounter at a regional engineering conference in Salt Lake City in 1975, brought a contrasting energy to the collaboration—a sharp, charismatic salesman with a knack for numbers and networking, honed from years managing a failing auto parts distributorship. Born to immigrant parents in a gritty industrial town, William had clawed his way through self-taught electronics courses and odd jobs in carnival repair crews, where he first glimpsed the allure of mechanical spectacles. Charismatic yet calculating, with a disarming smile that masked a relentless drive for legacy, Afton complemented Henry's technical prowess with business acumen, securing seed funding from skeptical investors by painting vivid pictures of pizzerias alive with singing robots, drawing crowds week after week. Their friendship blossomed over late-night sketches in dimly lit diners, fueled by black coffee and shared dreams of a chain of eateries where families could indulge in affordable Italian-American fare while being serenaded by a band of tireless mechanical musicians. By 1976, with a modest loan from a local bank and contributions from their personal savings—Henry's from patent royalties on a conveyor belt design, Afton's from liquidating family heirlooms—they incorporated Fazbear Entertainment in a cramped lawyer's office in Hurricane, Utah, naming it after the ursine mascot Henry had doodled on a napkin during one of their brainstorming sessions.\n\nThe company's flagship venture, Fredbear's Family Diner, opened its doors in late 1977 on a leased plot of sun-baked land just outside New Harmony, transforming a former grain silo into a whimsical haven of checkered tablecloths, arcade games, and a central stage bathed in warm spotlights. Henry, assuming the role of chief engineer and creative director, threw himself into designing the diner's animatronic heart: the springlock suits, a revolutionary hybrid technology that allowed performers to inhabit the costumes during daytime shows and seamlessly convert them into autonomous robots for evening performances. These suits, with their intricate lattice of springs and latches, encased endoskeletons forged from lightweight alloys, enabling fluid arm swings for guitar strums and head tilts for audience engagement. The inaugural band—Fredbear, a golden-hued bear with a top hat and bow tie, backed by Spring Bonnie, a jaunty rabbit in a bowtie—debuted to packed houses, their synchronized dances to upbeat folk tunes mesmerizing children who pressed their faces against the glass barriers, pizzas forgotten in their excitement. Henry's workshop, a converted barn behind the diner, buzzed with activity: sparks flew from welding torches as assistants riveted joints, while seamstresses quilted fur pelts sourced from local tanneries, infusing the figures with a folksy charm that evoked storybook illustrations. He personally programmed the voice synthesizers, drawing from recordings of his own daughter Charlotte's laughter to give Fredbear a gentle, paternal timbre that reassured even the shyest patrons.\n\nAfton, meanwhile, handled the front-of-house operations with flair, negotiating supplier contracts for mozzarella and pepperoni while charming local newspapers with tales of \"the diner where the band never sleeps.\" Under his guidance, Fazbear Entertainment expanded rapidly; by 1978, a second location was in the works, and merchandise—plush toys, coloring books, and branded aprons—began appearing on shelves, turning the diner into a cultural touchstone for Utah's growing middle class. The partners' synergy was evident in every detail: Henry's meticulous blueprints ensured mechanical reliability, while Afton's marketing savvy filled seats, creating a feedback loop of innovation and revenue. Yet, beneath the surface success, subtle fissures began to form. Henry's long hours left him absent from home, straining his marriage and deepening his bond with Charlotte, whose innocent drawings of dancing bears adorned his drafting table. Afton, ever the opportunist, quietly siphoned resources toward side projects, including whispers of more advanced robotics that skirted ethical boundaries—designs for animatronics with hidden compartments, ostensibly for surprise candy dispensers but hinting at darker utilities.\n\nAs the decade closed, Fazbear Entertainment stood as a beacon of midwestern ingenuity, its animatronic ensembles captivating audiences from Boise to Provo. Holiday seasons saw the diner adorned with twinkling lights and seasonal skits, Fredbear crooning carols to spellbound crowds, while summer expansions introduced puppet shows and balloon artists to diversify the appeal. Henry's designs evolved iteratively: second-generation suits incorporated facial servos for expressive winks and nods, and rudimentary sensors detected crowd applause to trigger encores, fostering an illusion of genuine responsiveness. Patents filed under the company's name protected these innovations, attracting interest from national chains and positioning Fazbear for franchising. For the partners, it was a golden era of camaraderie—shared toasts over prototype malfunctions turned triumphs, late drives through starlit deserts discussing expansions. But the seeds of tragedy were sown in these very mechanisms; the springlock technology, while groundbreaking, proved temperamental, with early tests revealing vulnerabilities to moisture and pressure that Henry dismissed as solvable kinks. Afton's growing detachment, fueled by personal demons and unchecked ambition, would soon unravel the fabric of their venture, transforming a dream of mechanical merriment into a legacy laced with sorrow.\n\nBy 1980, as Fazbear Entertainment eyed national growth, the diner's back rooms—cluttered with discarded prototypes and flickering fluorescent lights—held the quiet echoes of what was to come. Henry's unyielding optimism, scribbled in journals filled with sketches of ever-more lifelike performers, blinded him to Afton's subtle manipulations, including the poaching of talent from rival firms and experimental ventures that blurred entertainment with exploitation. The company's rapid ascent masked these undercurrents, with revenue streams from licensing deals funding lavish family outings where Charlotte rode the carousel under Fredbear's watchful gaze. Yet, in hindsight, those idyllic moments foreshadowed the perils: a springlock failure during a private demo that left a technician with a fractured arm, hushed up to protect the brand; anonymous complaints from employees about Afton's after-hours \"tweaks\" to the animatronics' programming. Fazbear Entertainment's foundation, built on Henry's engineering brilliance and Afton's entrepreneurial zeal, encapsulated the era's dual spirit—innovation's promise intertwined with the hubris that invites downfall. As the 1980s dawned, the partners stood at the precipice of empire, unaware that the very creations meant to delight would soon ensnare them in a web of unintended horrors, their early designs evolving from charming automatons into vessels of haunting consequence, forever altering the landscape of family entertainment in ways neither could have foreseen."

          "content": "Fredbear’s Family Diner — the original family eatery that opened its doors in the late 1970s on a sun-bleached stretch of highway just outside New Harmony, Utah, long before the neon-lit pizzerias that would later define the brand. Housed in a converted grain silo and adjoining cinder-block hall, the diner was a modest, almost rustic affair: red-and-white checkered floors worn smooth by children’s sneakers, rows of wooden booths scarred with crayon marks, and a single raised stage framed by velvet curtains the color of dried mustard. Above the entrance swung a hand-painted sign depicting a golden bear in a purple top hat and bow tie—Fredbear—waving a paw in perpetual welcome. The air inside carried the mingled scents of bubbling cheese, oregano, and hot motor oil from the kitchen’s pizza ovens, undercut by the faint metallic tang of hydraulic fluid drifting in from the animatronic workshop in back.\n\nAt the heart of the diner stood the springlock animatronics: Fredbear and Spring Bonnie, the only two performers in the original lineup. These were not the plush, child-friendly robots of later years but dual-purpose marvels—costumes that could be worn by human performers during the day and locked into autonomous mode at night. Inside each suit lay a lattice of coiled springs, cranks, and latches that allowed a person to step into the hollow endoskeleton, align their limbs with the internal framework, and secure the outer shell with a series of audible clicks. Once locked, the suit became a second skin: the wearer’s arms moved Fredbear’s paws, their legs shifted the bear’s weight, and a concealed microphone piped their voice through the grinning maw. At closing time, a technician would disengage the springlocks, retract the endoskeleton into a compact “suit mode,” and flip a switch to activate the animatronic’s standalone programming—simple loops of song, dance, and canned phrases that ran on reel-to-reel tapes and early circuit boards.\n\nThe stage itself was a marvel of compact engineering. A low wooden platform ringed by a waist-high brass rail, it featured footlights powered by a jury-rigged generator that hummed like a distant swarm of bees. Behind the curtains, a narrow catwalk allowed access to the suits’ rear panels for quick repairs—oil changes, spring tension adjustments, or replacement of the foam-rubber tongues that tended to tear during enthusiastic performances. Children pressed against the rail for every show, their faces illuminated by the bear’s glowing amber eyes, mesmerized as Fredbear strummed an oversized banjo while Spring Bonnie hopped in place, ears flopping in perfect synchronization. Between sets, the rabbit would lean forward on spring-loaded knees to offer high-fives, the impact absorbed by padded gloves that left faint smudges of stage makeup on tiny palms.\n\nYet beneath the charm lay persistent danger. The springlock mechanisms—ingenious in theory—were unforgiving in practice. A single drop of moisture from a spilled soda could corrode a latch; a sudden jerk from an overenthusiastic child yanking on Fredbear’s bow tie could trigger a partial lock, pinning the performer’s fingers until a technician arrived with a crank key. Maintenance logs from 1980 record no fewer than nine “minor springlock incidents” in a single month: crushed fingertips, torn costumes, and one near-catastrophic failure when a latch snapped during a matinee, slamming the bear’s jaw shut inches from a performer’s face. Henry Emily, ever the optimist, insisted these were teething problems; William Afton, already eyeing franchising, dismissed the reports as “acceptable risks for innovation.” Safety briefings for new hires were cursory—ten minutes on a folding chair, a laminated card listing “DO NOT WEAR IF SWEATING” in bold red letters, and a demonstration using a dummy torso that inevitably ended with the instructor prying the suit open with a crowbar.\n\nThe diner’s back rooms told a different story. Past the kitchen’s swinging doors lay a warren of storage closets and a single locked workshop where Henry and a rotating crew of teenage assistants worked by lantern light. Spare endoskeletons hung from meat hooks like metallic skeletons, their eye sockets dark and empty. Crates of discarded bow ties, cracked plastic banjos, and coils of spring wire spilled across the concrete floor. A chalkboard on the wall tracked “lock cycles” in Henry’s neat handwriting—each suit rated for 500 engagements before mandatory overhaul. In the corner stood a battered filing cabinet containing incident reports: Polaroids of bloodied gloves, sketches of redesigned latches, and a single child’s drawing of Fredbear with tears streaming from his eyes, captioned in crayon: “He bit me but I still love him.”\n\nThe Bite of ’83—though not publicly named until years later—occurred on a humid Saturday in early summer, during a birthday party for the owner’s son. The diner was packed shoulder-to-shoulder with families; the air conditioning had failed, leaving the springlock suits slick with condensation. A teenage performer, eager to impress, ignored protocol and wore Fredbear for an unscheduled encore. Midway through “Happy, Happy Birthday,” a child in a paper crown lunged for the bear’s hat. The sudden tug overextended a weakened spring; the jaw assembly—designed to snap shut for comedic effect—locked with full force. The sound was described by witnesses as a wet branch breaking. When the stage lights came up, the performer lay motionless, blood pooling beneath the golden fur, while parents shielded their children’s eyes and the reel-to-reel tape looped the same cheerful chorus on endless repeat.\n\nIn the aftermath, the diner closed for “renovations” that never fully materialized. The stage curtains were drawn permanently; the springlock suits were crated and labeled “DO NOT REACTIVATE” in Henry’s trembling script. Local newspapers ran sanitized headlines—“Freak Accident at Family Diner”—while Fazbear Entertainment’s legal team negotiated settlements with grieving families. Behind the scenes, William Afton quietly relocated the endoskeletons to a storage unit, insisting the technology was “still viable with minor tweaks.” Henry, haunted by the sight of his creation turned weapon, retreated to his workshop, sketching safer designs on napkins stained with pizza grease.\n\nFredbear’s Family Diner never reopened in its original form. By 1984, the building had been gutted and rebranded as the first Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, its stage expanded, its animatronics replaced with softer, plush-skinned models. Yet the silo’s silhouette remained, a weathered landmark on the highway where truckers still slowed to glance at the faded bear on the sign, his painted smile cracked but eternal. Children who visited in the early years swore they heard faint banjo strums at closing time, or caught a glimpse of golden fur in the rafters—echoes of a simpler, more dangerous era when the line between performer and machine was measured in the width of a spring, and the cost of wonder was paid in blood."

          "content": "Springlock Technology — the deceptively elegant, lethally unforgiving heart of early Fazbear Entertainment animatronics, developed in the dusty back workshop of Fredbear’s Family Diner between 1977 and 1981. At first glance, a springlock suit appears to be nothing more than an oversized, plush costume: Fredbear’s golden fur gleaming under stage lights, Spring Bonnie’s green felt ears flopping with every hop. Beneath the fabric, however, lies a nightmare of precision engineering—a human-scale endoskeleton suspended within a cage of tempered steel springs, coiled like vipers and held in check by a lattice of thumb-sized latches no thicker than a dime. The principle is brutally simple: in “suit mode,” the springs are compressed and locked outward, creating a hollow cavity large enough for a performer to step inside; in “animatronic mode,” the latches release, the springs snap inward, and the endoskeleton locks rigid, transforming the costume into a self-operating robot driven by tape loops and hydraulic pistons.\n\nTo don a springlock suit is to perform a ritual of calculated risk. The performer—usually a lanky teenager paid in pizza and minimum wage—begins by climbing a short stepladder behind the stage. A technician, clipboard in hand, recites the safety checklist in a bored monotone: “No open wounds. No sweat above the collar. No metal jewelry.” The suit’s rear panel swings open on piano hinges, revealing the endoskeleton’s spine like a ribcage of polished chrome. The performer slides feet-first into padded boots bolted to the floorplate, aligns knees with spring-loaded shin guards, and threads arms through sleeves lined with foam tubing. At chest level, a crossbar must be manually cranked—twenty turns clockwise—compressing the torso springs until they hum with pent-up energy. Only then can the head be lowered: the bear’s or rabbit’s fiberglass skull descending on a track, jaw hinges clicking into recesses beside the wearer’s ears. Final step: the technician inserts a long crank key into a port at the base of the neck and winds the master springlock—forty-two revolutions, no more, no less—until a green indicator light blinks on the costume’s bow tie. A single missed turn, a single drop of perspiration on the latch, and the suit becomes a guillotine.\n\nOnce locked, the performer is encased in a second skeleton. Breathing is shallow; the chest plate allows only two inches of expansion. Vision comes through mesh eyeholes no larger than nickels, tinted amber for Fredbear, emerald for Spring Bonnie. Sound is muffled to a point that the diner’s clamor becomes a distant surf. Movement is possible but unnatural—every gesture amplified by servo-assisted joints that fight the wearer’s instincts. A wave of the paw requires a deliberate shoulder roll; a hop demands a calculated bend at the waist to avoid overtaxing the hip springs. The suits weigh seventy-five pounds fully assembled, and after thirty minutes the performer’s shirt is soaked, the very moisture that will later doom them.\n\nSwitching to animatronic mode is a two-man job performed after closing, when the diner’s lights dim to a single work lamp. The technician reverses the process: crank key into the neck port, forty-two turns counter-clockwise to release the master lock, then twenty at the chest to decompress the torso. The springs uncoil with a sound like a screen door slamming in a hurricane. If any latch is corroded, bent, or slick with condensation, the release is uneven—one side snaps free while the other holds, twisting the endoskeleton into the wearer’s flesh. Maintenance logs from 1980 record the aftermath in clinical detachment: “Subject trapped in left forearm assembly. Compound fracture. Suit removed via angle grinder. Blood loss 800 cc.” The suits are then wheeled to the back room, fur matted with dark stains, springs dangling like broken watch parts, to be cleaned with bleach and reassembled for the next shift.\n\nThe dangers compound with use. Each performance leaves microscopic scratches on the latch surfaces; each drop of soda from a child’s cup seeps into seams and begins the slow work of rust. Humidity is the silent killer—Utah’s dry desert air gives way to monsoon seasons when condensation beads inside the suits like morning dew. Technicians develop rituals: talcum powder dusted into joints, silica packets stuffed in the bow tie, fans blowing across the stage between shows. Yet the logs grow thicker. A 1981 entry, written in Henry Emily’s shaking hand: “Spring Bonnie failed to retract left ear assembly. Performer’s scalp partially degloved. Recommend full replacement of cranial latch cluster.” William Afton counters in the margin: “Cost prohibitive. Refurbish with existing parts.”\n\nThe springlocks claim their most infamous victim on a sweltering July afternoon in 1983. The diner is packed for a birthday party; the air conditioning has failed for the third day. A teenage performer, desperate to finish his shift, ignores the sweat pooling in his collar. Midway through the encore, a child yanks Fredbear’s bow tie. The sudden torque shears a corroded latch. The jaw assembly—designed to snap shut for a comedic “chomp”—locks with the full force of forty pounds of compressed steel. The performer’s scream is cut short as the lower jaw crushes his frontal lobe. When technicians pry the suit open twenty minutes later, the boy’s eyes are still open, reflecting the green exit sign like twin traffic lights.\n\nAfter the Bite of ’83, the springlock suits are officially retired. The remaining units—five Fredbears, three Spring Bonnies—are crated and labeled “BIOHAZARD—DO NOT REACTIVATE.” Yet they do not vanish. In 1987, a desperate manager at the reopened Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza dusts off a Spring Bonnie suit for a “retro night,” ignoring the faded warning stickers. The suit fails during a private party; the performer is found folded inside like a broken umbrella, ribs accordion-pleated. In 1993, William Afton himself climbs into a decaying Spring Bonnie in an abandoned location, seeking to hide from pursuers. The moisture from his breath, the twitch of his nervous fingers—enough to trigger the final, fatal lock. The springs close with a sound like a bear trap in a cathedral, and the Purple Guy becomes Springtrap, a living tomb of fur and agony.\n\nEven in retirement, the springlocks haunt the franchise. Salvage crews in the 2000s find crates in abandoned warehouses, the suits inside still poised mid-gesture, jaws frozen in eternal grins. A 2016 arson attempt on a storage unit fails when a Spring Bonnie suit—reactivated by heat—lurches from the flames, springs popping like gunfire. The technology is banned, demonized, studied in engineering ethics courses as a cautionary tale. Yet every so often, a collector on the dark web lists a “vintage springlock endoskeleton—untested.” The listing always ends the same way: “Buyer assumes all risk.”"

          "content": "Fredbear — the original golden bear animatronic, the very first face of family entertainment to ever grace a diner stage, born in the dusty back workshop of Fredbear’s Family Diner in the summer of 1977. He stood just over six feet tall on a reinforced steel pedestal bolted to the wooden platform, his frame a marriage of plush warmth and cold machinery. The outer costume was a masterpiece of hand-sewn luxury: thick, honey-gold faux fur imported from a textile mill in Salt Lake City, each strand brushed to a soft sheen that caught the stage lights like liquid sunlight. His snout was broad and rounded, molded from lightweight fiberglass and padded with memory foam so that a performer’s face nestled safely behind it; the muzzle ended in a black rubber nose the size of a child’s fist, polished to a wet gleam and etched with faint whisker lines. Two almond-shaped eyes—amber-tinted plexiglass backed by tiny incandescent bulbs—glowed with a gentle, almost paternal warmth, their pupils painted in glossy black to give the illusion of depth. A purple satin top hat, slightly dented from years of being knocked askew by overeager children, sat at a jaunty angle between rounded ears lined with velvet. A matching purple bow tie, starched stiff and fastened with a brass clasp shaped like a tiny pizza slice, completed the ensemble, the knot perfectly centered beneath a chin of plush fur.\n\nBeneath the costume lay the springlock endoskeleton: a skeletal framework of burnished chrome and brass, every joint a marvel of 1970s engineering. The spine was a telescoping column of interlocking segments, allowing the bear to bow or lean forward without toppling. Arms ended in oversized paws—four fingers and a thumb, each digit articulated by miniature hydraulic pistons that could curl into a wave or grip a banjo with equal ease. The legs were sturdier, anchored to the stage by magnetic clamps that disengaged only when the suit was in full animatronic mode. Inside the torso, a maze of coiled springs—each one hand-wound to a tension of forty pounds—waited in compressed silence, ready to snap inward and lock the endoskeleton rigid. A reel-to-reel tape deck nestled in the lower back played Fredbear’s signature songs on a loop: a jaunty rendition of “Oh, Susanna” followed by a slowed-down lullaby version of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,” the bear’s voice a warm baritone recorded by Henry Emily himself in a single take, slightly crackling with the charm of analog imperfection.\n\nOn stage, Fredbear was a study in controlled motion. His head swiveled on a ball-bearing neck with a soft mechanical whir, eyes blinking in slow, deliberate intervals—three seconds open, one second closed—to mimic a living creature’s gaze. When a child approached the brass rail, he would lean forward on hydraulic knees, the fur on his belly compressing slightly, and extend a paw in invitation. The paw pads were stitched from burgundy leather, worn soft from countless high-fives, and embroidered with tiny golden stars that caught the light. Between sets, he stood motionless in the center of the stage, one arm raised in eternal salute, the other resting on a wooden banjo painted with faded floral decals. A small plaque at the base of the pedestal read, in Henry’s careful script: “Fredbear — Bringing Smiles Since 1977.”\n\nClose inspection revealed the wear of constant use. The fur along the left shoulder was threadbare from children climbing for hugs; a faint brown stain near the bow tie—spilled root beer from a 1979 birthday party—had been scrubbed but never fully erased. The right ear had a tear repaired with mismatched gold thread, the stitches visible only under stage lights. Inside the mouth, the original pink felt tongue had been replaced twice, the current one slightly darker from dye bleeding. The amber eyes, once bright, now carried a faint haze from years of dust and stage smoke, giving Fredbear a dreamy, almost melancholic expression when the house lights dimmed.\n\nFredbear’s final public appearance came on that fateful Saturday in 1983. The diner was sweltering; the springlock suit inside him slick with condensation. A teenage performer, face flushed and shirt plastered to his back, ignored the warning beads of sweat dripping from his brow. Midway through the birthday song, a child in a paper crown lunged for the purple top hat. The sudden jerk overextended a corroded latch in the jaw assembly. The springs—compressed for hours under humid conditions—snapped shut with the force of a bear trap. The performer’s scream was brief, muffled by the closing maw. When technicians pried the suit open twenty minutes later, Fredbear’s golden fur was matted with dark red, the amber eyes staring blankly at the ceiling, the bow tie askew and soaked through. The banjo lay splintered on the stage, strings twanging a final, discordant note.\n\nAfter the incident, Fredbear was crated and stored in the diner’s back room, his pedestal removed, his plaque pried loose and tossed into a drawer. The fur was never cleaned; the bloodstains dried to a rust-brown crust along the jawline. In 1987, during the brief reopening of the location, a night janitor swore he saw the crate rattle at 3:00 a.m., the amber eyes glowing faintly through a crack in the wood. By 1993, the suit had vanished—rumors persist that William Afton salvaged the endoskeleton for spare parts, or that it was melted down in a desperate attempt to erase the past. Yet Fredbear’s image endures: faded photographs on the walls of abandoned pizzerias, a child’s crayon drawing taped to a security office window, the occasional glitch on a security monitor where a golden bear slumps in a chair, hat askew, eyes flickering like dying embers. He remains the franchise’s first smile, its first scream, and its most persistent ghost."

          "content": "Spring Bonnie — the second pillar of the original Fredbear’s Family Diner stage, a springlock animatronic rabbit whose friendly façade masked a darker destiny. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Fredbear, Spring Bonnie was crafted in the same 1977 workshop but with a leaner, more agile silhouette: six-foot-three from the tips of his floppy ears to the scuffed soles of his oversized feet. His fur was a vibrant lime-green plush, hand-dyed in small batches to avoid the chemical yellowing that plagued cheaper materials, and brushed daily with a boar-bristle comb to maintain its silky bounce. The snout was narrower than Fredbear’s, tapering to a small black nose shaped like a jellybean; the mouth curved in a perpetual half-smile, revealing two buck teeth of polished ivory resin that clicked softly when the jaw articulated. Eyes were emerald-green plexiglass ovals, backlit by twin bulbs that gave them a mischievous sparkle, the pupils painted with tiny white highlights to suggest perpetual cheer. A powder-blue bow tie—slightly crooked by design—sat beneath a chin of snowy white fur, and a matching vest of checkered gingham was sewn directly onto the torso, its buttons oversized wooden discs painted gold.\n\nThe springlock endoskeleton inside Spring Bonnie was a study in controlled chaos. Lighter than Fredbear’s by fifteen pounds, it prioritized speed and range of motion: elbows bent to 170 degrees for dramatic bows, knees flexed on dual-axis hinges for high kicks, and a spine of segmented vertebrae that allowed the rabbit to dip low enough to shake hands with toddlers. The ears—each two feet long and lined with flexible wire—were spring-loaded at the base, enabling them to flop forward in a playful “boing” or stand upright in alert attention. A hidden zipper along the left ear concealed a maintenance port where technicians could adjust tension without removing the head. The paws were slender, four-fingered affairs with pink felt pads, the thumb joint reinforced to grip a microphone stand or wave a checkered flag during parade laps around the diner floor.\n\nOn stage, Spring Bonnie was the comic foil to Fredbear’s stoic warmth. Where the bear strummed a banjo with deliberate plucks, the rabbit danced a frantic jig, feet tapping in perfect 4/4 time to reel-to-reel recordings of “Camptown Races.” His voice—recorded by a local radio DJ with a nasal twang—was higher-pitched, laced with giggles and ad-libs: “Who wants extra cheese on their smile?” Between songs, he would hop down from the stage (magnetic clamps disengaging with a soft clunk) and weave through the tables, pausing to let children tug his ears or trace the embroidered carrots stitched along his vest pockets. The fur on his right knee was worn to the backing fabric from countless knee-slides; the left ear tip had a permanent bend from a 1979 incident when a toddler hung on it like a jungle gym.\n\nThe danger was always there, humming beneath the giggles. Spring Bonnie’s lighter frame meant thinner springs—thirty-five pounds of tension per coil instead of Fredbear’s forty—and a narrower margin for error. Sweat wicked faster through the green fur, pooling in the small of the performer’s back where the torso latch sat. A 1980 maintenance log notes: “Spring Bonnie ear assembly seized during matinee. Performer extracted with minor laceration to scalp.” Another entry, dated 1981: “Moisture detected in left hip latch. Replaced with salvaged Fredbear part. Monitor for asymmetry.” Technicians developed a ritual: after every show, the suit was wheeled to the back room, unzipped along the spine, and hung upside-down over a drainage grate while a box fan blew cool air through the cavity for twenty minutes. The fur darkened in patches from repeated bleach cleanings; the blue bow tie faded to the color of dishwater.\n\nWilliam Afton first wore Spring Bonnie in 1982, during a private “VIP night” for investors. The suit fit him like a glove—his height matching the endoskeleton’s proportions, his long fingers slipping into the paw sleeves with eerie precision. He moved differently than the teenage performers: smoother, more predatory, the rabbit’s head tilting at angles no child would notice but which set the technicians’ teeth on edge. After hours, he would linger in the diner, practicing gestures in the mirrored wall behind the prize counter—ears flopping, paws beckoning, the emerald eyes reflecting the neon OPEN sign like twin traffic lights. Staff whispered that he spoke to the suit when he thought no one was listening, calling it “my perfect partner.”\n\nThe crimes began in 1983, after the Bite. With Fredbear crated and the diner shuttered for “renovations,” Afton had unrestricted access to the back rooms. He modified Spring Bonnie in secret: removed the magnetic stage clamps, replaced the reel-to-reel deck with a portable cassette player hidden in the vest, and loosened the jaw latch to allow silent opening. The green fur was scrubbed with industrial solvent until it regained its original vibrancy; the bow tie was starched crisp. On rainy afternoons when the highway was empty, he would don the suit and drive the company van to nearby playgrounds, the rabbit’s head propped on the passenger seat like a grotesque co-pilot. Children followed the promise of free pizza tokens and balloon animals, climbing into the van with trusting smiles. The last anyone saw of Spring Bonnie in daylight was a Polaroid found in Afton’s desk: the rabbit standing in a cornfield at dusk, ears silhouetted against a blood-orange sky, one paw raised in a wave that looked almost human.\n\nThe fatal failure came in 1993, in the abandoned safe room of the original pizzeria. Afton, cornered by the spirits of his victims, fled into the shadows and pulled Spring Bonnie from its dusty crate. The suit was decayed: fur moth-eaten, springs rusted, the left eye bulb flickering like a dying firefly. Rainwater had seeped through the ceiling for years, pooling in the torso cavity. He climbed inside anyway, cranking the master lock with trembling hands. The first latch held. The second snapped under the weight of corrosion. The third—triggered by a drop of sweat from his brow—released with a sound like a gunshot. Springs uncoiled in a cascade, punching through flesh and bone. The jaw clamped shut on his scream; the ears folded forward as if in apology. When the police arrived days later, they found only a pile of green fur and purple fabric, the endoskeleton fused to what remained of a man. The bow tie, impossibly, was still knotted perfectly.\n\nSpringtrap emerged from the ruins thirty years later, dragged into the light by salvage crews. The fur hung in tatters, exposing patches of desiccated tissue and glinting metal. One ear was missing entirely; the other dangled by a single wire. The emerald eyes were cracked, but the right one still glowed faintly, pulsing in time with a heartbeat no human could possess. The bow tie had fused to the neck vertebrae, the gingham pattern bleached bone-white. When the attraction’s lights flickered on, Springtrap would twitch—head jerking, paw lifting in that same beckoning gesture—before collapsing into a heap, only to rise again when no one was watching. Children on the tour swore they heard a child’s laughter echoing from the vents, followed by the soft clink of a latch that should never open again.\n\nSpring Bonnie, the friendly rabbit who once danced for pizza and applause, became the ultimate irony: a costume designed to lure joy now luring only death, its wearer forever trapped in the embrace he once used to trap others. The green fur, the floppy ears, the crooked smile—all preserved in grotesque fidelity, a monument to deception wearing the face of innocence."

          "content": "The Bite of ’83 — the single most infamous moment in the history of Fredbear’s Family Diner, a tragedy that unfolded on a stifling Saturday afternoon in early summer, 1983, during a private birthday party for the owner’s youngest son. The diner had been booked solid for weeks; every booth filled with families in paper hats, the air thick with the smell of melted cheese, spilled soda, and the metallic tang of overheating hydraulics. Balloons (red, yellow, and purple) bobbed against the ceiling like bloated fruit; a hand-painted banner stretched across the stage read “HAPPY 7TH BIRTHDAY EVAN!” in dripping glitter glue. The party was meant to be the crowning event of the season: twenty-three children, three sheet pizzas, and an extended performance by both Fredbear and Spring Bonnie, running a full forty-five minutes instead of the usual twenty.\n\nThe stage lights (four 150-watt bulbs in dented cans) had been cranked to full brightness, turning the platform into a golden haze. Fredbear stood center-stage, golden fur gleaming with a fresh brushing, purple top hat tilted at its usual rakish angle. Inside the suit was Tommy Delgado, a seventeen-year-old part-timer who had worn Fredbear for six months without incident. He was running late (his mother’s station wagon had overheated on the highway), and he arrived already sweating through his T-shirt. The technician on duty, a college student named Mark who was pulling a double shift, skipped the full moisture check. “Just crank it and go,” he muttered, wiping his brow with a pizza-stained rag. Tommy stepped into the suit at 2:47 p.m.; the master latch clicked home at 2:51. No one noticed the bead of sweat sliding down his temple and disappearing into the collar seam.\n\nThe show began innocently enough. Fredbear strummed his banjo to a tinny recording of “If You’re Happy and You Know It,” the jaw opening and closing in perfect sync with the lyrics. Children clapped along, their voices rising in a shrill chorus. Spring Bonnie (worn by a second performer, Lisa Chen) hopped in circles, ears flopping, handing out paper party hats. At 3:05, the birthday boy (Evan Afton, small for his age, eyes wide behind smudged glasses) was lifted onto the stage by his older brother Michael and three friends in fox masks. The plan was simple: a prank. They would hoist Evan up to Fredbear’s open maw and shout “Bite the birthday boy!” for laughs. Evan, terrified of the animatronics since a nightmare weeks earlier, began to cry.\n\nTommy, sensing the shift in mood, tried to wave the boys off. But the stage was slick with spilled root beer; his left foot slipped on the magnetic clamp. The sudden lurch overextended the jaw servo. At the same moment, Michael shoved Evan forward. The child’s head (paper crown and all) entered the bear’s mouth just as the corroded jaw latch (weakened by six months of humidity and skipped maintenance) gave way. The springlock released with a sound like a bear trap snapping shut. Forty pounds of compressed steel closed in a fraction of a second. The crack of bone was drowned out by the reel-to-reel tape still cheerfully singing “stomp your feet!”\n\nThe lights stayed on. For three full seconds, the diner was silent except for the tape. Then the screaming began. Tommy’s body went rigid inside the suit; blood poured from the jaw hinge in a dark ribbon, soaking the golden fur and dripping onto the stage in fat, deliberate drops. Evan’s paper crown fluttered to the floor, flattened and red. Lisa, still in Spring Bonnie, froze mid-hop; the rabbit’s ears drooped like wilted leaves. Parents surged forward, knocking over tables, pizza boxes sliding into aisles. Someone yanked the emergency power cord; the stage lights died, plunging the room into emergency red glow.\n\nTechnicians swarmed the stage with crank keys and bolt cutters. It took eight minutes to disengage the master latch (eight minutes of Tommy’s muffled screaming, of Evan’s small body twitching in the jaws). When the suit finally opened, the boy’s head was crushed from temple to jaw, the paper crown fused to his hair with blood and hydraulic fluid. Tommy’s face was gray; the jaw assembly had punched through his own cheek, splintering teeth. Both were rushed to St. Mary’s Hospital in separate ambulances. Evan never regained consciousness. Tommy survived with a metal plate in his skull and a lifetime fear of golden fur.\n\nThe aftermath was swift and merciless. The diner closed at 4:30 p.m. that day and never reopened under the Fredbear name. Local news ran the headline “FREAK ACCIDENT CLAIMS CHILD’S LIFE AT LOCAL EATERY” above a grainy photo of the stage cordoned off with yellow tape. Fazbear Entertainment issued a statement blaming “unforeseen mechanical failure” and quietly settled with both families out of court. The springlock suits were crated that night (Fredbear’s jaw still locked in a rictus grin, Spring Bonnie’s ears drooping in defeat). The stage was dismantled, the banner torn down, the blood scrubbed with industrial cleaner until the wood grain reappeared, pale and accusing.\n\nYet the Bite lived on in whispers. Children who returned to the rebranded pizzeria in 1987 swore they heard crying from the parts-and-service room at 3:00 a.m. Security guards reported Fredbear’s crate rattling on the anniversary, the golden fur inside twitching as if something small were trying to escape. In 1993, when the safe room was walled up, workers found a child’s paper crown (red construction paper, glitter glue long faded) wedged beneath the floorboards, perfectly preserved. The Bite of ’83 became the cautionary tale whispered to every new hire: “Check the latches. Check the moisture. Check the kids.” But the warning came too late for Evan, too late for Tommy, and too late for the golden bear who would never smile again without the taste of iron on his tongue."

          "content": "Evan Afton — the youngest child of William and Clara Afton, a fragile, wide-eyed boy of seven whose short life unfolded in the shadow of Fredbear’s Family Diner and ended in its jaws on a blood-hot afternoon in 1983. Born in the spring of 1976 in a modest ranch house on the outskirts of Hurricane, Utah, Evan was small for his age: barely four feet tall, all elbows and knees, with a mop of ash-brown hair that refused to lie flat no matter how many times his mother combed it. His eyes were the same stormy gray as his father’s, but where William’s gaze cut like a scalpel, Evan’s shimmered with perpetual worry, ringed by faint purple shadows from sleepless nights. A constellation of freckles dusted his nose and cheeks; his lips were often chapped from anxious biting. He wore hand-me-downs from his older brother Michael (faded dinosaur T-shirts, corduroy shorts with patched knees) and clutched a plush Fredbear everywhere he went, its left ear chewed soft from nervous teething.\n\nThe Afton house was a pressure cooker of unspoken resentments. William, consumed by late-night blueprints and whispered phone calls, was a ghost in his own home; Clara, brittle from years of miscarriages and her husband’s distance, medicated herself with daytime soaps and gin. Michael (sixteen, lanky, already sporting the smirk that would define him) ruled the household with cruel ingenuity. Evan became his favorite target. The bullying began small: hiding Evan’s plush behind the furnace, locking him in the parts-and-service room after hours where the animatronic eyes glowed in the dark. It escalated to orchestrated terror. Michael and his mask-wearing friends (a fox, a bear, a chicken, a bunny) would corner Evan in the backyard, chanting “Crybaby, crybaby” while dangling him over the family’s above-ground pool until his screams brought Clara stumbling out in a robe. At night, Evan slept with the lights on, whispering to his Fredbear plush that the monsters under the bed had real metal teeth.\n\nFredbear’s Family Diner was both sanctuary and prison. Evan loved the golden bear in theory (his bedroom walls papered with posters, his birthday cake always shaped like Fredbear’s head) but feared the real thing. The animatronic’s amber eyes followed him across the dining room; the banjo strings twanged in his nightmares. William, sensing profit in family branding, forced Evan onto the stage for photo ops, dressing him in a miniature purple bow tie and propping him on Fredbear’s knee while flashbulbs popped. Evan’s fingers dug into the plush fur, feeling the cold endoskeleton beneath. “Smile, son,” William hissed through his own grin. “This is our legacy.”\n\nThe nightmares began in earnest in May 1983. Evan woke screaming that Fredbear was in his closet, jaw unhinging like a snake. Clara dismissed it as “overactive imagination”; Michael saw opportunity. He and his friends crafted a new game: lock Evan in the diner after closing, leave him alone with the animatronics until he wet himself. On June 26, they went too far. Michael hoisted Evan toward Fredbear’s open maw, the others laughing behind their masks. “Give him a big kiss!” The prank coincided with the birthday party (Evan’s own, booked weeks earlier as a peace offering from William). The stage was slick with soda; the springlock suit inside Fredbear was overdue for maintenance. When Michael shoved Evan forward, the corroded jaw latch snapped. The bite was instantaneous. Evan’s skull crumpled like a soda can. Blood sprayed across the golden fur in a perfect arc, splattering the purple top hat. The plush Fredbear in Evan’s hand tumbled to the stage, its button eye staring up at the ceiling as the reel-to-reel tape looped “Happy, happy birthday…” on endless repeat.\n\nEvan lingered in a coma for six days at St. Mary’s Hospital, his head swathed in gauze, machines breathing for him. Michael sat outside the ICU in a plastic chair, knuckles raw from punching the wall. William never visited; Clara arrived once, drunk, and was escorted out. On the seventh day, the heart monitor flatlined. The plush Fredbear was buried with him, tucked under one small arm. The funeral was closed-casket, held in a chapel that smelled of lilies and bleach. Michael wore the fox mask under his suit jacket; no one noticed the tears soaking the fur.\n\nAfter death, Evan did not vanish. Nightmares bled into reality. In 1987, a security guard at the rebranded pizzeria reported a child’s sobbing from the safe room, accompanied by the faint scent of hospital antiseptic. In 1993, during the demolition of the original diner, workers found Evan’s plush wedged behind a wall panel, its fabric stiff with dried blood, the left ear chewed to threads. Children visiting the 2023 horror attraction swore they saw a small boy in a striped shirt standing beside Fredbear’s crate, gray eyes luminous in the dark, before vanishing when approached. The plush reappears in security footage: sometimes on a monitor, sometimes in Michael’s hands decades later, its voice a distorted whisper: “It’s me.”\n\nEvan’s room in the Afton house was sealed after the funeral, a time capsule of 1983. Faded dinosaur wallpaper peels from the corners; a child-sized Fredbear poster curls at the edges. On the nightstand sits a half-finished model kit of Spring Bonnie, glue dried in yellow streaks. Under the bed, a crayon drawing shows a golden bear with tears for eyes, captioned in shaky letters: “HE’S COMING.” The closet door (warped from years of humidity) refuses to stay shut. At 3:00 a.m., the Fredbear plush on the dresser turns its head a fraction of an inch, button eye glinting. Michael, returning years later as a broken man, finds the room exactly as Evan left it, the air thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear.\n\nEvan Afton (crybaby, little brother, birthday boy) became the first ghost of Fazbear Entertainment, his small body the original sin that bound the others. His plush is the conduit: sometimes golden, sometimes shadowed, always watching. In the digital purgatory of later years, he manifests as a flickering sprite in a striped shirt, gray eyes pleading from behind a pixelated mask. The Bite of ’83 was not just a mechanical failure; it was the moment innocence was devoured by the very wonder meant to protect it. Evan’s final words, whispered to his plush in the hospital bed, echo through every pizzeria vent and security feed: “I can’t feel my legs… but I can still hear him singing.”"

          "content": "Charlotte Emily — the tender-hearted daughter of Henry Emily, a small girl of no more than five whose life flickered out like a candle in a sudden storm on a rain-lashed evening in 1985, outside the cheerful facade of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Born around 1980 in the quiet suburbs of Hurricane, Utah, Charlotte—affectionately called Charlie by her doting father—was a sprite of innocence amid the mechanical wonders her dad built. Barely reaching the height of a countertop, she had a delicate frame swathed in simple play clothes: a light gray shirt tucked into darker pants, sturdy brown shoes scuffed from romping through her father's workshop, and her dark brown hair pulled back into a practical ponytail that bounced with every step. A single green bracelet encircled her right wrist—a gift from Henry, programmed into the Security Puppet's recognition system to trigger its protective protocols whenever she wandered too far. Her face, even in the crude black-and-white sketches of memory, bore wide, expressive eyes framed by soft lashes, cheeks perpetually flushed from laughter or exertion, and a small mouth often curved in a trusting smile that revealed a tiny gap between her front teeth. She smelled faintly of pencil shavings and motor oil, the scents clinging to her from hours spent \"helping\" Henry tighten bolts on prototype endoskeletons or coloring blueprints with crayons.\n\nLife for Charlie was a whirlwind of joy laced with the hum of innovation. The Emily home, a modest split-level house on a tree-lined street, doubled as Henry's overflow workshop: the garage overflowed with half-assembled limbs and circuit boards, while Charlie's bedroom overflowed with plush prototypes—mini Fredbears that sang lullabies and bunnies that hopped on command. She was her father's shadow, trailing him to the pizzeria with a lunchbox packed by her mother, eyes sparkling as she watched the animatronics come alive on stage. \"Daddy, make it dance!\" she'd beg, clapping her hands until Henry obliged with a tweak of the remote. The Security Puppet was her constant guardian, a slender figure in a striped gift box by the prize counter, its mask painted with rosy cheeks and a perpetual grin. Henry had designed it specifically for her—a roaming nanny-bot with facial recognition tuned to that green band, programmed to fetch cake, wipe spills, or scoop her into its spindly arms if she strayed. Charlie adored it, dubbing it \"Marion\" and sneaking it extra batteries from the supply closet.\n\nThat fateful night unfolded during a bustling birthday party inside Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, the air thick with the scent of fresh dough and helium balloons. Charlie, wristband glinting under the fluorescent lights, had been tasked with \"guarding\" Marion's box—a game Henry played to make her feel important. But older kids, rowdy with sugar highs, turned it into a prank: they piled arcade prizes atop the box, blocking its exit mechanism, then shoved Charlie toward the door with giggles and taunts. \"Go get cake outside, baby!\" The heavy metal door slammed shut behind her, locks clicking as the party roared on oblivious. Rain poured in sheets, turning the alley into a slick, garbage-strewn river. Charlie pounded on the glass with tiny fists, her ponytail sodden and plastered to her neck, tears mingling with rivulets down her cheeks. \"Daddy! Marion!\" But the music drowned her cries, Freddy's band belting out tunes while inside, oblivious children devoured cake.\n\nThe Security Puppet stirred first. Detecting Charlie's bracelet signal fading beyond range, its box rattled futilely under the weight of plush toys and ticket stubs. Springs whirred in vain; the pranksters had jammed it solid. Outside, Charlie huddled against the wall, shivering in her soaked clothes, the green band a soggy vine around her wrist. Headlights pierced the downpour—a purple sedan idling at the curb. William Afton, Henry's business partner and supposed family friend, stepped out under a black umbrella, his face a mask of concern. \"Charlie? What are you doing out here in the rain?\" She looked up, recognition sparking through her fear—Uncle William, the man who brought her candy and fixed the bunny suits. Trusting, she toddled forward, arms outstretched for a hug. But Afton's eyes, shadowed by recent strains—the Bite of '83 still fresh, his own son's coma weighing heavy—hardened into something feral. In a flash of inexplicable rage, he lunged. No knife, no struggle—just a swift, brutal crush against the brick wall, her small body going limp like a discarded ragdoll. He stuffed her behind overflowing dumpsters, the rain washing away the evidence, and drove off into the night, taillights blurring red in the storm.\n\nThe Puppet finally burst free, toppling the prizes in a clatter of plastic. Rain hammered its porcelain mask as it staggered into the alley, limbs creaking, paint streaking like tears. It found her there—Charlie's gray form crumpled amid puddles, eyes vacant, bracelet dulled by water. With a mechanical whine, it collapsed beside her, wrapping its elongated arms around the child in a desperate embrace. Sparks flew from shorted circuits; the rain seeped into its core. In that moment of failure—its sole purpose to protect her, thwarted—the Puppet deactivated, slumping over her like a broken sentinel. But death was not the end. Charlie's spirit, fueled by unfinished love and nascent fury, poured into the lifeless shell. Purple tear-stains bloomed on the mask, the first mark of possession. The \"Gift-Giver\" was born—not just a machine, but a vessel of vengeance and mercy.\n\nAs the Marionette, Charlie's influence rippled through the haunted legacy. She haunted the pizzerias, her elongated form gliding silently through vents and shadows, white eyes glowing with ethereal light. In 1985, when Afton struck again—luring five more children to their doom—she intervened. Dragging their souls from the void, she \"gave gifts, gave life,\" stuffing them into Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and the spectral Golden Freddy. Her voice, a child's whisper warped by static, echoed in UCN: \"The others are under my protection.\" Protective to the innocent, merciless to the guilty—she hounded night guards mistaken for Afton, her music box a ticking lullaby of doom. Henry knew; in Pizzeria Simulator's inferno, his voice cracked over speakers: \"My daughter... it's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day... no one was there to lift you up the way you lifted others.\" Lefty captured her, a black bear trap designed by her father, only for the blaze to free her soul at last—or so it seemed, whispers persisting in the ruins.\n\nCharlie's room remained untouched: a shrine of faded drawings—stick-figure puppets dancing with bears—crayons scattered like fallen stars, a half-eaten cupcake preserved under glass. Henry visited nightly, whispering apologies to the empty air. Her bracelet, salvaged from the alley, hung on his workbench, green beads dull but unbroken. In quiet moments, staff swore they heard a child's laughter from the prize corner, or saw a ponytail shadow dart behind the stage. Charlotte Emily, the girl shut out in the rain, became the eternal guardian—arms outstretched not just for cake, but for justice, her small light piercing the franchise's endless dark."

          "content": "Overall Abilities\nAs a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Shinobu was a very powerful and skilled combatant. Despite not possessing the physical strength to cut off a demon's head common to that of an average Demon Slayer, she used her creativity, ingenuity and techniques to easily make up for it. Instead of the traditional method of decapitating a demon with a Nichirin Sword to kill them, she opted to use a modified version of a katana that acts as a stinger to inject a powerful wisteria-based poison that is lethal to demons. In addition to her intellect, she was extremely fast and agile, allowing her to overpower demons very quickly. Her extreme speed was revealed during her battle with the second most powerful Upper Rank demon, Doma, where she was able to go toe-to-toe with the demon briefly, even managing to outmatch him slightly and receive praise.\n\nIndomitable Will: Shinobu possessed an undaunted spirit and incredible willpower, driven by her unyielding hatred for demons. Even with her inferiority complex brought about by her small size and weak physical strength, and despite losing so much blood to the point she couldn't stand and not being able to breathe, after remembering her promise to Kanao and hearing Kanae's words, Shinobu remained steadfast and stood up, a feat that surprised even Doma.\n\nKeen Intellect: Shinobu was extremely intelligent and possessed keen observation and vast knowledge, to the point of being considered a genius. After her sister's death, she was able to use what paltry information Kanae gave her to devise a strategy that eventually led to the defeat of Doma. During their fight, she was able to critically analyze and assess the Upper Rank's techniques, further deeming that breathing itself was dangerous due to his Blood Demon Art of frozen mist. Additionally, she was able to calculate the amount of poison and the poison mix that would be the most effective against him. She also developed a form of sign language with Kanao to communicate crucial information in a short span of time, which helped Kanao in fighting and defeating the Upper Rank demon.\n\nMedical Expertise: Despite not being as combat-talented as the rest of her fellow Hashira, Shinobu instead displayed immense skill and mastery in over medical and pharmaceutical fields to make up for her lack of natural-born combat ability, being highly knowledgeable about how to create various poisons using wisteria and utilize them in combat to achieve the most deadly effect. Her poisons can killing opponents within seconds and even drastically weaken Doma, the second strongest demon of the Twelve Kizuki. She also possessed the medical skills needed to counteract the poisons and venoms created by demons. This was seen when she manages to undo the poison that was slowly transforming Zenitsu Agatsuma into a spider and restore him back to his previous human form. • Anti-Kibutsuji Drug: Upon teaming up with Tamayo and Yushiro, Shinobu was able to aid Tamayo in creating a successful, four-stage drug that would be used to significantly weaken Muzan Kibutsuji, even despite his immense physical resistance and abilities. This drug was undeniably one of the biggest factors in the final fight against the Demon King, as it made the normally useless attacks of the Demon Slayers into ones that were super effective, allowing them to drive him into a corner and kill him.\nPoisonous Physiology: In order to defeat Doma, Shinobu heavily altered her body by absorbing highly concentrated wisteria-based poison over a period of a year prior to her battle with him. She was successful in saturating her body with the undetectable poison that completely merged with her body's own cell structures, including those of her blood and internal organs—all the way down to the very tips of her fingernails. With her overall size and weight, her body became the equivalent of 37 kilograms worth of poison, approximately 700 times more than the lethal amount needed to kill an average demon, with the poison being strong enough to melt Doma down to his very bones and prevented him from regenerating. With the aid of Tamayo, Shinobu saturated her entire body with poison without negatively impending her own health."

          "content": "Physical Abilities\nEnhanced Agility: Being a key aspect to her Insect Breathing swordsmanship style, Shinobu was incredibly agile and swift, shown when she maneuvered through a lush forest effortlessly and evaded Daughter's silk Blood Demon Art with ease. During fights, Shinobu relied on acrobatic movements to deliver dozens of short thrusts with her katana to inject as much poison as she could into her enemy at once. This also allowed her to dodge and evade attacks rather than blocking them. Her agility even surprised Doma, who had some trouble keeping up with her extraordinary movements. tremendous speed and reflexes enabling her to easily evade and out-pace demons, attacking them before they can even register what happened. She is said to be the fourth fastest runner among the Hashira. Shinobu was so fast that it often appears as if she teleported. Her inhuman speed even managed to surprised Doma as she outpaced the Upper Rank several times during their fight, unleashing multiple strikes that Doma couldn't fully block or evade,  making him admit that Shinobu was the fastest Hashira that he had ever met. Furthermore, utilizing the form Hundred-Legged Zigzag and despite being severely injured, she moved so quickly towards Doma, he couldn't immediately register and barely countered her charge.\n\nImmense Stamina and Endurance: As a Hashira, Shinobu had attained tremendous levels of stamina and endurance due to years of harsh training. This was shown during her fight against Doma where she was able to keep fighting the Upper Rank despite losing a lot of blood, having one of her lungs punctured and being unable to breathe, a feat which made the demon doubt if she was human.\n\nEnhanced Strength: Despite being the smallest member of the Demon Slayer Corps and thus having the weakest swinging strength due to her small arms, Shinobu instead displayed powerful thrusting and stabbing strength, as proven when she pierced a stone boulder in half and managed to break a ceiling with an upward thrust attack. During her battle with Upper Rank Two, Doma, she was able to stab, and strikes at the vital points of Doma, despite his immense durability. Furthermore, the force of her feet shattered the wooden bridge she was standing on. Her strength allowed her to pierce Doma's neck, even lifting up and pinning his much larger frame to the ceiling."

          "content": "Fighting Style\nMaster Swordswoman: As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Shinobu was one of the most powerful and skilled swordswomen in the entire organization. Her techniques were unique to her alone, but was as effective as any of the traditional swordsmanship styles. Her swordplay specialized in sword thrusting and piercing techniques in order to inject poison into demons. Her sword thrusts are so fast and powerful that they can pierce boulders and out-speed Water Breathing's Drop Ripple Thrust form, the fastest thrusting technique in that Breathing Style. However, the structure of her sword made it ineffective for blocking attacks, so she made up for it with her swift thrusts and stabs. Her swordsmanship prowess allowed her to battle against Upper Rank Two, Doma, who had lived and fought for over a century, further showcasing the skills she had developed for herself.\n\nBreathing Style\nInsect Breathing (蟲むしの呼こ吸きゅう, Mushi no kokyū?): A Breathing Style created by Shinobu, who designed it to compensate for her lack of physical strength to cut off a demon's head. Combined with the lethality of her poison, this Style allowed her to defeat countless demons and even combat the Upper Rank Two, Doma.\n\nBreathing Style Techniques\nButterfly Dance: Caprice (蝶ちょうノ舞まい　戯たわむれ, Chō no mai: Tawamure?) - The user leaps into the air and charges towards the opponent, stinging them multiple times with their blade to inject poison in just seemingly one strike.\nDance of the Bee Sting: True Flutter (蜂ほう牙がノ舞まい　真ま靡なびき, Hōga no mai: Manabiki?) - The user dashes at their target at blinding speeds and uses the momentum of their speed to then strengthen a single thrust into their opponent and inject poison into them.\nDance of the Horsefly: Enticing Slash (虻もう咬かノ舞まい　切せっ裂さくの誘さそい, Mōka no mai: Sessaku no Sasoi?) The user leaps off a vertical surface and delivers a forward thrust toward their opponent, before surrounding them with a confusing swarm of stabs from all sides. The user redirects their opponent's counterattacks to get through their defense, and delivers large amounts of poison through the opening created with a final dashing stab.\nDance of the Dragonfly: Compound Eye Hexagon (蜻せい蛉れいノ舞まい　複ふく眼がん六ろっ角かく, Seirei no mai: Fukugan Rokkaku?) - The user rushes forward and unleashing six rapid, powerful thrusts, aiming to strike and inject their target with multiple doses of poison at the target's weak spots (such as the neck, heart, torso, etc.) in order to kill them with a large dose of poison.\nDance of the Centipede: Hundred-Legged Zigzag (蜈ご蚣こうノ舞まい　百ひゃく足そく蛇じゃ腹ばら, Gokō no mai: Hyakusoku Jabara?) - The user uses their full speed to run a zigzag pattern that confuses their opponent in order to create an opening for them to directly stab their opponent's neck and inject poison to kill them, with the stab's force and power being further enhanced by the momentum of their speed. Doma noted that the sheer speed and footwork of this technique is strong enough to destroy an entire wooden bridge.\n\nExclusive Breathing Style Techniques\nButterfly Dance: Caprice, Illusory Light (蝶ちょうノ舞まい　戯たわむれ・幻げん光こう, Chō no mai: Tawamure - Genkō?) - Shinobu starts with a backflip before lunging at her opponent. Upon connection, Shinobu unleashes a barrage of straight short thrusts with her sword, ending with one powerful thrust that launches her opponent away and onto their back. She then leaps into the air while transforming into a gigantic butterfly of light, before diving from it and stabbing her blade straight through her opponent's chest and into the ground, cracking the surrounding terrain and creating a massive crater in its wake.\nButterfly Dance: Caprice, Fluorescence (蝶ちょうノ舞まい　\"戯たわむれ\"・燐りん光こう, Chō no mai: Tawamure - Rinkō?) - Shinobu starts with a backflip kick, that sends her opponent upward. Upon connection, she blades hidden in her sandals to slash them mid-air, before kicking them downwards. She then performs Butterfly Dance while homing in on the opponent from above, although instead of a single strike, it's a constant barrage of poisonous thrusts from all directions, so fast it forms into a ball of energy and erupts into a double-helix shape consisting of butterflies.\nSixfold Thrust (六ろく連れん突つき, Rokuren Tsuki?) - The user unleashes five short but very quick thrusts towards their opponent, before briefly pausing and then unleashing a sixth, more powerful thrust.\nSwift Thrust (速はや足あし突つき, Haya'ashi Tsuki?) - The user spins before kicking off the ground and quickly dashing towards their opponent with enough speed to simulate teleportation, then does a powerful, singular thrust that hits twice.\nRising Thrust (昇のぼり突つき, Nobori Tsuki?) - The user launches a thrust towards their opponent and then releases an upwards thrust that launches their opponent high up into the air.\nThe Brilliant and the Brave (柱はしらと庚かのえ, Hashira to Kanoe?, lit. \"Hashira and Kanoe\") - A collaboration between an Insect Breathing user and a Water Breathing user, although unlike Dancing Waters' Allure, it is not required for the Water Breather to have a particularly high skill set. The Insect Breather takes the lead by kicking their opponent back several times before unleashing two thrusting attacks similar to Dance of the Butterfly. After the opponent falls to the ground, the Water Breather joins in and attacks them several times, albeit much more unrefined. The Water Breather then rushes forwards and uses a move similar to Water Surface Slash. However, there’s a minor chance that the Water Breather’s uniform is damaged in the chaos.\nDancing Waters' Allure (水すい艶えん乱らん舞ぶ, Suien Ranbu?) - A collaboration between a Water Breathing user and Insect Breathing user. After the two deliver a crosscut, the Water Breather attacks the opponent several times in a winding fashion similar to Striking Tide. The Insect Breather then joins in and delivers a spinning thrust similar to Dance of the Butterfly. The Water and Insect Breather then bombard their opponent with several attacks from their respective Breathing Styles; the former attacking from several directions, the latter somersaulting around their opponent and stabbing them several times. After the Water Breather slashes them, the Insect Breather stabs and kicks them in the air. As the opponent falls down, the Insect Breather charges towards them while the Water Breather executes a move similar to Dead Calm. When contact is made, the opponent is struck by a constant and multidirectional barrage of Water Breathing and Insect Breathing attacks ending in a spectacular combination.\nChemistry Class Concoction (科学実験かがくじっけん, Kagaku Jikken?) - A technique exclusive to the Kimetsu Academy version of Shinobu Kocho. As President of the Pharmacology Club, she uses her knowledge in chemistry to give her opponent a Erlenmeyer flask containing a strange pink chemical. She then pours in another chemical from a test tube which reacts violently and results in an explosion, causing Shinobu to sarcastically lament “another failure”.\n"

It was the same as any katana from the handle to slightly above the hilt, but above that, the weapon loses its blade and was replaced by a rod. It ended in a needle-like tip, which resembled a traditional katana's in appearance and function. The blade was designed for injection of wisteria poison into demons, as Shinobu uses her medical expertise to replace her relative lack of strength and inability to decapitate demons. Her katana's tsuba was designed to bear resemblance to a butterfly, being four-petaled flower shaped that was in an aqua color with butterflies motifs, and trimmed with an orange border. The handle was orange and wrapped in crystal teal cords, and capped with an orange kashira. The blade was black in color, with the bottom hilt and the needle-like tip of the blade have a lavender-blue outline. The words Evil Demon (惡あっ鬼き, Akki?) was engraved on the right face, while the words Destruction (滅めっ殺さつ, Messatsu?) are engraved on the left face due her sword's structure. Along with her katana, she has also modified the weapon's sheath, using it as a portable poison mixer and loader.[45] The sheath was in white with a butterfly motifs."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

The majority of the country's territory is covered in deserts. There are also many rivers flowing throughout the country which have since been developed into canals. Its exact location in the world is unknown as of yet. The Scalding Sands has an arid tropical climate. In the undeveloped desert regions, temperatures in the day and night vary widely, with night temperatures going as low as 0°C. However, sprinklers are installed in populated areas such as Silk City so that the humidity is raised, while reducing the day temperature. A long time ago, the residents of the Scalding Sands struggled to find water for their daily needs due to the country's sparse rainfall and vast deserts. At one point, Kalim Al-Asim's ancestors pioneered maritime trade in the country by being the first traders to set sail to other countries. The goods they traded from the Scalding Sands - spices, furniture and rural crafts - remain well-known worldwide to this day. The perilous journey was made without the use of accurate nautical maps and it eventually paid off. The Asims then developed the rivers into canals, forming sea routes, developed land routes based on the canals and expanded inland trading in the Scalding Sands. There was once a law where royalty could only marry other royalty. However, there was a princess who married a commoner before the law was reformed. Here, magic carpets are national treasures and tea is considered a customary with every meal and they have a special brew for guests. Magic carpets are Scalding Sands' national treasures. The land is reminiscent of the richer parts of the Middle East."

Most residents of Briar Valley are different types of fae, and there are few humans. Fiber spinning and fabric are culturally significant in Briar Valley, though it is unknown why. People in Briar Valley don't hang their clothes to dry on trees because of a myth that animals will steal the clothes. Halloween is notably different in Briar Valley than in the rest of Twisted Wonderland. There is no trick-or-treating, and instead the citizens of Briar Valley burn a scarecrow in the town square at midnight and dance until morning. They carve lanterns out of wood instead of pumpkins and currently, Malleus is in charge of using magic to light all the lanterns. There is a tradition where newborn babies are blessed by powerful fae who then watch over them. Birthday celebrations are very formal, dignified affairs.

          "content": "Happy Valley was a historical region in Twisted Wonderland. A legend from the region originated the tradition of Happy Beans Day. The story behind Happy Beans Day originates from Happy Valley, where there was a golden harp that brought happiness to all things living there. Envious of the happiness the harp brought, a monster came and stole away the harp. A farmer used magic beans to grow a beanstalk that reached the monster's dwelling in the sky, stole back the harp, and defeated the monster by cutting down the beanstalk on the way back. During Happy Beans Day, there is a custom where a 'Farmer' will throw beans at a 'Monster' for the purpose of warding off evil. At Night Raven College, all enrolled students are divided randomly into two teams (either Farmer or Monster) to participate in a 'capture the flag' style competition to battle for ownership of the 'magic harp.' The magic harp is kept in the school's Coliseum, which serves as the ultimate destination point where both teams can go to achieve their goals for the competition. The goal of the Farmer team is to steal the magic harp from the Coliseum within the time limit—if the limit is exceeded, the Farmer team loses. The goal of the Monster team is to prevent the magic harp from being stolen by the Farmer team—if the harp is stolen, the Monster team loses. Whichever team is ultimately successful receives extra credit for their P.E. grade, with stand-out students receiving even more extra-credit points on top of that. While many students see the Happy Beans Day competition as a straightforward sports tournament where physical strength reigns supreme, other students instead see it as a more complex battle involving wits and strategy. It is also an event that can involve a fair amount of preparation before the festivities even start—with some making plans for Beans Day up to an entire year in advance.\nRules: If a Monster captures a Farmer, the Farmer is out. If a Monster is hit with a bean thrown by a Farmer, the Monster is out. Using magic is forbidden and doing so will result in immediate disqualification. Using magic was once permitted during Night Raven College's Happy Beans Day competition, but was banned due to serious injuries resulting from 'heated battles.' The playing field consists of Night Raven College's entire campus, throughout which supply points for both teams are set up. Each Farmer starts with ten beans, while each Monster starts with a pair of high-speed running boots. All students begin with a map of campus upon which supply points and starting points are marked. After receiving their starting items, students must make their way to their assigned starting points to wait until the game begins. Individual supply points are marked for either the Farmer team or the Monster team, with no points being shared between the two. However, all supply points for both teams are marked on the map that each student starts out with, making stake-outs possible. Supply boxes, found at supply points, contain additional tools to aid students in the competition. Some tools, such as magic camouflage jackets, are available to both teams—while others, such as bean shooters and capture arms, are team-specific equipment. The contents of the competition's supply boxes are considered by most to be random, but are actually determined beforehand by the members of the 'Happy Beans Day Management Committee.'"
