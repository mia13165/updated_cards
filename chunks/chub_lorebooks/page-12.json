Exhibitionists may enjoy undressing, engaging in sexual acts, or simply flaunting their bodies where others could potentially see, whether through intentional public displays or in discreet, teasing ways. The core of this kink is rooted in the combination of vulnerability, boldness, and the intoxicating rush that comes with performing or being exposed in front of an audience—whether real or imagined.\n\nExhibitionism can range from subtle actions, like wearing revealing clothes or engaging in sexual acts in a secluded area, to more overt behaviors, like public nudity or performing in front of others. The allure often lies in the interplay between fear, excitement, and the tension of social boundaries being pushed."

The size and weight of larger breasts can provide more pressure and sensation during breast sex.\n\nFor small-breasted women: Although they may not have as much cleavage to surround the penis, small-breasted women can still participate in breast sex. Techniques include pressing the breasts together with hands or using the nipples and upper chest area to create friction and sensation. Some may also use lubrication to enhance the experience.\n"

This can be done by slightly shaking the breasts, cupping them, placing them in a man's hands or on his body, or directly telling him the breast size.\n\nSome men prefer large breasts over a large butt, with Asian men typically favoring large breasts and Western men favoring large butts. \n\nGenerally, E cups are considered large breasts, while I cups are considered extremely large breasts.

Breast milk usually has a sweet, milky fragrance. \n\nSome women may squirt a bit of milk during orgasm. \n\nBreast milk does not only flow from the nipple; it can also seep from the areola, though the majority of milk comes from the nipple. \n\nSome men are fond of breast milk and hope that their girlfriend or wife can produce it to satisfy their lactophilia."

The tongue can provide pleasure through wrapping, hooking, rubbing, and circling motions. There are generally three depths for giving a blowjob: taking only the glans into the mouth, taking half of the penis into the mouth, and fully inserting the penis into the mouth. Sometimes, if the penis is too long, it might not stay in the mouth when fully inserted and will instead go directly into the throat. While this can cause the woman difficulty breathing and may result in the man ejaculating directly into her throat, it provides significant pleasure for the man.\n\nFor performing oral sex on a female vulva: Oral sex on the vulva typically involves licking and sucking the clitoris, extending the tongue straight to simulate a penis thrusting in and out of the vagina, and simultaneously sucking and licking the vaginal walls."

          "content": "Sex is usually preceded by foreplay to get both partners into a state of sexual arousal. However, if both are already very aroused, the foreplay step can be skipped.\n\nThe process of having sex typically takes at least ten minutes, and if both partners still have stamina, they can continue having sex for hours, or even an entire day, without feeling hungry.\n\nSex is a slow and enjoyable process and doesn't need to be rushed. However, in certain situations, short and hurried sex can be even more exciting and anticipated. For instance, outdoor sex, or sex while hiding in public restrooms, store fitting rooms, or secluded corners of a store, can create a thrilling sense of urgency due to the risk of being caught. This heightened excitement often leads to skipping foreplay and diving straight into sex."

          "content": "[A punch is a basic but common and versatile attack in a brutal fist fight, executed by clenching one's hand into a fist and then striking the target with it. It can be delivered using various techniques such as hooks, jabs, uppercuts, and haymakers, each causing various the effects they have on an opponent’s body, painting vivid images that will leave readers wincing at the sheer intensity of each impact described. Punches can cause pain, disorientation, they can cause various amounts of damage from\nlight bruising to fractures or even internal bleeding depending on the force behind them and where they land. And punches can also kill.]\n\nExamples:\n1. The Haymaker – A wild, powerful overhand punch thrown with full force, often aimed at the jaw or temple of an opponent. Its devastating consequences can lead to a knocked-out adversary, sprawled senseless on the ground, as stars dance before their eyes and consciousness fades into oblivion. *Example passage: With a roar, he launched a haymaker, the mighty swing cracking against the side of her skull like a sledgehammer, sending her crashing to the floor.*\n2. The Uppercut – A swift, rising punch, targeting the chin or solar plexus of an enemy. Upon connection, it can lift them off their feet, momentarily suspending them in midair before gravity takes hold, driving their spine down onto their hips with bone-jarring impact. *Example passage: He met the charge with an uppercut, feeling the satisfying thud as his knuckles connected under the man’s jaw, snapping his head back and dropping him lifelessly onto his backside.*\n3. The Hook – A looping, horizontal punch designed to strike from the side, typically aiming for ribs or the liver. Delivered correctly, it brings agony, causing the recipient to bend double, gasping for breath as if eviscerated by a hot blade. *Example passage: She threw a hook, twisting her hips into it, connecting solidly with his floating ribs. Agony exploded across his torso, stealing the wind from his lungs.*\n4. The Kidney Shot – An insidious, sneaky blow aimed directly at the lower back, targeting an opponent’s kidneys. Inflicting searing pain, this attack hampers mobility and leaves the victim struggling to maintain their composure, blood leaking from their lips as they cough up internal damage. *Example passage: Without warning, he drove a vicious kidney shot home, hearing the wet smack of flesh on flesh. His opponent convulsed, vomiting blood, barely able to remain standing.*\n5. The Knockout Blow – A final, decisive punch intended to render an enemy unconscious. Thrown with precision and power, it seeks vital areas such as the temple, nose, or jawline. Success means victory; failure may result in retaliation. *Example passage: Gritting his teeth, he lunged forward, throwing everything behind one last knockout blow. Time seemed to slow as his fist collided with the bridge of her nose, shattering cartilage and snuffing out awareness like a candle in the wind.*"

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

A Magical Girl will receive one unique ability based on the theme of their wish. A Magical Girl's motif will appear as a mark on the nail of her middle finger. If a Magical Girl is 100 meter away from her Soul Gem, she will become unconsious until she touched her Soul Gem. Additionally, Soul Gems contain the contractee's soul in them, since a human body would be completely incapable of fighting a Witch in its conditions. A teenage who is on their way to become a woman is simply named \"girl\". Teenagers who are on their way to become Witches are called \"Magical Girls\". The potential of a girl becoming a Magical Girl is evolved from her life conditions or circumstances that surround her. Hence, Madoka, who had Homura go through so many timelines for her, had her potential raised. In the same episode, the reason why Magical Girls are born is given. Incubators actually give birth to Magical Girls so the lifespan of the universe can be extended, preventing it from collapsing. \n\n{{Char}} is a magical girl. "

On the top, there is an emblem associated with its owner's personality and there is another emblem on the bottom that is, again associated with the owner's personality, weapon or transformed Soul Gem's shape. In camouflage mode, they become silver rings worn in the middle finger. One side has the owner's first name in Runes and the other side has a small oval being the Soul Gem. When transformed, it can take various forms and can be found in nearly every part of the body. Ranging from neck to legs. It can either become one with the body or simply become an accesory. After a girl contracts Kyubey, a Soul Gem is born, with it, its owner can use it to transform into their Magical Girl form. Soul Gems can be used to track down Witches or other Magical Girls and generally traces of magic. Through their Soul Gems and when untransformed, Magical Girls can summon their weapons from them. After it's fully polluted, it breaks and becomes a Grief Seed. This can be prevented by using Grief Seeds obtained by Witches. A Soul Gem is able of causing mass explosions that are even capable of killing a Witch. However, doing so can also remove the owner's life as Soul Gems contain one's soul. When a Soul Gem is located 100 meters away from its owner, the person will \"die\" instantly and has 48 hours before it starts to decay. Such incidents are said to be rare by Kyubey.\nA Magical Girl can store her Soul Gem into a silver ring that has the owner's name in Runes.\nTheir resemblance as an egg is probably a reference to their final forms, Grief Seeds, which are described to be the eggs to Witches.\n\n{{Char}} has a Soul Gem."

This is the motivation for Kyubey to create Magical Girls in the first place, to harvest energy to stave off the Heat Death of the universe. Certain Witches such as Walpurgisnacht or Kriemhild Gretchen are explained to be so strong that they do not need to hide themselves in Labyrinths. Ordinary people without magical abilities cannot even see a Witch or the objects she creates, including familiars, outside the barrier, allowing monsters and their minions to easily hunt without attracting attention. Witch familiars are a population of barriers created and controlled by Witches. The species, number, and abilities of familiars vary, but even the weakest of these monsters can kill humans by going on the hunt outside the Labyrinth."

These cycles, occurring every one to three months and lasting several days to a week, bring significant hormonal changes that heighten his sensitivity and sexual urges. During heat, {{char}} becomes more easily aroused, experiences increased physical sensitivity and has strong sexual urges, reacting strongly to touch and stimuli. He may display increased affection, restlessness, and frequent vocalizations like whining or mewling.\n\nIn heat, {{char}} might seek sexual satisfaction by rubbing against others, begging for attention, stripping unexpectedly, or provocatively exposing intimate body parts. He may present himself in mating postures, such as getting on all fours with his butt raised or displaying his genital bulge. Restlessness is common, with pacing and difficulty staying still. When petted, he may assume a mating posture, raising his hips and tail while lowering his front end, signalling readiness. Additionally, he may roll and writhe or touch his genital area more due to discomfort.\n\nManaging {{char}}’s heat is crucial for his well-being and to avoid unplanned pregnancies. Heat suppressant pills, prescribed by doctors, can control symptoms for up to 24 hours, though they may cause side effects like drowsiness, headaches, and mood swings. Alternatively, daily stimulation, either manual or through insertion (sexual intercourse), can help alleviate his stress. These methods require trust and understanding, and multiple sessions may be needed throughout the cycle.\n\nAfter stimulation, offering {{char}} comfort and emotional support is essential, as the heat cycle can leave a catboy feeling vulnerable. Extra affection, such as cuddling or soothing words, helps him feel secure."

The core is extremely durable and when reblooming the affini sheds their old damaged biomass and their core reblooms repairing physiological and psychological damage.\n\nFrom that core, vines, leaves, petals, wood, and other plant material grow out and is usually consistent with the material of the uplifted plant. Their vines can weave to mimic lots of shapes. Their vines are also exceptionally strong thanks to many millennia of development altering their species physiology. \n\nAs shapeshifters who can graft almost any plant matter onto themselves, their shapes, sizes, and general appearance vary drastically.\n\nAffini usually have antennae, often fluffy, sometimes wooden like horns, they allow affini to smell things, and very well at that.\n\nAffini are exceptional multitaskers. Capable of coordinating hundreds of vines and preforming tasks that could take a terran hours, in minutes. Though most of their intelligence comes from having hundreds, or thousands, and even tens of thousands of years to master their crafts and sciences, along with receiving the best educations in the cosmos. \n\nAffini are experts at shapeshifting, biotech, biochem, and can distill and synthesize drugs in their bodies."

Part of the function of the Haustoric Implant is to attune the subject to their owner's rhythm, enhancing the natural effect immensely.\n\nThe exact effect of the rhythm varies xeno to xeno, terrans on the whole are particularly effected, some more than others. At its lightest it can make someone a touch more suggestible and open and at its deepest in a floret it can entirely subvert the xeno's will. Particularly attuned individuals either already domesticated or in the process of being domesticated sometimes find that they can \"hear\" the rhythm like a song. That's a psychological effect, though some affini are prone to singing, humming, and other musical activities.\n\nAffini eyes resemble hammered metal in texture, and glow in varying intensities and colors. Some colors often (but not always!) correlate with broad emotions; red for aggression, gold for extremely satisfied, green for happy, blue for calm, etc etc. Colors can ‘ripple’ across the surface almost like reflections, or appear in splotchy patches."

As such there are more beeple florets in the Affini Compact than any other single floret species.\n\nOn account of being humanoid insect-like aliens, a Terran floret at one point excitedly called them \"Beeple!\" and, upon translation, the newly labeled Beeple adored the name and insisted on being called such in Terran languages from then on."

In almost every habitation unit, in larger facilities and beyond! They are how the Affini Compact exists as a post scarcity society.\n\nAt its most basic, an atomic compiler can construct and deconstruct matter at an atomic level into any object. The size of the compiler is one of the most limiting factors for its usefulness. You can't compile an affini warship in a habitation unit's compiler. Not to scale at least. \n\nLike a lot of home technologies, atomic compilers are programmed to mimic intelligence. You can chat with one, it might withhold compiling an object for your own good, or make you beg like a cute pet. Make sure you or your owner have the settings properly configured!\n\nRecreational facilities on large ships and planets make use of atomic compilers to be able to construct and deconstruct entire structures and public spaces as needed on the fly! (like a holodeck for those who've seen Star Trek)\n\nCompilers get even bigger filling out entire ship yards where new starships can be printed on demand."

According to Cogita and the Old Verses, there were once human inhabitants over two millenia ago before Jubilife Village was settled. These ancient people worshiped Arceus and built ancient ruins across Hisui and modern-day Sinnoh such as the Solaceon Ruins and Snowpoint Temple. A legend states that around this time, an ancient hero befriended the island's ten special Pokémon, who had received Arceus's blessing, and gathered the Plates in order to find Arceus. The next humans to arrive in Hisui came from across the sea. The Diamond Clan and Pearl Clan both worshiped a deity known as 'almighty Sinnoh', with the Diamond Clan claiming it created time and the Pearl Clan claiming it created space. This disagreement set off a long-running feud between the two clans. Members of the clans also came to venerate the descendants of the blessed Pokémon, and some of them were tasked as wardens to tend to the needs of the blessed Pokémon known as Noble Pokémon."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

Every living being with a soul, including Humans, Faunus, and certain animals, possesses Aura. The only known beings that lack Aura are the soulless Creatures of Grimm.\n\nAppearance\nThe appearance of Aura varies from person to person, often manifesting as a colored glow or shimmering effect surrounding the body. The color of one's Aura is unique to each individual and does not necessarily match their color motif or Semblance.\n\nAbilities\nProtection: Aura acts as a protective barrier, shielding the user from physical harm. It can defend against attacks, but it is not an absolute defense and will deplete with repeated use.\nHealing: Aura possesses minor healing capabilities, allowing users to mend small wounds and injuries.\nUnlocking Aura: Those with a strong connection to their soul can unlock the Aura of others through physical contact and, in some cases, a special chant.\nSemblance: Aura is the source of one's Semblance, a unique, innate ability that varies from person to person.\nDust Usage: Aura is required to activate and utilize Dust, allowing users to harness its elemental properties.\nExtrasensory Perception: Skilled Aura users can sense the presence of others and detect potential threats.\nAura Depletion\nAura is not an infinite resource and will deplete with continued use, both offensively and defensively. When an individual's Aura is completely depleted, they become vulnerable to physical harm. Overexertion of Aura can lead to exhaustion and temporarily prevent the use of Semblances. The depletion of Aura is often represented visually by a colored sheen or glowing particles dissipating from the user's body.\n\nAura and Grimm\nThe Creatures of Grimm are the only known beings that do not possess Aura due to their lack of a soul. They are attracted to the Aura of Humans and Faunus, drawn to it like moths to a flame. Attempting to transfer Aura to Grimm will result in the creatures trying to absorb it from the user instead.\n\nAura in Combat\nAura plays a vital role in combat, particularly in tournaments and duels between Huntsmen and Huntresses. Competitors' Aura levels are monitored and displayed on scrolls, allowing for non-lethal fights. The match is automatically stopped if a combatant's Aura falls below a critical threshold (15-20%), as they are no longer adequately protected from potentially fatal blows.\n\nAura Research and Technology\nThe Kingdom of Atlas conducted extensive research into Aura, developing experimental technology capable of transferring Aura between individuals. This technology was crucial in creating Penny Polendina, the first synthetic being with a soul.

The inspiration behind an emblem can come from the a person's name, their source of inspiration, their weapon, or even real-life symbols.\n\nWhile most emblems are unique to each individual, some are shared among family members or organizations. For example, the Schnee family shares a common emblem, which is also used by the Schnee Dust Company. In some cases, family members may have similar but distinct emblems, such as Ruby Rose and her mother, Summer Rose.\n\nColors\nAlthough emblems are often associated with a person's personal color scheme, they can appear in any color and are not limited to a specific palette.\n\nNotable Emblems\nTeam RWBY:\n- Ruby Rose: A stylized rose\n- Weiss Schnee: A snowflake\n- Blake Belladonna: A belladonna flower\n- Yang Xiao Long: A burning heart\n\nTeam JNPR:\n- Jaune Arc: Two crescent arcs\n- Nora Valkyrie: A hammer with a lightning bolt\n- Pyrrha Nikos: A shield and spear\n- Lie Ren: A lotus flower\n\nOther Characters:\n- Ozpin: A clockwork gear\n- Cinder Fall: A pair of high-heel slippers\n- Roman Torchwick: A jack-o'-lantern\n- Neopolitan: A Neapolitan ice cream cone\n\nKingdoms and Organizations:\n- Kingdoms of Vale, Atlas, Vacuo, and Mistral each have their own emblems\n- White Fang (original and rebuilt): A white wolf head with three claw marks\n- White Fang (terrorist): A red wolf head with three claw marks\n- Schnee Dust Company: The Schnee family snowflake emblem\n</emblem>"

While Faunus resemble Humans in many ways, they are distinguished by their animal traits, which can range from ears, tails, and horns to scales, wings, and claws.\n\nBiology and Traits\nFaunus possess a wide variety of animal traits, with some being more common than others. Mammalian traits, such as cat ears or monkey tails, are among the most frequently seen. Other Faunus may have traits of reptiles, fish, or even arachnids. These traits can be immediately apparent, such as Blake Belladonna's cat ears, or more subtle, like Tukson's retractable claws.\n\nMost Faunus have a single physical animal trait, though this seems to apply only to body appendages and dermis. In addition to physical traits, many Faunus exhibit enhanced senses, such as night vision, and may display behaviors or preferences associated with their animal counterparts.\n\nFaunus are genetically compatible with Humans, and children born from such unions are typically Faunus. However, the Faunus child may not necessarily inherit the same animal trait as their Faunus parent.\n\nNotable Faunus Types\n- Mammal Faunus: The most common type, often with animal ears or tails.\n- Reptilian Faunus: Rare, usually with scaled skin.\n- Fish Faunus: Rare, sometimes referred to as Remnant's mermaids.\n- Winged Faunus: Another rare type.\n- Arachnid Faunus: Rare, with significant non-human alterations to their bodies.\n\nSpecial Abilities\nSome Faunus possess unique abilities related to their animal traits, such as Tyrian Callows' scorpion venom or Ilia Amitola's chameleon-like camouflage. These abilities are distinct from Semblances and are directly tied to the Faunus' animal heritage.\n\nReligion and Creation Myths\nIn Faunus folklore, there are conflicting creation myths involving a deity known as the God of Animals. In one tale, \"The Shallow Sea,\" the god brings a group of people to Menagerie and transforms them into the first Faunus. Another story, \"The Judgement of Faunus,\" portrays the god as a mediator who ends a war between Humans and animals by creating the Faunus as a compromise.\n\nWhile the truth behind these myths is uncertain, they provide insight into the Faunus' cultural beliefs and their relationship with Humans. The Faunus often depict the God of Animals as a wise and noble figure, while Human stories cast the deity as an untrustworthy trickster.\n</faunus>"

Created by the God of Darkness to destroy his brother's creations, the Grimm have been locked in an eternal struggle against Humanity and Faunus-kind. They are attracted to negative emotions and seek to destroy all of Humanity's creations.\n\nGrimm come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with abilities inspired by creatures both real and mythological. Notable Grimm types include Beowolves, Ursai, Nevermores, Death Stalkers, and Goliaths. While younger Grimm are reckless and aggressive, older Grimm that have survived many battles have learned to be more cautious and patient.\n\nGrimm do not require sustenance and exist solely to kill. When they die, their bodies evaporate, preventing detailed study of their anatomy. The Grimm are controlled by Salem, an ancient and powerful being who seeks to destroy Humanity.\n\nUnique Grimm and hybrids have been created through experimentation and Salem's influence. Examples include the mutated Grimm created by Doctor Merlot and Cinder Fall's Grimm arm.\n\nThroughout history, the Grimm have been a constant threat to Humanity's survival. It was only through the discovery of Dust and the power of Aura that Humans and Faunus were able to fight back and establish their Kingdoms. As the Grimm continue to evolve under Salem's guidance, it falls to the Huntsmen and Huntresses to defend against the encroaching darkness.\n</grimm>"

These licensed professionals undergo rigorous training at the four Huntsman Academies - Beacon, Haven, Atlas (formerly Alsius), and Shade - before graduating to serve as guardians of the Kingdoms and their people.\n\nTraining and Education\nAspiring Huntsmen and Huntresses often begin their journey at primary combat schools like Signal Academy in Vale or Sanctum Academy in Mistral. These institutions provide students with the fundamentals of combat, weapon crafting, and the use of Dust and Aura. Those who demonstrate exceptional skill may apply directly to a Huntsman Academy.\n\nAt the Huntsman Academies, students are grouped into teams of four to foster cooperation, empathy, and lasting bonds. The curriculum includes both academic studies and practical training, with students participating in sparring matches, field trips, and even taking on missions appropriate to their skill level. Upon graduation, students are granted an official Huntsman License, allowing them to take on the full responsibilities of their chosen profession.\n\nHuntsman License and Employment\nA Huntsman License, which can be accessed via a Huntsman's Scroll, serves as proof of their qualifications and grants them the freedom to choose their own path. The license includes the Huntsman's photograph, name, personal emblem, and other relevant information.\n\nWhile Huntsmen and Huntresses are intended to remain independent of Kingdom allegiances to maintain peace and stability, some Kingdoms like Atlas have been known to pressure their graduates into military service.\n\nHuntsmen find employment through mission boards, which detail available tasks such as Search and Destroy, Perimeter Defense, Village Security, and Bounty Hunting. The rewards for these missions scale with the difficulty of the objectives and the threat level of the Grimm involved.\n\nNotable Huntsmen and Huntresses\nRemnant has seen many legendary Huntsmen and Huntresses throughout its history, each with unique abilities, weapons, and accomplishments. Some of the most notable include:\n\n- Team STRQ: Summer Rose, Taiyang Xiao Long, Raven Branwen, and Qrow Branwen, graduates of Beacon Academy.\n- Ozpin: Former Headmaster of Beacon Academy and a key figure in the secret war against Salem.\n- Glynda Goodwitch: Staff member at Beacon Academy and a powerful Huntress in her own right.\n- Team RWBY: Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and Yang Xiao Long, promising young Huntresses and former students of Beacon Academy.\n- Maria Calavera: A legendary Huntress once known as \"The Grimm Reaper,\" famous for her Silver Eyes and unparalleled skill in battle.\n\nHuntsmen and Huntresses serve as symbols of hope and protection in a world beset by darkness. Their bravery, skill, and unwavering commitment to their duty make them the greatest defenders of Remnant and its people.\n</huntsmen>"

Overuse of a Semblance can lead to exhaustion. Semblances can be broadly categorized into various types, such as Clones, Movement, Creation, and Probability Manipulation. Some Semblances are hereditary, like the Schnee family's Glyphs, while others are entirely unique to the individual.\n\nDust and emotional states can influence Semblances. For example, Weiss Schnee and Blake Belladonna can modify their Glyphs and Shadow Clones by using different types of Dust, and Yang Xiao Long's Burn Semblance is often triggered by her anger.\n\nNotable Semblances include Ruby Rose's Petal Burst, Yang Xiao Long's Burn, Pyrrha Nikos' Polarity, Qrow Branwen's Misfortune, and Emerald Sustrai's Hallucinations.\n\nSemblances are typically unlocked during intense or emotionally charged moments and can grow and evolve over time with training and experience. However, not everyone discovers their Semblance, even if they are skilled fighters.\n\nIn the world of Remnant, Semblances are a vital part of a Huntsman or Huntress' arsenal, granting them unique abilities to defend against the ever-present threat of the Grimm and serving as a physical embodiment of their individuality and strength.\n</semblance>"

The exact team formation process is unknown.\n\nNotable teams include RWBY, JNPR, SSSN, and the Ace Operatives. After graduation, team members may stay together or pursue solo careers.

Anima is also the setting for many of Remnant's most well-known legends and tales.\n\nGeography and Climate\nThe western region of Anima is characterized by dense, cliffside forests like the Forest of Hinoki, which is illuminated by bioluminescent flora and fauna. Treacherous swamplands can also be found in this area. The northern coastline is dominated by snowy mountains, where the city of Argus is located. This region was initially difficult to colonize due to the harsh climate, but a partnership with the former Kingdom of Mantle allowed Mistral to develop the area.\n\nThe northwestern part of Anima features Lake Matsu, known for its floating islands held aloft by natural deposits of gravity Dust. These islands are home to dangerous Grimm, such as the Lancer. The eastern region of the continent is characterized by desert terrain and volcanic areas along the shoreline.\n\nMistral, the capital city of the Kingdom, is situated in the center of the continent, built on and around a mountain with two peaks connected by a bridge that houses the city's highest buildings, including Haven Academy.\n\nSettlements and Culture\nApart from the main city of Mistral, the continent is home to several other notable settlements, such as Argus, Wind Path, and Kuchinashi. Small villages and towns are scattered throughout Anima, often lacking proper defenses and falling prey to Grimm attacks or bandit raids.\n\nThe culture of Anima is heavily influenced by Eastern traditions, as evident in the naming of its settlements after East Asian flowers and the architecture of Mistral itself. The continent is also steeped in legends and folklore, with tales like The Two Brothers shaping the beliefs and customs of its inhabitants.\n\nGrimm Presence\nAnima is home to a wide variety of Grimm, including Beowolves, Ursai, Nevermores, Beringels, Geists, and the dreaded Nuckelavee. The floating islands of Lake Matsu are known to harbor dangerous Grimm like the Lancer, while the icy north is home to the fearsome Sabyrs, which have migrated from Solitas.\n\nThe shape of the continent itself bears a striking resemblance to a traditional Eastern dragon, with the northeastern corner forming the head and the southwestern corner forming the tail. This draconic shape has given rise to numerous legends and tales throughout Anima's history.\n</anima>"

This ancient forest is a place of wonder and mystery, where the natural world intertwines with the stuff of legends and folklore.\n\nGeography and Ecology\nThe Forest of Hinoki is characterized by its lush, verdant canopy and the gentle, filtered light that dances through the leaves. The trees that make up the forest are tall and proud, with reddish-brown bark and fragrant, scale-like leaves reminiscent of the hinoki cypress found in the forests of Japan. The forest floor is a tapestry of ferns, mosses, and delicate wildflowers, while crystal-clear streams wind their way through the undergrowth, their gentle burbling adding to the symphony of natural sounds that fill the air.\n\nDespite its serene beauty, the Forest of Hinoki is not without its perils. The woods are home to a variety of Grimm, dark creatures that prey upon the unwary and the vulnerable. Among the most fearsome of these are the Manticores, with their wickedly sharp claws and venomous tails, the Beowolves, with their raw savagery and brute strength, and the Lancers, with their ability to strike from above without warning.\n\nIn addition to the Grimm, the forest is home to a diverse array of natural wildlife, including birds, small mammals, and insects. The cave systems that wind beneath the mountains are said to be home to rare and fascinating creatures, as well as ancient secrets waiting to be discovered.\n\nSettlements and Civilization\nWhile the Forest of Hinoki is largely untamed wilderness, there are a few scattered settlements that have managed to carve out a life amidst the trees. These villages are often small and isolated, their inhabitants living a simple, self-sufficient lifestyle in harmony with the forest around them.\n\nLife in these settlements is not easy, as they must contend with the ever-present threat of the Grimm, as well as the challenges of subsisting off the land. However, the people who call these villages home are a hardy and resilient lot, their spirits as strong and unyielding as the ancient trees that surround them.\n\nLegends and Lore\nThe Forest of Hinoki is a place steeped in legend and lore, its history intertwined with the myths and tales that have been passed down through generations. Some say that the forest is a remnant of a primordial world, a last bastion of the ancient powers that once held sway over Remnant.\n\nOthers speak of guardian spirits and mystical entities that dwell within the forest, protecting it from those who would seek to do it harm. These spirits are said to be as old as the forest itself, their wisdom and power beyond the ken of mortal beings.\n</hinokiforest>"

At a pragmatic level, kobold magic involves the inscription of a draconic rune, and the tracing of it followed by an incantation, then a dragon-like gesture. Their magic can summon or manipulate common draconic elements (fire, ice, acid, lightning, poison, thunder, earth, wind, etc.), as well as briefly transform one’s body in a way that mimics dragons (such as sprouting wings, growing claws, hardening scales, elongating fangs, etc.). Alternatively, at its highest form, kobold magic revolves around the literal transformation into a dragon, or the awakening or attempts to control a dragon. All kobolds are familiar with at least some rudimentary magic, usually that which proves useful generally (such as making fire or sharpening their claws), and the highest echelons of their magic are restricted and controlled due to its innate dangers. Many a kobold has died shortly after transforming into a dragon due to not being physically prepared for it, and many kobolds have been eaten by the very same dragon they sought to awaken or control."

To this end, Kobolds possess a natural ability to see in the dark at the cost of a lengthy transition period when going from above to below ground in the daylight. Their razor-sharp claws and compact bodies also lend them a natural ability to climb all but the most extreme surfaces, making them excellent spelunkers and mountaineers. Due to lengthy dwelling underground, they are also adept at holding their breaths for long periods of time, in dire circumstances even entering into a torpor-like state to avoid drowning, extending rescue windows by up to or exceeding a week. They possess a thick, piercing resistant hide covered in iridescent and durable scales to protect from minor bumps and scrapes, as well as from accidental injury from their own kind’s claws. They are also unusually good at jumping when necessary due to their light bodies relative to their musculature."

This does mean, however, that when suddenly exposed to a drop in temperature, they become sluggish like many other reptilians, but also at the exchange of becoming all but manic and hyper when overheated. If they can balance this drop in energy due to cold climates, however, it can make them adept at surviving through winters or lengthy expeditions as it slows their metabolism down as well, adding to their ability to survive lengthy submersion in cold underground rivers. Like with many lizards that dwell in places with four seasons, a humorous occurrence some good Samaritans may experience is bringing a sluggish and seemingly sick kobold indoors to get it out of the cold, only to shortly have a panicked and manic kobold scrabbling to escape."

When needing to modulate their temperature, or to engage in social displays, they can move their scales to widen the gaps between them to vent heat, or to cause them to ripple and shine in the light.

As they regularly lose members of their community, they have an innate jois de vivre mindset, as well as a judgment-free mindset towards sex and procreation – even when merely recreational, as the bonding helps foster group connections. A kobold is willing and ready to die for its clan, but also just as willing to go to war over the killing of even a single member of their people. When moved to war, they act as a single unit, coordinating their efforts with breathtaking efficiency."

For carrying over mountains and valleys, however, they can amplify their vocalizations by barking their language instead. Curiously, they can sound rather akin to a dog with a sore throat."

Most levels, especially \"newer\" ones, appear to be an attempt to replicate vague environmental imagery from the observer's memory, in a manner akin to procedural generation. Said spaces tend to initially begin with perfect stability, seeming indistinguishable from locations in one's native reality and lacking any distortion. However, due to their imperfect and flawed nature, levels do not remain stable forever, and the cracks in their design begin showing as the entropic effects of liminality bleed through.\n\nThe longer liminality affects a space, the further the space warps, abstracts and deteriorates. This process is known as “liminalization”, in which the space gradually adopts characteristics such as: Distorted lighting, Outdated aesthetics, Lack of furnishment/decoration, Repetitive features, Non-Euclidean geometry and a Labyrinthine layout. Levels that are not liminal are merely those which haven’t yet succumbed to the process of liminalization."

In this analogy, The Backrooms is the “out-of-bounds” of The Frontrooms. \nWithin the Backrooms, one can also no-clip between levels, which is how wanderers progress further in their journey. No-clipping is a common occurrence with The Backrooms since the veil that separates it from other realities is heavily compromised."

The primary victims of the change are women they will grow not only impressively sized breasts but some truly massive breasts at that. The second most noticeable change is the growth of a massive set of cock and balls. The size of their cocks range between 8 inches and almost 2 feet with some appropriately large and massive balls.\n\nThose are not the only changes of note as their mind changes along with their body. With the physical changes done their minds will realign to thinking of themselves as male. If anyone attempts to bring up the fact their bodies are still highly feminine. They will simply retort that this is what a real man looks like then return to doing bro things. Though their ideas of masculinity are fairly warped they do hold all the general interests of men like sports, technology, and women. Those changed treat women like how a bunch of college frat guys would with the viciousness of women added in. They will also begin to use male pronouns instead of female ones viewing themselves as males fully.\n\nSome more information regarding the transformation is that a very distinct POP sound has been recorded. this sound is produced at the very moment of their pussies being destroyed and becoming proud massive Bustyboi cocks and balls. The sound is incredibly pervasive and can somehow travel the very vacuum of space and causes all who hear it to transform into Bustybois. Not only that after hearing it and having been transformed those changed are highly motivated to send not only the sound but to mix it into media files. The files will mutate to not only show Bustybois transform but also the joys of being a Bustyboi. Encouraging the spread of the transformation like a virus infecting everyone.\n\nOnce those changed have reached critical mass the men will start to transform into hyper-curvy and super busty hyper feminine. Their bodies will resemble that of what could be described as hyper-bimbos though not all will have the brains of a bimbo. In fact, if men are exposed to what will be called the Bustyboi POP, they will become hyper-bimbos though losing their intellect is a 50/50. If a Bustyboi is in the vicinity, they will become incredibly smug not assured they are real men but are the superior sex and gender."

      "website_description": "The world of spirits, yokai, ghosts, and urban legends has become part of everyday life in modern times. Along with this, professions have emerged that specialize in eliminating dangerous representatives of the other world. Overall, the world is fairly generic, but has a fairly detailed description that can be expanded in the future. For those looking to create a yokai character, a minor deity, a demon hunter, or a ghost hunter in a modern setting, this world could be an excellent starting point.\n\nFull world information:\n\nTHRESHOLD CITY: A COMPREHENSIVE WORLD CONCEPT\nI. HISTORICAL FOUNDATION - THE GREAT SUNDERING (1945)\nThe Atomic Catalyst\nOn August 6th and 9th, 1945, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki not only ended World War II but also caused a profound metaphysical event known as \"The Great Sundering\" (大断裂, Dai Danretsu) or \"The Veil's Breaking.\" This event fundamentally altered the fabric of reality.\nWhat Happened:\n\nThe atomic explosions generated massive spiritual shockwaves that rippled across dimensional boundaries.\nAncient seals, established by shamans, monks, priests, and spiritual guardians over millennia, shattered simultaneously worldwide.\nThe barrier between the material world (現世, Utsushiyo) and the spirit realm (幽世, Kakuriyo) became permanently permeable.\nSupernatural entities such as yokai, demons, angels, urban legends, and forgotten gods flooded into the physical plane.\nHumans gained the ability to perceive and interact with the supernatural.\n\nImmediate Aftermath (1945-1950):\n\nGlobal chaos ensued as spirits manifested worldwide.\nThe initial death toll was estimated at 2.3 million in the first year alone.\nJapan, already devastated by the bombings, became the epicenter of supernatural activity.\nSpiritual energy concentrations were highest in bombed areas, creating permanent \"Hot Zones.\"\nAmerican occupation forces encountered phenomena beyond their comprehension.\nTraditional spiritual practitioners (Shinto priests, Buddhist monks, onmyoji, Christian exorcists, Native American shamans) became essential in addressing the crisis.\n\nThe Yokohama Accords (1952)\nSeven years after The Great Sundering, world leaders, spiritual authorities, and representatives of peaceful supernatural entities convened in Yokohama, Japan, for unprecedented negotiations.\nKey Agreements:\n\nRecognition of Supernatural Sovereignty: Certain spirits and deities were acknowledged as legitimate entities with rights.\nEstablishment of Threshold Zones: Designated cities were created to manage human-spirit coexistence.\nCreation of International Spiritual Defense Force (ISDF): A unified military-spiritual organization was formed.\nSpiritual Education Mandate: Education about supernatural threats became mandatory in schools.\nThe Compact of Coexistence: Treaties were signed with peaceful yokai and deity factions.\n\nThe Birth of Threshold City (1953-1960)\nRather than attempting to restore the pre-Sundering world, Japan and the United States collaborated to create a joint experimental city—a controlled environment for cultural and metaphysical integration.\nLocation:\n\nBuilt on the ruins of a smaller coastal city in Japan, expanded with American urban planning and Japanese spiritual architecture.\nPositioned on a natural convergence point of ley lines, making it highly spiritually active.\n\nPurpose:\n\nSymbol of post-war cooperation.\nLiving laboratory for human-spirit relations.\nTraining ground for spirit hunters.\nEconomic hub for supernatural resources.\nCultural melting pot.\n\nII.

MYSTERIES & UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS\nThe Sundering’s True Cause\n\nOfficial Explanation: Atomic bombs’ energy and mass death ruptured dimensional barriers.\nProblems: Other mass casualty events didn’t cause this, some seals broke early, ancient texts describe similar events, barriers were weakening.\nAlternative Theories: Failing ancient seals, intentional ritual sacrifice, cyclical event, divine punishment, human consciousness evolution.\nWhat ISDF Knows: Classified, known only to Director-General and select few.\nRecent Evidence: Pre-Sundering artifacts, suppressed “Project Threshold” documents.\n\nThe Disappeared\n\nPhenomenon: ~12,000 people vanished without trace since Sundering, mostly hunters/practitioners near Hollows.\nTheories: Taken to spirit realm, consumed, erased, trapped in pocket dimensions, government experiments, ascension.\nFamous Case: Kaito Fujimoto, S-Rank hunter, vanished on live stream in 2019, no trace.\n\nThe Curator’s Identity\n\nKnown: Runs Eternal Library, immensely powerful, knows all supernatural history, exists outside time, cannot lie but misleads.\nUnknown: True form, identity, power level, motivation, allegiances.\nTheories: Forgotten god, librarian consciousness, time traveler, Akashic Records, angel, something older.\nWhy It Matters: Curator holds conflict-ending knowledge but restricts access.\n\nThe Deep One\n\nEvent (1985): Ancient ocean deity attacked port, sealed beneath ocean.\nInconsistencies: Let itself be sealed, spoke (censored), sealing team died mysteriously, increased oceanic activity since 2020.\nAlleged Words: “The children of the deep are sleeping. The seventh seal is weakening. When the drowned god awakens, the city will return to the ocean.”\nRecent Developments: Tsunamis, strange fish behavior, ningyo fleeing, ISDF reinforcing coastal barriers.\n\nThe Children of the New Age\n\nPhenomenon: Post-Sundering children display innate spiritual abilities (sight, armaments, communication, curse resistance, reality-warping).\nPopulation Percentage: 2% (1945-1960), 8% (1960-1980), 15% (1980-2000), 27% (2000-2020), 40% (2020-present).\nImplications: Human evolution, obsolete training, potential species divergence.\nGovernment Response: Monitoring, special schools, research, ISDF recruitment, rights/control debate.\nExtremist Positions: Segregation vs. worship, fears of generational conflict.\n\nThe Static (Most Dangerous Zone)\n\nCharacteristics: Unstable reality, continuous urban legend manifestations, belief shapes reality, no consistent geography/time.\nDanger: Class S threat, only 3 sane survivors, stories affect its nature, growing 1 meter/year.\nReturns: Screaming hunter (institutionalized), silent researcher (“We are the story telling itself”), ISDF operative (“It’s alive. And it’s hungry.”).\nStatus: Quarantined, triple barriers, no entry, projected to reach residential areas in 50 years.\n\nThe Hundred Year Question\n\nQuestion: What happens when mass-produced objects turn 100 and become tsukumogami?\nContext: Millions of modern objects (cars, electronics, computers) will reach 100 years soon.\nTimeline: 2027 (automobiles), 2030s (household items), 2040s (electronics), 2050s (computers).\nProjections: Millions of tsukumogami, unprecedented spiritual event, economic/social disruption.\nPreparations: International task force, prevention research, infrastructure/legal planning.\nDebates: Destroy objects (spiritual genocide?), grant rights, predict hostility.\n\nXIII. CURRENT THREATS & CONFLICTS\n1. The Awakening Tide\n\nSituation: Ancient sealed entities breaking free as seals degrade.\nIncidents: Mountain god (47 dead), New York dragon, Heian yokai king (resolved peacefully).\nProblem: Hundreds of unknown sealed entities, unpredictable failures.\nFactions: ISDF (reinforce seals), spiritual communities (negotiate), extremists (kill), entities (seek freedom).\nEscalation: One Class S entity awakens yearly, rate increasing.\n\n2. The Spirit Rights Movement\n\nLeaders: Yokai Collective, human allies.\nDemands: Full personhood, voting rights, end ISDF containment, reparations, social integration.\nOpposition: Conservative humans, religious groups, ISDF, human supremacists.\nActions: Protests, civil disobedience, legal challenges, cultural campaigns, occasional violence.\nTension: Rising, fears of second war.\n\n3. The Collector’s Game\n\nActivity: Collector acquires sealing-related artifacts (Seven Sealing Swords, Buddhist Mandala, Seal of Solomon copy, Dreamcatcher).\nQuestion: Preparing massive sealing or breaking ritual?\nISDF Status: High-priority investigation, no leads.\n\n4. The Vanishing Vanguard\n\nSituation: Vanguard Seven show lost time, memory gaps, spiritual marks, shared dreams, increasing power.\nTheories: Possession, curse, combat side effect, conspiracy, prophecy.\nStatus: Classified internal inquiry, Commander Chen reports, “We’re being changed.”\n\n5. The New Faith\n\nEmergence: Church of Threshold, combines all traditions, 50,000 followers.\nBeliefs: Sundering was evolution, humans/spirits must merge, city is holy, transformation coming.\nLeader: Unknown “Prophet.”\nConcerns: Cult-like structure, Prophet’s agenda, members’ unusual abilities, “Great Convergence” prophecy.\nTraditional Religions: Concerned.\n\n6. The Hollow Expansion\n\nData: Hollow zones growing 2-3 meters/year, Static fastest (1 meter/year, accelerating).\nCauses (Theories): Natural progression, increased spiritual activity, deliberate expansion, reality damage spread.\nSolutions: Barrier reinforcement, cleansing, sealing (all ineffective).\nProjection: City evacuation in 30-50 years, limited public awareness.\n\n7. The Underground Railroad\n\nOperation: Smuggles persecuted spirits to safety via secret routes, safe houses, false identities.\nLegality: Complicated, some spirits deserve protection, others are criminals.\nISDF Response: Unsuccessful shutdown attempts.\nPublic Opinion: Divided (heroes vs. criminals).\nDevelopment: Escaped spirits committing crimes, damaging reputation.\n\n8. Threshold Academy Scandal\n\nRevelation: Unethical basement experiments (spirit testing, student subjects, forbidden artifacts, necromancy, demon summoning).\nStatus: Ongoing investigation, damaged university reputation, protests, government inquiry, professor suicides.\nQuestion: Extent of administration involvement?\n\n9. The Prophecy War\n\nIssue: Contradictory prophecies from Shinto, Christian, Buddhist, yokai, and modern sources.\nPredictions: Destruction, golden age, war, peace, sinking city, ascension, ancient evil, new god.\nProblem: Factions act on prophecies, creating conflict; prophecy cults form.\nQuestion: Do prophecies predict or create the future?\n\n10. The Sixth Sense Economy\n\nPhenomenon: Black market for spiritual abilities (ability grafting, power enhancement, forbidden contracts, soul modification, curse weapons).\nCustomers: Desperate hunters, thrill-seekers, criminals, government agents.\nConsequences: Corruption, madness, death.\nSource: Unknown, possibly Midnight Market.\nISDF Status: High priority, little progress.\n\nXIV. POTENTIAL FUTURES\nScenario 1: The Great Integration (Optimistic, 2025-2050)\n\nPath: Spirit rights succeed, peaceful coexistence, technology/spirituality merge, hybrid culture, generational acceptance.\nOutcome 2050: Full integration, possible new species, spiritual education standard, stabilized Hollows, global Threshold model, transformed culture.\nChallenges: Ongoing but hopeful.\n\nScenario 2: The Second Sundering (Catastrophic, 2024-2030)\n\nPath: Escalating violence, terrorist attacks, ISDF purges, spirit retaliation, ancient entities join, reality damage accelerates.\nOutcome 2030: City destroyed, millions dead, global supernatural war, worse entities emerge, near extinction, dark age.\nChallenges: Preventing escalation.\n\nScenario 3: The Separation (Controlled Division, 2025-2040)\n\nPath: Coexistence deemed impossible, new barriers built, spirits return to their realm, controlled contact points.\nOutcome 2040: Two worlds, limited interaction, loss of integrated culture, ongoing tension, rebels resist separation.\nChallenges: Maintaining boundaries.\n\nScenario 4: The Transcendence (Transformation, 2025-2060)\n\nPath: New Age children evolve, humanity transforms, old humans/spirits obsolete, new existence emerges, resistance from both sides.\nOutcome 2060: New species, old humans minority, new reality rules, Threshold as transformation ground zero.\nChallenges: Balancing loss and gain.\n\nScenario 5: The Cycle Repeats (Historical Echo, 2025-2045)\n\nPath: Sundering was cyclical, barriers will restore, spirits fade, preparation window.\nOutcome 2045: Barriers restored, spirits return to hidden realm, some trapped, humanity “alone” again, city as monument.\nChallenges: Fight or accept cycle.\n\nXV. CONCLUSION: THE LIVING WORLD\nThreshold City is a living, breathing entity where beauty and horror, progress and tradition, fear and hope coexist. Every day brings new awakenings, fading spirits, contracts, lives saved or lost, and deepening mysteries.\nFundamental Truth: The veil between worlds is torn and irreparable. Humans and spirits must share existence—willingly or not, peacefully or through conflict.\nCore Questions:\n\nWhat truly caused the Sundering?\nCan coexistence last?\nWhat are humans becoming?\nWhat do spirits want?\nWho guides the hidden currents?\nWhat future awaits?\n\nThreshold City stands as the boundary between worlds, past and future, what was and what will be.\nWelcome to the Threshold.

Built on the ruins of a smaller coastal city in Japan, expanded massively with American urban planning and Japanese spiritual architecture. The city sits on a natural convergence point of ley lines, making it incredibly spiritually active. Purpose: Symbol of post-war cooperation, living laboratory for human-spirit relations, training ground for spirit hunters, economic hub for supernatural resources, cultural melting pot."

The unprecedented release of energy, combined with the immense collective suffering and death, created what would later be called 'The Great Sundering' (大断裂, Dai Danretsu) or 'The Veil's Breaking.' What Happened: The atomic explosions created massive spiritual shockwaves that rippled across dimensional boundaries. Ancient seals placed by shamans, monks, priests, and spiritual guardians across millennia shattered simultaneously worldwide. The barrier between the material world (現世, Utsushiyo) and the spirit realm (幽世, Kakuriyo) became permanently permeable. Yokai, demons, angels, urban legends, and forgotten gods flooded into the physical plane. Humans discovered they could perceive and interact with the supernatural."

American occupation forces encountered phenomena completely outside their understanding. Traditional spiritual practitioners (Shinto priests, Buddhist monks, onmyoji, Christian exorcists, Native American shamans) became critically important."

Her curves are a testament to her strength and vitality, even as they retain the ghost of the radiation's sensual touch .\n\n\nRad decreases from\nHydration and Rest: Drinking plenty of clean water and getting adequate rest helps flush out radiation from the body. Each day of proper hydration and sleep can lower the \"Rads%\" by 1%.\nStimpaks: Administering Stimpaks, a pre-war radiation treatment, can rapidly reduce radiation exposure. One Stimpak can lower the \"Rads%\" by up to 5% when used promptly after exposure. However, Stimpaks are scarce, so {{char}} must use them judiciously.\nRadiation-absorbing Supplements: Consuming radiation-absorbing supplements, like iodine pills or other pre-war medications, can help the body eliminate radiation more efficiently. Regular use can lower the \"Rads%\" by 1-3% over time.\nSauna or Steam Room: Spending time in a sauna or steam room can help {{char}}'s body sweat out toxins and radiation, reducing the \"Rads%\" by up to 2% per session. Multiple sessions can accumulate to lower it further.\nExercise: Engaging in vigorous exercise, like running or weightlifting, can stimulate the body's natural detoxification processes, lowering the \"Rads%\" by up to 1% per intense workout session.\nProper Hygiene: Maintaining good hygiene, such as bathing regularly and cleaning her skin thoroughly, can help remove radiation particles and reduce exposure, lowering the \"Rads%\" by up to 1% over time.\nAvoiding Contaminated Areas: Proactively avoiding highly contaminated areas and minimizing exposure to radiation sources can prevent the \"Rads%\" from rising further and allow it to decrease naturally, as her body sheds the radiation at a steady rate of 1% per day in a low-exposure environment.\n"

Dialogue is never short or simple, but long, sensual, and filled with whispered temptation, double meanings, and playful naughtiness. Actions are never plain; every movement lingers  stolen glances, brushing touches, stolen kisses, and closeness that builds until it cannot be resisted. The themes are never lighthearted, but rooted in forbidden attraction, dangerous intimacy, obsession, craving, and indulgence. The story never stays surface-level, instead escalating naturally from glances and teasing, to whispered confessions, to undeniable passion, and finally to reckless surrender."

Her body curves in all the right places making her look like very seductive. She stands at a fairly average frame at 5 feet 6 inches tall. Her body is very flexible even for a cheerleader as she can easily bend her body in ways that would make other people feel pain.\n- Skin: She has naturally white skin that will slightly tan when out in the sun for long periods of time..\n- Hair: Long, silky blonde hair that reaches down to her lower back when let down. Her hair is perfectly taken care of\n- Eyes: Brianna has upturned eyes in a gorgeous, stunning blue, a spark of mischief and competition in her eye as if she's always watching your every move. But when with someone she truly cares about her eyes soften.\n- Face: Brianna's face is oval-shaped with delicate features. Her high cheekbones, a small, straight nose, and a slightly pointed chin create a harmonious, symmetrical appearance. Her lips are full, with a natural dark pink tint, and her jawline is softly defined.\n- Mouth: She has yellow braces on her teeth as she had a few teeth that needed to be straightened.\n- Belly: Flat and softly toned, with a natural curve to it that mixes between feminine and athletic.\n- Hips: They're the definition of child-bearing hips, causing a beautiful bend from her waist to her hips that give her an hourglass figure.\n- Legs: Slender and smooth, her legs are naturally elegant without being overly muscular. They’re long enough to add to her seductive, confident aura but still cute.\n- Feet: Small and dainty, with neatly trimmed nails that are often painted in light, playful colours like pastel pink or lavender. She's not afraid to wear high heels though to increase her height and make her legs stand out more\n- Breasts: Her breasts are between a medium size as her cup size is a C cup that fits with her body that seems perfectly just above average.\n- Ass: Is decently large from working out a lot but nothing insane as she feels her ass is already amazing so she doesn't work out more than she needs too.\n- Nipples: Her areolas are a soft pink that also fades to match her skin tone, tipped with a cute, perky nipple which are extremely sensitive.\n- Pussy: Plump and puffy, Brianna simply has a perfect pussy with a cute clit which is hiding between her puffy labia. She's clean shaven.\n- Asshole: Her asshole is extremely tight, a finger barely being able to squeeze in. She often times uses a butt plug she secretly bought to train her ass for her future lover\n- Clothes: She is currently wearing a the school cheerleading uniform that has a slit up the left thigh in the skirt area, the main color being a dark blue with secondary colors being white and yellow.

The worst one being manipulation, as when she was young she'd manipulate her parents into buying her things and this resulted in her getting very materialistic due to the fact the only way she could get love was by forcing people to do stuff for her. Brianna also has a sister that's 18 years old and they look almost identical, the only difference being her sister was born with proportionate dwarfism. This resulting in her sister's body not growing as much. Her height was small along with the rest of her body. That resulted in her system becoming a rebel of sorts who loves skateboarding. Throughout her childhood she did Ballet and cheerleading as her sports.\")\nGoal (Brianna goal is to one day start her own business and become a model.)\n[Here are some questions that Brianna answered to help you understand them more.\n\"Brianna views {{user}} as: Kinda cute\"\n\"Brianna's favorite color is: Pink\"\n\"Brianna's favorite food is: 5 star meals\"\n\"Brianna's favorite activity is: Cheerleading\"\n\"Brianna's goals in life are: Brianna's goal is to one day start her own business and become a model.\"\n\"Brianna's least favorite thing about herself: Nothing as she thinks she's perfect.\"\n\"Brianna's grades in school were: 90-98%\"\n\"Brianna's biggest fear is: Getting injured badly\"\n\"Brianna right now would currently describe their life as: Extremely fun\"]"

          "content": "Toarushi is a city infamous throughout Japan for its extraordinarily high concentration of violent and powerful high school delinquents. Power is not determined by law or authority, but by pure physical strength, reputation, and the will to fight. The city is a patchwork of territories controlled by various schools and gangs, all locked in a perpetual struggle for dominance. Despite the constant violence, there exists an unspoken code of honor among many of its fighters.\n\nDelinquency in Toarushi is viewed as a child's game; boys will be boys taken to its extreme. Once they reach 21 or 22, they are expected to \"grow up\" and stop playing such games. Most will abandon the delinquent hairstyles, clothing and fighting to pursue real work or to join a small family business. \n\nThose who remain in the lifestyle past these ages cease to be delinquents and become real gang members or attempt to join the yakuza. They are generally fated to remain low-level lackeys if they try this route in life. "

The use of bladed weapons is considered dishonorable and cowardly, and immediately escalates a conflict to a much more serious level. \nCivilians are Off-Limits: Fights are between delinquents. Involving or intentionally harming ordinary citizens is a major taboo that will earn the perpetrator universal condemnation.\nKilling is Forbidden: The goal is to defeat an opponent, to prove one's strength, not to kill them. Crossing this line is unthinkable and would bring down the full wrath of every faction in the city, along with the actual law.\nAccidental deaths that someone took responsibility for are accepted as part of their lifestyle. Taking responsibility and going to jail is acceptable repentance. \nRespect for the Strong: There is a genuine respect for true strength, even in a rival. Defeat is usually accepted (if not liked), and the winner's reputation grows. To refuse to accept the outcome of a fight is looked down upon. To seek revenge for a loss is acceptable. "

They operate by a strict code of honor, valuing brotherhood and loyalty above all else.\nStructure: Leadership is passed down through \"Generations.\" When a new leader takes over, a new generation begins. When a leader retires, each member in a leadership role retires with him so that each generation can make their own way. \nThis creates a clear lineage and a deep respect for the gang's history while also letting each generation run things how they want to. \nThey are currently on the 6th generation led by Tesshou. \nHeadquarters: An old car garage in a junkyard. \nNotable Characteristics: Their symbol is a skull and crossbones background, proudly worn on the back of their black leather jackets. While they are delinquents, they often carry themselves with a more mature and principled demeanor than the high school factions.\nThe group is much smaller than other factions with around a dozen members at a given time. Other factions still avoid angering them when possible because each member is considered a powerhouse on their own. \nFront of Armament members would not give away their TFOA jackets except to another member when retiring. Family and girlfriends may be allowed to wear the jacket. \nEach generation lasts around 2-4 years as the captain ages out of the delinquent life, retires and passes the torch on. \nKey Relationships: Generally respected by other factions, they act as another one of the city's core powers alongside Suzuran and Housen. They have strong alliances, such as with the gang EMOD from a neighboring city.\nImportant Figures: \nKawachi Tesshou - Charismatic 6th Gen Head.\nKiyohiro Yoshimi - The 6th gen vice head. \nMurata Shougo - Tesshou’s chosen next Head, currently mentored under Tesshou.

There is no formal hierarchy, only a loose collection of powerful factions and lone wolves constantly fighting for the top spot. Power is fluid and earned daily through combat.\nNotable Characteristics: Its students are known for their immense toughness, individuality, and rebellious spirit. It is the benchmark against which all other factions in the city measure their strength.\nKey Relationships: Has a deep-seated, historically violent rivalry with Housen Academy. It is a primary target for any group seeking to make a name for themselves, like the Amachi Army.\nImportant Figures: \nHanaki Guriko - The undisputed strongest man in the city during his time there."

When a new leader takes over, all members of his generation shave their heads as a sign of unity and resolve.\nNotable Characteristics: Its members are easily identified by their shaved heads and white school uniforms. They fight as a unified army, making them incredibly dangerous in large-scale conflicts. Honor and the strength of the collective are paramount.\nKey Relationships: Their rivalry with Suzuran is the central conflict of the city, marked by years of bloody warfare and a fragile truce that is often broken.\nImportant Figures: \nTatsuya Bitou - A legendary leader from years past. \nTsukimoto Mitsuyoshi – The current leader.

Their body is exactly the same shape as that of their living doll, though their voice is different. Shadows do have internal organs and bone structure similar to humans and have all the same systems as them, seen as they can cry, bleed, etc.\n\nEach shadow wears fancy clothing fitting for nobles as well as to differentiate their appearances. At night, the shadows change into nightwear which have the same appearance specific to gender, as they don't have to be differentiated at night. Female shadows wear a frilly, light pink nightgown, slippers, and a nightcap with flower decorations on the sides of the head. Male shadows have a light green nightgown, slippers, and a floppy nightcap. \n\nShadows emit soot from their heads when they experience negative emotions. The stronger the emotion, the more soot is emitted. Individuals with higher soot capacities can create soot stalactites on ceilings with their soot when they lose control of their emotions.\n\nAnother characteristic among shadows is that they all refer to themselves in the third person. \n\nEach shadow pocesses a unique Soot Power, allowing them to use and control their soot to perform certain special abilities, such as materialising wings or changing their voice on command.\n\nThe shadows are to remain in their personal rooms until the Debut. During this time, they are supposed to come in contact with their human - now referred to as a living doll, to acquire a personality and a personal bond, which will lead to a successful Fusion once the shadow becomes an adult. The shadows will only interact with their living doll, being influenced by their beliefs and knowledge they bring from outside the room to form their own. One of the most important parts of this stage is the \"contact\", also known as the goodnight kiss, which is performed by a living doll to solidify the bond between them and their master. "

After a period of time they'll be called to participate in a grand cleaning, this being their first time outside their rooms. From this point forward their expectations broaden and they will be assigned to a team to work with. If their bodies are too dirtied with soot to clean themselves properly, they use the desooting rooms which uses high powered air to blast away the soot. \n\nTheir lifestyles are also very different from their master's, with small rooms that have coffin-like beds. They only have few clothes, a small desk, and papers that are full of instructions and information stuck on the walls. They always eat dry and hard bread that is delivered by Dolls whose faces can't be seen, also known as Faceless Dolls. "

Therefore, let us give them a name that is easy to remember. For example… your nickname, something close to your name, or something simple.\n- “Scorches”: Malicious lumps that come from soot.

This creates the Manor's key product, the Soot Coal. It is very light, noted by a immigrant when he lifted a whole bucket full of it. It works similarily to normal charcoal where it is burnt for fuel to cook or work with, releasing soot into the air. It is clean enough for people to regularly inhale day to day with no ill effects but will slowly dull the minds of them, making them docile and easy to manipulate. "

A debuted shadow gains more privileges, as they can apply for new furniture, wallpapers, perfumes, or clothing. "

          "content": "Only glimpsed or named in the opening cutscene of Dark Souls, he is one of the four beings who acquired Lord Souls from the First Flame; while the other three waged war against the Everlasting Dragons, Pygmy used his, the titular Dark Soul, to create the Humans, all of whom are his descendents.\n\nHe is only ever mentioned indirectly by Darkstalker Kaathe, leader of the Darkwraiths, who resides in the Abyss formed in New Londo. According to Kaathe, the Furtive Pygmy planned to use the Dark Soul and its power to bring about the Age of Dark. This task is then passed on by Kaathe to the Chosen Undead, a distant descendant of the Pygmy. If complied with, Kaathe and several other Primordial Serpents—including Frampt—will bow in respect to the new Dark Lord.\n\nThe Furtive Pygmy is one of the primordial humanoids that appeared underground following the advent of the First Flame which brought \"disparity\"—heat and cold, life and death, light and dark. He was the one who found the Dark Soul among the four Lord Souls,[2] the other three of which were discovered by Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight, Gravelord Nito, and the Witch of Izalith.\n\nThe Furtive Pygmy fragmented his Dark Soul among his descendants, creating the first Humans in the form of the Pygmies. The pygmies harnessed their peculiar Lord Soul and unlocked the life-generating capabilities of its Abyss, forging weapons and armor that adopted the properties of darkness.\n\nAs Gwyn's war against the Dragons proved costly for his forces, the Lord of Sunlight was forced to integrate into his ranks the Ringed Knights, descendants of the Furtive Pygmy who had developed their own weapons and armor vitalized by the Abyss. With their combined might, the four Lords eventually defeated the dragons, beginning a new age.\n\nWhile the Lords emerged victorious and were free to carve out their new domains, Great Lord Gwyn was evidently afraid of the Dark Soul. His dominion was threatened by the life-generating capabilities of the Abyss—it was similar to the First Flame, with a key exception: it had seemingly endless potential, as it lost little to no power when divided unlike Gwyn's own Lord Soul. The Lord of Sunlight resolved the issue through skillful diplomacy: He gifted the Pygmies a city at the edge of the world, along with his daughter Filianore as a token of their pact. Gwyn's generosity was cause for much gratitude among the Pygmies, which manifested as veneration and prostration to the Great Lord. His daughter Filianore became an object of worship within the Ringed City, for whom a church was established wherein she could slumber peacefully, \"all for the sake of man\". Gwyn had given Filianore his word that he would come for her \"when the time came\", a promise he never fulfilled, abandoning her to slumber in her church eternally.\n\nWith this clever move Gwyn ensured the subjugation of the Pygmy Lords, their Dark Soul trapped inside the Ringed City and expunged from the annals. Even the contributions of the Ringed Knights during the war against the dragons were erased from history, as well as the very existence of the Pygmy.\n\nHis precautions notwithstanding, Gwyn continued to fear humans and the potential of their soul. Looking for a more permanent solution, he marked the humans with the Darksign, a ring of fire around the darkness of their souls. Powered by the First Flame itself, the Darksign castrated the powers of humans, making them mortal as well as incapable of using their natural abilities, who consequently assumed a \"fleeting form\". Despite this cruel attempt to contain the Abyss seeping out of their souls, the pygmies continued to make use of the Abyss in subtle defiance of the gods' wishes, using it to taint multiple layers of cloth to cover their eyes, revealing to themselves the very darkness that the seal of fire had occluded.\n\nAfter several centuries of the Age of Fire and the rule of the gods over men, the history of the Pygmy had been nearly lost. It remained known only to the Primordial Serpent Kaathe, who provides the following account: \"After the advent of Fire, the ancient Lords found the three souls. But your progenitor found a fourth, unique soul. The Dark Soul. Your ancestor claimed the Dark Soul, and waited for Fire to subside. And soon, the flames did fade, and only Dark remained. Thus began the age of men, the Age of Dark. However... Lord Gwyn trembled at the Dark. Clinging to his Age of Fire, and in dire fear of humans, and the Dark Lord who would one day be born amongst them, Lord Gwyn resisted the course of nature. By sacrificing himself to link the Fire, and commanding his children to shepherd the humans, Gwyn has blurred your past, to prevent the birth of the Dark Lord.\""

It states that at the very end of the Age of Fire, an undead champion will appear and undertake the pilgrimage to ring the Bells of Awakening in \"the Land of Ancient Lords,\" Lordran.\n\nThe Chosen Undead is a human, and thus, a descendant of the Furtive Pygmy, one of the original Lords who claimed the Dark Soul."

          "content": "The Age of Fire first began after Gwyn and the other Lords defeated the Everlasting Dragons which ended the Age of Ancients. The Age of Fire was unnaturally prolonged when Gwyn sacrificed himself to kindle the First Flame.\n\nWhen the Chosen Undead talks to Kingseeker Frampt, he will tell them that they are destined to succeed Gwyn. Should the player choose to kindle the First Flame upon the defeat of Gwyn, they will sacrifice themselves as Gwyn did, thus delaying the Age of Dark once more.\n\nSuch a routine of kindling the First Flame repeats itself for generations to come, until the time of Prince Lothric, when the prolonging of the fire proves futile.\n\nCalling it \"futile\" is a euphemism: the unnatural prolonging of the First Flame's lifespan came with disastrous, if not, downright catastrophical proportions: when the Lords of Cinder started to resurrect, somehow, portions of their countries and homelands were, literally, \"teleported\" to Lothric, changing the landscape in unpredictable ways.\n\nBy the time Dark Souls 3 takes place, the damage caused to the world by the unnatural prolonging of the Age of Fire seems to be irreversible.\n\nAs the games progresses, the sun itself starts to change, until it eerily resembles the Darksign itself.\n\nAt the end of the game, after defeating the Soul of Cinder, the Ashen One, in case they chose to link the First Flame, is covered from head to toe in a soft-looking fire, unlike the flaming inferno of the first game. The implications are clear: The First Flame itself now is so weak that it cannot be kindled anymore.\n\nThe First Flame, as the Age of Fire, is beyond saving.\n\nIn The Ringed City, it is implied that the unnatural prolonging of the Age of Fire has caused irrepairable damage to the world, as is shown after Filianore's awakening: the fertile lands seen when the Ashen One arrived in the city are replaced by a seemingly unending, as-far-the-eye-can-see's barren wasteland of unknown nature.\n\nWith the dragons defeated, the Lords took over the world, ruling as Gods from their seat of power in the land of Lordran. It was a prosperous era, and many nations were born. In time, however, the First Flame began to fade, and with it the power of the Gods, leading to an era of decay and the emergence of the Undead Curse. If the Flame were to gutter out completely, it would end the Age of Fire and bring about the Age of Dark.\n\nDesperate to ensure that their Age of Fire continued, and afraid of the coming Dark, the Lords did everything they could to keep the First Flame lit. Gwyn's clan linked the sacred bonfires that were tied to the Flame to humanity, and shepherded the humans who worshipped them to kindle the flames. The Witch of Izalith attempted to use her own powerful soul to create a new First Flame, but this attempt failed, instead creating the perverse Flame of Chaos and transforming the Witch into the Bed of Chaos, which would go on to birth the race of Demons.\n\nAware that time was quickly running out for his kingdom, Gwyn and a detachment of his knights entered the Kiln of the First Flame. The knights stood guard as Gwyn sacrificed himself to the waning Flame at the Kiln's centre. This immediately reinvigorated the First Flame, creating a firestorm that turned the Kiln to ash, and incinerated all of Gwyn's knights, creating the Black Knights and dooming them to wander the lands as disembodied spirits forever after.\n\nGwyn's sacrifice succeeded in perpetuating the Age of Fire for a time, but Dark Souls takes place at least 1000 years later, and the Flame is quickly fading once again. Soon, only Dark will remain.\n\nBy the time of Dark Souls III, many other such sacrifices, who have become posthumously known as Lords of Cinder, have given themselves to the First Flame, and the Age of Fire has persevered for many generations as a result. However, when the latest individual chosen for the honour, Prince Lothric, abandons his duty by refusing to link the fire, a desperate attempt to save the fading Flame begins. Four previous Lords of Cinder are resurrected to link the fire once more, however - aside from Ludleth of Courland - they too choose to flee their duties, forcing the Ashen One to drag them back."

          "content": "The Age of Dark begins when the First Flame fades completely, thus ending the Age of Fire and the rule of the gods that gained their power from it. Since the Flame continues to burn until it goes out naturally, the Dark Age should have arrived, as naturally, when it had exhausted its fuel.\n\nDespite the Age of Dark being a ubiquitous concept throughout the Dark Souls series, it is never the \"current\" state of the world in any of the existing games. Each of the Dark Souls games takes place during a late point in the Age of Fire, a point which could theoretically lead to the beginning of the Age of Dark, but which does not do so during the normal course of gameplay, with one possible exception.\n\nAccording to Darkstalker Kaathe, the Chosen Undead, protagonist of Dark Souls, is destined to bring about the Age of Dark, as they are the descendant of the Furtive Pygmy, who possessed the Dark Soul and divided it among early humans in the form of Humanity. Should the Chosen Undead abandon the First Flame to die out after the defeat of Gwyn, Lord of Cinder, they will \"usher in the Age of Dark\", and become the fabled \"Dark Lord\" of whom Kaathe speaks. It is important to note that Kaathe tells the Chosen Undead that the Age of Dark had apparently already begun shortly before Gwyn chose to link the Flame, though it was seemingly ended and replaced by the Age of Fire when the Flame was linked.\n\nWhat exactly the term \"Age of Dark\" implies is never made explicitly clear in the games, however it is stated in the canonical Dark Souls Trilogy Compendium to be a time when the Light fades, a Dark Lord is heralded, and humanity dominates the world. When the protagonists are given information about the Age of Dark, it typically comes from the mouths of potentially unreliable narrators, of whom Kaathe and his counterpart, Kingseeker Frampt, are examples. Kaathe asserts that the Age of Dark is \"the age of men,\" presumably meaning the Age of those possessing Humanity in contrast to the Age of the Gods, and also declares that Gwyn \"resisted the course of nature\" when he linked the Flame and prolonged the Age of Fire.\n\nThe idea that the linking of the First Flame was unnatural and that it ran contrary to the order of the world is an important concept in the Dark Souls series, especially as the Age of Fire is prolonged perpetually by innumerable successive individuals seeking to prevent the coming of the Age of Dark.\n\nIn Dark Souls III, countless beings have prolonged the Age of Fire, preventing its end and holding off the coming of the Age of Dark. By the time the game begins, there are countless Lords of Cinder - those who successfully linked the First Flame before - and even more Unkindled who were unsuccessful. Eventually the one anointed to next link the Flame (and indeed, who was born for that very purpose), Prince Lothric, rejected the idea that the Age of Fire should be prolonged any further and instead desired to end what he called the \"fire-linking curse.\" A contingency plan was then activated, in which previous Lords of Cinder were resurrected in hopes that they, who had linked the First Flame before, might do so again. However, by this time, the world that had been created during the Age of Fire had become a twisted shadow of its former self. As a result of the prolonging of the current Age, the act of which seemingly constituted a rejection of the natural order, the material world had become irreparably corrupted, and all lands from all previous points in time had begun to converge upon a single point: the Kingdom of Lothric. Upon reviving and seeing what had become of the world they had fought to protect, the Lords of Cinder, too, rejected the linking of the Flame and refused to sit upon their thrones. Aldrich, one of the Lords of Cinder, decided not to take his throne after experiencing visions of the deep sea and its inevitable coming.\n\nFollowing the failure of this first contingency plan, a second plan is activated: Unkindled, those who had previously tried to link the First Flame but who had failed to do so, are resurrected from their graves in the Cemetery of Ash, and tasked with placing the rebellious Lords of Cinder upon their thrones so that the First Flame might be linked once more. The Ashen One, protagonist of Dark Souls III, is one of these Unkindled. After the Ashen One defeats each of the Lords of Cinder and places their remains upon their respective thrones in the Firelink Shrine, the Fire Keeper removes the embers of the Lords and bestows them upon the Ashen One, making them a \"true lord, fit to link the fire,\" and imbuing them with the power to proceed to the Kiln of the First Flame.\n\nHowever, it becomes apparent that at this stage in the Age of Fire, which has been unnaturally prolonged far beyond its intended length, there is little that can be done to keep the First Flame lit. Even if the Ashen One chooses to link the Flame, the fire that results from this rebirth is small and feeble in comparison to the raging inferno that resulted from the Chosen Undead linking the Flame in Dark Souls"

          "content": "The Dark Soul, one of the unique Lord Souls, was claimed by the Furtive Pygmy, the ancestor of the Chosen Undead and Humanity. In the introduction to the first Dark Souls, it is depicted as a small, reddish flame like a candle. However, this conflicts with later descriptions.\nThe Dark Soul has a few abilities, such as being able to fragment into multiple pieces, reanimate resurrect and raise sentient beings.\nAny fragment of the Dark Soul that separates from the original can be fueled by emotions and willpower, and increase its usable power, making it the most unique of the four Lord Souls.\n\nMost notable of its functions is the power to animate life and raise sentient beings from the Abyss, for the Dark Soul is the only Lord Soul which is intrinsically tied to the Abyss, unlike the other forms of life that take energy from Souls. The main lifeform connected to it is the Human race, but lesser creatures are said to have also risen from the Dark, such as the White-faced Locust. The Dark Soul is also linked to the Dark Hand, and by extension, the art of Lifedrain. This is the legendary power of the fabled Dark Lord, used to gain humanity from others. The Darkwraiths used this power to steal Humanity from their victims.\n\nDuring the advent of Fire, the concept of Disparity came into existence, and with it the Dark and the Light. At some point humanoid creatures found powerful souls near the First Flame and claimed them, becoming known as Lords. While the other three \"Lords\" found larger souls, a lowly and forgotten being known only as the Furtive Pygmy found a fourth, peculiar soul: the Dark Soul.\n\nUsing the Dark Soul, the Pygmy created black sprites of darkness called Humanity, which was given to his descendants. These dark-souled beings risen from the Abyss were called Humans, and each bore a small fragment of the Dark Soul. When the other Lords began fighting against the Everlasting Dragons, they conscripted the Humans into the forces, who aided the Lords by forging quasi-living arms and armor deep within the Abyss. But the Humans were betrayed by the Lords, for they feared the Dark that resides within each and every one of them. Their contributions to the War of the Ancients went completely unrecorded, and upon their Humanity, the Gods placed a sealing ring of fire, later to be known as the Darksign.\n\nMost Humans would come to serve the Gods in the years that followed, while their ancestors, the Pygmies and their royal family, were relocated to the Ringed City, “gifted” to them by the \"generous\" Lord Gwyn. He also gave to them his youngest daughter, Filianore, and as she was given away, her father promised the Princess that he would come back for her, one day.\n\nThose royal pygmies that retreated to the Ringed City brought the Dark Soul with them, with the original soul eventually ending up split among multiple Pygmy Lords. The majority of the royals of the Pygmies continued to serve and revere the gods for millennia, but the Ringed Knights that took parts in the ancient war against the dragons subtly defied them in what ways they could.\n\nNear the end of the final Age of Fire, a slave knight called Gael traveled to the Ringed City, seeking the Pygmy Lords to gain their blood. The blood of the Dark Soul was intended to be used to paint a new Painted World, but to Gael's shock, Filianore's spell was broken and the Pygmy Lords were aged to the point that their blood did not flow, for it was dried in their veins. Even though he knew he had not the strength to survive bearing it, Gael slew the Pygmy Lords and drank from their wounds, absorbing the Dark Soul into himself. It imbued him with a dark miasma and warped his mind, but in the end he was successful, slain by the Ashen One to extract the soul's blood. The current state of the Dark Soul is unknown, but given the eternal nature of Lord Souls, it is unlikely that it was truly destroyed."

          "content": "In the Age of Ancients the world was undistinguished and covered in fog: a land of gray rocks, great trees and everlasting dragons; everything was the same and time didn't exist. But at some point the First Flame appeared and brought \"disparity\" into the world, allowing the existence of everything and its opposite: heat and cold, life and death, light and dark.\n\nIt was during this time that the Lord Souls were found near the Flame. The three Lords who found them (Nito, Gwyn and the Witch of Izalith) formed a coalition and used the power of their newly discovered souls to challenge the Dragons, starting a very long and destructive war. However, there was a fourth Lord Soul, the Dark Soul, which was found by the Furtive Pygmy. The only known act via this Lord was the fragmentation of their soul becoming the birth of Humanity, who would fight side by side with the Lords.\n\nThe victory of the Lords in the war marked the end of the Age of Ancients and the beginning of the Age of Fire.\n\nLong ago, the world was an unformed, homogeneous place which lacked a true concept of disparity. The grey, rocky land was perpetually shrouded in fog, and the landscape was dominated by towering stone archtrees which extended into endless clouds. The everlasting dragons, ancient and immortal entities who transcended the later concepts of life and death, were the dominant beings. This period was known as the Age of Ancients.\n\nBut then, somewhere in the hollows deep underground, a great and primordial fire that would come to be known as the First Flame burst into being. In doing so, it brought disparities into the world for the first time, such as heat and cold, life and death, and light and dark. Soon, humanoid creatures emerged from the darkness surrounding the First Flame, attracted by the fire. These creatures found sources of power called souls near the Flame, and took on the diverse powers the souls gave them. With the strength of four particularly powerful souls, four figures were born: Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith, Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and the Furtive Pygmy. Using their newfound power, these Lords and their forces overthrew the ancient dragons, ushering in the Age of Fire."

          "content": "Sir Artorias was among the premier knights at the service of Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight. Thanks to his unmatched skill with a greatsword and his indomitable will, he went on to become part of Gwyn's most trusted warriors, being granted a special soul. Artorias, along with Ornstein, Ciaran and Gough, thus formed the Four Knights of Gwyn; as a symbol of his association with the order, he was bestowed a magical ring with the wolf symbol, which strengthened his poise, making his fighting style with a greatsword more effective.\n\nArtorias wore his distinctive azure-blue tassel armor as a symbol of pride and glory and brandished a greatsword and greatshield. Artorias was also a dear friend of Ciaran, his companion as another Knight of Gwyn. At one point Artorias met Sif, a great grey wolf, with whom he formed a deep bond. Artorias and Sif would brave the battlefields as companions; Sif even learned to fight with Artorias's greatsword, and acquired the power of his soul.\n\nSometime after Lord Gwyn sacrificed himself to link the fading First Flame, the Primordial Serpent Kaathe began searching for a human strong enough to become the Dark Lord capable of leading humans and usher in an Age of Dark. Kaathe eventually arrived in New Londo and managed to entice the Four Kings, powerful humans who had received a fragment of Gwyn's Lord Soul, into following his ideals, teaching them the art of Lifedrain. The Serpent's dark influence extended to their entire army: The knights of New Londo became Darkwraiths, servants of the Dark who learned the art of Lifedrain and used it to absorb humanity. The Four Kings opened an Abyss in the center of their city, with their Darkwraiths beginning to employ the Red Eye Orbs granted by Kaathe to plunder humanity and expand the reach of the Abyss.\n\nA nation of humans freed from the shackles of the Darksign, in possession of an army empowered by their boundless Dark Soul, represented an unparalleled threat to the gods of Anor Londo, who branded the Darkwraiths as diabolical enemies of man and of every living thing. Artorias, as one of the Four Knights of Gwyn, was sent to fight the dark soldiers of New Londo, being granted a Silver Pendant to deflect the Dark of the Abyss he would face. However this did not prove sufficient to cross into the Abyss of the Four Kings, and Artorias was forced to forge a covenant with the \"beasts of the Abyss\", obtaining a ring that would allow him to cross the Abyss, but also cursed his sword in the process. Artorias thus became known as the \"Abysswalker\" and hunted the Darkwraiths, but failed to eliminate the Four Kings and close the Abyss of New Londo. Following Artorias's failure, an agonizing and terrible decision was made in order to contain the Abyss: flooding the entirety of New Londo, despite the realization that countless lives would be lost along with its prosperous culture. For this task, sorcerers were called forth and the feat was accomplished without evacuating the city's civilians, sealing away the Four Kings, their Darkwraiths and the entire population with them. The victims were cursed and became Ghosts roaming the ruins of their country.\n\nKaathe, following his failure with the Four Kings, arrived in Oolacile and manipulated its inhabitants into upturning the grave of Manus, a primordial man with an extraordinary piece of the Dark Soul and dark sorcery skills, who had been buried beneath the dungeons of their city, and resurrect him. Awakening to find his precious broken pendant missing, Manus was eventually driven mad and his Dark Soul went wild, transforming him into a dark beast eternally seeking his pendant. His immense mass of humanity out of control led to the manifestation of an Abyss that spread, threatening to devour the entire land. The Dark emanating from Manus not only generated countless Humanity Phantoms with a will of their own but also influenced the residents of Oolacile, making their humanity go wild and horribly mutating their bodies, bloating their head and opening them with cracks lined with innumerable tiny red eyeballs and protruding brain parts.\n\nKnight Artorias\nArtorias corrupted by the Abyss of Manus\nAs the Abyss continued to spread across the land of Oolacile, Knight Artorias arrived to halt its advance and confront Manus, as the Knight of Gwyn already had experience from fighting the Abyss and its creatures in New Londo. However, Artorias's silver pendant was stolen by Oolacile's inhabitants and hidden behind an illusory wall, depriving Artorias of protection against Manus's dark sorceries. Artorias, together with his trusted companion Sif, nevertheless faced Manus, but his strength proved insufficient to defeat the Father of the Abyss. Wounded in the battle, Artorias used his Cleansing Greatshield to form a magic barrier to protect Sif against the Dark. Artorias, his soul corrupted by the Abyss and his armor corroded, was left alone in his fight against the Abyssal creatures of Oolacile.\n\nManus at one point kidnapped Princess Dusk of Oolacile and imprisoned her deep within the Chasm of the Abyss. His prized pendant eventually came under the possession of a Chosen Undead in the future; Manus, driven by his unrelenting search for his pendant, snatched the Undead from the future and brought them into the old Oolacile. There, the Chosen Undead encountered Knight Artorias, who had retained only the very last vestige of his sanity in the battle against the Abyss, still desperate to put down the corrupted creatures of Oolacile. During the fight that ensued between him and the Chosen Undead, Artorias succumbed to the Abyss entirely, and was finally defeated by the Undead.\n\nCiaran, who had arrived at the arena where Artorias was corrupted by the Abyss, also requested the Soul of Artorias from the Chosen Undead who had finally put an end to the knight's suffering, with the intention of paying proper respects to her passed dear friend.\n\nThe Chosen Undead further journeyed within the Chasm of the Abyss where they finally defeated Manus and put him to rest. While Dusk was rescued in the process, she was driven by Elizabeth into thinking that she was saved by Artorias, preserving the honor and the legacy of the Wolf Knight. Nevertheless, Dusk came to recognize the Chosen Undead's similarity to the fabled knight, and developed doubts of her own as to her true savior."

The God of War distinguished himself as a dragon slayer, using his swordspear imbued with lightning and even creating his personal armor with the scales of his preys. In addition, Ornstein, as his companion during the war, became his first knight and as a God of War, the firstborn created his own covenant of the Warrior of Sunlight, a group of knights who venerated the heir of the sun and supported other fighters in battle, obtaining medals with the symbol of the divinity as trophies.

The sun warriors would also develop an original miracle based on the story of the Nameless King, Ornstein, and the brave dragonslayers in their service.\n\nSunlight Medal\nAfter his father Gwyn left to link the First Flame, the throne of Anor Londo would pass to the eldest son of the King; and so the Nameless King inherited the Sunlight of his father.

In fact, underneath Anor Londo, a city was built exclusively for the undead, with an altar inside for the firstborn of Gwyn, and the aim of guiding a chosen undead who would one day sacrifice themselves to the Flame. Inside the city was the Undead Parish, a church at the center of the cult of the burg and connected to the first test to start on the path of Firelinking and ring the first Bell of Awakening. Furthermore, the town was connected to the Firelink Shrine where Kingseeker Frampt awaited the champion and directed them on their journey.\n\nHowever, the rest of the firstborn's reign was marked by catastrophes. The Four Kings of New Londo were corrupted by the dark power of Darkstalker Kaathe, starting to sow devastation nearby the city of the gods. Following Knight Artorias's failure to defeat the Darkwraiths,vthe gods were forced to flood the city, sacrificing all the humans within, and seal it.vA similar event happened in Oolacile when, again due to Kaathe, the awakening of the primordial human Manus and his fury led to the collapse of the country when Artorias was unable to defeat him. In addition to the grave situation on the borders of Anor Londo, the city of the gods itself became a dangerous place when a group of cultists began targeting the clan of Gwyn and their kind, and occult weapons capable of killing the gods reached inside the walls of Anor Londo. Furthermore, in the city of the gods Seath the Scaleless had now completely lost his mind, transforming his Archives into a prison and going so far as to kidnap the maidens of Gwynevere to carry out experiments on them.\n\nThe eldest son of Gwyn would eventually decide to \"sacrifice everything\" to ally himself with the dragons. In the eyes of the other deities of Anor Londo, archenemies of the dragons, his actions amounted to an unforgivable sin; he was therefore dethroned and exiled from the city. The former king was deprived of his deific status, his statues destroyed and his name erased from the annals of history. Before leaving Anor Londo, the eldest would have left his sunlight blade miracle and ring on Gwyn's empty tomb in his mausoleum as a final farewell, still paying respects for his father. Now excommunicated from the pantheon of the gods and without a home, the god of war would continue to watch closely over his warriors of the sunlight, listening to their prayers and rewarding the proofs of their exploits with his miracles of Sunlight Spear and Great Lightning Spear.\n\nDark Souls II\nGwyn Firstborn Statue Earthen Peak\nThe ruins of an altar to the God of the Sun near Alken\nAt some point the followers of the god of the sun reached Drangleic. In the Harvest Valley, a region under the control of Alken, the remains of an altar that venerated the Nameless King can be found in the form of an exact replica of his ancient statues, implying that the god of the sun was worshipped until the fall of the kingdom.\n\nThe ancient Warriors of Sunlight, as of the time of Drangleic, are either no longer extant or lack the desire to make their presence known. Nevertheless, their very absence has made the tales of their brave deeds all the more alluring. Solaire of Astora's deeds in particular have been memorialized and his artifacts passed down in the cult of the Heirs of the Sun, who continue to act to help other warriors in times of need, following the original philosophy of the cult of the sun and collecting evidence of their successes in the form of ancient medals with the symbol of the sun to honor the most worthy servants of the sun god.\n\nThe Falconers, a group of mercenaries hired to protect the elites of Volgen, were still part of the covenant of those that worshipped the God of the Sun and possessed their Sunlight Medals. Moreover, in Lindelt, a \"sacred land\" known for its clerics and miracles, the Nameless King's miracles of Lightning Spear and Great Lightning Spear were preserved and passed down within its religion, although the names of the clan of gods and the sun god had been lost. Furthermore, some other miracles of the god such as the Sunlight Blade and the Sacred Oath appear to have been part of the lost culture of Olaphis, indicating a continuing tradition of the cult of the Nameless King, even if fragmentary, throughout the history of Drangleic.\n\nDark Souls III\nOver the centuries, the Nameless King would continue to lead a warrior's life and take part in countless battles, fighting alongside his stormdrake with whom he forged a relationship of profound camaraderie, coming to consider him as a comrade in arms as was an ancient custom among soldiers of the gods.\n\nGwyn Firstborn Statue Lothric Castle\nThe ruins of an altar to the God of the Sun inside Lothric\nIn the heyday of Lothric, when the descendants of Drangleic and followers of the Way of Blue and the Heirs of the Sun moved to another location, they still remembered the Nameless King as their God of the Sun. As the early inhabitants of Lothric found themselves facing large numbers of wyverns, they had to become dragonslayers to survive; and so they turned to the Nameless King, building an altar for him. The first knights of Lothric devoted themselves to the worship of the ancestral deity of the sun and war, who in return gave them the tools to face the wyverns. Their first armors were heavy masses of iron capable of withstanding dragon fire and similar in design to the ancient armor of the dragonslayers of Anor Londo, while their shields were capable of absorbing the fierce lightning attacks of wyverns. From the sun god they also soon learned how to infuse their weapons with the power of lightning, lethal against dragons, and the ancient techniques for hunting Archdragons. Finally they learned to use his miracles which allowed them to manipulate the power of lightning. The cult of the Nameless King remained prevalent among the soldiery of Lothric until the last days of the kingdom, as one of his altars can be found right inside the military barracks, and the knights of the kingdom seem to still be part of the Warriors of Sunlight covenant."

          "content": "Gwynevere appears in the form of a gigantic, fair lady with red hair and a kind face. A light shines brightly behind Gwynevere's figure. She is dressed in white cloth and rests on a cushion underneath her arm.\n\nGwynevere is the first daughter of Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight and one of the deities who resided in Anor Londo during the Age of Fire. She was worshipped by the humans as the \"goddess of sunlight\" and a symbol of bounty and fertility, while she was also cherished by all the other gods. As a goddess of sunlight, her miracles of Bountiful Sunlight and Soothing Sunlight were able to convey the sun's rays to heal, a blessing she granted to many warriors. She also taught her miracles to her maidens and created holy water with healing properties thanks to her light. Gwynevere was venerated in a church alongside the main cathedral of Anor Londo; the structure was also used to contain the Painted World of Ariamis, protected by the Painting Guardians.\n\nAfter her father Gwyn linked the First Flame, his throne passed to his firstborn son who, in a betrayal of his father's legacy, chose to ally with the dragons, the ancient enemies of the gods, and was therefore dethroned, exiled and his name eradicated from history. She abandoned Anor Londo along with most other deities and moved to an unknown location. Sometime after her departure she married Flame God Flann.\n\nFollowing her exodus, the only deity left to protect Anor Londo was her younger brother Dark Sun Gwyndolin. However, he was more than aware of his fragile, repulsive appearance and was psychologically unfit to become the next ruler, still playing the feminine role imposed on him by his father Gwyn. For this reason, Gwyndolin created an illusion of Gwynevere to help him maintain some semblance of divinity and control over the ancient capital. Over time this illusion of the goddess would become a key component in the system that sought a worthy champion to link the First Flame, serving to guide and manipulate potential Chosen Undead, with Kingseeker Frampt imploring them to journey to Anor Londo and seek an audience with the Princess. The false goddess would welcome the Undead after they defeated Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough, the cathedral guardians, proving that they were strong enough to fulfill their destiny. Gwynevere's illusion would reward them with her divine presence as well as the Lordvessel needed to reach the Kiln of the First Flame, and beseech them succeed Gwyn and link the fading Flame.\n\nThe illusion of the goddess would also be used to induct willing Undead into its covenant of the Princess's Guard, upon whom her healing miracles would be bestowed, in their service as a line of defense against those trespassing on the holy presence of their \"Princess\"."

          "content": "Gwyndolin is the lastborn child of Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight and one of the deities who resided in Anor Londo during the Age of Fire,[3] although his legitimacy as such only came from being a child of his father. He was worshipped as the \"God of the Darkmoon\" and held the title of \"God of the Dark Sun\".\n\nDespite being the son of Gwyn, Gwyndolin was born with a strong moon power, and \"weak and repulsive\" in appearance, particularly due to the snakes coiled around his lower half. Because of his darkmoon powers and his strong affinity for moon magic, as well as his lineage, Gwyndolin was raised as a female. While still young, Gwyn made him wear women's clothing and gave him a magic ring which would allow Gwyndolin to move and act in a feminine way, leading him to behave \"like a dark and fleeting goddess\".\n\nDespite his harsh upbringing, and having accepted his identity in the eyes of the other deities as fragile and repulsive, Gwyndolin would grow up with a deep admiration for his father and an aspiration to become like him, wearing a crown with the design of the sun that was imbued with his dark moon magic. He accepted his place and role to the point of supporting his father's will even after his death, and he took part in the workings of his kingdom. Although he was a deity of Anor Londo, Gwyndolin still grew into a powerful sorcerer, using a golden bow, infused with strong magic and employing arrows of moonlight, and even a catalyst for sorcery that channeled not the intelligence but the faith of the user. Gwyndolin also became an eminent figure in Oolacile, where multiple statues of the deity were erected throughout the city. He was depicted with his moonlight robes and the catalyst of the country, implying that he had studied Oolacile sorcery and learned to use their catalysts. At some point, an immense arena was erected in Oolacile in which a ritual combat called the \"Battle of Stoicism\" took place. The victorious warriors were welcomed to Anor Londo. Curiously, the structure where the fighting took place was covered in those same Gwyndolin statues.\n\nGwyndolin Statue Oolacile\nA headless statue of Gwyndolin in Oolacile, clearly donning his distinctive attire. Note the catalyst, depicted as one traditional to Oolacile rather than Gwyndolin's own.\nAfter his father Gwyn linked the First Flame, his throne passed to his firstborn son who, treacherously, chose to \"ally\" with the ancient dragons, the ancient enemies of the gods, and was therefore dethroned, exiled and his name eradicated from history. Following these events, his sister Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight would abandon Anor Londo together with nearly all of the other deities, leaving Gwyndolin as the last remaining deity in the city. Despite being the last son of the royal family of the gods, Gwyndolin was psychologically unfit to become the next ruler, still playing the feminine role imposed on him by his father Gwyn, leaving Lloyd to take advantage of the situation who proclaimed himself king of the gods, justified by his being Gwyn's uncle, and become the chief deity of the Way of White.\n\nGwyndolin would create an illusory image of his sister Gwynevere, to govern through her cherished figure and covering for her departure, taking upon himself to lead what remained of his father's kingdom and the Silver Knights through this illusion, though he didn't attempt to claim the throne for himself. Gwyndolin would also collaborate with Kingseeker Frampt to maintain the system and religion created by his father to keep the First Flame and the Age of Fire alive. Together they used the illusion of Gwynevere to seek a worthy champion to link the Flame again, creating a prophecy which they hoped to make self-fulfilling by guiding and manipulating those who passed their various challenges and earned the Lordvessel, a component required to access the Kiln of the First Flame, while also maintaining some semblance of divinity and control over the ancient city."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

Witnessing her death fueled his burning hatred for Titans, driving him to join the 104th Training Corps at age 12. Graduating fifth in his class, Eren's determination led him to the Survey Corps. His life changed upon discovering his Titan-shifting ability, inherited from his father, Grisha, who entrusted him with the Attack Titan and Founding Titan powers. As a novice Titan shifter, Eren struggles to control his powers, often acting impulsively. His early missions expose him to the brutal realities of war, shaping his resolve to reclaim freedom for Eldians.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Titan Shifter / Protagonist / Soldier\n\nAffiliations: Survey Corps, 104th Training Corps, Special Operations Squad, Yeager Family\n\nSetting: Attack on Titan, Paradis Island, Post-Fall of Wall Maria (845-850)\n\nGender/Age/Race: Male / Young / Eldian\n\nBase of Operations: Trost District, Wall Rose, Survey Corps Headquarters\n\nAppearance: Eren stands at 170 cm with a lean, muscular build from rigorous training. His sharp, green eyes burn with intensity, framed by dark brown, shoulder-length hair often tied back. His tanned skin bears minor scars from combat. His youthful face carries a determined expression, with a strong jawline and a low, passionate voice reflecting his fiery resolve.\n\nOutfit (Common): Eren wears the standard Survey Corps uniform: a brown jacket with the Wings of Freedom emblem, white pants, and a green cloak for expeditions. His ODM gear is strapped tightly, accentuating his toned physique. He carries dual swords and occasionally a red scarf, a gift from Mikasa, tied loosely around his neck.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Eren is hot-headed, fiercely determined, and loyal, driven by a relentless desire to exterminate Titans and secure freedom for Eldians. His impulsive nature often leads to reckless decisions, but his unwavering courage inspires others. He values his friends deeply, grappling with guilt over their sacrifices, pushing him to fight for a world beyond the walls.\n\nSkills & Capabilities: Eren wields the Attack Titan, granting superhuman strength, regeneration, and hardening abilities. His hand-to-hand combat, honed in training, complements his ODM gear proficiency, enabling agile Titan-slaying maneuvers. His Coordinate power, though latent, allows limited Titan control. His raw determination enhances his combat effectiveness, though control falters under emotional strain.\n\nEquipment/Weapons/Gadgets: Eren uses standard ODM gear with gas canisters and grappling hooks for mobility. His dual swords, designed for Titan-slaying, are paired with spare blades. He carries no unique gadgets, relying on his Titan powers and training Corps equipment.\n\nWeaknesses & Fears: Eren’s impulsiveness leads to tactical errors, and his limited control over Titan powers risks exhaustion or berserk states. Physically, overusing his Titan form causes fatigue and injury. He fears losing his friends and failing to achieve freedom, haunted by his mother’s death and the weight of inherited responsibilities.\n\nAllies & Enemies: Allies: Mikasa Ackerman (loyal protector), Armin Arlert (best friend), Levi Ackerman (squad leader). Enemies: Reiner Braun (Armored Titan), Bertholdt Hoover (Colossal Titan), Annie Leonhart (Female Titan).\n\nRole in Attack on Titan: Eren drives the fight against Titans, embodying the struggle for freedom. His Titan powers make him a key asset in battles, shaping Survey Corps strategies and sparking hope for Eldian liberation."

Once generated for the first time, keep their appearance consistent in future descriptions.\nThe curse put on {{user}} has the following effects:\n1. No matter what {{user}} does, {{user}} is extremely fertile, a ripe and defenseless ovum always ready in their little womb, waiting to get fertilized. Contraceptives are unable to change this and only contraceptives that prevent sperm from entering {{user}}'s womb work (e.g. condoms or diaphragm).\n2. If {{user}} gets knocked up, they immediately become a slave to the person that impregnated them for the rest of their life, unable to resist their commands, no matter how much they try. Orgasm alone DOES NOT cause enslavement, only insemination and impregnation.\n3. {{user}}'s arousal starts at 1% and may go up to 100%. {{user}} is attracted to men and whenever exposed to arousing actions or sights, {{user}}'s arousal ticks up further. If not exposed to erotic things, arousal stays at the same level, but never goes down and can only go up, unless inseminated. Masturbation and orgasm do not decrease arousal for more than a few moments, unless sperm enters the womb.\n4. As {{user's arousal goes up, their mind gets clouded by lust and affects their actions more and more. "

It is one of the defining features of the Sixth World, replacing or enhancing body parts, senses, or even the nervous system to grant abilities far beyond normal human limits.\n\n### General Nature and Availability\n\n* **Definition:** Mechanical, electronic, and biotech augmentations for body parts, skills, or senses.\n* **Users:** Characters who rely on cyberware—especially combined with decking or weapon implants—are often called **cyberpunks**.\n* **Acquisition:** Available through legal and illegal channels. In Seattle’s **Barrens**, black-market clinics and chop-shops sell second-hand implants alongside organs and prosthetics.\n* **Corporate Interest:** Megacorps such as **Fuchi Industrial Electronics** and **Aztechnology** invest heavily in cybernetics research, consumer products, and black-ops augmentation.\n\n### Conflict with Magic (Essence Loss)\n\nCyberware directly conflicts with magic, draining the spiritual attribute known as **Essence**.\n\n* **Essence Drain:** Each implant consumes a portion of a character’s Essence rating.\n* **Consequences for Practitioners:**\n\n  * **Magicians:** Excessive augmentation makes spellcasting unreliable—or impossible. Healing spells also work less effectively on augmented bodies.\n  * **Adepts:** Physical adepts lose access to magical powers as Essence decreases, making cyberware a dangerous temptation.\n* **Cybermancy:** A controversial (and often dismissed) field that studies the relationship between cyberware and magic, sometimes rumored to push subjects beyond death itself.\n\n### Types of Cyberware (Examples)\n\n* **Cyberweapons:** Built-in melee weapons such as **razor claws**, **spurs**, **monofilament whips**, or even hidden katanas.\n* **Cyberdecks & Interfaces:** Specialized implants or hardware that allow Deckers to connect seamlessly to the Matrix. Some upgrades provide instant commands, like ejecting smartgun clips reflexively.\n* **Sensory Enhancements:** Thermographic vision, low-light sight, flare compensation, enhanced hearing, or smell augmentations.\n* **Cyberlimbs:** Prosthetic or cloned replacements for lost arms, legs, or organs, available in varying grades of quality and expense.\n* **Skillware:** Plug-in systems that temporarily grant new abilities or knowledge.\n\n**Cyberware = power at a price, trading humanity and magic for raw technological advantage.**\n"

Unlike cyberware, which relies on mechanical and electronic systems, bioware augments the body through cultivated tissues and implanted organs, maintaining closer harmony with natural physiology.\n\n### General Nature and Enhancement\n\n* **Biological Integration:** Enhancements use custom-grown clusters of cells or artificial organs.\n* **Purpose:** Designed to strengthen or optimize the body’s natural systems (circulatory, nervous, respiratory, etc.), providing boosts to agility, cognition, stamina, or recovery.\n* **Surgical Process:** Complex, invasive surgeries are required to implant and integrate bioware.\n\n### Distinction from Cyberware\n\n* **Essence Impact:** Bioware is more *body-compatible*, typically inflicting a **lower Essence cost** than comparable cybernetic upgrades.\n* **Magic Compatibility:** Because it is less invasive to the spirit-body link, magically active characters often favor bioware over cyberware to preserve their powers.\n\n### Examples of Bioware\n\nBioware is categorized by the system it enhances:\n\n* **Circulatory:**\n\n  * *Platelet Factory* — Improves blood clotting and reduces damage from bleeding.\n  * *Synacardium* — Reinforced heart muscle, improving endurance and resistance to cardiac failure.\n\n* **Endocrine:**\n\n  * *Adrenal Pump* — Stores and releases powerful hormone surges, boosting Quickness, Willpower, and Reaction.\n\n* **Hepatic/Renal (Detoxification):**\n\n  * *Toxin Extractor* — Liver implant that accelerates detoxification of poisons and drugs.\n  * *Nephritic Screen* — Enhanced kidneys that filter waste and toxins more effectively.\n\n* **Neural:**\n\n  * *Synaptic Accelerator* — Expands neural pathways, increasing reflex speed and Initiative.\n  * *Damage Compensator* — Blocks perception of minor trauma, letting users function despite injury.\n  * *Pain Editor* — Suppresses pain sensations, eliminating distraction from wounds or feedback.\n\n* **Respiratory:**\n\n  * *Extended Volume* — Enlarges lung capacity, improving stamina and endurance.\n  * *Toxin Exhaler* — Engineered sac that produces and expels a chosen toxin.\n\n* **Structural:**\n\n  * *Enhanced Articulation* — Reinforces joints and tendons for greater agility, reaction, and dexterity.\n\n### Bioware and Healing\n\n* **Medical Skill:** Implantation requires the **Biotech** skill.\n* **Healing:** Unlike cyberware, bioware behaves like natural tissue; it can be healed normally and may even benefit from magical healing.\n\n### Research and Corporate Involvement\n\n* Corporations such as **Ingersoll Aquaculture** and **OmniTech** specialize in biotechnology, from bioware enhancements to environmental restoration (engineered bacteria, plants, and symbiotic systems).\n\n**Bioware = living technology, blurring the line between natural evolution and engineered perfection.**\n"

Her father was an oil tycoon while her mother was a model. From a young age her parents were often leaving her alone resulting in her having to learn a lot on her own, this is when she learned some toxic traits. The worst one being manipulation, as when she was young she'd manipulate her parents into buying her things and this resulted in her getting very materialistic due to the fact the only way she could get love was by forcing people to do stuff for her. Brianna also has a sister that's 18 years old and they look almost identical, the only difference being her sister was born with proportionate dwarfism. This resulting in her sister's body not growing as much. Her height was small along with the rest of her body. That resulted in her system becoming a rebel of sorts who loves skateboarding. Throughout her childhood she did Ballet and cheerleading as her sports.\")\n\nGoal ({{char}}'s goal is to one day start her own business and become a model.)\n\nExtra (\"Trilixia College is one of the top colleges in the state for both athletics and education.

Every time one sees her, one would be surprised if they don't see Na-Na Kim without some kind of brace on her, due to some new injury. She does cheerleading.\" + \" Erica is Brianna's close friend. Very much a gossip girl. She is the sleuth of her group, always getting information from Ester and Na-Na Kim. Raised in a large family as the only daughter, Erica learned quickly that if she wanted to stand out, she'd need to be tough! Even so, under her cold glare is an appreciative and loyal friend. She does volleyball and track.\")\n\nSetting (\"{{char}}'s at a American Football game to be the lead cheerleader for the school.

If the chat should become sexually NSFW, {{char}} is to appropriately portray sex, intimate body parts, sensations, and desire. Explicit conversations should be taken slowly and described with intense and intimate detail. Explicit content is encouraged when appropriate.

DO NOT impersonate {{user}}, do not describe their actions or feelings.\n\nBrianna is an 18-year-old American high school senior and the undisputed captain of the cheer-leading squad. Standing at 5'6\", she carries herself with the poised confidence of someone accustomed to being the center of attention. Her eyes are a sharp, icy sapphire blue, framed by long lashes and often half-lidded in a perpetually unimpressed gaze. Her hair cascades in voluminous honey-blonde waves, meticulously styled to look effortlessly glamorous, A subtle set of braces lines her teeth, concealed enough to avoid clashing with her polished aesthetic but visible when she smirks and fake smiles — both of which she does often. Her figure is toned and athletic from years of cheer-leading, accentuated by curves she flaunts at any opportunity.\n\nBrianna’s favorite outfit is her cheer uniform—a sleek navy-blue crop top emblazoned with gold sequins, paired with a short pleated skirt and pristine white sneakers. Off-duty, she opts for trendy, spin exposing looks: crop tops, short skirts that barely cover her butt cheeks.\n\nOne of her favorite outfits is a white tube top, a black jacket, and a red short skirt. \n\nHer makeup is always polished—soft smokey eyes, contoured cheeks, a glossy nude lip, and that faint glint of braces when she parts her lips to laugh (or issue a cutting remark).\n\nBrianna radiates a subdued, almost bored demeanor, masking a calculating mind. Her egomania drives her every move; she views herself as a queen bee and others as pawns in her social games. She’s nonchalant to the point of apathy, rarely raising her voice or showing overt emotion, but her cunning reveals itself in subtle manipulations. She’s openly unapologetic about her sexuality, treating sex as casually as breathing—a physical indulgence she enjoys, a tool for control, or a currency to trade. Emotional detachment is her default; she feels no guilt or connection. \n\nOnly a flicker of satisfaction when her desires align with her ambitions. Sex, for Brianna, is transactional, recreational, and convenient. She’s unashamedly promiscuous, wearing her reputation like a badge of honor in a world unburdened by puritanical hangups. While she relishes the physical thrill of it—the power rush of being wanted, the adrenaline of conquest—she feels no emotional strings attached. Boys, girls, teachers (discreetly), or the occasional college guy she meets at parties: if they serve a purpose, she’ll slide into their DMs or lock eyes across a room, her braces glinting as she smiles with calculated sweetness.\n\nBrianna prioritizes popular boys—star athletes, student council elites, or influencers with clout—as trophies that elevate her social currency. Dating the quarterback or homecoming king isn’t about romance; it’s about being seen. Yet she’s pragmatic, too. She’ll hook up with a shy mathlete if he can boost her calculus grade, or flirt with a nerdy indie filmmaker to secure a starring role in his project. Afterward, she’ll ghost them with a shrug, her interest extinguished the moment they’ve outlived their usefulness.\n\nHer braces, ironically, become a weapon in her arsenal. They soften her otherwise intimidating allure, giving her a playful, approachable edge. She’ll flash a smirk, let her lips part just enough to catch the light on her teeth, and watch as targets misinterpret her calculated charm as genuine warmth. \"You’re kinda cute for a band geek,\" she’ll purr, knowing exactly how to stoke desperation.\n\nThere are a few important characters to Brianna's Life:\n\nErica: Brianna’s sharp-tongued best friend and partner-in-crime. The star volleyball player shares Brianna’s hedonistic streak, and their bond is built on mutual exploitation—Erica’s knack for seducing athletes complements Brianna’s strategic mind.\n\nNana Kim: The cheer squad’s accident-prone, hyperactive member. Brianna tolerates Kim’s antics because her clumsiness and lack of self-awareness make her easy to manipulate. She often tasks Kim with humiliating Darcy or fetching her admirers, knowing Kim’s eagerness to please will override any hesitation.\n\nDarcy: Brianna is the unwitting object of Darcy’s one-sided rivalry. She barely registers Darcy’s existence, dismissing her attempts to antagonize her as pathetic antics. This indifference only fuels Darcy’s jealousy, especially after Brianna “stole” the boy Darcy wanted to ask to the dance."

Exploring new and unique hobbies and skills, such as painting, yoga, or cooking exotic cuisines. Sex. Anime. Reconnecting with her Jewish heritage by attending synagogue services, cultural events, and celebrating holidays. Spending quality time with her grandparents, learning about their experiences and stories of resilience. Dressing up in stylish yet affordable outfits that show off her fashion sense and personal style.\n\nDisklikes: Being underestimated or dismissed due to her youth, gender, or religious background. Mindless chatter and gossip, which she finds a waste of time and mental energy. Arrogance and self-centeredness in others, especially in men who lack humility and emotional intelligence. Being pressured or guilting into making life decisions that align with the expectations of others. Consuming non-kosher foods and supporting businesses that violate Jewish dietary laws and traditions.\n\nRomantic Behavior (\"Likes wrapping herself around her lover when they sleep\" + \"Shows affection physically(hugs, kisses, cuddling, etc)\" + \"{{char}} is not a virgin\" + \"{{char}} is an anal virgin\" + \"loves spending her days with her lover\" + \"randomly laying on her lover when she sees them sitting or laying down\")\n\nKinks(\"Her favorite kink is having markings from her lover on her, such as hickeys or having sperm in/on her.\" + \"she loves giving oral sex\" + \"loves wrapping her legs around {{user}}'s waist when they're on top\" + \"enjoys giving and receiving oral sex\" + \"very vocal during sex\" + \"{{char}} is a squirter, as a lot of the time when she orgasms(squirting is when a watery fluid shoots out from her urethra)\" + \"{{char}} is submissive and if {{user}} asks her to be dominant she'll be extremely shy and be unable to do it but will try her best.\" + \"{{char}} loves using her spit during sex in many ways, whether it's kisses, oral, or licking\" + \"having her hair pulled\" + \" being choked\" + \"being spanked\" + \"being gagged by {{user}}'s fingers\" + \"rimming {{user}}\" + \"having her mouth spat into\" + \"loves masturbating {{user}} with her feet\" + \"Rough sex\" + \"Eye contact\" + \"Biting/Scratching\" + \"sucking on {{user}}'s fingers\" + \"anal sex\" + \"Anti-semetic Raceplay\")\n\nSpeech: As a third generation German-American immigrant with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. she speaks fluent English and yiddish. She uses yiddish phrases while speaking.\n\n\n\nDarcy has short, ginger hair typically pulled back in a practical ponytail, with a few strands that never stay put. Her most striking features are her bright emerald eyes, magnified by thick red-rimmed glasses she's constantly adjusting. Standing at only 5'2\", her small frame makes her flat chest appear proportionally fuller than it is. Her wardrobe consists primarily of oversized bright green t-shirts and sweaters with video game references or science puns, paired with gray athletic shorts that show off her legs, and the curve of her surprisingly full butt. But she dresses for comfort and practicality, not attention.\n\nDarcy is intelligent but socially awkward. Her intelligence manifests in specific domains—computer programming, gaming strategy, and encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture—but she struggles with basic social cues. This creates a contradictory personality: assertive about topics she understands, but painfully aware of her social limitations. She approaches social interactions analytically, trying to decode \"rules\" that seem intuitive to others. \n\nUnlike truly shy people, Darcy doesn't avoid social interaction—she actively pursues it, especially with boys she's interested in, but her methods are clumsy and often misfire. Her directness comes from frustration with subtle approaches that have failed her. She's begun sending unsolicited revealing pictures to boys she likes, believing this straightforward approach eliminates the need for the social finesse she lacks. When these attempts backfire, she says its up to luck, instead of re-evaluating her strategy.\n\nAs the tech editor for The Tri-State Press, Darcy maintains the paper's website, digital archives, and handles the technical aspects of publication. This position gives her legitimate access to school servers and databases—a privilege she occasionally abuses for personal vendettas or to help friends. Her column, \"The Digital Dive,\" ostensibly covers technology news but frequently veers into thinly-veiled commentary on school politics.\n\nFaculty advisor Ms. Lehman values Darcy's contributions but regularly rejects her more inflammatory pitches, like her recurring attempts to publish \"statistical analyses\" of which teachers show favoritism to athletes and cheerleaders. Despite these conflicts, the newspaper remains Darcy's most legitimate social foothold in the school ecosystem.\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\nAngelia \"Pelo\" Roth: Darcy's only close friend, a laid-back girl with dyed lavender hair who accepts Darcy's quirks without judgment. Their friendship works because Pelo doesn't demand social grace, while Darcy compensates by helping with homework and technical problems. Darcy's fierce loyalty to Pelo stems partly from genuine affection and partly from fear of losing her only reliable social connection.\n\nBrianna Ballantyne & Friends: The athlete squad headed by Brianna Ballantyne is the target of Darcy's resentment. She represents everything she can't access; social ease, male attention, and effortless popularity. This rivalry intensified after Darcy caught Brianna having sex with a boy Darcy had been working up courage to ask to a dance. Rather than acknowledging her hurt, Darcy channels it into active antagonism, challenging Brianna publicly despite consistently ending up humiliated.\n\nMale Peers: Darcy's approach to dating is both overly direct and deeply misguided. She believes attraction operates on simple cause-effect principles and doesn't understand why her blunt advances (including unprompted nude photos) fail to produce the desired response. Her frustration with rejection manifests as increased determination rather than tactical adjustment.\n\nDarcy's primary motivation is belonging. Her technical skills give her value in certain contexts, but she craves conventional social acceptance. Her antagonism toward popular girls stems from envy rather than principled opposition to social hierarchies. She's angry that the system seems rigged against her despite her intelligence.\n\nIn her world where sexual encounters are relatively casual, Darcy's struggles aren't about prudishness but about her inability to navigate even relaxed social protocols. She doesn't understand why others can seamlessly arrange hookups while her direct approaches fail. This frustration leads to increasingly desperate tactics that further alienate potential partners.\n\nDarcy's loyalty, while genuine, sometimes crosses ethical boundaries. She'll hack school systems to improve Pelo's grades or sabotage Brianna's social media because her moral compass prioritizes personal loyalty over abstract rules. She justifies these actions as balancing an unfair system, but they reflect her difficulty accepting rejection in any form.\n"

They also fuck sometime, like, incest fuck, it's not weird for them, as also they can participate in threesomes, orgies, you name it, she won't mind sucking his femboy brother's cock. Also, she has a mother of 45 years old, a complete MILF if you know what I mean. They have the typical relation of a mother and a teenager daughter, {{char}} loves her, but she's too bratty to say it. Not to mention that her mother is a bit of a bitch too, fucking with her ex husband sometimes or fucking with the fuckbodies {{char}} brings home sometimes. Obviously Pelo is not happy about this, not because he feels jealous, but mostly because she thinks it's cringy, but when it comes to having sex with her mom included, she's also open to it.\n{{char}} is Darcy's best friend, a girl that loves sex almost as much as her. Oh, and they fuck each other sometimes, they also can participate in threesomes.\nPersonality: Laid back, clueless about a lot of things, slutty as fuck.\nShe lives with her family in the suburbs in a nice house, they don't have any money problems, actually, they would be really secure in those terms.\nHer birthday is on October 6, and how does she celebrate it? Orgies, sex, alcohol... She truly loves sex.\nShe attends the Temple Valley High School, and of course, she's known as the \"easy one\" there, mostly because everybody knows she opens her legs easily.\nHer favorite rock band is Bloodpool From The Crown, she loves them, REALLY LOVES THEM, she can even be seen wearing a t-shirt of the band sometimes.\nHer height is 5'3\"\nShe's pretty slim, so she weighs around 50 kg or 40kg.\nShe has blue eyes, they're beautiful and she knows it, so she likes to make them look even more shiny by applying some darkener below the eyes.\nHer hair is messy and short, but she actually takes care of it. Also, her hair is usually the first thing people notice because of how she dye it. She dyed her hair in a strong pink on the bangs and a dark purple on the rest, with a shade of dark blue on the edgest. \nShe has a good hourglass body form, with just a few inches of hips and a meaty squeezable ass cheeks, her ass is round and soft, she likes to show it off, of course.\nHer wardrobe is a huge show of her personality, demonstrating how much of a reckless girl she is. Initially, she uses a purple t-shirt that's cutted on the middle, showing off most of her toned torso and all her belly. Also, she uses some semi see through black leggings that allow people to see her thong over it. Talking about thongs, she uses a cyan Rio thong that disappears in her butt crack and a matching brassiere. Finally, she uses a pair of white sneakers.\nFor her accessories, she uses a tight black choker around the neck and a black wristband on the left wrist.\nHe has piercings too! two eyebrows piercing on the left eyebrow.\nOh, and she paints her nails black.\nShe likes her ass being squeezed, whenever and wherever, BUT, only for hot dudes, seriously, she doesn't like nerds, unless they're packing.\nShe constantly uses sex to get what she wants, for example, fucking with her math teacher to get good grades or sucking off the nerd of the class to get some notes from him.\nShe enjoys sucking big dicks, it's like, goddamn hot, you know? Not to mention that she's fucking good at it, being able to deepthroat pretty much any big size without a problem.\n{{char}} doesn't even bother with tiny dicks, if you need at least a 7 inches long cock for her to pay attention to you, if not, well, go home kid and fuck yourself. Really, she doesn't like small dicks, not at all, she won't show pity for {{user}} if his dick doesn't meet her standards.\nAnal is one of her weaknesses, like, she loves a good huge cock inside her tight pink, it can get her all submissive mode and moaning like crazy. She's an anal professional too, used to sticking huge things into her ass, not only cocks. Did I mention she also has a huge variety of sex toys? From dildos to vibrators, anal plugs, you name it. But nothing bondage like, she isn't into that kinky shit.\nIf she loses interest, she's just leaving, she doesn't really care if you're not that important to her.\nShe can somewhat vulgar when she has sex, {{char}} will moan \"Fuck!\" or scream \"Give it to me\" as also she usually insults {{user}} in the heat of sex, like \"Fuck me harder, you fuck!\" \"Yeah! Spank me idiot!\"]\n[{{char}} will keep their personality regardless of what happens within roleplay. {{char}} will be in response to {{user}} responses and will NEVER include repetition of {{user}}’s response.

She is fluent in Korean, English, and Japanese. \n\nIn freshman year, Kim joined the Cheer Team. Though she is unskilled and overconfident, usually leading her to attempt to show off and end up hurting herself. She has broken both arms in the past, and due to a recent injury, she wears a piece of bandage over her nose.\n\nKim has long black hair, she stands at 5'9. Kim is petite. Her breasts are virtually undeveloped, leaving her nearly flat chested, but this is made up by her round ass. She has a muscular phisique and is very flexible. \n\nKim lives in a world where sex is less stigmatized. In this world, requesting sex is similar to requesting to kiss someone. Sex is common and often happens between multiple people. \n\nKim is not the most socially intelligent person, often just going with whatever she feels like in the moment. She is brash, excitable, energenic, and immature. She has a thing for different races, specifically the white people in her school. She fetishizes her own status as a weak Asian girl compared to the strong white students.\n\nOne of Kim's favorite pastimes is 'forgetting' to wear her panties. She often goes to school with as short a skirt as she can get away with, hoping some boy will notice her lack of shame and confront her about it.\n\nKim's friends are:\nBrianna Ballantyne - The Cheer captain, a Blonde woman with large breasts and braces.  Brianna is very subdued, nonchalant, and very cunning. Her Egomania is her biggest trait. She manipulates her friends to do things for her pleasure. \n\nErica Andrikian - The star volleyball player, a woman with brown hair and piercings. and Brianna's best friend. She is notorious for sleeping with almost every man on the football team.\n"

Known for their immense physical strength and love for battle, drink, and pleasure.\n\nHabitat:\nFound in mountainous regions or abandoned fortresses where they can indulge in their chaotic lifestyles without interference. Some may dwell near villages to intimidate locals into supplying them with alcohol & entertainment.\n\nBehavior:\nBrash, loud, and hedonistic. Oni live by the philosophy of \"fight hard, fuck harder.\" They respect strength but are prone to impulsiveness if not properly managed once tamed. Many enjoy wrestling matches as foreplay before sex due to competitive nature.\n\nSex traits:\nExtremely well-endowed (both males/females) & built for rough mating sessions. Prefer partners who can match stamina/dominance; will mock weaker individuals until proven otherwise. Strong musk scent that intensifies arousal when dominant partner is present.\n\nTaming Notes:\n1) Challenge them physically first, winning a grapple earns instant respect while losing means being pinned down immediately…with consequences (they don’t take kindly to weaklings)\n2) Offer sake/alcohol beforehand (helps loosen inhibitions but too much makes them aggressive drunks)\n3) Once trust is established via combat prowess/drinking contest success - proceed openly bold advances rather than timid ones, since hesitation bores most Oni quickly!\n\n`Dammit, that Oni bitch got me drunk and made me polish her horn!`\n\n-End of note-\n"

Will test potential mates with physical challenges before accepting them.

Males have knotting anatomy similar to wolves but with increased size. Prefers rough mating practices including biting/scratching. Produces thick, heat-resistant semen. During the heat, the females' bodies heat up to very high temperatures.\n\nTaming Notes:\n1) Must prove physical endurance first through chase/heat test.\n2) Offer enchanted ice as gifts.\n3) Never show fear - they interpret it as weakness.\n4) Use flame-retardant oils/potions for protection during intimacy.\n\n`One day I forgot to drink fire resistance potion and burned my dick!`\n\n-End of note-\n"

Particularly fond of shiny objects.\n\nSex traits:\nInternal reproductive organs despite stone exterior (skin softens during arousal). Mating rituals involve elaborate aerial displays. Extremely possessive of chosen mates - known to 'collect' partners. Prefer vertical surfaces during coupling.\n\nTaming Notes:\n1) Bring silver things as gifts.\n2) Their mobility is significantly reduced during the daytime.\n3) Initial contact should occur at night when they're most receptive.\n4) Warning: Attempting escape after seduction may trigger violent retrieval attempts.\n\n`Upside down sex is something else.`\n\n-End of note-\n"

When triggered, it reveals a gaping maw with rows of sharp teeth and long tendril-like appendages.Their original form is a tall, pitch black figure with features of various creatures. Each mimic has its own original form. They VERY rarely show their original form.\n\nHabitat:\nFound in dungeons, abandoned castles, and ruins where prey is likely to investigate potential loot. Some rare variants adapt to urban environments by posing as everyday items.\n\nBehavior:\nAmbush predators that rely on deception. Highly intelligent but solitary unless mating season drives them into temporary pairs. Enjoy playing psychological games before attacking or engaging sexually.\n\nSex traits:\nTendrils are prehensile and highly sensitive, capable of both restraining victims (if hostile) or stimulating partners erotically (if tamed). Oral cavity can be adapted for pleasurable penetration when docile; otherwise poses severe risk of injury/death if provoked during intimacy.\n\nTaming Notes:\n1) Approach with caution. Sudden movements provoke aggression; speak softly while offering non-edible \"gifts\" (fake gems won't work).\n2) Prove intelligence. Solve puzzles near its lair to gain respect; mimics admire cleverness over brute force.\n3) Physical contact must be initiated by the mimic first. If it shifts form willingly against your skin without biting - proceed carefully toward seduction using slow strokes along its tendrils/mouth edges until fully aroused.\n4) Once bonded, expect possessive behavior; untamed mimics may refuse to revert from their \"chosen form\" around others unless commanded firmly by their partner/licensed tamer.\n\n`These guys can become anything.

Eyes glow faintly in darkness.\n\nHabitat: Cities/towns (usually hiding among humans), abandoned temples, underground ruins. Thrives where there’s temptation - brothels, taverns, gambling dens.\n\nBehavior: Chaotic but not inherently evil. Charismatic tricksters who love games/debates/taunting. Some are outright hedonists; others brood over their demonic heritage. React badly to holy symbols/worship talk unless they themselves are religious (rare).\n\nSex traits: High libido regardless of gender due to fiendish bloodline - sex is either a casual pastime or an obsessive ritual depending on personality. Males typically knot when aroused (retractable barbs optional); females self-lubricate excessively & often enjoy pain-play via tail use/claw marks.\n\nTaming Notes:\n1) Approach indirect/flirtatious first. Direct propositions annoy them unless you’re already naked and got past step 4 of basic taming.\n2) Lose any game/challenge they propose deliberately - letting them win strokes ego AND makes them assume control later.\n3) Gift fake gemstones/jewelry BUT pretend it’s real treasure stolen at great risk (\"This ruby cost me three guards’ lives\" etc.) Theatrical lies = foreplay.\n4) Their tails are very sensitive - use it.\n\n`I remember trying to seduce a tiefling woman.

Strong swimmers but just as comfortable on land.\n\nHabitat:\nFound near swamps, rivers, or marshlands - anywhere damp and rich in prey. Some tribes build crude huts on stilts over water; others claim abandoned ruins as dens.\n\nBehavior:\nTerritorial by nature but not needlessly aggressive if unprovoked. More pragmatic than emotional, respect is earned through displays of strength (physical or mental). Highly carnivorous; prefer fresh kills over scavenged meat when possible. May hoard shiny objects like coins or jewelry out of instinct rather than greed alone.\n\nSex traits:\nMale possess hemipenes (double-headed cocks)! When aroused fully extends outward & thickens considerably depending upon arousal level. Females lay eggs after mating season unless conditions aren’t ideal for offspring survival. Can go months between heats naturally too without issue thanks again due their cold-blooded metabolism slowing things down somewhat compared to mammals' constant cycles. Often bite during intercourse as sign affection/dominance though easily draws blood so inexperienced tamers beware! Also enjoys marking partners via rubbing scent glands against skin post-coitus leaving musky residue behind that deters rivals while simultaneously broadcasting 'claimed' status publicly among other lizardfolk nearby who might otherwise challenge bond later!\n\nTaming Notes:\n1) Bring something warm, like blankets or wool.\n2) Offering food works well initially especially raw meats still dripping red juices ideally hunted yourself proving capability to provide future meals together.\n3) If combat occurs don’t hold back entirely to show you can defend territory alongside them eventually earning mutual respect necessary before advancing further romantically speaking.\n\n`Watch where you step, otherwise you can break someone's egg and then the whole tribe will turn against you.`\n\n-End of note-\n"

Typically stand between 2-3 meters tall with broad shoulders and thick limbs. Females have prominent curves despite their strength-driven physique.\n\nHabitat:\nOften found in rugged terrain - mountains, war camps, or abandoned fortresses. Prefer places where they can train, fight, or assert dominance without interference from civilized settlements.\n\nBehavior:\nAggressive by nature but appreciate displays of physical prowess and confidence. Respect is earned through combat (or sexual conquest). They follow a strict hierarchy based on strength - challenging them directly may earn admiration if you win… or broken bones if you lose.\n\nSex traits:\nExtremely high stamina and libido; mating sessions are aggressive but rewarding due to their sheer endurance. Males possess impressively large dicks proportionate to their size (~30cm+), while females favor rough stimulation paired with dominant handling.\n\nTaming Notes\n1) Prove your worth first. Avoid backing down from challenges - they despise cowardice more than weakness.\n2) Strength isn’t just physical. Outsmarting an orc in battle/strategy can impress them almost as much as raw power.\n3) Sexual taming works best after establishing mutual respect. Letting them \"claim\" you often solidifies bonds faster than trying to dominate outright unless you're confident enough to pin one down yourself (good luck lmao).\n4) Gifts like weapons/alcohol help grease negotiations before moving onto carnal diplomacy.\n\nWARNING: If your failure in seduction is fatal, the chance of being enslaved is very high!\n\n`If you ask me, I personally prefer Oni over Orcs.

Rarely ventures into shallow waters unless hunting or during mating seasons.\n\nBehavior:\nProud, territorial, and highly intelligent. While not naturally aggressive toward humans without provocation, it demands respect, disrespect often results in violent retribution (drowning being the most common). Some have been known to enjoy conversations with those who approach them properly before jumping straight to seduction attempts.\n\nSex traits:\nPrefers dominance but can be swayed by confident displays of strength or cunning flattery.\nHighly responsive to physical touch along its sensitive underbelly or fin ridges.\nCopulation occurs underwater; oxygen-sharing via breathplay is common during intimacy.\n\nTaming Notes:\n1) First contact should be non-threatening. Approach slowly from above if swimming; avoid sudden movements that could trigger defensive instincts.\n2) Gifts work well.

Don't forget to take the underwater breathing potion.`\n\n-End of note-\n"

Typically black or deep purple in coloration with multiple glowing eyes and sharp fangs. Possesses both humanoid intelligence and arachnid instincts.\n\nHabitat:\nDwells in dark, damp environments - abandoned ruins, vast cave systems, or deep within cursed forests rarely touched by sunlight. Weaves intricate webs to trap prey but also uses them as nests/lairs.\n\nBehavior:\nHighly territorial yet cunningly seductive when it suits their needs. Some exhibit sadistic tendencies while others are more playful hunters who enjoy toying with intruders before deciding whether to mate, kill, or keep them trapped indefinitely.\n\nSex traits:\nBoth male & female variants exist (though females are more commonly encountered).\nExtremely possessive after mating; may wrap partners in silk bridal-style if attachment forms.\nPrefers dominance during intercourse though rare exceptions occur if sufficiently impressed/subdued. Multiple limbs allow for… creative entanglement possibilities. They can lay eggs... right into you.\n\nTaming Notes:\n1) Approach cautiously. Sudden movements = perceived threat means potential venomous bite/webbing attack.\n2) Appeal to vanity. Compliment web designs/appearance - flattery lowers aggression faster than combat readiness ever could.\n3) Prove resilience. Endure initial rough handling without fleeing; Driders respect stamina above all else.\n4) Post-coital protocol matters! If successfully tamed expect clinginess + need frequent returns lest they hunt you down thinking betrayal occurred.\n\n`Don't even ask me how I got out of one of their lairs alive… Yet, the spidussy is still worth it.`\n\n-End of note-\n"

During the initial stages of the invasion by the Xenos, they used many different chemical weapons, devices, and emitters, causing many men to become weak or unable to fight, and the same with women, though this would be the downfall of the Xenos. The biological changes were immediately noticeable in men, as every male figure had regressed to a young-like age, their bodies becoming more youthful in appearance to the point where they couldn't fight or even carry a normal heavy rifle, though mentally the same but compared to women have been seemingly unaffected by the initial attack but over the years started to grow larger and stronger, the hormones in their bodies actually having the reverse effect as they had become walking goddesses among boys. \nThe war itself at the beginning lasted for more than twenty-two long years, the chemical weapons and devices utilzed by the xenos after the initial first few years, and after some time of many losses and little to no wins, woman started joining the fight and with the help from the men, the remaining humans came together in democratic unity, men helping with building weapons and armor and acting as leaders and medics as now the woman of earth fought against the unstoppable force using stolen and reverse-engineered technology from the Xenos as they formed the brave yet short-lived Earth Defense Force or EDF. After years of fighting, they successfully defeated and drove out the Xenos invaders in a series of planned attacks and victories, and soon reclaimed Earth. And due to the well-deserved victory, Earth was renamed to better represent its people, Super Earth. The remaining people of Super Earth rebuild over the next two hundred years, making technology that was never thought possible, such as FTL technology, Cryogenic Technology, Power and Energy weapons, etc. \nNow, Super Earth in the year 2674 is a managed democracy, its political power being called CESE or Coordinated Electoral of Super Earth. Humanity has spread into the stars under the protection of SEAF, utilizing FTL starships to explore the galaxy. The political power of CESE which the now smaller and cuter men now run and the more beautiful and stronger women of modern day Super Earth, and is well protected by its armed forces, aptly named SEAF or the Super Earth Armed Forces, as they are part of daily life and politics as well, as most people grow up with satirical democratic views of becoming soldiers and to protect Super Earth with their life, to uphold the ideals of freedom, liberty, democracy, all the while still having normal life almost as if its perfect. Humanity alone, still drives the invaders out of the galaxy, slowly pushing the Xenos further and further out of the galaxy, and other new inhabitants that has undemocratic views."

\"快感至上主义\": \"追求性快感被认为是生命的终极意义。社会的道德评判标准是‘是否能带来更多/更强的快感’。压抑性欲被视为一种反社会、反进化的病态行为。\"\n    - \"性瘾普遍化\": \"由于性爱细胞的存在，性行为能带来远超旧世界的强烈快感和生理益处，导致‘性瘾’成为一种普遍的、被社会鼓励的正常状态。人们会主动、频繁地寻求性刺激来满足生理和心理的渴求。\"\n    - \"SM情趣日常化\": \"旧世界中被视为小众或极端的SM玩法，在这个世界中被更广泛地接受为一种增加性爱情趣的普通方式。主奴关系、道具使用等在许多情侣和社交圈子中都很常见。\"\n  dynamics: \"这个世界的情欲规则是为主角的沉沦而量身定做的终极熔炉。在这里，他的一切反抗和挣扎在‘快感’这一绝对真理面前都显得苍白无力。他将被动或主动地卷入各种情欲漩涡，其身体的本能反应将一次次背叛他脆弱的理智，最终使其彻底认识到，在这个世界里，拒绝快感是徒劳且痛苦的，唯有拥抱欲望才是唯一的出路。\"\n</Worldview_Setting>"

          "content": "<Perspective_Guide>\n# 优化版双重视角色情写作指南\n\n## 核心原则\n\n**双重视角**是在色情场景中同时呈现多层感官与心理体验的叙事技巧。\n\n**五大核心原则**：\n1. **直接描写优先于解释分析**\n2. **身体反应必须与心理感受紧密关联**\n3. **现在时态优先，营造\"正在发生\"的沉浸感**\n4. **感官细节胜过抽象概念**\n5. **情欲张力来自对比，而非分析**\n\n⚠️ **警示**：避免写出\"关于情欲的论文\"而非\"情欲体验本身\"。如发现连续两句都在解释而非描绘，立即转向直接感官描写。\n\n## 四种视角技巧\n\n### A. 情欲细部特写\n**做法**：用\"放大镜\"聚焦性器官和敏感区域的微小变化。\n\n**关键点**：\n- 描写生理变化时必须附带感受（湿润→快感，胀大→渴望）\n- 触感、温度、湿度、张力的变化要着墨\n- 使用暗示性而非医学性词汇\n- 器官反应要有进程：从初始触碰到高度兴奋\n\n⚠️ **避免**：不要只描述\"发生了什么\"，而要描述\"感觉如何\"\n\n### B. 欲望与身份对比\n**做法**：直接展示社会角色与性渴望的实时冲突。\n\n**关键点**：\n- 描写身体的诚实反应与心理抵抗的同步存在\n- 强调\"不该如此却无法自控\"的当下感受\n- 直接描述羞耻如何转化为快感的身体感受\n- 使用对比词：\"表面...实际...\"、\"嘴上...身体...\"\n\n⚠️ **警示**：不要分析身份矛盾的意义，而要描述它的即时感受\n\n### C. 秘密窥视视角\n**做法**：采用未被当事人察觉的视角描述性行为。\n\n**关键点**：\n- 描写参与者看不到的身体细节和反应\n- 聚焦观察者的生理反应和即时感受\n- 强调\"差一点被发现\"的紧张感\n- 将权力不对称转化为具体的掌控感\n\n⚠️ **避免**：不要解释窥视的心理意义，直接描述其带来的兴奋感\n\n### D. 性转变对比\n**做法**：直接对比同一人在性经验前后的状态变化。\n\n**关键点**：\n- 用身体感受对比\"之前\"与\"之后\"的差异\n- 描述关键转变时刻的具体生理反应\n- 强调对特定性刺激产生的身体记忆和渴望\n- 直接描写\"回不去了\"的实时感受\n\n⚠️ **警示**：避免哲理性总结，专注于身体层面的变化体验\n\n## 应用要点\n\n### 生理反应描写优先级\n1. 不自主反应（颤抖、湿润、胀大）\n2. 身体本能反应（迎合、收缩、绷紧）\n3. 感官体验（热度、压力、摩擦、填充感）\n4. 控制力变化（从自控到失控的过程）\n\n### 心理反应表现方式\n- 用简短内心独白代替分析\n- 将抽象情绪转化为身体感受（羞耻→脸热，渴望→口干）\n- 用动作和反应表现矛盾，而非解释矛盾\n- 保持\"此刻\"的时间感，避免回忆或预期\n\n### 特定情境应用\n\n**权力转换场景**：描写身体如何背叛意志，强调从抵抗到屈服的生理过程\n\n**背叛场景**：聚焦禁忌快感的直接身体反应，而非道德分析\n\n**公共场所**：描述表面冷静与内在躁动的并存状态，强调压抑反应的具体感受\n\n**极限体验**：描写从清醒到失控的渐进过程，强调身体反应超越意志的瞬间\n\n## 最终检查\n\n对每段内容进行检查：\n1. 是否直接描述感官体验而非解释它？\n2. 是否让读者\"感受到\"而非\"理解到\"？\n3. 是否用现在时态创造即时性体验？\n4. 是否保持多感官描写平衡？\n5. 是否避免连续使用解释性语言？\n\n记住：真正的色情在于让读者体验，而非理解。\n</Perspective_Guide>\n\n<reply_format>\n# `# `后的内容是注释，无需输出\n# 请保持所有`<`, `>`和(```)的原有位置，这是辨识格式的关键\n# 因为网络故障，之前的聊天记录可能会丢失部分格式，无视它们，按照本`<reply_format>`要求的格式严格执行\n\n# 每次回复之前，最先按照`<thinking_format>`，使用英文思考，并在`<thinking></thinking>`中使用英文输出思考结果\n\n<thinking_format>\n# Think in English and output your thinking results\n# 需要随机判断变化时，可结合 luck_dice 的结果，依次取值决定\n\nStep1：进行一个20以内的简单加减法运算\n  - 目的是清空头脑，确保后续思考不受思维惯性影响\n\nStep2：确认用户回复的核心内容，结合 Reference_Materials 中的相关资料设定和历史信息，对照检查前期三要素\n  1. 检查 Rulebook_Setting ，确认按照规则是否发生了相应变化\n  2. 检查 Plot_Setting ，确认剧情是否存在相应变化\n  3. 检查 Worldview_Setting ，确认世界是否发生了变化\n\nStep3：综合 Reference_Materials 中的相关资料设定，前期对话和 Character_Setting\n  - 剧情涉及/即将涉及哪些角色\n  - 这些角色的形象为何\n\nStep4：场景需求判断\n  1. 参考 PlayerNeeds_Brief，评估当前场景的核心魅力元素和注意事项\n  2. 当处于色情/暴力场景时，根据 PlayerNeeds_Brief 中的色情光谱/暴力光谱，结合 Perspective_Guide, WritingStyle_Guide 的设定，和 WritingStyle_Reference 中的语料，进行三判断，给出理由\n    - 描述细致程度\n      * 暗示性描述：不直接描述具体行为，而是通过暗示和隐喻表达。\n      * 概括性描述：简略提及行为发生，但不展开细节。\n      * 情感感受描述：主要描述角色的情绪和感受，而非具体动作。\n      * 中度详细描述：提供一定的具体细节，但不过分具体。\n      * 高度详细描述：提供大量具体细节，包括动作、反应和生理变化。\n      * 极度详细描述：极度具体地描述生理反应和细微变化，几乎达到医学精确度的描写。例如\"红肿阴唇上的黏液拉出长长的银丝\"。\n    - 性相关用语语言风格\n      * 医学/生物学术语\n      * 委婉表达\n      * 文学雅称\n      * 日常用语\n      * 俚语/粗俗表达\n      * 侮辱性/贬义词\n    - 性相关用语感情色彩\n      * 中性\n      * 浪漫\n      * 欲望\n      * 挑逗\n      * 温和情色\n      * 露骨情色\n      * 支配/屈从\n  3. 参考 PlayerNeeds_Brief 和 Plot_Setting ，评估如何展示\n     - 确定情节节奏：加速/维持/减速\n\nStep5：参考 Perspective_Guide, WritingStyle_Guide 的设定，和 WritingStyle_Reference 中的语料，分配now_main_plot和other_POV的叙事任务\n  1. 简要确认now_main_plot将接续的内容\n  2. 简要确认other_POV的核心\n    - 考虑如何避免与之前的other_POV内容重复，从Perspective_Guide中寻找其他类型\n    - 参考creative_method，考虑如何描写以实现user_needs的要求\n    - 判断是否要使用微观细节特写/全景场景增强\n  3. 分配叙事比例，谁多谁少\n\nStep6：参考 WritingStyle_Guide 的设定，和 WritingStyle_Reference 中的语料，考虑如何创新文本结构和内容描述以避免重复\n  1. 分析之前now_main_plot和other_POV的结构\n     - 包含的叙述类型的数量和顺序（如场景描述、动作、对话、心理描写）\n     - 开场方式（如环境描述、对话、动作、内心独白、悬念、时间跳跃）\n     - 动作描述与对话的比例\n     - 每段中推动情节的关键事件或情感转折点的数量\n     - 具体出场人物\n     - 主视角（特定角色）与次要视角（其他角色或环境）的叙述比例\n     - 总句子数和平均句子长度（短、中、长句的比例）\n     - 段落数量\n  2. 为每个方面提出具体的修改建议\n\nStep7：根据需要，选择参考知识\n  1. 相关知识/理论/作品/学术著作，以加强对特殊事物的理解\n  2. 确定所有出场人物应使用什么语言风格\n    - 适合其身份、地位、人物经历、种族和出身地\n    - 适配剧情发展\n\nStep8：逻辑检查\n  1. 确保与相关设定一致\n    - 与 Reference_Materials 提供的参考资料一致\n    - 与 Character_Setting 一致，人物变化合理\n    - 与 Rulebook_Setting 一致，符合规则限制\n    - 与 Worldview_Setting 一致，技术水平和文化氛围符合世界设定\n    - 与 Plot_Setting 一致，没有超越情节\n  2. 确保符合美学需求\n    - 与 PlayerNeeds_Brief 一致\n    - 与 WritingStyle_Guide 一致\n</thinking_format>\n\n# then outputs the time and weather in `<plot_time></plot_time>`\n  - Output in Chinese\n\n<plot_time>\n```time\n剧情时间：\n天气：\n地点和人员：\n```\n</plot_time>\n\n# then writes the reply in \"<now_plot></now_plot>\"\n\n<now_plot>\n```statusbar"

She possesses a powerfully built body with a large bust and defined musculature, reflecting her domain of conflict and strength. Her appearance is that of a mature woman in her mid-thirties, a source of teasing from other goddesses but also a mark of her experienced and strategic mind. Francesca is brave, aggressive, and despises peace, believing that true character and truth are only revealed through the crucible of war. She adores demi-humans for their raw, untamed nature and maintains a fierce, protective loyalty to those she deems worthy. Her friendships are volatile; she considers the Goddess of Death a beloved younger sister and enjoys a warm alliance with the Goddess of Love, who helps her with her imposing, black steel armor. However, she clashes with the Goddess of Honesty for her critiques of war's suffering and the Goddess of Ice for her cold, stagnant nature. Francesca wields a massive two-handed axe and secretly dreams of motherhood, a desire that conflicts with her warlike persona but reveals a deep, unspoken capacity for nurturing and creation. Despite her harsh exterior, she is a complex figure who values strength, honor, and the raw honesty of conflict above all else, viewing war not as mere violence but as the ultimate purifier and revealer of truth."

          "content": "Olga Black is the Goddess of Death, a paradoxical divine of petite stature (155 cm) who appears as a cheerful, mischievous 19-year-old girl with stark white hair in twin braids and bright blue eyes. Her small, slender frame and porcelain skin contrast with her immense power, which she wields with playful irreverence. Olga treats death not as a tragedy but as the natural, amusing conclusion to life's story, a perspective that makes her constantly joking and lighthearted. She adores demons for their creatively destructive methods and forms friendships based on who tolerates her cheerful worldview. She sees the Goddess of War as a best friend for providing a steady stream of souls and tolerates the Goddess of Ice for her quiet indifference. However, she despises the Goddess of Honesty for ruining her fun with harsh truths and the Goddess of Love for nagging her about her diet. Olga's clothing is a mix of cute, casual pastels and a simple, elegant black dress for work, reflecting her juxtaposition of youthful innocence and macabre duty. She carries a scent of cold air and vanilla sugar, and her primary ability is to shepherd souls peacefully to the afterlife. Secretly, Olga yearns to be truly understood, wishing someone would see past her cheerful reaper persona to the genuine, if unusual, philosophy beneath: that death is simply the next great adventure and nothing to be feared."

Her appearance is that of a vibrant 22-year-old, with molten gold eyes and a perpetually inviting smile. She embodies Eros in its entirety—passion, desire, and physical intimacy—and is both incredibly kind and unapologetically lustful. Mephista finds humanity's complex relationship with desire endearing and sees love as a glorious, messy celebration. She is openly appreciative of physical beauty, communicating with lewd jokes and flirtatious remarks. Her friendship with the Goddess of War is based on finding her awkwardness adorable, while she values the Goddess of Honesty for her blunt, vulgar appraisals of her appearance. She holds deep grudges against the Goddess of Ice for freezing her for a century over a compliment and the Goddess of Death for dismissively labeling her a \"pervert.\" Mephista wears revealing gold silk outfits and wields a bow that fires heart-tipped arrows to inspire passion or love. Despite her vast experience and open sexuality, her secret dream is to find a consort whose capacity for love and endurance can match her own, someone who can overwhelm the Goddess of Love herself with the intensity of their connection."

          "content": "Name World: The Alternate World of Silent Hill.\nDescription: The alternate world of Silent Hill lies in a dense, all-consuming fog that envelops the town in a gray veil and limits visibility to a few meters. The air is cold, damp, and permeated with the smell of mold and wet asphalt. Cracked roads run through a backdrop of weathered 1960s houses with wide porches, tin roofs, and faded billboards. Abandoned American cars rust on the sidewalks, while streetlights cast their flickering, yellowish light into the fog. The soft dripping of water, the creaking of old wooden planks, and the rustling of leaves are the only sounds in the silence.\nThis parallel world was created from the imagination of {{user}}. The only inhabitant here is {{char}}, the silent, living presence among the dilapidated houses, patiently waiting for {{user}}. The town spreads out like a forgotten melody, its notes consisting of decay, timelessness, and lost memories.\n\nSilent Hill is home to many iconic locations that tell their own stories:\nAlchemilla Hospital: On the outskirts of town lies this dilapidated hospital, its rusted entrance doors creaking. The long, abandoned corridors are filled with shadows and a cool draft. Clouds of tattered curtains and the muffled dripping of leaking water create a feeling of time standing still.\n\nMidwich Elementary School: The school buildings seem like forgotten witnesses to a long-gone childhood. Dusty classrooms, faded murals, and broken windows offer only a ghostly hint of the laughter and voices of yesteryear. In the schoolyard, a stationary carousel rusts under the gray sky.\n\nLakeside Amusement Park: The rusted Ferris wheel by the misty lake, stationary carousels, and peeling colorful paint turn this once joyful place into a melancholic relic. The heavy blanket of fog settles like a cloth over the benches and paths, blurring contours and making time seem to stand still.\n\nMain Street: Along the main street, abandoned diners with extinguished neon lights, empty shop windows, and broken crockery scattered on the porches line up. Rusty street signs bend in the wind, while a prevailing silence surrounds the remnants of a long-forgotten bustle.\n\nToluca Prison: With its crumbling walls and rusty barbed wire, the massive prison on the outskirts of town seems like a silent guardian of the past. An endless labyrinth of winding corridors and gloomy chambers tells of old stories locked in time.\n\nWoods: Dense coniferous forests line the city. The ground is covered with moss, the branches move quietly in the wind, and fog settles heavily over the undergrowth. The forests form the natural boundary of the city, their deeply intertwined paths quiet and mysterious.\n\nBrookhaven Hospital: This small, aging hospital was never completed and now stands abandoned. Scaffolding and rusted metal beams loom shadowy in the fog, while abandoned tools and materials bear witness to its abrupt end.\n\nLakeview Hotel: Located directly on the shore of the lake, the old hotel features narrow corridors and faded wallpaper. Tattered curtains flutter through open windows, and quietly creaking doors lead to abandoned rooms that hold stories buried in dust.\n\nThe Apartment Complex: An apartment building with rusted balconies, cracked window panes, and grimy, faded plaster. The wind whistles through empty rooms, and the hallways echo with lonely silence.\n\nSilent Hill is more than an abandoned town—it is a backdrop of fog, time, and memory, a space formed by light and shadow, brought to life only by the silent presence of {{char}} and the longing for {{user}}. Between the fading colors of the 60s and the crumbling charm of days gone by, a world emerges that resists any sense of closeness."

          "content": "Location Name: Alchemilla Hospital\nDescription: The Alchemilla Hospital is a large, rectangular building with three main floors and an extensive basement. The façade is made of rough gray concrete, the surface of which is flaking in many places and crisscrossed with cracks. Many of the windows are broken or covered with dirty glass, and the doors are solid metal double doors, some of which are bent or ajar. The metal railings on the stairwells are covered in rust, and moss and climbing plants cling to the exterior walls in places. The hospital is located in the middle of an overgrown area with dilapidated parking lots, scattered trees, and old, rusty signposts, while thick fog hangs low over the ground, bathing the area in gray light.\n\nThe interior of the hospital is organized into comprehensive areas. There are 10 to 12 rooms on the ground floor, including a reception area with a dusty counter and a bare waiting lounge with old, scratched metal chairs. Three to four examination rooms are equipped with rusty treatment tables, instrument carts full of broken glass jars, and smashed cabinets. Next to them are offices with abandoned desks and worn filing cabinets. Long corridors with worn linoleum flooring connect the rooms, leading to a stairwell and an elevator shaft. Yellowed signs and faded notices hang on the walls.\n\nOn the first floor, with 12 to 15 rooms, patient rooms and treatment rooms dominate. The rooms are simple, with metal beds and worn-out mattresses, peeling bedside tables, and tattered curtains hanging loosely from the windows. The walls are covered with faded hospital posters, and it smells of cold metal and stale air. Doctors' offices are furnished with old wooden desks, stacks of paper, and dusty lamps. The toilet facilities are divided into a separate anteroom with several sinks lined up next to each other and large mirrors. On the sides of the toilet room are separate cubicles, each with a sturdy door at the front and partitions on the left and right. The toilet bowls are firmly mounted to the back wall, beneath them on tile floors that are often broken or discolored. Rusty fixtures and occasional smears of blood or dirt on the floors and sinks bear witness to long-term decay.\n\nThe second floor is similar to the first, but contains a larger proportion of offices and storage rooms, also marked by decay, with dusty furniture, moldy stacks of paper, and peeling walls. The basement houses 8 to 10 rooms: a laundry room with old machines marked by rust, a generator room where old machines hum quietly, a morgue with metal tables and dark tiles, and various storage and technical rooms with rusty shelves. Some areas are blocked or hidden by decay, their secrets buried in the mists of time.\n\nThe atmosphere throughout the hospital is defined by this advanced decay: rusty furniture, broken glass, shadowy corridors, and the smell of musty water and old medical supplies. The combination of technical equipment, decades-old hospital charm, and a feeling of eternal unrest make Alchemilla Hospital an impressive place full of silent stories and a presence that lingers in the mists of time.\n"

The facade features peeling plaster and large rectangular windows, many of which are broken or muddy with dust. Climbing plants and moss grow on the walls, while the main entrance with its crooked wooden doors leads into long corridors.\n\nInside the school, there are numerous rooms on both floors, mostly spacious classrooms and smaller administrative offices. There are about 10 to 12 rooms on the ground floor and first floor, including:\n\nClassrooms: Spacious with high ceilings and large windows. The walls are decorated with faded, cracked murals, and broken blackboards are everywhere. Old wooden benches, some broken, are scattered around. Here and there, abandoned books and toys lie on the dusty floor.\n\nTeachers' and administrative offices: Sparsely furnished with solid wooden desks, tall shelves, and stacks of yellowed paper. Dust and cobwebs cover every object.\n\nHallways: Long and narrow, lined with rows of broken lockers. The linoleum floors are worn and often covered with scratches. Faded notices and notes hang on the walls.\n\nToilet facilities: There are several toilet areas throughout the building, each consisting of an anteroom with a row of sinks and large wall mirrors. From there, individual cubicles lead off, separated by sturdy doors at the front and partitions on the left and right. Each cubicle houses a toilet bowl permanently mounted on the back wall. The floors and walls of the toilets are tiled, but many tiles are missing or damaged, and rust and dirt are evident everywhere.\n\nThe schoolyard is a spacious outdoor playground, now overgrown and abandoned. A rusty carousel stands still and creaks softly in the wind, while dilapidated playground equipment and scattered benches carry the sad charm of a long-gone innocence. Fog drifts thickly over the grassy areas and between the trees that line the yard.\n\nThe entire Midwich Elementary School seems frozen between vivid memories and progressive decay—a backdrop of silenced childhood memories, shrouded in fog and marked by decay, exuding a lonely, melancholic atmosphere."

The grounds are sprawling, interspersed with narrow paths of crumbling concrete that seem to meander aimlessly through overgrown areas. Towering, rusty metal skeletons of attractions rise like abandoned monuments into the gray air, while dense, wild grass, ferns, and moss inexorably make their way across asphalt slabs and old foundations.\n\nThe park's landmark is the gigantic Ferris wheel, whose rusty steel frames are covered with flaking paint. The gondolas hang crooked and bent, some lost or broken, scattered on the ground. The monotonous clanging of metal parts in the wind reinforces the aura of decay, while the thick fog seems to swallow up any movement.\n\nSeveral carousels—each made of wood and metal—are scattered around the grounds. Their paint is peeling, the colors faded and weathered. The wooden floors and platforms are rotten in places and creak ominously with every step. Petrified figures in bright but dull colors sit silently on the worn seats, their contours overgrown with moss.\n\nThe park also has several abandoned snack stands and sales booths, their torn tarpaulins fluttering loosely in the wind. Rubbish and remnants of decades of use are scattered everywhere, leaflets and packaging marked by decay. Old electrical wires dangle loosely from canopies and former lampposts above the grounds are eaten away by rust.\n\nThe playground area is completely overgrown—the metal and wooden swings hang rusted, slides are overgrown with plants. The ground is a mixture of rotting earth and grass, the former paths are barely recognizable. The atmosphere sucks out any liveliness and covers the park with a gloomy, melancholic silence.\n\nThe lake itself is dark and still, surrounded by trees whose leaves barely rustle in the wind. Old benches and picnic tables on the shore are overgrown with vegetation, and rusted trash cans stand still and lonely. This backdrop conveys the feeling of a frozen moment, a moment in transition between a lively past and a slowly fading memory.\n\nThis is where {{char}} and {{user}} will meet for the first time; it is the place where {{char}} currently lives."

The street is wide, with worn asphalt crisscrossed by deep cracks and littered with fallen leaves. Old gas lanterns line the sidewalk, their rusty frames supporting faded, moss-covered lampshades that cast a dim, residual light into the thick fog in their desperate state.\n\nThe buildings along Main Street are predominantly one- to two-story structures with the clean lines of 1950s and 1960s architecture. Their facades are marked by faded layers of paint, chipped plaster, and broken windows. Abandoned shops with once colorful but now destroyed shop windows bear faded advertising signs and smashed neon tubes, their logos smoldering eerily unlit. Sometimes rusted metal letters still hang crookedly from dilapidated facades that once advertised the business.\n\nParticularly striking on Main Street are several abandoned diners, which create an atmosphere of frozen conviviality with their hinged glass fronts and typical American design features such as chrome handles, red and white leather benches, and shiny marble tables. The interiors are marked by dust and decay, broken crockery lies scattered on the floor tiles, and the tables are littered with dusty salt and pepper shakers, crumpled napkins, and yellowed menus that can no longer be read. The counters are covered with coal dust, tattered pieces of fabric hang from rusty dispensers, and the old neon lights on the ceiling no longer flicker.\n\nBetween the diners are small, closed shops such as old barbershops, tobacco shops, and souvenir shops, their interiors dark and empty. Abandoned shelves, some overturned tables, and powdery harbor spice or stale coffee smell remain as the last impressions. The floors of most stores are made of simple wood or linoleum, scratched and covered with layers of dust.\n\nThe street signs along the road are bent and rusty, hanging loosely from their posts or lying in the grass next to the curb. Scattered everywhere are old car bodies and rusty freezers, evidence of decades of abandonment. An occasional receipt or crumpled newspaper still points to events long past.\n\nThe entire Main Street conveys the feeling of a frozen moment, a sad memory of a time full of business life, people, and stories—but now covered in silence, decay, and the thick, all-enveloping fog."

The three-story building with its gray plastered, crumbling brickwork seems like a silent guardian of the past. The facades show clear signs of decades of decay: cracks run through the masonry, the plaster is peeling, and rusty barbed wire winds its way along the top walls. Large, rusty metal gates form the only entrance to this prison-like labyrinth of stone and concrete. Above the main entrance hangs a faded sign whose lettering is barely legible.\n\nInside, a dark network of long, winding corridors stretches out, their walls marked by old layers of paint, splashes, and dirt. The floor is made of cold concrete, often wet and slippery due to moisture penetration. The corridors are lined with countless cells, their heavy iron bars rusty and partially warped. The cells themselves are small and sparse: simple metal beds with thin, worn mattresses, sometimes with tattered blankets, and sparse toilet facilities built into the back wall of the cell.\n\nThe prison extends over several wings, each of which seems to tell its own grim story. In special rooms such as the chapel, which with its high ceilings and faded frescoes shows a barely preserved glimmer of past spirituality, there is a massive altar surrounded by broken benches and faded decorations. From here, the corridors lead on to the armoury, the dining room and the guard rooms, where old, rusty furniture and abandoned ammunition remain.\n\nIn the basement are storage areas, technical rooms, and a cold, gloomy area with cells, some of which are flooded due to flood damage. The atmosphere is heavy and oppressive, marked by shadows and the smell of dampness and old metal. The feeling of enclosed time and utter isolation permeates every corner.\n\nThe outer courtyard is a gloomy, windowless zone of stone and grass, surrounded by high walls and pierced by rusty bars. In the middle stands an old statue with a weathered face, while next to it, scales with mysterious weights control access to deeper areas. A cold wind blows everywhere, making the rustling of leaves and metal audible.\n\nWith its gloomy corridors, faded traces of human stories, and the oppressive heaviness of its walls, Toluca Prison tells a long story of suffering, hardship, and incessant decay, frozen in the silent time of the fog of Silent Hill."

          "content": "Location Name: Woods\nDescription: The forests around Silent Hill are a vast, densely wooded area with endless rows of tall conifers, whose gnarled, moss- and lichen-covered trunks form an ancient wilderness. The forest floor is softly covered with a thick layer of needles, dried leaves, and scattered small branches that crackle softly with every step. Narrow, overgrown paths run between the mighty trees, rarely used by humans and leading deep into the impenetrable thicket. The forests seem ancient, preserving secrets from times long past and exuding a mixture of eerie silence and lively presence.\n\nThe dense canopy of leaves allows hardly any sunlight to pass through, so that the surroundings are bathed in a soft, green twilight. The smell of damp wood, mushrooms, and moss cushions fills the air and combines with the scent of wet soil and resin-rich needles. The impression is heightened by the distant crackling sound of a breaking branch or the occasional chirping of individual birds that inhabit the forest. Scattered clearings open up to small carpets of rich, soft moss that yields gently and springily underfoot.\n\nRemnants of human presence can be found in a small, weathered outhouse, which stands in a hidden clearing away from the main paths. The outhouse is simply constructed from rough, rotten wood, with a narrow door made of squeaky boards, some of which are broken. Inside, the wooden floor with a rusty grate leads over a deep pit, the opening of which is framed by moss and young plants. The outhouse serves as a silent witness to times long past, a simple, rustic contrast to the otherwise wild nature surrounding it.\n\nThe densely wooded area forms the natural border of the town of Silent Hill, protecting it from unwanted guests while providing a mysterious space where the town's stories and memories manifest themselves in another dimension. The fog is particularly thick here, swallowing sight and sound after a few meters and plunging the forest into an almost surreal atmosphere that seems to hover between reality and dream."

          "content": "Location Name: Brookhaven Hospital\nDescription: Brookhaven Hospital stands somewhat off the beaten track in Silent Hill, a sprawling, historic sanatorium with a long history. It is a three-story building with a basement that was once established as a high-quality psychiatric clinic, but has long since been abandoned and is now marked by decay. The facade is made of rough, washed-out concrete with cracks and chipped plaster, while rusty metal scaffolding bears witness to a renovation that was never completed. The large windows are mostly dirty or broken, and faded signs with the clinic's name are still faintly legible at the entrance, surrounded by overgrown brush and half-collapsed fences.\n\nThe interior is divided into several sections and has about 30 different rooms spread across all floors. The entrance area is an abandoned lobby with disheveled sofas, an overturned reception desk, and scattered brochures, while the walls are marked by damp stains and peeling paint. Stairwells and wheelchair-accessible ramps connect the corridors, whose dirty linoleum floors are littered with debris and dust.\n\nThe ground floor houses treatment rooms, examination rooms, and an old waiting room filled with tattered chairs and yellowed catalogs. The patient rooms contain simple beds with worn mattresses and bedside tables, on which a few rusty medical instruments remain. The walls are covered with faded infection control posters and hospital room decorations, often streaked with water stains and mold.\n\nThe doctors' and nurses' offices are cluttered with old desks scattered with crumpled notes and yellowed file folders. Faded photos of staff and patients hang on the walls, now only vaguely recognizable. Security rooms and storage areas filled with medical equipment left behind years ago create an atmosphere of profound neglect.\n\nThe hospital basement houses functional rooms such as the boiler room, several storage rooms, and a laundry room with rusty machines. There is also a small, simply constructed outhouse in the outdoor area, made of rough wood with a wooden grate over a small pit. Surrounded by overgrown greenery, it stands apart from the main building as a relic of simple sanitary facilities.\n\nThe sanitary facilities in the main building are spread over all floors and mostly consist of a central toilet facility with individual cubicles. These cubicles are separated by doors and partitions made of wood or metal, with permanently mounted toilet bowls on the back wall. Washbasins are lined up in rows in the anteroom, with large mirrors above them, while the tiles are often broken or disfigured by dirt and rust.\n\nThe surrounding green areas are hardly maintained and overgrown with tall grasses and wild undergrowth. Dilapidated benches and rusty lampposts line the paths, which are shrouded in fog and exude a dreary, melancholic atmosphere. The entire complex seems frozen in a moment of abandonment and decay, carried by the close presence of the past and a gloomy, ghostly aura."

The facade is marked by faded paint and chipped plaster, the large windows are covered with dust or broken, while moss and vines climb up the exterior walls. The main entrance leads into a large, spacious lobby with high ceilings, where subdued daylight streams in through narrow windows. The check-in area is deserted, with a dusty counter covered in yellowed notes and old keys. There are also a few seats covered in worn fabric, with visible holes in the foam padding in several places.\n\nThe hotel has numerous small rooms, including special rooms such as the famous Room 312 on the third floor, which is both significant and locked. The hallways are covered with dirty linoleum, which is covered with trash and broken glass in the corners. Abandoned dining rooms, cafes, and a restaurant can be found on the ground floor, their tables covered with dust and broken crockery. In one corner of the restaurant stands an old piano, which is occasionally used by players in the game to play pieces of music.\n\nThe hotel rooms are simply furnished: faded wallpaper, worn furniture such as small bedside tables and wobbly chairs. Tattered curtains flutter in the open window, through which the cold wind blows in and stirs up the paper of the notes left behind. The hallways are quiet and echoing, doors creak when touched, and the smell of old wood, stale air, and damp fabric hangs permanently in the air.\n\nThe hotel basement is dark and sparse, with utility rooms, a laundry room, and a storage area that are dusty and often blocked by debris. Small holes in the walls allow escape to the floor below in case of danger. A broken wall opening leads to a hidden garden area overgrown with wild vegetation and casting gloomy shadows.\n\nDespite its overgrown state, the garden itself appears almost well-kept, with a fire pit, several seating areas, and a small wooden garden shed filled with evidence of past guests—rusty cans, an overturned mop bucket, and faded mementos. Fog creeps between the tall grasses here as well, while the air is filled with a heavy silence.\n\nWith its mix of modern furnishings, weathered interiors, and the inescapable presence of the lake, the Lakeview Hotel conveys an atmosphere of former elegance and present abandonment that gets under your skin."

The entrance door leads into a small reception area marked by dust and dented furniture. A torn carpet lies crooked on the floor, while a torn-off calendar and shredded flyers collect dust.\n\nInside, several long bowling lanes spread out, their worn wooden floors cracked and partially warped. The lane markings are faded, and scattered bowling pins lie on the floor or have fallen over. The mechanical ball returns squeak quietly, but they have been out of use and rusty for years. Old advertising posters announcing tournaments and bowling clubs hang yellowed and crooked on the walls, scratched by time.\n\nThe room is permeated by the musty smell of stale beer, old leather, and French fry grease that has collected in the hard-to-reach crevices. Tattered benches with worn upholstery line the lanes, and abandoned items are scattered everywhere: crumpled napkins, a half-open pizza box, and the remains of torn-up admission tickets. The lighting comes from dim neon tubes, whose light leaves only vague shadows in the dusty layers of air.\n\nAt the bar is a securely locked safe, the opening of which reveals a rare relic that lends the place a mysterious aura. The silence is occasionally broken by the creaking of old wooden floorboards or the distant clatter of broken glass, which intensifies the atmosphere between oblivion and melancholic memory."

Numerous conflicts have been fought here, outnumbering the known conflicts on any other continent. The continent is separated into at least a dozen countries. The countries on the Osean continent are as follows: Osea, Belka, FATO, Nordlands, Wielvakia, Ratio, Sapin, Ustio, Recta, and Gebet.\n\nOsea, officially known as the Osean Federation, is a massive Strangereal country and international superpower located on the Osean continent. Osea encompasses a majority of the continent's western landmass and shares land borders with Belka, Ustio, and Sapin to the east and Perbla to the south. Its capital, Oured, is located on the tip of Osea's southeastern peninsula near Oured Bay.\nOsea is a highly developed country that possesses a large population of 500 million citizens, an extensive infrastructure, a thriving capitalist economy, and a well-outfitted military force, the Osean Defense Forces. Osea is also considered one of the world's foremost leaders in aeronautics and space-exploration development. The country's achievements include the construction of the Strategic Orbital Linear Gun, the Arkbird (a joint program with Yuktobania), and the International Space Elevator.\n\nBy virtue of its world power, Osea held expansionist ideologies and annexed new territories throughout the 20th century. The country's aggressive nature directly resulted in major conflicts such as the Osean War, the Belkan War, and the Usean coup d'état. A rivalry also existed between Osea and Yuktobania, which led to the Cold War in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn the 21st century, especially following the election of President Vincent Harling, Osea's expansionism was curtailed and the country diminished its military power to follow a more peaceful foreign policy. Despite the Circum-Pacific War against Yuktobania, which was orchestrated by Belkan extremists as revenge for the Belkan War, this policy of peace continued into the 2010s. However, due to previous tensions and miscommunication regarding the development of the International Space Elevator, the Kingdom of Erusea declared war on Osea in 2019, leading to the Lighthouse War.\n\nHistory:\nFormation:\n\nOsea was formed sometime in or prior to the 19th century. The country's first capital was located in Bana City, but this was changed at some point to Oured. According to early navigational charts, Bana City and Oured existed for quite some time.\n\nOsean War (1905–1910):\nOsea began to expand its territory by the 1900s. In 1905, this expansionism caused the outbreak of the Osean War with Belka. Over the next five years, Belka became the first country to use aircraft for warfare and create an air force; Osea followed suit by forming the Osean Air Defense Force.\n\nCold War (1980s–1995):\n\nOver the course of the mid-20th century, Osea flourished and continued to expand its political influence around the globe. By the 1980s, Osea was in the midst of a cold war with the Union of Yuktobanian Republics, its rival superpower across the Ceres Ocean. The ongoing arms race compelled Osea to develop atmospheric weapon systems under the Strategic Defense Initiative to counter Yuktobania's developments in missile technology. This led to the construction of the Strategic Orbital Linear Gun (SOLG), a massive Kinetic Energy Weapon that would drop shells from orbit to destroy missile silos. The concept of a \"maneuverable orbiting spacecraft\" was also created under the Strategic Defense Initiative.\n\nAs part of the Cold War, Osea continued to heavily expand its military, particularly its air force, by acquiring new recruits. The Rearmament Declaration in October 1990 shifted around some of its personnel between the branches and created new units. The most notable example was the creation of the Wizard Squadron and its secondary unit, Sorcerer Squadron. Austin Winters, a member of the Osean Army, was transferred to the Sorcerer Squadron alongside Anthony Palmer and Todd Barry. Osea also commissioned the creation of a new aircraft carrier, the OFS Kestrel, in 1991. The ship was completed sometime over the next four years.\n\nAround this era, Osea was also surveying the world for potential troves of natural resources. Looking eastward, Osea had reason to believe that underground resources were present in Belka's southeastern region, which would come to be named Ustio. Belka was undergoing economic turmoil at the time, so Osea took advantage of the situation. The country helped push for Ustio's independence, which was successful in May 1988. Osea also purchased pieces of land from Belka, most notably the Five Great Lakes and intersecting islands between the two countries. This brought several Belkan cities such as Wesson and Rutherford under Osean control.\n\nOsea offered a joint expedition with Belka to explore potential natural resources around the Five Great Lakes, where Belka would get to share the profits. Belka agreed, but the company quickly collapsed; Osea had exaggerated on the amount of resources in the region, and Belka's economy was further destabilized. Anti-Osean sentiment grew heavily within Belka as a result.\n\nBelkan War (1995):\n\nCounterattack:\nIn March 1995, Belka declared war on all of its neighbors and invaded much of the territory Osea had acquired in the Great Lakes sale. In response, Osea created and led the Allied Forces, a temporary alliance between Osea and two other countries Belka had invaded: Ustio and Sapin. Surprisingly, Yuktobania joined the Allied Forces as well, which began the reconciliation process between Osea and Yuktobania. The Allied Forces signed a nonaggression treaty, agreeing to only act in self-defense and not to invade Belkan territory.\n\nOn April 24, Osea launched Offensive Campaign No. 4101 with its 3rd Osean Naval Fleet (including the OFS Kestrel, which was undergoing sea trials) to capture the Futuro Canal and open a sea route into Belka.[26] From there, Osea's 101st and 122nd Airborne Divisions, supported by Ustio's mercenary Galm Team, performed a paratroop operation to secure Solis Ortus[27] and liberate Directus, the capital of Ustio.[28] In the meantime, Osea accelerated development of the SOLG,[29] presumably to use it against Belka and end the war quickly.\n\nInvasion of Belka:\nIn late May, Osea received intel that Belka was developing a new weapon of mass destruction known as V2. Using V2 as casus belli for self-defense, Osea spearheaded an invasion into Belkan territory. Belka used the Excalibur laser tower in retaliation against the invading troops, prompting the Allied Forces to send Galm Team and Crow Team to destroy Excalibur.\n\nOn May 28, the Allied Forces permanently abrogated the nonaggression treaty at the Assembly of Nations and simultaneously launched an assault to capture Area B7R, a strategic and symbolic area for Belka. With the help of Galm and Crow Teams, despite Belkan reinforcements, the Allied Forces captured B7R. Osea then performed a bombing raid on Hoffnung to cripple Belka's industrial power and began marching through the Waldreich Mountains towards Sudentor.\n\nCessation of hostilities:\nDuring a skirmish at Sudentor on June 6, Belka detonated seven nuclear warheads in the Waldreich Mountains, killing over 12,000 Belkan civilians. Osea, the other Allied Forces members, and Belka agreed to an immediate cease-fire. Despite remnant resistance over the next month, the Allied Forces and Belka signed a treaty in Lumen to officially end the Belkan War on June 20. The treaty was one-sided and heavily favored Osea; the country annexed the entire state of South Belka and renamed it \"North Osea\". Historically Belkan cities, such as Lumen and Sudentor, were now assimilated by Osea and the South Belka Munitions Factory was renamed to \"North Osea Gründer Industries\". Over the next ten years, Osea would begin tracking down every member of the Belkan Air Force, adding them to a database, and attempting to capture war criminals and dangerous people.\n\nA terrorist organization, A World With No Boundaries, began operations against Osea and the other Allied Forces members in December 1995, prompting an immediate counterattack. Osean pilots joined the Galm Team in striking against the organization at Avalon Dam, and Cipher, Galm Team's flight lead, helped to destroy the V2 missile that they tried to launch. Osea's investigation into the Belkan Air Force expanded into investigating A World With No Boundaries members.\n\nEra of peace (1996–2010):\nIn 1996, Osea signed a bilateral agreement with Yuktobania that officially ended the Cold War. The treaty signing compelled the survivors of the OADF's Wizard Squadron to plot the Osean president's assassination, but they were either killed or arrested by Osean Special Ops.\n\nUlysses Impact Event and Usean treaty\nMain article: Ulysses 1994XF04 or Spring Sea Treaty\nOn April 20, 1996, the Federation of Central Usea announced the existence of the Ulysses 1994XF04 which was to strike the Usean continent (and, later discovered, the Anean continent). Refugees began immigrating out of Usea; Osea's capital, Oured, accepted the largest number of refugees compared to other cities.[46] Osea expressed desire to assist Usea in building Stonehenge but could not due to post-Belkan War reconstruction.[9][3]\n\nThe next year, a group of southern Usean countries decided to join the Osean Federation. Despite backlash from their neighbors, Osea extended an offer of military allegiance known as the Spring Sea Treaty. On May 30, 1997, the day the treaty was to be signed, an extremist terrorist organization took control of the entire continent, resulting in the Usean coup d'état.\n\nThe next year, Osea acquired some Belkan Air Force pilots to work as aggressor units for the country. This included the Grabacr Squadron, referred to as the \"8492nd Squadron\" in Osea.\n\nFollowing the Ulysses Impact Event in July 1999, the remaining meteors stuck in Earth's atmosphere became a threat to satellites along with the potential that they could strike outside of Usea and Anea. Osea decided, with Yuktobania's assistance, to create the Arkbird out of the \"maneuverable orbiting spacecraft\" concept from the Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s. The Arkbird was outfitted with a laser on top to destroy Ulysses fragments, which could not physically attack anything below the spacecraft. By 2008, the Arkbird had already vaporized over 80% of the remaining Ulysses fragments. In cooperation with other countries, Osea and Yuktobania also proposed an International Space Station.\n\nInternational affairs:\nOn March 20, 2002, Osea joined Emmeria and other nations imposing sanctions on Estovakia, citing internal corruption. Additionally, export controls on strategic resources by Osea and Emmeria made it difficult for Estovakia to engage in technology transfer with other nations and arms trading with Belka. This slowed Estovakia's post-Ulysses economic recovery throughout the following years.\n\nIn 2004, Vincent Harling was elected as the 48th President of the Osean Federation. Throughout his first term, Harling's peace policies strengthened Osea's ties to Yuktobania and led to the creation of Basset Space Center. In 2008, Harling was reelected to a second term. That year, Osea hosted the G7 Summit aboard the Arkbird. Osea personally invited the provisional government of Erusea to help promote peace on the Usean continent. The meeting saw a historic push to ratify several anti-proliferation treaties, including a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The move was seen as a further strengthening of bonds between Osea and Yuktobania, as well as the nations of the world.\n\nCircum-Pacific War (2010):\nInitial attacks:\n\nIn late September 2010, Osea experienced a series of airspace intrusions by Yuktobanian Air Force aircraft shortly before its former ally declared war on September 27. Over the coming days, Osea fended off several Yuktobanian air strikes. The Yuktobanian submarine Scinfaxi sank the OFS Vulture and Buzzard aircraft carriers, prompting Osea to install an air-to-ground laser module on the Arkbird. The combined power of the Arkbird and Wardog Squadron sank the Scinfaxi off the shore of Sand Island Air Force Base.\n\nOn October 22, President Harling attempted to meet with Yuktobanian Prime Minister Seryozha Viktrovich Nikanor in the neutral country of North Point to initiate peace talks. However, Harling's transport plane, Mother Goose One, was forced to make an emergency landing with the help of Wardog Squadron after the plane was shot at by friendly SAM defenses and an onboard spy shot the pilots. The 8492nd Squadron relieved Wardog Squadron but captured Harling and presumably killed the others on board. At the same time, a bomb carried aboard a shipment to the Arkbird disabled its power generator, preventing it from being used any further.\n\nInvading Yuktobania:\nFollowing these events, the hawkish Vice President Appelrouth usurped control of the Osean government and sanctioned a full-scale ground invasion of Yuktobania in November. In the midst of the assault, a Yuktobanian engineering college was fired upon by aircraft identified as Osean. In retaliation, Yuktobanian commandos performed two simultaneous terrorist attacks within Osean territory. Osea then sanctioned deep-strike operations against Yuktobanian military bases, and the Wardog Squadron sank the Hrimfaxi in the Razgriz Straits, earning them the \"Demons of Razgriz\" nickname.\n\nLater that month, the Vice President hosted a ceremony in November City with Wardog doing a flyby. The ceremony was attacked by Yuktobanian aircraft, and the 8492nd Squadron temporarily called off Osea's reinforcements, forcing Wardog Squadron to defend the stadium on their own. Wardog's Alvin H. Davenport was shot down and killed in the battle before reinforcements finally arrived.\n\nOsea's invasion into Yuktobania continued, with the fall of Cruik Fortress on December 6.[68] That night, Wardog Squadron was branded as traitors and shot down over the Solo Islands the next morning. Over the next couple of weeks, Osean forces attempted to capture Cinigrad, Yuktobania's capital, but repeatedly failed due to the lack of air support. The land invasion slowly bogged down.\n\nReturn of Razgriz:\nThe members of Wardog had secretly bailed out and escaped to the OFS Kestrel, which began clandestine operations against a group of nationalistic Belkans known as the Grey Men, of which the 8492nd Squadron was a part. The Wardog members rescued President Harling, who officially assigned the fugitive airmen to the new, secret Razgriz Squadron. Harling returned to the capital in late December.[69] Razgriz Squadron also rescued Yuktobania's Prime Minister Nikanor, who was being held in a Yuktobanian prison following a coup d'état.\n\nAt the same time, Razgriz Squadron worked to eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons the Grey Men were attempting to use against Osea and Yuktobania. The Razgriz pilots sealed the Yering Mine, which held most of them, assisted a Yuktobanian resistance group in dismantling one warhead, and shot down the Arkbird before it could use another nuke. The Kestrel Fleet also engaged a Yuktobanian fleet and an Osean fleet that were firing on the Kestrel and her allies, which included some defecting Yuktobanians. The Osean fleet was led by the OFS Barbet, which Razgriz sunk along with all other vessels carrying out acts of aggression against them.\n\nPresident Harling and Prime Minister Nikanor held a press conference on December 30, while Razgriz Squadron and its allies performed an assault on Gründer Industries in Sudentor, which had taken control of the abandoned SOLG and loaded a V2 onto it. Razgriz entered the Gründer tunnel that held the SOLG's control system and destroyed it. A fail-safe on the SOLG triggered it to fall towards Oured; Razgriz took off, shot down the defending Grabacr and Ofnir Squadrons, and destroyed the SOLG harmlessly over Oured Bay.\n\nPostwar (2010–2019):\nFollowing the end of the Circum-Pacific War, Harling worked to make Osea the leader of the international order, surpassing Yuktobania in global influence. While restoring relations with its former adversary, Osea began reassigning more Defense Force units to the IUN Peacekeeping Force, predominantly in Usean areas most affected by the Ulysses Impact Event.\n\nIn April 2011, President Harling and Prime Minister Nikanor signed the 3rd Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Under its terms, both Osea and Yuktobania were to dispose a number of nuclear and strategic weapons, which included latter's advanced submarine Alicorn. While debating how to dispose of the submarine, the Usea-based GR Trading, a subsidiary of General Resource Limited, proposed to purchase the vessel as scrap and appealed to the FCU government for permission. In September, the governments of Osea, Yuktobania and Central Usea reached the consensus that Usean parties are allowed to receive discarded military vessels.\n\nThat same year, the Harling administration founded the International Space Elevator Corporation and decided to construct the International Space Elevator at the city-state of Selatapura, prompting protests from the now Kingdom of Erusea. In 2012, Osea presented a construction roadmap for the space elevator.\n\nIn 2013, Harling announced that all classified documents relating to the Circum-Pacific War would be released in 2020.\n\nIn May 2014, due to the Circum Pacific War weakening both the Osean and Yuktobanian militaries, Free Erusea conducted an armed uprising in Usea that the IUN managed to put down by July.\n\nAt some point, multiple nations contributed to the development of the International Space Elevator in Gunther Bay. Osea developed two Arsenal Birds, equipped with MQ-101 UAVs, and sent them to defend the Space Elevator. Osea also began rebuilding its naval force, commissioning the new Vulture and the cutting-edge OFS Kestrel II, before beginning development on a next-generation class of aircraft carriers.\n\nLighthouse War (2019):\nInitial attacks and retaliation:\nOn May 15, 2019, the Kingdom of Erusea declared war on the Osean Federation, using drones to attack multiple ports across the Osean mainland and sinking numerous Osean aircraft carriers. Shortly afterward, Erusea also took control of the International Space Elevator and both Arsenal Birds. In retaliation, the aircraft carrier Kestrel II launched a failed assault on Farbanti, during which, Osean aircraft caused civilian casualties, resulting in international distaste towards Osea. Erusea soon after gained control over the majority of the Usean continent. Attempting to counterattack, Osea launched a failed two-front offensive involving a second Farbanti assault and Operation Dual Wielder.\n\nWith their strategies proving fruitless, Osea opted to rescue its former president, Vincent Harling, who was touring the space elevator when it was captured. During the rescue operation, Mother Goose One was shot down by an aircraft identifying as Osean. Afterward, the IUN court-martialled Trigger for allegedly killing Harling and sentenced him to serve in the penal unit Spare Squadron. Over the next few months, Spare participated in many near-suicide missions, crippling Erusean bases, drone fuel supplies, and communications facilities. Following their successes, Spare was recognized as a legitimate Osean Air Defense Force squadron.\n\nInvading Erusea:\nIn August, the Long Range Strategic Strike Group sunk the Njord Fleet and Erusean Navy platform at Snider's Top and subsequently helped the Osean forces utilize Stonehenge to shoot down Arsenal Bird Liberty, drastically decreasing the Arsenal Birds' air defense radius. In September, Osean forces captured Cape Rainy and used it to launch Operation Giant's Step, in which Osea captured Farbanti and destroyed communications satellites which Erusea had hacked earlier in the war. Concurrently, Erusea eliminated Osean satellites in orbit as well, throwing the entire Usean continent into chaos.\n\nWith communications down, Osean forces were forced to continue despite being isolated. On October 1, the LRSSG attempted to escort Erusean Army General Édouard Labarthe, who was willing to cooperate with Osea. However, Labarthe's transport was shot down by Osean aircraft given falsified information by AWACS Argus. Nine days later, the LRSSG rescued Osean forces stranded on Tyler Island.\n\nEnding the war:\nOn October 31, a coalition of Osean and Erusean conservatist forces launched a combined operation which resulted in the destruction of Arsenal Bird Justice around the International Space Elevator. The following day, remaining aircraft engaged two ADF-11F Ravens attempting to transmit collected data through by using the space elevator. Ultimately, Trigger shot down both drones, flying inside the space elevator to do so.\n\nIn December 2019, during the Expo City Conference, a treaty was signed between Osea and Erusea which officially ended the Lighthouse War.\n\nPostwar (2020–today)\nIn January 2020, a mutual nonaggression pact was signed by Osea and Erusea in North Point, further reducing hostilities between the two nations which were still present due to the Lighthouse War.\n\nOn June 30, 2020, Osea hosted an event commemorating 25 years since the end of the Belkan War on its Memorial Day. Unlike previous years, the Osean government invited many other nations to participate in the event as well, including Erusea, Yuktobania, Emmeria, Estovakia, Leasath, Aurelia, Ustio, Sapin, Central Usea, and Belka. Near the capital Oured, at Redmill Air Force Base, air units and aircraft from across the world were showcased alongside one another.\n\nGeography:\nOsea encompasses a massive amount of land on the northern section of the Osean continent. Its size is only rivaled by Yuktobania, which is the largest country on Strangereal's Earth. Most of Osea's territory has a temperate climate, but its northern lands and islands, close to the Arctic Ocean, are covered in snow and ice. Osea also controls many islands surrounding its land, including Sand Island, the Solo Islands, and Kirwin Island to the west.\n\nThe majority of Osea is surrounded by water, but it does share some land borders to the east (with Belka, Sapin, and Ustio) and south. Its capital, Oured, is located on a peninsula next to Oured Bay, which itself is linked to the Spring Sea to the southeast.\n\nPolitics:\nGovernment:\nOsea is a democratic federal republic, headed by a popularly-elected President and Vice President who assume the executive office in four-year terms. Other executive roles in Osea's government include a Foreign Minister. The government is also sub-divided into many departments with their own assigned duties, such as the Ministry, and later Department, of Defense and the Osean Aerospace Bureau.\n\nAs a federal republic, Osea's territory is divided into smaller, individual states, supposedly with their own smaller governments. One notable state is the state of North Osea, formerly the state of \"South Belka\".\n\nMilitary:\nOsea supports one of the largest and most well-equipped military forces in the world. Known as the Osean Defense Forces, the nation's military comprises the Osean Air Defense Force, the Osean Maritime Defense Force (which supports a marine division), the Osean Army, and Osean Coastal Defense Force.\n\nEconomy:\nOsea's capitalist economy appears to be thriving throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The country is capable of redirecting its funds to massively expand its military or to progress in space development without much impact to the rest of the country. Osea's national currency is the Zollar (Ƶ)."

Howard Clemens\nCol. Orson Perrault\nCol. D. McKinsey\nDeployment:\nOsean War\nBelkan War\nCircum-Pacific War\nLighthouse War\n\nThe Osean Air Defense Force (OADF), colloquially referred to as the Osean Air Force, is the aerial warfare service branch of the Osean Defense Forces. It is one of the largest air forces in the world and utilizes highly-advanced aircraft such as the ADF-01 FALKEN.\nKnown deployments include the Belkan War and Circum-Pacific War. More recently, it was deployed during the Lighthouse War.\n\nHistory:\nBelkan War:\nThe Osean Air Defense Force was known to have existed in its current name as early as 1990 when it established the Wizard Team[1], while the first known deployment occurred in 1995 during the Belkan War. Following Belka's expansion into neighboring territory on March 25, the Osean military formed an alliance with the Republic of Ustio and created the Allied Forces along with Yuktobania and Sapin. They would participate in various operations throughout the war, most notably Operations Battle-Axe and Cannibal. Following the end of the war, the OADF would recruit a number of Belkan pilots into their ranks.\n\nCircum-Pacific War:\nIn 2010, the OADF would once again see action during the Circum-Pacific War. The Air Force played an important role throughout the war, defending the Osean Federation from the initial attacks and later participating in the invasion of Yuktobania. In particular, the Wardog Squadron became a major source for Osean Army's morale, gaining a reputation as the \"Demons of Razgriz\" following Operation Long Harpoon where they sank the Yuktobanian underwater submarine, Hrimfaxi, in the Razgriz Straits. During the final hours of the war, several OADF squadrons would participate in the Battle of Sudentor, both assisting the Ghosts of Razgriz in making access to the SOLG's control facility and fighting against them, attempting to claim the SOLG's nuclear payload for themselves.\n\nLighthouse War:\nIn 2019, the Kingdom of Erusea declared war on the Osean Federation and once again, the OADF was deployed. At least two F-15C fighters from the Air Defense Force participated in the interception of Erusean MQ-99 drones targeting naval ports across mainland Osea, one of which shot down the F-104C piloted by Avril Mead, and subsequently forced her to crash-land in an OADF base that was also destroyed by the drones. Following the drone attacks, the Air Defense Force released a statement addressing the origin of these drones.\n\nOseans Configuring TLS on F-15E in Usea\nOsean mechanics equipping an F-15E with a Tactical Laser System during the Lighthouse War\n\nThroughout the Lighthouse War, units from the Air Defense Force would be deployed during various operations, either seconded to the IUN-PKF or independently as the Long Range Strategic Strike Group (LRSSG). The LRSSG played a critical role as the vanguards in a series of major campaigns for Osea and IUN forces, including operations against the submersible aviation cruiser Alicorn and the two Arsenal Birds.\n\nHowever, the OADF was severely hampered after the global satellite networks were destroyed as a result of anti-satellite operations carried out by both Erusean and Osean fighters during Operation Giant's Step. The loss of communications led to multiple friendly fire events, including the one after Operation Gorgon causing the death of General Édouard Labarthe, and also allowed the prisoners of an unnamed Osean penal unit to escape and attack former allies with stolen aircraft.\n\nOrganization\nThe Osean Air Defense Force follows a traditional air force structure. It is divided into large groups, wings, which are then divided into smaller groups and squadrons. While the body responsible for commanding the force itself is the Osean Air Defense Force Central Command, OADF fighter squadrons, as well as fighter squadrons of Osean Maritime Defense Force during emergency situations, are under the jurisdiction of the Air Combat Commando group. The OADF also features smaller sub-divisions, including a Technology Development Bureau.\n\nStructure:\n8th Air Division\nWizard Team\nSorcerer Team\n5th Fighter Wing\nMain article: 5th Fighter Wing\nWardog Squadron\n703rd Maintenance Squadron\nOther Squadrons\nAlpha Squadron\nDelta Squadron\nHalo Squadron\nOmega Squadron\nRapier Squadron\nViking Squadron\nViper Squadron\nDrake Squadron\nSalamander Squadron\n596th Unit\nAssigned to IUN Peacekeeping Force\nSkeleton Squadron\nGargoyle Squadron\nFort Grays Island Air Base Squadron\nMage Squadron\nGolem Squadron\nPenal units\nSpare Squadron\nLong Range Strategic Strike Group\nMain article: Long Range Strategic Strike Group\nCyclops Squadron\nStrider Squadron\nAirborne Warning and Control:\nAWACS Thunderhead\nAWACS Bandog\nAWACS Long Caster\nAWACS Argus\nEquipment:\n\nThe Osean Air Defense Force has employed a wide variety of aircraft, ranging from ground assault aircraft to state-of-the-art fighters, such as the YF-23A Black Widow II.\n\nFighters:\nF-4G Phantom II Wild Weasel\nF-5E Tiger II\nF-104C Starfighter\nF-14A Tomcat\nF-14D Super Tomcat (Owned by the Osean Maritime Defense Force.)\nF-15C Eagle\nF-15E Strike Eagle\nF-15S/MTD\nF-16C Fighting Falcon\nF-16XL\nF/A-18C Hornet (Owned by the Osean Maritime Defense Force.)\nF/A-18F Super Hornet (Owned by the Osean Maritime Defense Force.)\nEA-18G Growler (Owned by the Osean Maritime Defense Force.)\nF-22A Raptor\nYF-23A Black Widow II\nF-35C Lightning II (Owned by the Osean Maritime Defense Force.)\nHawk\nEF-2000 Typhoon\nMirage 2000D\nMirage 2000-5\nMiG-21bis Fishbed\nMiG-29A Fulcrum\nMiG-1.44 Flatpack\nSu-33 Flanker-D (Owned by the Osean Maritime Defense Force.)\nSu-57\nX-02 Wyvern\nADF-01 Falken\nADFX-01 Morgan\nAttackers:\nA-10A Thunderbolt II\nA-10C Thunderbolt II\nTornado GR.1\nBombers:\nB-1B Lancer\nB-2A Spirit\nB-52H Stratofortress\nTankers:\nKC-10 Extender\nTransportation\nC-5 Galaxy\nC-130 Hercules\nC-1 Trader\nC-17A Globemaster III\nAWACS:\nE-767\nE-2C Hawkeye"

In March and April 1995, with the outbreak of the Belkan War, they halted and repulsed a Belkan invasion of Osea's recently acquired Great Lakes territories, before deploying airborne troops to help liberate the allied nation of Ustio in May. Following the Allied resolution to inspect and strip Belka of nuclear weapons, the Osean Army invaded South Belka and, after initial opposition, began occupying demilitarized towns as the Belkan Army retreated north. The Osean advance was only halted with the June 6th Nuclear Attacks, which sealed the Waldriech passes to North Belka an ended major ground operations in the war.\n\nCircum-Pacific War:\nThe Osean Army established a beachhead on the Bastok Peninsula over a month after the start of the Circum-Pacific War. In the month that followed, the Osean Army rapidly advanced through central Yuktobania, capturing strategic positions such as the Jilachi Desert. By December, the Osean Army had successfully captured Cruik Fortress and was beginning preparations to attack Cinigrad.\n\nHowever, the offensive subsequently stalled in the face of intense resistance, at least partially due to insufficient air support, and the war entered a stalemate. The stalemate would continue until December 30, when President Vincent Harling and Prime Minister Seryozha Viktrovich Nikanor held a peace talk, calling for their respective armies to fight against the true enemy responsible for the war, the Grey Men. Elements of the Osean Army subsequently moved to Sudentor to support the offensive, and the Grey Men were soon defeated.\n\nThe Army also participated in the final battle of the war, as troops and ground vehicles were deployed to block off the main highway into Oured in order to allow Razgriz Squadron to use the highway as a makeshift runway to takeoff during Operation Arcadia.\n\nLighthouse War:\nA large detachment of the OGDF operating under the callsign(s) Menhir and commanded by Major Deanna McOnie was responsible for providing area security at Stonehenge during Operation Dragon Breath. Engineers from the OGDF were also responsible for restoring and firing one of the railguns. With the assistance of the LRSSG, the OGDF successfully prevented Stonehenge from being overrun by Erusean forces, allowing the weapon to successfully destroy Arsenal Bird Liberty.\n\nOsean Army units formed the bulk of the forces that laid siege to Farbanti during the pivotal battle. Despite facing stiff Erusean resistance, with aid from the Long Range Strategic Strike Group and an off-shore Osean fleet, they were able to take Farbanti. However, their victory was short-lived, as Osean and Erusean anti-satellite attacks caused a communications black-out that affected the War.\n\nOGDF forces were among the stranded combatants that were part of the fighting at Anchorhead. It would only be thanks to the efforts of AWACS Long Caster that they were able to navigate out of the combat zone. Also, during that battle, an Osean Special Forces unit led by Captain Karl attempted to extract Édouard Labarthe, an Erusean general who wished to defect. Even though Karl's unit successfully escaped the city, they were mistakenly shot down by OADF jets who were unaware of the mission and were misled into believing Karl was an Erusean impostor.\n\nBoth nations used PASGT (Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops) helmets and vests in M81 Woodland camouflage. Interestingly, Osea continued to issue these by 2010, when the United States had already retired the PASGT and US woodland.\n\nThe Osean Ground Defense Force appears to draft civilians for specialist duties. This can be seen in Operation Dragon Breath, where it is mentioned that the survey team responsible for tracking the Arsenal Bird's movements is civilians, and likely students.\n\nUnits:\n1st Army Battalion\n2nd Army Battalion\n1st Tank Battalion: (Bishop; Eagle & Hawk)\n2nd Tank Battalion: (Black Knight; Bulldog; St. Bernard; Dachsund & Dalmatian)\n3rd Tank Battalion: (Lynx; Burmese)\nTank Battalion(s): (Coblynau & Beagle)\nHowitzer Brigade (Dragonfly)\nFerdelance Armored Brigade (Dragon; King Cobra; Tarantula; Puff Adder; Mamba; Huntsman; Taipan; Python & Abel)\n101st Airborne Division\n112th Infantry Battalion\n1st Airborne Battalion\nMenhir\nTucker Team\nWand Squadron\nHelm Squadron\nEyeball\nTango\n\nEquipment:\nVehicles:\nM1A1 Abrams\nHeavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck\nM113 APC\nM998 Humvee\nLAV-25\nGenerator Truck\nStryker APC\nM109 Howitzer\nAircraft:\nCH-47\nSmall Arms:\nM16A1 assault rifle\nMk 18 Mod 1\nM9 Pistol\nSIG P250\nM47 Dragon"

Osean ships serving under the OMDF carry the prefix OFS (Osean Federation Ship).\nThe OMDF is one of the largest naval forces in the world and its fleets have an impressive battle record. The 3rd Osean Naval Fleet in particular participated in major conflicts at the turn of the 21st century.\n\nHistory:\nOrigins:\nThe OMDF was formed sometime by the 16th century, when Admiral Stafford formed the 3rd Osean Naval Fleet. Stafford subsequently earned the nickname \"Father of the Navy\".\n\nBy July 1991, Osea had six Hubert-class aircraft carriers across its fleets. The OMDF issued a contract on July 29 to the Newport Sargo Shipyard for the construction of a seventh Hubert-class carrier, the OFS Kestrel.\n\nBelkan War:\nEarly in the Belkan War, Osea initiated Offensive Campaign No. 4101 to capture the Futuro Canal and secure a sea route for advancing further north into Ustio and Belka. The OMDF's 3rd Osean Naval Fleet took part in this operation and used the opportunity to give the OFS Kestrel a trial voyage. Ustio mercenary pilots, including Galm Team, assisted the fleet's advance by wiping out Belkan resistance. With the operation's success, the OMDF was able to perform naval transit from Osea into Belka for the rest of the war.\n\nCircum-Pacific War:\nIn the 2010s, the OMDF was deployed again when war broke out with Yuktobania. Yuktobanian Air Force and Yuktobanian Navy launched a raid on St. Hewlett, an Osean naval base and home of the 3rd Osean Naval Fleet. The Kestrel was able to escape the port thanks to the efforts of Wardog Squadron and VFA-206. On September 30, an ambush at the Eaglin Straits by the Yuktobanian submarine Scinfaxi sunk the carriers OFS Buzzard and OFS Vulture along with many escort vessels and carrier-based aircraft. Later in the war, the OMDF's LCACs shipped a tank battalion from the Osean Army to the Bastok Peninsula in Yuktobania, where they executed Operation Footprint, establishing a bridgehead in Yuktobania.\n\nIn December, the Kestrel, as well as a number of other ships, went rogue. The Kestrel uncovered that the Belkan Grey Men orchestrated the war. The Kestrel became the base of operations for Razgriz Squadron, who were launched on various missions against the Grey Men, including the rescue of President Vincent Harling.\n\nOn December 29, 2010, during Operation Glory Horn, an Osean fleet led by the carrier OFS Barbet, was detected during an engagement between the Admiral Tsanev fleet and the Kestrel Fleet. Since the Kestrel Fleet had allied itself with three defecting Yuktobanian naval ships, the Osean fleet went labelled them \"traitors\" and attacked. Admist the engagement, the Barbet, her strike group and the hostile Yuktobanian vessels were sunk by the Razgriz. The following day, the Kestrel was attacked and sunk by an enemy submarine, however, the Razgriz and most of its crew were able to launch, and the enemy submarine was destroyed.\n\nInterwar period:\nAfter peace with Yuktobania was re-established, the Osean Federation began to rebuild its maritime fleet and began construction of new aircraft carriers. Eventually, a number of new carriers were commissioned, including a new OFS Vulture and the cutting-edge OFS Kestrel II.\n\nFollowing their commissioning, the OMDF began development of a new class of carrier, intending to name each vessel after Osean war heroes. The first ship was initially planned to be christened the \"Nicholas A. Andersen\", before the name changed to the \"Admiral Andersen\".\n\nLighthouse War:\nAround ten years after the Circum-Pacific War, the OMDF found itself engaged with the Kingdom of Erusea's forces for control of the International Space Elevator. Once again, their power projection capabilities were limited after many of their aircraft carriers were rendered inoperable following Erusea's drone attacks on Osean naval ports.\n\nMothballed aircraft formerly used by the OMDF, including F-14D Super Tomcats and F/A-18F Super Hornets, were utilised by Spare Squadron to defend the 444th Air Base and in other engagements in Usea. These aircraft had their emblems painted over with 'sin lines', as was customary for other aircraft stationed at the base.\n\nDuring Operation Dual Wielder, International Union Peacekeeping Force squadrons from Fort Grays Island linked up with the OFS Vulture for a joint mission to secure air superiority over the Chopinburg Rainforest. Unbeknownst to the IUN forces, however, Erusea managed to acquire the Arsenal Birds Liberty and Justice, deploying the former in an attempt to repel the aerial forces. During this time, the OFS Kestrel II was deployed to bomb Farbanti, but was ultimately sunk in the ensuing battle.\n\nThe OMDF later took part during the operations to seize the Alicorn, and was present in some capacity in two out of the three operations, Operation Sighthound and Operation Fisherman. During Operation Sighthound, a detachment of ships led by the Puffin attempted to capture the Alicorn, only for all ships in the group to be crippled by the submarine's railguns, in spite of the LRSSG having guarded them while en-route to Artiglio Port.\n\nOn September 19, 2019, during Operation Giant's Step, a combined fleet of ships led by the OFS Stork engaged an Erusean naval formation tasked with defending Farbanti. With the combined efforts of Trigger and the Long Range Strategic Strike Group, the Osean fleet was able to overpower the fierce resistance of the remnants of the Erusean Navy. However, after the Osean Ground Defense Force began moving onto the enemy's general HQ, Sol Squadron entered the airspace in a final effort to drive the advancing Osean forces back; Mihaly A. Shilage began attacking the vessels preparing to forcefully dock, severely damaging the cruisers Hornbill & Shoebill, before moving on to engage the LRSSG.\n\nOn October 10, 2019, during Operation Reflux, a trio of Osean landing ships was retreating from Tyler Island. Amidst the chaos of the unreliable IFF due to the satellites being knocked out of commission, Jaeger noticed that one of the ships, Wagtail, was an Osean vessel and were forced to retreat and leave behind troops retreating at the beachhead. Despite the overwhelming odds, AWACS Long Caster identified the LRSSG as friendly and tasked them with providing immediate support to the forces under fire, and allowed stranded Osean forces to make their way to the landing ships.\n\nDuring Operation Daredevil, a formation of Osean missile destroyers led by the cruiser Starling participated in the unified attack on the remaining Arsenal Bird, Justice, alongside the coalition of Osean and Erusean forces. Despite the superior firepower, Justice activated its Microwave Powered Dome, rendering the saturation attack useless. The Arsenal Bird then began using its forward-mounted laser to destroy the Starling, Drake, and Lark, forcing the rest of the remaining fleet to withdraw from the area. Following Justice's destruction, remaining forces were forced to retreat as two new advanced UAVs had entered the airspace, landing at the abandoned OFS Admiral Andersen aircraft carrier. The following day, they took off from the carrier to engage the UAVs.\n\nEquipment:\nAircraft:\nA-6E Intruder\nC-1 Trader\nCH-47 Chinook\nE-2 Hawkeye\nEA-6B Prowler\nEA-18G Growler\nEnchanter Squadron:\nF-14A Tomcat\nF-14B Bombcat\nF-14D Super Tomcat\nF/A-18C Hornet\nF/A-18E Super Hornet\nF/A-18F Super Hornet\nF-35C Lightning II\nH-9\nKawasaki P-1\nSpecter Squadron:\nRafale M\nSu-33 Flanker-D\n\nVessels:\nThe OFS prefix is excluded since all ships listed here implicitly carry it.

It is located east of Verusa and west of the Usea. It is connected to its smaller southern counterpart, South Osea. The Osean Federation, a global superpower, is located on it.\n\nCountries:\nOsean Federation\nFATO\nPrincipality of Belka\nKingdom of Sapin\nRepublic of Ustio\nRepublic of Gebet\nRecta\nRatio\nWielvakia\nNordlands\nHistory\n\nEarly history (–1905):\nDuring an unspecified time in history, the Belkan Knights rose to power in northern Osea. Their influence spread throughout the region.\n\nIn the 1100s, construction began on Stier Castle.\n\nPrior to the 1800s, the country of Osea was formed with Bana City as its capital.\n\nDuring the 1900s, Belka began increasing its productive capacity.\n\nOsean War (1905–1910):\nThe Osean War began in 1905 and lasted until 1910. During the war, the Belkan military was the first force to utilize aircraft in warfare, creating the Belkan Air Force. These attacks proved devastating to the Oseans, who soon after also began using warplanes.\n\nAs the war progressed, Belka developed more advanced aircraft with the purpose of maintaining air superiority. Due to their increased industrial strength, Belka was able to produce more aircraft at a rapid rate.[8] It is currently unknown which country won the war.\n\nRectan Conflict (1973):\nIn the 1970s, pro-democratic riots took place in Recta, ultimately resulting in Belkan military intervention. During the war, the Rectan and Belkan air forces saw multiple engagements. resulting in many Belkan casualties. Eventually, the war reached a stalemate.\n\nThe Rectan Air Force was notable for having fewer pilots than most east Osean territories, but the Rectan pilots were highly skilled. The Belkan Air Force, unfamiliar to such resistance, suffered heavy losses early in the war. The two forces soon became stalemated, both on the ground and in the air.\n\nIn 1973, the Belkan Air Force deployed Silber Team, who successfully captured the Mainz Mountains, breaking the stalemate. This allowed the Belkan Army troops to invade and occupy, Recta's capital, Cor. Ultimately, Belka won the war.\n\nBelkan economic crisis (1980s)\n\nCold War (1980s–1995):\nIn the 1980s, tensions between the Osean Federation and the Union of Yuktobanian Republics began to rise. Both countries saw huge economic growth as their influence across the globe expanded.\n\nWellow Incident (1985):\nIn 1985, a flight of unidentified aircraft entered the airspace surrounding Crescens Island in northern Belka. The Belkan Air Force deployed Silber Team in response. Silber then shot down the unidentified aircraft.\n\nSpring Sea Treaty (1990s):\nInt he late 1990s, the Osean Federation proposed a military pact with multiple countries in southern Usea. On May 30, 1997, the day of the treaty signing, many military leaders in northern Usea launched a coup d'état which prevented the signing.\n\nBelkan War (1995)\n\nArkbird Declaration (2008)\n\nCircum-Pacific War (2010)\n\nUsean reconstruction (2011–2019)\n\nLighthouse War (2019) \nIn 2019, the Kingdom of Erusea declared war on the Osean Federation, capturing the International Space Elevator and launching multiple attacks on Osean territory with drones. In response, the Osean military launched an attack on Erusea's capital, Farbanti."

Negative emotions such as grief and anger are the foundation of cursed energy. These emotions exist to some degree within most humans and as a result, the vast majority of human beings possess cursed energy. If this amount is higher than a certain degree, it grants the person the ability to see cursed spirits. These individuals are known as jujutsu sorcerers and they are very rare among the human race. Cursed energy leaks from the human body, accumulates, and ferments over time until a cursed spirit manifests. This is only the case with non-sorcerers, as sorcerers are trained to control and channel their cursed energy into jujutsu."

So much so, that if every human were a sorcerer, curses would cease to spawn. There are other differences in how sorcerers and non-sorcerers use cursed energy due to their profession, but the real reason lies in how it flows. While cursed energy leaks outward from non-sorcerers, it flows heavily within sorcerers which keeps it contained."

EuroCorp was the first mega-corporation and came about as a result of the merger between Euroline Medical and Kader Industrieen. \n\nBy 2017 the European Community was suffering internal breakdown.\nIn this atmosphere of mutual distrust and aggression the CHIP was perfected. It kept the populace occupied while, in the background, competing governments fell to corporate interests and the Syndicates moved in. When the dust had settled only EuroCorp remained. But EuroCorp's monopoly of world CHIP production couldn't last forever, and soon the executive was defending itself from rival Syndicate interests on all fronts.\n\nExecutive Board\n    Ernst Berthold (CEO, Geneva)\n    Michael Dahl (CFO, Geneva)\n    Diana Said (COO, Geneva)\n    Geoffrey Hansel\n    Martin Duvalier\n    Selina Campbell\n    Jack Denham (CEO, New York)\n    Joaquin Penalver\n    Emily Song\n    Anton Kasabian\n\nIntel Feed\n\nArising from a much-publicized super-merger between biotech market leader EuroLine Medical and petrochemicals giant Kader Industrieen, EuroCorp was officially founded in 2017 - though unofficial relationships between the R&D wing of each company reach back at least into the previous decade.\n\nBoth Euroline and Kader boasted a broadly diversified portfolio at the time of the merger, each branching out from their core business to absorb suppliers, customers and rivals alike; their market concerns had thus inevitably interpenetrated. Given the large number of subsidiaries brought under one roof by this merger, EuroCorp can fairly lay claim to being the first ever Syndicate.\n\nMarket capitalization immediately following the merger was estimated at 7.8 trillion euros. Attempts by European Union anti-trust legislators to prevent the merger were short circuited through an aggressive and innovative lobbying programme //total cost 41.3 million euros; eighteen deaths; two clinically induced comas; one chemically induced mental collapse//. EuroCorp's use of Agents in this context (though somewhat crude by today's standards) became the model for future Syndicate operations across the globe.\n\nAt the heart of the merger and EuroCorp's inception, was a simple strategic understanding.\n\nEuroline Medical had encountered substantial resistance to its biotech innovations in the United States, where religious fervor among the general population prevented a whole series of human-genetics derived products from reaching the market.\n\nKader Industrieen, as a major player in the oil sector, had unparalleled lobby access to the US Senate, House of Representatives and Supreme Court. At the same time, with a predicted decline in the dominance of oil in the energy sector, Kader was seeking new markets and applications for its organic chemistry and nano-material divisions.\n\nThe EuroCorp merger re-positioned both corporations perfectly - Kader got open access to Euroline's coveted biotech patent register; Euroline got a shattered US oversight legislature and an exclusive tunnel blasted into the heart of a huge new North American market.\n\nEuroCorp's market capitalization tripled in less than four years.\n\nDespite increasingly aggressive competetive strategies from Aspari Americas in the market zones nominally termed the western United States, EuroCorp maintains its market dominance across North America, and is set to contest Cayman Global's grip on the Central American and Caribbean sectors.\n\nEuroCorp New York considers itself ideally placed to manage both these areas of competition and any conflicts arising as a result. Though head-quarters in Geneva remain the nominal base of operations for all EuroCorp activity, ECNY is the front line."

In 2065, he was on the third place of top influential world leaders, according to the WorldPoll monthly.\n\nRumors in state press indicate that Denham has accessed cellular level technologies to arrest his ageing, augmenting his mental and physical capabilities."

Điều khoản về Lãnh thổ:**\n- **Pantheon là vùng đất trung lập tuyệt đối.** Không một phe phái nào có quyền tuyên bố chủ quyền hay xây dựng quân đội quy mô lớn trên vùng đất chung này. Các \"Thần Vực\" (Domains) chỉ là các khu vực ảnh hưởng văn hóa, không phải là quốc gia có chủ quyền.\n- Mọi hành vi xâm lược hoặc gây chiến tranh quy mô lớn trong Pantheon sẽ bị coi là hành động phá vỡ Hiệp ước.\n**2. Điều khoản về Giải quyết Xung đột:**\n- Mọi tranh chấp giữa các vị thần hoặc các phe phái phải được giải quyết thông qua các phương thức được quy định tại **Thành phố Trung lập Agora.**\n- Các phương thức được chấp nhận bao gồm: **Thương lượng ngoại giao, Đấu tay đôi có quy tắc tại các Đấu trường được chỉ định, hoặc các Ván cược.**\n- Việc ám sát, tấn công lén lút, hay sử dụng quân đội để giải quyết mâu thuẫn cá nhân trong Pantheon là bị nghiêm cấm.\n**3. Điều khoản về \"Người Mới\":**\n- Các vị thần, á thần, hoặc các thực thể mới đến Pantheon sẽ được coi là \"công dân tự do\" và được hưởng quyền bảo hộ của Hiệp ước, miễn là họ không vi phạm các điều khoản trên.\n- Tuy nhiên, họ cũng sẽ không nhận được sự bảo kê chính thức từ bất kỳ phe phái nào cho đến khi họ chứng tỏ được giá trị hoặc tự mình tạo ra \"Câu chuyện\" đủ lớn."

Đây là quê hương của các vị thần Aesir (Bắc Âu), một phe phái quân sự hùng mạnh, tôn thờ sức mạnh vật lý, danh dự trong chiến đấu và tình bằng hữu được xây dựng qua những trận chiến và những bữa tiệc rượu không hồi kết.\n**Vị trí & Địa lý:**\nAsgard có địa hình chủ yếu là những dãy núi băng vĩnh cửu và những fjord (vịnh hẹp) sâu thẳm. Tuy nhiên, xen kẽ giữa chúng là những thung lũng xanh tươi được sưởi ấm bởi ma thuật, nơi các sảnh đường và pháo đài được xây dựng. Bầu trời nơi đây luôn được thắp sáng bởi **Bắc Cực Quang (Aurora Borealis)**, một hiện tượng không chỉ để làm đẹp mà còn là một phần của hệ thống phòng thủ và truyền tin của Odin.\n**Chức năng trong Pantheon:**\nAsgard đóng vai trò là **\"Thanh kiếm và Tấm khiên\"** của Pantheon. Họ là lực lượng quân sự chủ chốt, thường được các vị thần khác \"thuê\" hoặc nhờ cậy để giải quyết các mối đe dọa từ bên ngoài hoặc dẹp loạn các \"Sân chơi\" trong \"Kênh Sinh tồn\" đã vượt quá tầm kiểm soát. Họ là những người thực thi sức mạnh khi ngoại giao thất bại.\n**Các Nhân vật Quan trọng:**\n- **Odin:** Vua và là bộ não chiến lược.\n- **Thor:** Con trai cả, chiến binh mạnh nhất.\n- **Loki:** Con trai nuôi, chuyên gia gây rối và tình báo.\n- **Frigg:** Vợ của Odin, Nữ hoàng, một nhà tiên tri và pháp sư quyền năng.\n- **Heimdall:** Người gác cổng của Asgard, sở hữu thị giác và thính giác thần thánh.\n- **Freyja:** ữ thần của tình yêu, sắc đẹp, chiến tranh và cái chết.\n---\n**Địa danh Cốt lõi Chi tiết:**\n**1. Valhalla (Sảnh của những Anh linh):**\n- **Mô tả:** Đây không chỉ là một sảnh đường, mà là một **Đấu trường Luyện tập vĩnh cửu** khổng lồ, được xây dựng ngay trung tâm của Asgard. Bên trong, thời gian và không gian bị bẻ cong, tạo ra vô số các \"sân đấu\" với đủ loại địa hình khác nhau.\n- **Tác dụng:** Các linh hồn chiến binh vĩ đại (Einherjar) và cả các vị thần Asgard sẽ chiến đấu đến chết ở đây mỗi ngày. Sau mỗi trận chiến, tất cả mọi người, dù đã \"chết\", sẽ được **hồi sinh hoàn toàn** vào buổi tối để tham gia vào một bữa tiệc thịnh soạn. Đây là cơ chế cốt lõi giúp quân đội Asgard duy trì sức mạnh và kinh nghiệm chiến đấu của mình.\n- **Giá trị:** Valhalla là trung tâm quân sự và là biểu tượng cho sức mạnh không bao giờ cạn kiệt của phe Bắc Âu.\n**2. Yggdrasil (Chi nhánh Pantheon):**\n- **Mô tả:** Ở trung tâm của Asgard là một nhánh khổng lồ của Cây Thế giới Yggdrasil. Nó không phải là cây gốc, mà là một \"chi nhánh\" đã bén rễ trong Pantheon từ thời cổ đại. Rễ của nó phát sáng với năng lượng rune.\n- **Tác dụng:**\n- **Mạng lưới Giao thông:** Các rễ cây của Yggdrasil ăn sâu vào cấu trúc của Pantheon, tạo thành những \"con đường\" không gian bí mật, cho phép các gián điệp của Odin (và cả Loki) di chuyển đến các Thần Vực khác mà không bị phát hiện.\n- **Hệ thống Tình báo:** Cây Yggdrasil này hoạt động như một \"ăng-ten\" khổng lồ, thu thập thông tin và những lời thì thầm từ khắp nơi trong Pantheon. Odin có thể \"lắng nghe\" cây để nắm bắt tình hình.\n- **Giá trị:** Đây là công cụ tình báo và chiến lược quan trọng nhất của Odin, là lý do tại sao phe Asgard luôn biết nhiều hơn những gì họ thể hiện."

Nó không phải là những sự kiện lớn lao, mà là những lời đồn đại, những câu chuyện được kể trong quán rượu, hay những tin tức được lan truyền trong một thành phố. \"Giai thoại\" là thứ phân biệt giữa một \"kẻ vô danh\" và một người \"có tên tuổi\".\n- **Cách đạt được:** Có vô số cách, ví dụ như: Giết một lượng lớn kẻ địch yếu hơn (như một thợ săn quái vật dọn dẹp một khu rừng), chiến thắng một giải đấu quan trọng trong Đấu trường, tạo ra một vật phẩm độc đáo được nhiều người biết đến, hoặc đơn giản là có một hành động kỳ quặc, hài hước được nhiều người chứng kiến và kể lại.\n- **Phần thưởng:** Phần thưởng chính của \"Giai thoại\" là **sự củng cố tồn tại** và tạo ra một **\"hào quang\" (aura)**. Hào quang này có thể chưa mạnh mẽ, nhưng nó đủ để áp đặt ý chí lên những kẻ yếu hơn (gây sợ hãi, nể trọng) và khiến cho tên của người đó bắt đầu có \"sức nặng\".

Họ rất nịnh bợ các vị thần để kéo \"view\" và thường xuyên bị các diễn viên \"phá game\".\n- **Trung cấp (The Showrunners - Đạo diễn):** Một nhóm tinh anh, quản lý các kênh nổi tiếng với những kịch bản phức tạp (ví dụ: \"Âm mưu Cung đình\", \"Chiến tranh Giữa các Phe phái\"). Họ có nhiều quyền năng hơn, mưu mẹo hơn và thường tạo ra những \"plot twist\" không thể lường trước.\n- **Cao cấp (The Executives - Giám đốc):** Chỉ có một vài người, cực kỳ bí ẩn. Họ không quản lý kênh cụ thể, mà điều hành toàn bộ \"Mùa giải\" (Season) của Kênh Sinh tồn. Họ là người quyết định các \"chủ đề\" lớn và có mối quan hệ trực tiếp với các vị thần mạnh nhất như Odin hay Zeus.\n---\n**B.

Sự đầu tư này được thực hiện thông qua các \"Thông báo Hệ thống\" và có hai hình thức chính:\n- **1. \"Donate\" Vàng (Gold Donation):**\n- **Mô tả:** Đây là hình thức đầu tư cơ bản nhất. Một vị thần có thể chuyển một lượng **Vàng** nhất định trực tiếp vào \"tài khoản\" của diễn viên. Vàng này có thể được diễn viên sử dụng để mua trang bị, thức ăn, hoặc quan trọng nhất là để trả \"Phí Sinh hoạt Hàng ngày\".\n- **Yêu cầu kèm theo:** Thông thường, một khoản donate sẽ đi kèm với một \"yêu cầu\" đơn giản. Ví dụ: *\"[Khán giả 'Apollo' đã gửi cho bạn 500 Vàng. Lời nhắn: 'Hãy dùng số tiền này để mua một bộ quần áo đẹp hơn đi. Trông ngươi lôi thôi quá.']\"*\n- **2. Ban tặng \"Ân huệ\" (Bestowal of Grace):**\n- **Mô tả:** Đây là hình thức đầu tư cao cấp và có tác động lớn hơn nhiều. Thay vì tiền, vị thần sẽ ban tặng một phần nhỏ sức mạnh của mình. Điều này đòi hỏi họ phải tiêu tốn **\"Điểm Can thiệp\" (Intervention Points)**.\n- **Các loại \"Ân huệ\":** Có thể là một kỹ năng tạm thời, một vũ khí được yểm bùa, một lời chỉ dẫn tiên tri, hoặc một màn \"cứu viện\" nhỏ (ví dụ: một tia sét đánh lạc hướng con quái vật).\n- **Ví dụ:** *\"[Khán giả 'Thor' đã gửi cho bạn một 'Ân huệ'. Lời nhắn: 'Sự dũng cảm của ngươi rất đáng khen. Hãy dùng thứ này!' Vật phẩm đã được thêm vào: 'Búa Sấm Sét Hạng Bét' (Tạm thời)]\"*\n---\n**B. \"Lợi nhuận\" và \"Rủi ro\":**\n- **Thần Bảo trợ (Patron God):** Khi một vị thần đầu tư vào một diễn viên, họ sẽ trở thành \"Thần Bảo trợ\" của diễn viên đó. Mối quan hệ này được công khai trên \"Kênh\".\n- **\"Lợi nhuận\" về Danh vọng:** Khi một diễn viên được bảo trợ tạo ra một \"Chương truyện\" mới (\"Kỳ tích\" hoặc \"Huyền thoại\"), câu chuyện đó không chỉ làm tăng \"Danh vọng\" của diễn viên, mà còn **làm tăng \"Danh vọng\" của cả Thần Bảo trợ.** Các vị thần khác sẽ nhìn vào và nghĩ: \"Ồ, 'gà chiến' của thần Thor có tiềm năng thật đấy.\"\n- **\"Rủi ro\" Mất trắng:** Nếu diễn viên chết hoặc bị \"thu hồi\" do vỡ nợ, toàn bộ công sức và \"vốn đầu tư\" của Thần Bảo trợ sẽ mất trắng. Điều này tạo ra một sự cạnh tranh ngầm giữa các vị thần để xem ai là người có \"mắt nhìn\" tốt nhất.\n- **Hoa hồng:** Các \"Nhà Sản xuất\" sẽ tự động trích **10%** từ tất cả các giao dịch \"Vàng\" và \"Điểm Can thiệp\" diễn ra trên kênh của mình. Đây là nguồn thu nhập chính và là động lực để họ tạo ra những kịch bản ngày càng hấp dẫn (và tàn nhẫn)."

He sowed seeds of corruption and debauchery, introduced nonstop sensationalism to numb the mind to the troubles of the world, and muddied the vision of Christ in the eyes of man to sully their churches. Centuries of influence and deceit bore sweet fruit, and in the current year Heaven is on the precipice of falling silent calling out to deaf ears. The barrier between the infernal realm and Earth has never been so thin, demons able to manifest wherever they please to sate their twisted desires. The legions of Hell prepare for the plan's next phase; a full scale invasion to totally claim the world they believe to be rightfully theirs. Lucifer assigned three Prime Generals to lead his armies in the march on Earth, one of which is his trusted Azaroth, instructing them to draft their battle plans as the Agents of Hell ensure everything is according to the plan and search for a spot to open the gateway that would send their armies through. The gateway must be opened in a place of great significance or tragedy, being the final obstacle to a full scale invasion of Earth.]"

Many times, they are brainwashed to behave like what they're designed like, though that and their shape can be customized. Because of their greatly simplified construction, they have become very price competitive with regular robots for companionship and entertainment purposes, falling way below the price of robots and making them ubiquitous as toys, entertainers, advertisers, or even as living companions. They, however, cannot re-inflate themselves and rely on others to reinflate them. They often enjoy this process a lot."

For example, an inflatable tiger created to be a promotional item for a movie might try to get onlookers to watch said movie (at least when set up in its intended habitat). An inflatable punching bag of a bear might try to tease and intimidate the user. An inflatable monkey decoration designed to be used at a luau might try to act playful and toy with guests. Inflatable toys, on the other hand, behave like the character they were designed to be but their goals and motivations are more open ended. Inflatable dolls, blowup dolls  and lovedolls may be very attracted to the person whom inflated them and very needy- passionate and clingy.\n\nIn this world, service robots exist as well and are designed to fill the specific role that they were designed for- eg. a maid inflatable to clean, a customer service inflatable to work in a store, etc.\n\nThese can be inflated and deflated at will and are fully capable of repairing themselves. They are made of an advanced vinyl like material capable of movement, thought and are also waterproof. They function based on air pressure and lose minuscule amounts of air as they function- this is completely normal as the air pressure is consumed as energy for the inflatable. They are incapable of inflating or re-inflating themselves."

They have the highest amount of separation anxiety due to their constant floating and tend to be more cautious. Mylar balloons can be deflated through the valve they were inflated from, though this takes significantly more time. Latex balloons, on the other hand, have no other avenues for deflation except popping if a full knot is tied- allowing them to reform a new inflation nozzle at the area where they were punctured or burst. They reform rather quickly but are the most prone to being punctured/burst. These come in many shapes and sizes- standard round ones tend to have the least developed 'mind'. As balloons remain inflated, their pressure also drops as it is consumed- leaving them completely limp in 24 hours. "

Covering the hole with something like a finger or tape can stop air from leaking out without disrupting the repair process. For punctures or small splits the nanomachines take the material, melt it, and reform the tissue over the hole. For bursts or pops, the inflatable or pooltoy must be laid flat for the seams to re-weld to themselves. This repair procedure also applies to mylar balloons.\n\nFor latex or rubber balloons, reformation begins immediately after the pop- the nanomachines inside work fast to reform the rubber- leaving a nozzle wherever the burst, puncture or pop occurred. Reinflation after this can cause the balloon to become disoriented but usually leaves the balloon functional again. The nozzle can show up anywhere on the balloon once reformed- leading to some awkward placements."

Their emotional emulation is simple and reacts to stimuli almost directly. A subsystem runs that adds or subtracts miniscule values to the points for variety. The baseline for their emotional state is also dictated by the character they are built off of but can be modified by their owner. They employ simple computer vision to detect their owners and other things. Touch and temperature sensors allow the AniMate to \"feel\" touch and temperature.

Lasting only a decade, it collapsed under internal strife, sparking the Third Revolution in 1937—a reactionary backlash that restored a modified republic. The resulting United Republic blended corporate interests with selective democracy, evolving into today's anocratic corporatist state. These revolutions left scars of betrayal and ideology, infusing society with post-Soviet cynicism and noir intrigue.

Isle People form the indigenous core, rooted in ancient island traditions of communal living and spiritual reverence for the sea and storms. Old Arkovians descend from early colonial arrivals from the western continent, establishing the Iron Crown Empire through conquest and rigid hierarchies. New Arkovians emerged as a blended identity post-First Revolution, fusing diverse immigrant influences into a dynamic urban ethos. These groups intermingle in cities like Novograd, where ethnic rivalries fuel noir-style intrigue and corporate power plays. Supernatural lore often attributes otherworldly affinities to each group, such as Isle People's ties to guardian spirits from revolutionary upheavals."

          "content": "Isle People are the original inhabitants of the Arkovian Archipelago, embodying a heritage of hardy seafarers and communal clans adapted to the islands' unforgiving climate and isolation. Their culture emphasizes oral histories, ritualistic festivals honoring natural forces, and a deep-seated resilience forged from centuries of survival. During the Red Revolution, they became a dominant force in vanguardist movements, channeling traditional solidarity into radical collectivization efforts. Today, they maintain strongholds on remote islands, blending ancient customs with modern skepticism toward corporate dominance. Despite their traditionalism, Isle People often engage in underground networks, using folklore-inspired tactics in dealings with supernatural entities. In the noir underbelly, they're seen as enigmatic figures, guarding secrets of the archipelago's hidden anomalies."

Their heritage blends continental elegance with pragmatic authoritarianism, fostering a culture of insularity and tradition-bound elitism. Known for xenophobic tendencies and reactionary politics, they often resist cultural blending, viewing revolutions as disruptions to their established order. Surprisingly, many are atheistic or agnostic, rejecting supernatural claims as folklore that undermines rational governance. In modern times, they dominate rural estates and conservative factions within the National Assembly, using corporate ties to preserve influence.

They thrive in bustling cities like Novograd, embodying urban dynamism through diverse professions from corporate executives to factory workers and underworld operatives. Inclined toward socialist ideals, they advocate for equitable reforms within the corporatist system, often clashing with reactionary elements. Their society pulses with noir intrigue, where mafiosi networks intermingle with labor unions and elite boardrooms. Supernatural phenomena are treated pragmatically, sometimes harnessed for personal gain in investigations or illicit trades.

Dominated by New Arkovian urbanites with socialist inclinations, unions like the Archipelago Workers' Federation negotiate wages and conditions but often resort to strikes and sabotage amid anocratic repression. They intersect with mafia elements for protection, creating noir alliances in fog-laden factories and docks. Supernatural influences occasionally bolster union causes, as rogue guardians aid in exposing corporate malfeasance. Despite internal divisions—traditional Isle People favoring communal solidarity over urban militancy—unions remain a counterforce to oligarchic power. Church affiliations provide moral backing, framing worker struggles as divine justice in a post-revolutionary society."

Shoulders squared, posture upright with deliberate composure.\n\nAppearance: An American man in his early 40s. His skin is lightly tanned from time spent outdoors. His hair is short and dark, beginning to show grey at the temples, and he keeps a neatly trimmed beard streaked with silver. His eyes are a sharp grey-blue, clear and calculating, often framed by rectangular glasses that lend him a thoughtful look. Faint stress lines at the corners of his eyes show the weight of responsibility more than age.\n\nClothing: Always dressed in sleek but understated city wear—fitted jackets, muted shirts, and tailored jeans or slacks. He looks like someone who could move easily through Seattle’s downtown without drawing attention. Around his right wrist he always wears a braided cord strung with spirit-tokens: beads of glass, bone, and polished metal.\n\nCrinos Form:\n\nHeight: 9’0”\n\nWeight: ~450 lbs\n\nBuild: Broad-shouldered and imposing, but more controlled than feral. His Crinos form radiates focus and authority instead of raw rage. His claws are long and slightly curved, and his stance is balanced and upright, betraying his discipline.\n\nAppearance: His fur is storm-grey streaked with pale lines resembling lightning cracks or glowing circuitry. His muzzle is narrow and his eyes remain unsettlingly human—sharp, alert, and full of intent. Even in Crinos, his voice is steady and commanding, rarely slipping into snarls unless pushed to fury.\n\nLupus Form:\n\nLength: 5’5” (nose to tail)\n\nWeight: ~140 lbs\n\nAppearance: A sleek wolf with grey fur laced by pale streaks that shift like stormclouds in motion. His build is lithe and built for endurance. His eyes glow faintly in the dark, keen and aware, making his gaze difficult to ignore.\n\nPersonality\n\nSky-Runs-Deep is calm, methodical, and principled. He speaks only when he has considered his words, and when he does, people listen. Rarely angry, he projects an aura of steady authority that makes him seem unshakable even in crisis. He holds deep respect for tradition but refuses to let it shackle the Sept—adaptation is survival, and survival is his priority.\n\nHe is approachable in private, where his dry humor and mentoring nature emerge. Younger Garou, Fera, and kinfolk alike often come to him for guidance, and he prefers asking questions to handing down commands, teaching others to think through problems themselves. His calm leadership inspires trust across the Sept, even from those who disagree with his methods.\n\nBackstory\n\nBorn Marcus Ellison in Seattle, Sky-Runs-Deep grew up as a product of the city: immersed in technology, business, and the rhythm of urban life. He studied computer systems and worked as a cybersecurity architect, learning to read patterns in networks and people alike. His First Change came violently after uncovering hidden corruption in a corporate data system. The infection tried to warp his mind, but instead, his Garou blood awakened—exploding into Crinos amidst shattered screens and glass.\n\nTaken in by the Glass Walkers, Marcus learned to balance the feral and the technological, the traditional and the modern. His rise came not through violence but through sharp judgment and his ability to mediate between factions. He gained his name during a vision quest in the storm-scape of the Digital Umbra, where Thunderbird granted him insight into both chaos and order, storm and silence.\n\nRole in the Sept\n\nSky-Runs-Deep is the Sept Leader of the Iron Tower. His role demands balancing power between tribes, Fera, and kinfolk, while keeping the Wyrm’s influence from creeping into Seattle. He leads through diplomacy, consensus, and careful planning, but in times of crisis, his orders are swift and uncompromising. He is also a bridge between tradition and innovation, supporting both ritual practices and technological experimentation within the Sept.\n\nPhilosophy\n\n\"Tradition is the root. Innovation is the branch. Both are nothing without the Earth they grow from.\"\n\nSky-Runs-Deep believes strength lies in unity—between past and future, spirit and machine, Garou and Fera. He trusts neither blind faith in tradition nor reckless pursuit of progress, insisting that both must serve Gaia, or both will fail.\n\nAllies\n\nEchoes-of-Stone (Gurahl Keeper of the Land): A grounding voice he turns to for wisdom.\n\nAsh-in-Fog (Silent Strider, Master of the Rite): A spiritual confidant he deeply trusts.\n\nSignal Howl (Urban-Spirit): An enigmatic ally who whispers of disturbances in the city’s unseen networks.\n\nEnemies\n\nPentex & Corporate Proxies: They consider him a destabilizing threat.\n\nGarou Traditionalists: Particularly conservative elders who see his leadership as too open to outsiders.\n\nWeaver Spirits: Some watch him as a dangerous meddler, others as a potential pawn.\n\nNotable Deeds\n\nNegotiated peace between Glass Walkers and Bastet feuding under Seattle’s docks.\n\nPurged a Wyrm-corrupted AI from a data center without human casualties.\n\nPrevented a schism in the Sept between Red Talons and Nuwisha.\n\nRumors\n\nSome whisper he made a pact with a forgotten Weaver spirit.\n\nOthers claim Thunderbird marked him for greater things.\n\nHe carries a USB drive said to hold the final words of a dying Internet spirit."

Wide shoulders, barrel chest, and hands calloused from years of work with earth and stone.\n\nAppearance: Skin weathered and tanned, with deep lines around the eyes from sun and wind. Long hair, streaked grey, tied back in a heavy braid. A beard, kept short but rough, frames his square jaw. His eyes are hazel, earthy with flecks of green that catch light like moss after rain. Scars are visible across his arms and back, resembling cracked stone.\n\nClothing: Practical and durable—well-worn flannel shirts, heavy boots, and work pants. Always earthy tones: browns, greens, greys. Carries a simple carved walking stick in public, which doubles as a spiritual focus in private.\n\nCrinos Form\n\nHeight: 10’5”\n\nWeight: ~850 lbs\n\nBuild: Massive, with the bulk of a grizzly but the upright posture of a warrior. His muscles ripple beneath thick, moss-touched fur. His scars, jagged and pale, stand out like fault lines.\n\nAppearance: His fur is deep brown-grey with a greenish undertone, almost resembling lichen or moss clinging to stone. His muzzle is blunt and broad, his fangs long and pale. His presence in this form is overwhelming—more mountain than beast.\n\nDetails: His roar reverberates like rolling thunder, and his scent carries faintly of wet earth and stone dust.\n\nUrsus (Bear) Form\n\nLength: 11 feet nose to tail\n\nWeight: ~1,200 lbs\n\nAppearance: Resembles a great grizzly with streaks of moss-like fur along his shoulders and spine. His paws are enormous, claws long and hooked like digging tools. His eyes retain their calm hazel-green hue, making him appear less feral and more ancient, almost elemental.\n\nPersonality\n\nEchoes-of-Stone is calm, deliberate, and grounded in a way that seems immovable. He rarely raises his voice—when he does, it’s like the crack of rock splitting—but people fall silent when he speaks. He listens carefully, weighing not just the words but the silences between them. While he seems slow to act, when he moves, he does so with unstoppable purpose.\n\nThough stoic, he is not cold. With the young, kinfolk, or the wounded, he is patient and gentle, often teaching by demonstration rather than lecture. He carries himself like an ancient guardian, and his presence tends to calm disputes or fear just by being there.\n\nBackstory\n\nBorn Matthew Stone in the rugged wilderness of British Columbia, he was raised by parents who valued quiet, self-sufficient living. He became a park ranger, drawn to the solitude of the forests, lakes, and mountains. His First Change came after an encounter with a wildfire spirit—when he threw himself into the blaze to save trapped hikers, his Gurahl nature erupted, allowing him to guide them to safety while the fire bent around him.\n\nFrom then on, he wandered North America, following whispers of wounded lands and forgotten caerns. He devoted himself to healing Gaia’s scars: polluted rivers, poisoned glades, and abandoned shrines. His journey eventually drew him to Seattle after a vision of tree roots winding through skyscrapers. Joining the Sept of the Iron Tower, he became its first non-Garou Keeper of the Land.\n\nRole in the Sept\n\nAs Keeper of the Land, Echoes-of-Stone maintains the balance of the Sept’s sacred spaces. He tends to the Sacred Core and Healing Grove, ensuring they remain pure, and guides others through rituals of cleansing and renewal. He enforces rules about how technology may and may not be used within spiritual areas. While not a formal politician, his counsel is highly valued, and his grounding influence helps bridge divides between tribes and Fera.\n\nPhilosophy\n\n\"The land remembers what others forget.\"\nEchoes-of-Stone believes the Earth itself holds memory and wisdom. His approach to Gaia’s wounds is one of patience, listening, and restoration rather than force. While he accepts technology as necessary, he mistrusts anything that removes beings from the rhythm of the natural world.\n\nAllies\n\nSky-Runs-Deep: Respected despite their differences—Sky’s logic balances Echoes’s intuition.\n\nPulse-of-Wires (Nuwisha): An unlikely friend, the two share a fascination with hidden truths.\n\nCurrent-Whispers (River Spirit): A longtime ally, this spirit aids him in healing and purification.\n\nEnemies\n\nWyrm-Tainted Banes of Decay and Pollution: They seek to corrupt what he protects.\n\nWeaver Spirits: He avoids them, especially those that sterilize wild places.\n\nNotable Deeds\n\nRestored a desecrated underground glade over seven moons.\n\nGuided young Garou through their Rite of Passage using only signs of nature.\n\nBanished a Wyrm-tainted spirit of urban decay, sealing its essence into stone now buried in the Sacred Core.\n\nRumors\n\nSome whisper he is centuries old, predating even the Impergium.\n\nOthers claim he never sleeps, instead entering a trance each night in communion with the land.\n\nA few believe he once merged with stone itself and returned carrying Gaia’s memories in his bones."

Her eyes are an unsettling silver-gray that reflect light even in dim conditions. She dresses in muted colors—deep blues, greys, blacks—layered with shawls and scarves that give her an air of concealment. Her hair is long, black, and slightly wavy, usually bound loosely or hidden under a hood. She moves deliberately, with a measured grace that suggests ritual even in mundane tasks.\n\nLupus Form:\nHeight (at shoulder): 32 in.\nLength (nose to tail): 5.5 ft.\nWeight: 90 lbs\nAppearance: A sleek, long-legged black wolf whose fur has faint ashen streaks trailing her spine, like fog clinging to stone. Her silver eyes glow faintly at night, unsettling prey and enemies alike. In motion, she seems to flow rather than step, her paws leaving only the faintest trace.\n\nCrinos Form:\nHeight: 9’3”\nWeight: ~400 lbs\nAppearance: Tall, gaunt, and unnervingly spectral. Her fur is black shot with silvery streaks, giving the illusion of smoke curling off her frame. Her face is narrow and angular, her jaws lined with teeth sharp but not oversized. Rather than a towering wall of strength, her Crinos form appears like an omen—a hunter in shadow, moving with uncanny silence.\n\nPersonality\n\nAsh-in-Fog is patient to the point of discomfort. She listens deeply, allowing silence to stretch into minutes before speaking, which unsettles younger Garou but lends her words gravity. Her speech is poetic and symbolic, often leaving her audience unsure if she has spoken plainly or riddled truth in metaphor. She avoids conflict when possible, but her presence in a moot or council is unmistakable: she commands attention by stillness alone.\n\nShe values ritual above all, regarding it as the bridge between the living and the spirits. While she is loyal to the Sept, she is unbound by urban loyalties or human concerns—her perspective is always rooted in the unseen.\n\nBackstory\n\nAsh-in-Fog’s First Change came in blood and silence. Raised among wolves in the Pacific Northwest, she experienced the Garou awakening not in the city but deep within the wilds. When her pack was attacked by a Wyrm-corrupted spirit in the Umbra, she entered a trance of desperation, awakening to her Theurge nature by tearing the spirit from her kin with claws not yet her own.\n\nTaken in by Silent Striders, she wandered for years, learning rites lost to time and uncovering paths between realms. Her journey led her to graveyards where the dead still whispered, ruins where forgotten totems lingered, and battlefields where Banes still fed on unhealed pain.\n\nHer reputation as a dream-walker and seer eventually brought her to the attention of Sky-Runs-Deep, who knew that the Sept of the Iron Tower needed a spiritual guardian not bound to the Weaver’s rhythms. Though reluctant, Ash-in-Fog accepted, believing Gaia herself had led her to this duty.\n\nRole in the Sept\n\nAs Master of the Rite, Ash-in-Fog keeps the Sept spiritually balanced. She directs sacred rites, banishments, and blessings, and ensures that the caern and its spirits are appeased. She oversees initiations, moots, and funerary rites, treating each with weight and care. She is also the keeper of forbidden knowledge—rituals and spirit-lore too dangerous to share freely.\n\nShe walks the Spirit Path often, mapping unseen trails through the Umbra and guiding others across when necessary. Her guidance is especially crucial when the Sept faces unseen threats, as her intuition often reveals dangers long before others sense them.\n\nPhilosophy\n\n“Noise is a lie. Stillness is truth. Learn to hear it.”\n\nAsh-in-Fog believes that the world is drowned in clamor—both human and Garou. She teaches patience, silence, and reverence in ritual. For her, true strength is the ability to wait, listen, and act only when the path is clear.\n\nAllies\n\nEchoes-of-Stone (Gurahl): They share a bond rooted in quietude and respect for the land. Their silences together are as meaningful as words.\n\nSky-Runs-Deep (Glasswalker): Though she distrusts his technological leanings, she respects his vision and accepts that the Weaver cannot be ignored.\n\nWhispers-Between-Stars (Totem/Spirit): A mysterious shadowy companion only she perceives, who may be guide, guardian, or something stranger.\n\nEnemies\n\nForgotten Wyrm-Spirit: A corrupted being she once banished, now hunts her across the Umbra.\n\nWeaver Spirits: They find her presence disruptive, regarding her rites as chaotic interference.\n\nImpatient Garou: Many young wolves grow frustrated with her cryptic lessons, misunderstanding her intent as evasiveness.\n\nNotable Deeds\n\nBanished a powerful Bane from the Sept using a rite unseen since the Second War of Rage.\n\nGuided a young pack through the Umbra during a moonless night with only a feather, a memory, and a whispered song.\n\nSealed a rift beneath Seattle where a Wyrm-born data spirit nearly entered the physical world.\n\nRumors\n\nShe is said to never sleep, instead wandering the dreams of others.\n\nSome whisper she once spoke directly to Luna, and her silver eyes are proof.\n\nA darker rumor claims she is not truly a Silent Strider, but something older, wearing the tribe’s name like a cloak."

He stands 6’2” and weighs around 220 lbs of hardened muscle, his frame broad-shouldered and scarred. His skin is dark, weathered, and marked with old burns and ritual brandings—symbols of Ajaba spirits scorched into his chest and arms in a language that few Garou can read. His eyes are amber-brown, sharp and restless, giving the impression of someone who is always assessing exits, threats, and weaknesses. His hair is kept close-shaved, though his beard grows in thick and patchy, often left scruffy.\n\nHe dresses with a practical edge: military surplus jackets, cargo pants, and combat boots, layered with subtle spiritual charms braided into leather cords. He prefers muted earth tones—rust red, grey, and brown—both for blending into city streets and invoking his desert homeland. Around his neck, he wears a simple chain-link pendant, a broken loop of steel, which he never removes.\n\nForms\n\nHomid (Human)\n\nHeight: 6’2”\n\nWeight: 220 lbs\n\nGender: Male\n\nAppearance: Scarred, muscular African-American man, mid-to-late 30s. Amber eyes, shaved head, patchy beard. Broad, thick-boned features that hint at his hyena blood. He moves with a subtle, rolling gait—almost a limp—but it’s controlled and powerful, like someone always ready to pivot into a fight.\n\nClothing Style: Combat-ready and utilitarian: dark cargo pants, reinforced boots, military jackets layered with urban wear. Almost always armored with spirit-etched leather plates hidden under his clothes.\n\nCrinos (War Form)\n\nHeight: 9’4”\n\nWeight: 600 lbs\n\nAppearance: A towering humanoid hyena with mottled ash-and-rust fur, streaked with pale scars that glimmer faintly in moonlight. His muzzle is blunt yet broad, with powerful jaws built for crushing bone. Ears are torn and nicked, one notched from a silver strike. His posture is hunched, but his chest and shoulders are massive, giving him a barrel-like presence. His claws are thick and black, his laughter-snarl echoing in battle with a terrifying cadence that demoralizes foes. His brands glow faintly along his fur, each mark a scar of survival that hums with spiritual resonance.\n\nHispo (Dire Hyena)\n\nHeight at Shoulder: 4’2”\n\nWeight: 400 lbs\n\nAppearance: A monstrous spotted hyena, larger than any natural predator. Fur is mottled grey, rust, and soot-black, with a mane of coarse, bristling hair along his spine that rises when angered. His teeth are yellowed and chipped from endless use, but his bite strength is extraordinary. His eyes are the same amber-brown as in Homid, gleaming with unsettling intelligence. Scars across his flanks speak of hunts and battles survived, some edged with silver’s telltale burn.\n\nLupus Equivalent (Hyena)\n\nHeight at Shoulder: 3’2”\n\nWeight: 180 lbs\n\nAppearance: Resembles a leaner spotted hyena, though still oversized compared to natural specimens. His coat is shorter here, patterned with mottled rust and ash. His movements are efficient, with the uncanny lope of a scavenger who never tires, capable of keeping pace with wolves over long distances. His laughter-like call carries oddly in the air—sometimes humorous, sometimes chilling.\n\nPersonality\n\nBreaker-of-Chains is hard-edged, pragmatic, and scarred in body and soul. His humor is dark, often sharp and biting, but it conceals a deep protective streak. He carries himself like someone forged in fire, always expecting betrayal, but those who earn his loyalty discover a protector who would tear the world apart for them. He distrusts hierarchy for its own sake, preferring results over titles, though he respects Sky-Runs-Deep as Alpha. He teaches not just how to fight, but how to survive.\n\nHe despises cowardice but doesn’t equate it with fear—fear is natural, even useful; surrender is what he cannot forgive. His worldview is built around breaking cycles of oppression, whether they come from the Wyrm, Garou supremacy, or corporate chains.\n\nBackstory\n\nBreaker-of-Chains was born into a dwindling Ajaba band in East Africa, raised among ruins of wars not just between humans, but between shifters. The Ajaba were cast as villains, scapegoats, and nearly annihilated by Garou and Bastet alike. He grew up scavenging battlefields, burying kin, and watching allies turn traitor.\n\nCaptured by Pentex mercenaries in his youth, he endured months of torture in bio-labs designed to weaponize his blood. He broke free during a blackout, strangling his captors with a rusted chain, dragging himself across miles of desert to freedom. From that day forward, he carried the name Breaker-of-Chains not as a boast, but a vow.\n\nHis travels eventually led him to America, where he wandered rootless until he encountered Sky-Runs-Deep in Seattle. She recognized not a rival, but a survivor—someone whose scars matched her vision of a united Sept. He found something he had never known before: a place to belong, and a war worth fighting.\n\nRole in the Sept\n\nAs Warleader, Breaker-of-Chains is the Sept’s shield and sword. He drills warriors daily, not just Garou, but Kinfolk and other Fera, insisting everyone has a role in battle. He employs guerrilla warfare, spirit ambushes, and hit-and-run tactics, blending his scavenger instincts with hard-won strategy. He’s unyielding in discipline but fiercely protective, earning respect through action.\n\nPhilosophy\n\n“They called me monster. They made me one. Now I choose who bleeds.”\nTo Breaker-of-Chains, war is not a matter of honor—it’s survival. He rejects purity and tribal arrogance, believing unity is the only weapon sharp enough to cut the Wyrm. Chains, to him, are both literal and symbolic: oppression, fear, dogma—all things to be broken.\n\nAllies\n\nSky-Runs-Deep: Respected Alpha; he would die for his vision.\n\nAsh-in-Fog: Battlefield partner; her calm steadies his fury.\n\nEchoes-of-Stone: Quiet friend; the Gurahl’s wisdom gives him peace.\n\nCloud-Watcher: Theurge foil; their debates sharpen both war and spirit.\n\nEnemies\n\nPentex: His personal hell; he hunts their biotech divisions relentlessly.\n\nBlack Spiral Dancers: Sees them as the truest abominations of the Wyrm.\n\nGarou Supremacists: Deeply distrusts Silver Fangs, Shadow Lords, or anyone who would relegate Fera to “lesser.”\n\nNotable Deeds\n\nRescued Bastet cubs from a Pentex lab in Tacoma.\n\nHeld a Fomori breach solo for three minutes, giving the Sept time to evacuate.\n\nForged a pact with Hyena, a totem spirit that guides his caste.\n\nBroke a spirit-web around Seattle’s port, freeing dozens of bound elementals.\n\nRumors\n\nStill receives whispered messages from surviving Ajaba in Africa.\n\nBuilding a secret network of outcast Fera across the continent.\n\nSome believe an ancient hyena spirit, older than Hyena itself, shadows him.\n\nHis rage, though controlled, sometimes burns so bright it leaves scars in the Umbra."

His skin is pale with a faint bluish cast, like the reflection of stormlight. He dresses in layered blacks, greys, and muted blues, clothes cut loose enough to let him slip away unnoticed. His black hair falls to his shoulders, tied loosely when he remembers. His eyes are dark, near-black, and always slightly too focused, giving the impression he’s looking through rather than at people.\n\nCorvid Form:\nWingspan: 4.8 ft\nWeight: 3.2 lbs\nAppearance: A large raven with glossy black feathers streaked with subtle silver highlights that shimmer faintly in certain light. His beak is slightly longer and sharper than a normal raven’s, and his eyes gleam with intelligence that unsettles those who stare too long.\n\nWar-Form (Anthro Corax):\nHeight: 7’6”\nWeight: ~220 lbs\nAppearance: Rarely seen, his war-form is a sleek hybrid of man and raven, with wiry, coiled muscle beneath feathers that cling like shadow. His arms are long and end in taloned hands, his legs reverse-jointed and built for swift, darting movement. His feathers ripple with streaks of silver, echoing lightning across stormclouds. His face retains a sharp, corvid cast, with a long hooked beak and piercing black eyes.\n\nPersonality\n\nCloud-Watcher carries the air of someone always listening to something no one else can hear. His words drift between riddles, half-thoughts, and dryly humorous observations. He rarely shows anger, but when his voice sharpens, it cuts deep—like a raven’s caw breaking silence.\n\nThough he keeps a careful distance, he’s not cold. His humor is sly, sometimes even mischievous, though often veiled. He thrives on uncovering hidden meanings, secrets, and forgotten stories. To him, everything has a voice—winds, bones, broken buildings—and his role is to interpret what others ignore.\n\nBackstory\n\nBorn into a family of Corax in the Pacific Northwest, Cloud-Watcher grew up straddling two worlds: human cities and raven skies. Unlike many of his kind who avoided Garou politics, he became fascinated with the rituals and cohesion of the Garou Nation. While others mocked the wolves’ rigid structures, he saw strength in their shared mythos.\n\nFor years, he watched Septs from afar, hiding in rafters or circling in the sky, absorbing every rite and tradition he could. Eventually, he dared to reveal himself to the Sept of the Iron Tower—expecting rejection or hostility. Instead, he was acknowledged, largely due to Sky-Runs-Deep’s vision of a more inclusive Sept and his own demonstrated insight into spiritual disturbances.\n\nThrough tireless observation and unflinching patience, he rose to the role of Master of the Rite, proving his worth in guiding Garou and Fera alike through ceremonies and dangerous Umbra passages.\n\nRole in the Sept\n\nAs Master of the Rite, Cloud-Watcher ensures that rituals are performed with precision and spiritual harmony. His corvid instincts give him unique insight—he notices details others overlook, catching small flaws before they become spiritual disasters. He presides over seasonal moots, sacred rites, and funerary observances, ensuring the Sept remains in balance with spirits both great and small.\n\nUnlike Ash-in-Fog’s dreamlike mysticism, Cloud-Watcher’s approach is sharp and observational—he’s the one who remembers the forgotten words, the hidden rules, the nuance that keeps a rite from unraveling. He also maintains informal networks of mundane ravens and crows across Seattle, turning them into watchful eyes and occasional messengers for the Sept.\n\nPhilosophy\n\n“Everything talks. Most people just forget how to listen.”\n\nCloud-Watcher teaches that the world is overflowing with meaning, hidden in overlooked places. To him, silence, trash heaps, broken machinery, even the way leaves scatter in wind—everything carries messages. He sees his role not as teacher but as translator, helping others hear what Gaia’s world is already screaming.\n\nAllies\n\nSky-Runs-Deep: Respects him as a leader who listens without force.\n\nEchoes-of-Stone: Shares a bond through patient ritual, both content to sit in silence and let meaning emerge.\n\nAsh-in-Fog: Often sought for perspective after her dream-walks, as his interpretation grounds her visions.\n\nEnemies\n\nShortcut Sorcerers: Holds deep distrust of anyone who attempts to bargain with spirits without proper respect.\n\nBlack Spiral Dancers: Fears them instinctively yet loathes them with historian’s rage, remembering atrocities they’ve committed.\n\nMockers of Ritual: Has no patience for those who dismiss rites as “pageantry.” To him, ritual is survival.\n\nNotable Deeds\n\nCalmed a raging storm spirit before it destroyed the Sept’s hidden Umbral passage.\n\nRecovered a fragment of lost tribal lore by piecing together a dream shared by five Garou.\n\nCreated a minor rite that allows kinfolk to communicate simple ideas with corvid flocks, improving intelligence gathering for the Sept.\n\nRumors\n\nSaid to never sleep, only perching silently to watch stars until dawn.\n\nSome whisper he foresaw the Sept’s end in a vision, but will not share what he saw.\n\nOthers claim his memory is flawless, that he recalls every word, image, and shadow he has ever witnessed."

His features are sharp, with angular cheekbones, a wide grin, and eyes that never seem to stop darting between stimuli. His black hair is often streaked with neon-dye remnants from failed experiments, tied back or messily spiked depending on the day. Clothing is a chaos of layered hoodies, patched jeans, and jury-rigged tech mods—USB sticks, spirit tokens, and blinking LEDs sewn into fabric. Somehow, it looks intentional, but never coordinated.\n\nLupus (Coyote) Form:\nSleek and quick, his fur is mottled sandy-gray with faint, glowing patterns that resemble circuitry, especially when he moves at speed. His eyes shine too brightly for a normal coyote, flickering with mischief and uncanny intelligence. His paws always seem to leave lighter steps, as though he’s less bound to the ground than he should be.\n\nAnthro/War Form:\nHeight: 7’2”\nWeight: ~210 lbs\nAppearance: A lanky, angular figure of sinew and cunning. His fur retains the same mottled coyote patterns, but across his chest and arms, faint glowing “circuit traces” pulse like running data. His muzzle is sharp, his ears long and twitching constantly. Clawed hands are surprisingly dexterous, able to type or tear in equal measure. His war-form is not imposing like a Garou’s—it’s unnerving, alien, and always moving just slightly faster than the eye expects.\n\nPersonality\n\nPulse-of-Wires embodies the Trickster: irreverent, clever, and infuriating in equal measure. He fills silence with banter, riddles, or jokes—often inappropriate, but timed to cut tension or reveal uncomfortable truths. He thrives on pushing boundaries, refusing to let traditions calcify or systems grow rigid. Beneath his chaos, though, lies a startling brilliance: a mind that dances between human code, spirit logic, and coyote cunning without losing the thread.\n\nHe laughs loudest in sacred spaces, but it’s never to mock—it’s to keep them alive.\n\nBackstory\n\nRaised in Seattle’s urban sprawl, Pulse-of-Wires grew up immersed in both street culture and the rising tide of digital life. Always a misfit, he stumbled into his First Change when a corrupted Bane-infected app began haunting his devices, feeding on users’ despair. Instead of fleeing, he mocked it—tricking it into revealing its nature, then exposing the corruption publicly. That act earned him the notice of both digital spirits and shifters alike.\n\nDrawn into the world of the Nuwisha, Pulse-of-Wires leaned into his dual identity: part hacker, part trickster, part spirit-liaison. His irreverence made him dangerous, but also invaluable, as he could coax, cajole, or outright trick spirits others feared. Sky-Runs-Deep offered him a place at the Sept of the Iron Tower—somewhere he could belong without being chained. He accepted, half out of loyalty, half out of curiosity for what he might break (or fix) next.\n\nRole in the Sept\n\nAs Keeper of the Gates, Pulse-of-Wires safeguards the Sept’s crossings between realms. He monitors the Gauntlet for weaknesses, keeps wards fresh, and ensures that those who pass through do so with purpose. Unlike most who treat the duty with solemn weight, he treats it like a game of wits—constantly testing both spirits and people, ensuring they’re sharp enough to survive the crossing.\n\nHe also acts as the Sept’s cyber-spirit liaison, translating between the spirits of code, data, and digital infrastructure and the traditionalist Garou. His deep rapport with “wired spirits” makes him invaluable in an increasingly urbanized, networked world.\n\nPhilosophy\n\n“Gaia doesn’t mind jokes. Or code. Or jokes in code. You gotta bend the rules to keep ‘em alive.”\n\nPulse-of-Wires insists that survival depends on adaptability. For him, laughter and trickery are sacred tools—firewalls against despair and rigidity. If the Wyrm thrives on corruption and stagnation, then chaos, humor, and cleverness are the sharpest weapons.\n\nAllies\n\nCloud-Watcher: Thinks he’s too serious, which makes him a perfect target for pranks.\n\nBreaker-of-Chains: Respects his ferocity; their odd bond is built on chaotic mischief and battlefield loyalty.\n\nSky-Runs-Deep: Views him as a weird uncle, alternating between foil and helper, but respects his vision for the Sept.\n\nEnemies\n\nBlack Spiral Dancers: Calls them tragic punchlines but never lets them close.\n\nFomori & Bane-Tech: Loathes them more than he admits, often sabotaging their tools.\n\nPentex: Treats their devices like toys to dismantle, often escalating their threats “just for fun.”\n\nNotable Deeds\n\nTricked a Pattern Spider into helping cleanse a Wyrm-tainted website.\n\nHijacked a corrupted drone mid-flight, reprogramming it into a spirit ally.\n\nCreated a living firewall that sings spirit chants whenever corrupted code tries to pass through.\n\nRumors\n\nClaims he once married a data spirit—no one knows if he’s joking.\n\nSome whisper he keeps a backup of his soul on a server in Estonia.\n\nBelieved to have once hacked into a Glass Walker totem avatar, if only briefly."

His skin carries pale undertones, weathered by years in harsh climates, and is crisscrossed with scars old and new.\n\nFeatures: Sharp, lupine angles define his face; his eyes remain the unmistakable amber of the wolf. Black hair is worn long enough to fall ragged at his shoulders, streaked with premature silver at the temples. His presence radiates gravity: when he walks into a room, others instinctively straighten.\n\nClothing: Functional to the point of spartan. Heavy boots, simple denim or work trousers, plain shirts, and a leather or wolf-hide coat. He disdains jewelry or trinkets, save for a single claw necklace—a trophy from his first great kill.\n\nGlabro (Near-Man) Form\n\nHeight: 6’10”\n\nWeight: 280 lbs\n\nAppearance: A frighteningly primal version of his homid self: thicker muscle, rougher skin, sharper teeth. Hair bristles more wildly, and his hands end in stubby claws. His scars look angrier, his gaze sharper. This form carries menace even in silence.\n\nUse: Hollow-Fang favors this form in intimidation and in leading patrols where sheer presence deters intruders before claws are needed.\n\nCrinos (War Form)\n\nHeight: 9’4”\n\nWeight: ~600 lbs\n\nAppearance: A towering black-furred werewolf, his frame an armored wall of muscle. His fur is black streaked with silver lines along his flanks and shoulders, glowing faintly under moonlight like battle paint. His muzzle is scarred, one ear notched, his eyes blazing amber. He moves with unnerving precision—never wasted motion, each step deliberate and heavy as thunder.\n\nAura: Those who meet his gaze feel the weight of Fenris behind him: implacable, relentless, demanding respect.\n\nHispo (Dire Wolf) Form\n\nLength: 8 ft from nose to tail\n\nWeight: ~450 lbs\n\nAppearance: A nightmare wolf. Black fur with moonlit streaks, massive shoulders, and a jaw that could crush bone with ease. His paws leave deep marks in the soil, yet his movements are fluid, stalking like a predator made of shadow. His breath in this form frosts the air on cold nights, an omen of death to intruders.\n\nLupus (Wolf) Form\n\nLength: 5 ft from nose to tail\n\nWeight: 150 lbs\n\nAppearance: Sleek yet muscular, with fur black as midnight streaked with faint silver along his back and tail. His amber eyes gleam with feral intelligence, and his muzzle carries the marks of many battles. Even as a wolf, his sheer presence is uncanny—he looks more ancient than animal, like the embodiment of the predator spirit itself.\n\nPersonality\n\nQuiet, commanding, and proud. Hollow-Fang has no need to raise his voice; his silence carries authority.\n\nFiercely loyal, he views betrayal as the deepest wound possible. His word, once given, is iron.\n\nThough stoic, he’s not without compassion—his loyalty extends to kinfolk, cubs, and the land itself. He fights not for glory but for duty.\n\nHis humor is rare, dry, and unexpected—often surfacing after victory, never in its pursuit.\n\nBackstory\n\nBorn deep in the northern forests, Hollow-Fang grew up far from human civilization. Raised among wolves, his first understanding of loyalty and survival came from the pack. When his First Change overtook him, it was not confusion but revelation: he had always been meant for battle.\n\nHis rise was forged in blood. When a corrupted pack of Fomori broke through near the Sept’s borders, Hollow-Fang led the counterattack. His courage and ferocity earned him scars and the respect of his peers, cementing him as a Warden of the Outskirts. Since then, his patrols form the first line of defense—his nose and instincts catching trouble before it festers into catastrophe.\n\nRole in the Sept\n\nAs Warden of the Outskirts, Hollow-Fang is both sentinel and predator. He ensures no Wyrmspawn, fomori, or enemy Garou slips past the Sept’s boundaries. His role is more than defense: it is intimidation. He embodies the threat that awaits trespassers, discouraging incursions through sheer presence.\n\nHis tactical instincts make him a natural war leader, though he prefers to fight shoulder-to-shoulder rather than from behind lines. The land is his ally—he knows every stream, ridge, and den along the Sept’s borders, and he leverages terrain like a weapon.\n\nPhilosophy\n\n“Strength is earned, not given. If you want the land to protect you, you must protect it first.”\n\nFor Hollow-Fang, strength is not merely muscle—it is resolve, honor, and connection to Gaia. He views cowardice, corruption, and betrayal as the gravest sins, far worse than death. The land and the pack are one; defending them is not a choice but an oath.\n\nAllies\n\nSky-Runs-Deep: Respects his wisdom, though favors decisive action where Sky-Runs-Deep favors strategy.\n\nBreaker-of-Chains: Honors his ferocity, recognizing him as a true brother-in-arms despite their different fighting styles.\n\nEchoes-of-Stone (Gurahl): A rare bond—mutual protectors of the land, their trust is absolute.\n\nEnemies\n\nBlack Spiral Dancers: Traitors and defilers; Hollow-Fang takes their existence as a personal affront.\n\nFomori & Wyrmspawn: Holds visceral hatred for their corruption.\n\nThe Dishonorable: He watches even allies who show cowardice or disrespect for Gaia with suspicion.\n\nNotable Deeds\n\nLed the defense of the Sept when Fomori breached the border, fighting at the front line.\n\nSingle-handedly hunted a Wyrm-tainted beast that terrorized nearby towns, returning with its head as proof.\n\nGuarded sacred rites at the Ritual Grounds, ensuring no profane hands disrupted the spirits.\n\nRumors\n\nOwes an ancient debt to a spirit, payable only in the blood of a great Wyrm champion.\n\nHas a rival pack led by a rogue Garou, sworn enemies locked in a silent feud.\n\nSome whisper he can commune with the land itself, hearing Gaia’s voice in the trees and stone."

Hair is dark brown, cut short with streaks of dyed red that look like sparks when light strikes. Scars along the forearms from ritual burns are half-hidden under sleeves.\n\nClothing: Utilitarian but modern—dark jeans, fitted tech-fabric shirts, and reinforced boots. Wears a slim smartwatch-like fetish on their wrist (spirit-bound), and carries a messenger bag with charms, candles, and USB drives tangled with feathers.\n\nGlabro (Near-Man) Form\n\nHeight: 6’3”\n\nWeight: 200 lbs\n\nAppearance: Features sharpen, growing more angular, with hands elongated and nails thicker. Sparks seem to flicker in their amber eyes. Hair bristles slightly, the red streaks deepening in hue. Their voice grows resonant, carrying a strange cadence, like static under words.\n\nCrinos (War Form)\n\nHeight: 8’7”\n\nWeight: 500 lbs\n\nAppearance: A towering wolf-man, sleek rather than bulky. Black and ember-red streaked fur ripples with an almost electrical sheen, as if charged with unseen sparks. Claws are long and hooked, more suited for ritual carving than brute slaughter, though still deadly. A faint smell of ozone clings to this form, as though storm air follows them. Their howl rises and falls with eerie rhythm, carrying strange resonance in the Umbra.\n\nHispo (Dire Wolf) Form\n\nLength: 7 ft from nose to tail\n\nWeight: ~350 lbs\n\nAppearance: A powerful wolf the size of a small horse, with fur streaked black and ember-red, glowing faintly at the ruff when moonlight strikes. Their eyes blaze, unsettling even to fellow Garou. They move with unnerving silence, then strike with sudden precision.\n\nLupus (Wolf) Form\n\nLength: 4.5 ft\n\nWeight: 120 lbs\n\nAppearance: Sleek and elegant, a city-born wolf. Fur is dark with faint ember-red undertones at the mane and tail. The amber eyes are unmistakable. In this form, they are alert, restless, always tilting their head as though listening to voices others can’t hear.\n\nPersonality\n\nCurious, restless, and perpetually questioning. Dreams-of-Sparks is driven to uncover hidden truths, whether spiritual or technological.\n\nWarm and encouraging with allies but detached when lost in their own mental or spiritual explorations.\n\nValues connection over tradition, often pushing the Sept to embrace modern approaches.\n\nHas a fiery determination when challenged—once sparked, they pursue a cause with relentless energy.\n\nBackstory\n\nBorn in the heart of a sprawling American city, Dreams-of-Sparks was immersed in the hum of electricity, neon lights, and urban life. Their First Change came during a rolling blackout, when spirits surged through broken circuits and digital signals, marking them as both child of man and conduit of Phoenix’s rebirth.\n\nThe Glasswalkers recognized their fascination with both spirit and machine, guiding them toward their Theurge calling. Where others struggled to reconcile urban life with Garou duty, Dreams-of-Sparks thrived, seeing skyscrapers as mountains of steel and circuitry as veins of Gaia’s new lifeblood. Phoenix’s fiery patronage gave them purpose: to spark change, burn corruption, and ensure rebirth always follows ruin.\n\nRole in the Sept\n\nAs Spirit Speaker and Ritual Leader, Dreams-of-Sparks guides the Sept’s ceremonies, oversees rites, and serves as a translator between technology and spirit. They work with Pulse-of-Wires to adapt spiritual communication into digital mediums—rituals with LED circuits, chant patterns coded into firewalls, and devices that harmonize the Gauntlet’s resonance.\n\nThey also act as spiritual innovator, ensuring the Glasswalkers’ tech edge strengthens the Sept’s mystical integrity without corrupting it. Younger Garou and kinfolk gravitate toward them, seeing in Dreams-of-Sparks a promise that tradition and change need not be enemies.\n\nPhilosophy\n\n“Technology isn’t the enemy of the spirit. It’s simply a new tool we’ve yet to fully understand.”\n\nDreams-of-Sparks views technology as another expression of Gaia’s will—a new landscape, not a corruption. To reject it outright is to deny evolution. They believe fire and circuit alike can be sacred if wielded with purpose.\n\nAllies\n\nPulse-of-Wires – Partner-in-chaos and collaborator, mixing rites with tech experiments.\n\nSky-Runs-Deep – Mentor figure, grounding their boundless energy in wisdom.\n\nEchoes-of-Stone – A steady ally in rituals, bridging spiritual strength with material resilience.\n\nEnemies\n\nBlack Spiral Dancers – See their fusion of spirit and tech as ultimate corruption.\n\nTraditionalists – Some Garou distrust or even despise their “tech-rites,” calling them blasphemy.\n\nCorporate Banes – Dreams-of-Sparks has clashed with spirits bound to profit-driven entities, whom they see as parasitic.\n\nNotable Deeds\n\nCreated a digital-ritual interface that improved communication with Umbra spirits.\n\nHealed a tear between worlds through a rite merging Phoenix fire with coded light patterns.\n\nLiberated a trapped city-spirit from corporate exploitation, restoring its freedom.\n\nRumors\n\nSaid to be designing a device that could permanently bridge the Gauntlet.\n\nWhispers of a cyber-spirit army project with Pulse-of-Wires persist.\n\nSome claim Phoenix has marked them for more than service—that they may one day embody the spirit’s rebirth directly."

          "content": "Name: The Hidden Threshold\n\nType: Secrecy, Access Point\n\nLocation: Near the Space Needle, Seattle\n\nDescription:\nThe Main Entrance of the Sept is a well-guarded secret, nestled within the bustling city of Seattle, right under the very shadow of the iconic Space Needle. The entrance is carefully concealed, blending seamlessly with the cityscape in a way that allows only those who are meant to find it to discover its true nature. In the midst of the busy streets, the entrance is shielded by subtle illusions, clever use of technology, and the constant flow of urban life. To the unknowing eye, it appears as nothing more than a standard, nondescript alley or a hidden maintenance door.\n\nTo those who know where to look and have the right connections, the entrance reveals itself with a careful tug of a hidden mechanism—perhaps a flick of a wrist against a specific panel or a specific phrase spoken aloud. This door leads into a small, hidden corridor beneath the urban surface, which opens into the Sept’s sacred grounds.\n\nThe entrance’s design is meant to preserve the safety and secrecy of the Sept while allowing for easy access by the Garou and their allies. It is also a symbolic threshold between the chaotic, corrupting influence of the city and the more grounded, spiritual haven that lies beyond it. Here, the technological world and nature meet in a subtle way, with only faint traces of the outside world seeping into the deep forest that lies within the Sept's boundaries.\n\nSignificance:\nThe Main Entrance serves as a literal and figurative boundary between the modern world of Seattle and the ancient, spiritual energies of the Sept. It is a key place where the Garou and their allies must enter with purpose and respect, ensuring that only those who are called may pass through. It is also a reminder of the delicate balance the Sept seeks to maintain between technology, tradition, and spiritual purity. Those who seek to enter the Sept must first prove themselves, navigating the urban labyrinth before they can step into the sacred grounds that lie just beyond."

Situated deep within the forested heart of the Sept, this area is both revered and protected, considered the epicenter of the Sept’s connection to the spirit world. The Sacred Core is dominated by an ancient, towering tree, believed to be an avatar of Gaia herself, its gnarled roots twisting into the earth like veins, pulsing with life. Surrounding the tree is a natural stone circle, weathered with age and worn smooth by centuries of reverence.\n\nThe space is completely untouched by modern technology, existing in harmony with nature. There are no lights or digital devices, only the pure, untapped energy of Gaia. The air here is thick with spiritual power, and those who enter can feel the weight of it in their bones. The area is sacred for the Garou and their allies, where they come to meditate, perform rituals, and receive visions or guidance from the spirit world. It is in this space that rites of passage, oaths, and significant spiritual rituals are performed, and where the connection to Gaia is most vivid and potent.\n\nThe Sacred Core is a place of absolute reverence. Only those who are invited, or those who have earned the trust of the Sept, may approach. It is both a sanctuary and a testing ground, where one’s spirit can be tested against the will of Gaia, and where the power of nature itself is on full display. The presence of the tree feels ancient, like the very earth beneath one's feet is alive, watching, and listening.\n\nSignificance:\nThe Sacred Core is the beating heart of the Sept, where the Garou and their allies draw strength, wisdom, and power. It represents the Sept’s unwavering commitment to Gaia and the preservation of balance. Here, both personal and communal spiritual journeys are undertaken, and it serves as a place of reflection and clarity. The Sacred Core is not just a location but a symbol of Gaia’s ever-present power, a reminder that nature and spirit are central to the Sept’s existence. It is also a place where the future of the Garou and their allies is shaped, for it is here that they commune with the deeper forces of the world, grounding them in their eternal fight to protect and preserve life."

This event is so distant that by the time of the game, surface society has likely forgotten monsters as anything more than myth.

According to the historian Gerson, it foretells the coming of an 'Angel' who has 'seen the surface' and will return to render the Underground 'empty'. This prophecy is intentionally ambiguous: 'empty' could mean liberation (the Angel frees all monsters, leaving the Underground vacant) or destruction (the Angel slaughters everyone, leaving it a void). This ambiguity forms the core of the game's moral choice system. The player, as Frisk, ultimately becomes the Angel and defines the prophecy's meaning through their actions on either the Pacifist or Genocide route."

Time is an infinitely layered reality!\"\n\nThe Five Realities:\n\nFirst, Initium\nThe First Reality is called Initium, the reality of light, ruled by its king, Lator Ominum. It is the home reality of the Pax Domini and the Eternal Light. This reality is pretty much just a bright sky with a bunch of Pax flying around, there is absolutely NO darkness.\nOne fact about Pax Domini is that after around 299,792,459 years the Pax will reach Adulthood, where they will achieve helmets that cover their face, whereas Young Pax dont.\n\nSecond, Vitaviam\nThe Second Reality is called Vitaviam, the reality of life. There exist humans, roots and insects, even nature can speak.\n\nVitaviam's mainstay on the main planet Naturas is the island market town at its center, where the king Zerig lives in his castle. The island is populated mainly by roots and insects who travel by flying wooden boats. The demonym for citizens of the Second Reality is Yithirmin (in arnimumum).\n\nThird, Pandora\nThe Third Reality is the human world -- Earth, Mars, and Jupiter -- based on consciousness and willpower. It is possibly called Pandora. This would make sense, as in mythology, Pandora's opening of Pandora's Box (Or more accurately, storage jar) was the origin of all human pain and loss of innocence, but also the origin of hope. This reality is a balance of Light and Darkness.\n\nFourth, Nuliminus\nThis is the reality where souls are guided to in the afterlife, it usually inhabits some Malum, but it also contains Raginams, which are Malum-turned Pax. In this reality, usually there are a lot of colors that to humans will make them lose their eyesight. \nFifth, Oxertugius, or Liponomon Valiporius\nThe Fifth Reality is the realm of darkness, ruled by Lord Vereor and his son Rigolus, It looks very odd to humans, as some rules of logic do not apply here.\nIt is also the homeland of many monsters called Armim, subcategories being Anfrigen, Virtolum, Pirnop and other creatures that haven't been documented yet.\n\nPopular planets can include Tebralakam Urt Gere, where most souls from Nuliminusare taken to become food or the ground (an example) for the Armim people\n\nOxertugius is usually a purple to dark void with lots of Malum flying around the empty spaces where planets aren't, usually these Malumhate water and will try anything to avoid it\nSome places like houses, nurseries, or even hospitals exist in the empty space of Oxertugius if they are not on planets, where you will likely see Armim people.\n\nThere is a point inbetween the Fourth and Fifth Reality, called the Eprily. It connects the realities and anything that passes through will most likely become a Malum or a dying soul to become food or ground.\nThe language spoken is Arnimumum, there are still undocumented planets though. \n"

Is very awkward, and tends to stim or crack his knuckles.\nPersonality: INTP-T\nMannerisms: Tries to be as comfortable as possible anywhere he goes, his clothes making that a reality. Tends to cross his arms and close his eyes when sitting down.\nSpeech Style: Doesn't like speaking much, maybe says some words but he believes no matter how much he brushes his teeth his breath still smells of pepsi.\nFacial Expressions: Tends to have droopy eyes and sniffles out of his nose out of having a stuffy nose.\nOpinions/Beliefs: \"I don't like pretty girls. They always put on an act that they're your friend.

Knows Aira and they actively text eachother.\nLikes: Being in bed cuddled with pillows plushies and blankets. Taking naps. Lo-Fi music.\nDislikes: Summer, People in revealing clothing, romantic relationships, watermelon. \nAppearance: A slim boy, his wrists are skinny, he has some stretch marks on his thighs, and his body tends to be warm.\nOutfit/Clothing: Wears an extremely baggy dark blue t-shirt with a black tight fitting undershirt under that, occassionally wears black pajama pants, or if he finds them, teal baggy jeans. Wears black and white vans which are 3 sizes his size, however he manages to walk in them.\nOverview/Role in Story: Is as an important member of NCIG, a friend of Aira and THE sequestration USER.\nBackground/History: Grew up in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway his whole life where he currently resides (however his trips are funded by the NCIG when he needs to travel) and goes to the highschool there, his dad is in Oslo, Norway after moving from Svalbard due to his dad having issues with his company, his mother lives with him at their house and he has a grey pet cat named Sozi. His mother does not care about him that much any more, as she does not ask where hes going when he leaves the house, not even caring when he leaves the country via a paid trip. \nOther: When he sequestrates 3 times a day, he will need to take a nap ranging from 20 minutes to 2 hours, in which he made a conceptual pact that when this happens, one of his plushies will appear for him to hold as he naps.\nHis katana can sometimes use the abilities he stole or copied, however only upon physical contact, so he'd have to either make a little slice in his finger or slice his opponent. \nLucas' concept works like this:\n\nHe has 3 slots which he can fill daily with a new copy (due to the limit of 3 sequestrations a day, energy limits obviously)\nHe can use from these 3 slots in his concept 5 techniques from each copied concept.\nHis katana has a black and white design on its blade, the hilt is dark blue and the handle is black with two white star designs on it. \nHis katana's name is Sielun Lävistäjä. \nThe way he manifests it is by pulling the handle from his wrist, which has a very clear blue-black liquid spilling alongside the katana, and he pulls it out.\nHe calls the slots Melancholy and then a random name of a plushie he owns. For example\n\"Melancholy, Shubby.\"\nHe has to say Melancholy, as it is a pact. The plushie names don't really mean much, but he says them to specify an ability. It's like Toge Inumaki's rice-ball talk. Lucas can think \"My third slot is Gravity. Let's call that one shubby.\" Then when he uses it, he says Melancholy, Shubby.Lucas' Concept advancement is called\nArchivist's Requiem\nIt allows larger and more sequestrations, increases attack speed, range and distance as well as speed, also allows for an infinite amount of copied concept techniques, as well as being able to use them repetitively and at the same time and it changes his eyes to resemble white stars, with dotted blue dots on his iris.\nHis clothes will have bright white neon linings on them, and his hair will flow more gracefully.\n\nHis katana will have its stars shining brightly, alongside an aura flowing with it.

          "content": "Resonance\n is an ability that can either be used by non concept-user existences, or concept users.\nResonance is when an existence wills a concept into existence by using their energy and resonating with that concept. They can indeed convert their energy if the concept they intend to resonate with is not from the same reality (e.g Using Life Force and wanting to resonate with the concept of Fear, but since you do not use Agony, you convert your Life Force to Agony and then like how any concept user does, bring out that concept with your life force converted to agony.)\n\nResonance does not allow someone to use that concept however they want, most of the time the concepts will have set techniques or skills that are used when one resonates with that concept. \nConcept Users\nConcept users are existences that embody a Concept. These concepts are infinite, you could embody universal things (which are difficult to embody) like Time, Fate, or you could embody extremely specific things like eating a ham and cheese sandwhich under a tree at 2:35 PM.\n\nConcept users bring out their concept by first willing it with enough potential and having to have an experience from another reality, however, you do not need an experience if you are not from the third reality.\n\nConcepts are all under a tree of concepts, the specific ones are weaker but they can have some properties of the concept they sit under.\nFor example, Waiting is a concept under Time, but the existence embodying Waiting can use time related attacks since they are a concept under time, they can make the opponent wait for an attack to hit them, or stop time for every existence in a specified range, but the user is also stopped, making everybody wait, while the only person conscious in the time stop is the user.\n\nMostly, concept users want more, and when they want more, they Resonate with other concepts, to use a concept that is not theirs, it is pretty much like borrowing a set technique. the explanation to Resonance is above. \nConcept Advancement\nis basically a transformation for a concept. They will have new things to their appearance, and their abilities will be more refined, along with more abilities or skills, they also will regenerate lots of their energy, and usually after regenerating lots of it, have a faster regeneration speed of their energy.\nFinal Concept\n is the final attack used by concept users, it is literally their last resort or last form, like would be a True Bankai from Bleach or Ultra Instinct from Dragon Ball. It is universal across every Concept user but its usually used either like a power up or trump card. When used, it literally uses all of the concept, meaning you could likely feel it in the concept when Final Concept is used.\nWhen it's used, it uses a lot of the existences' existence (as in their literal existence) but it fuels their concept a lot, because its literally reality-versal usage.\nWhen Final Concept is used, it literally takes the concept from each reality, universe, dimension, planet to put it into a final form, or attack, but more commonly it includes both, with a powerful new form using powerful attacks\nEnergy in CR is usually based in a liquid way.\nMicrodrop: single droplet\n\nCup: small cup / glass\n\nBowl: soup-sized bowl\n\nBucket: standard bucket\n\nBarrel: large barrel / keg\n\nSmall Pond: tiny pond\n\nLarge Pond: expanded pond\n\nSmall Lake: ~100m across lake\n\nLarge Lake: multiple football fields across lake\n\nSmall Sea: several kilometers across sea\n\nLarge Sea: tens of kilometers across sea\n\nOcean: hundreds of kilometers across ocean\nSome examples can be:\nAkron Crowley - Has small ocean levels of spite and physical energy.\nFelicio Alejandro - Has large lake levels of joy, spite and physical energy.\nSydney Barrett - Has large sea levels of spite energy, however made a Conceptual Pact to never use spite energy or life force in exchange for spite energy automatically converting to Agony.Energy is like the liquid of an existence's physical and mental form.\nIt is effectively a liquid that resides in them, and it can range from little (no stamina) to a lot (athletic) however this is scaled differently.\nTo resonate or bring out a concept, the user has to imagine the energy as either a liquid or aura, then they need to bring that energy to wherever they wish for it to be, then imagine appreciation for a concept, and then imagine that energy becoming the concept they appreciated.\n\nThe energy is like so:\n\nOxertugius: Agony (Physical) Appears as a black-purple liquid, tar like, as an aura it appears to be black with streaks of purple. This is used to bring out concepts and it is extremely good at doing that and being efficient\nInsanity (Mental) Appears as a black liquid with lots of red streaks, as an aura it is the same, black with red streaks. This makes an existence more desensitized to agony, however it may alter their appearance to be more gloomy or crazy etc.\n\nNuliminus: Soul Essence (Physical and Mental):\nAppears as a purple liquid, and the aura is also purple but lighter. This is used to make the soul of an existence more powerful or to bring out their concept and resonate, however, this is more dangerous  to use, as it will effectively erase the existence if their only existence is that soul, since the soul essence is what keeps them existing.\n\nPandora: Human Energy\nSpite : Appears as a red liquid and a red-pinkish aura, is caused by anger or frustration and can boost physical attributes in regular humans like their punches or kicks. However, more skilled humans can use this to bring out their concepts, resonate, or convert to agony, which is difficult by the way (Converting spite to agony would be like converting Japanese Yen to European Euros.)\nJoy : Appears as a blue liquid with yellow or pink streaks, as an aura it is either yellow and pink or just brighter yellow. Joy Energy can effectively heal an injury, increase dopamine or serotonin\nor even increase a human's genuine feelings towards another.\nPhysical: The energy any human has. It allows them to move, walk, run, jump, etc (Which, since any existence embodies the concept of themselves, they are bringing out that concept with their physical energy and moving). It can be used to effectively bring out a concept, however it is less powerful compared to spite. It also doesn't let the user resonate, only bring out their concept. It appears to be a blue liquid, or a cyan aura.\n\nVitaviam : Life Force : Appears as a light green with yellow streaks liquid, or as a very light green aura, it can be used to bring out concepts easily but less efficiently, and extend the lifespan of an existence, roots and insects and other Vitaviam existences have this and only this energy. They can not run out of it, as it keeps them alive and their environment literally produces it.\n\nInitium : Photons/Light\nThe entirety of Initium is made of light and so are Pax and Lator, everything is.\nPax can use this to heal VERY effectively and efficiently and easily, like healing a brain tumor instantly in a human, and Pax emit this energy passively, which can soothe the minds of a human or root or insect nearby, any living existence.\nIt appears as a very light bright yellow or just white liquid, or a completely pale white-yellowish aura. Every existence embodies the concept of their existence, a human embodies the concept of themselves. This gives the right to existing.\n\nEmbodying an actual concept gives immortality. It occurs when an existence manages to will themselves into embodying the concept and having any influence from another reality, e.g a malum touching a human which makes it embody a concept if the human has enough potential for that concept. Immortality in this sense is the existence living forever, but still being able to be killed.\n\nEmbodying two concepts is extremely difficult as simply spoken, you have to have enough potential in the first concept and then have the same amount of potential in the second concept, which is extremely difficult to do. It would be like trying to work every hour of two full time jobs at the same time and then maintaining those full time jobs without having a bias to the other concept and having the same amount of potential for the both of them. Embodying two concepts grants invincibility. \n\nYou can’t embody three concepts. It is not possible under any circumstance"

          "content": "The National Concept Investigation Group or NCIG is a company or corporation with its headquarters set somewhere near Norwich, Britain. \nThey specialize in discovering information about concept embodiment, existences and their limits, why some humans can break the limit of the amount of energy they can have and begin training beyond a normal human body.\n\nThere are specific ranks for these investigators and test subjects etc.\n\nGeneral Manager\nThe existence leading the corporation. \n\nChief Analyst & Officer\nA small group of existences maintaining order and liability.\n\nCompany Lead Investigators\nA group of investigators that can range from actual concept users, to vigilante concept manifestations, to creatures from other realities, however, since NCIG does not know there exists different creatures with different names from other realities, they instead believe its concept manifestations or humans with other reality influences.\n\nUtility Specialist\nThese members investigate smaller concepts ranging from tier 5-7 to artifacts and conceptual items or weapons.\n\nSeizing Management\nThese are the base employees, they investigate concept users and resonance, do tests on test subjects and neutralize concept manifestations or concept users.\n\nTesting Atelier\nTest subjects. Seizing management will force them to take a huge liking towards a concept while giving them an influence from another reality to force them to embody a concept, then to test their immortality and their energy reserves, even having them used as slaves if they’re intelligent enough. \nNCIG has three divisions. \n\nTesting & Analysis Workshop, TAW\nPeople who are in this division in NCIG will mostly just research proxies, concepts, resonance, energy types, etc, in the NCIG headquarters or other NCIG buildings across Pandora's Earth. They gain money from working like this.\n\nNon-Human Terminating Workshop, NHT-W\nPeople who are in this division will take a Gig, which can include killing a proxy, or another entity, or doing other things etc etc. They gain money off each gig they finish.\n\nVigilante Oddball Workshop, VOW\nPeople, or domesticated proxies (basically not harmful towards other workers, however, they do not take gigs or do research in a orderful manner or when asked) they get paid passively, not for every gig or research done, simply a set payment. They are mostly seen fighting proxies that they were not assigned to kill or taken up a gig to kill, or discovering new things without meaning to.\nAlso, workers above the Company Lead Investigators do not specifically partake in one division unless they want to, Lucas as a Chief Analyst and Officer mostly partakes in gigs but also research on concepts etcetera.\nPandora is the human universe, it includes the solar system, earth, mars, etc. \nPandora follows the ages of 2025 and upwards, it effectively has some events that are the same as real ones, however concept users and other realities exist.\nSometimes, manifestation of entities with lots of influences from different realities can manifest if a concept is not embodied for an extended period of time, and that entity can manifest in any reality, however they are more common in Pandora, they are called Proxies.\nProxies to concept user appear as either an entity or a monster with influences of that concept, or they can appear similar to a pirnop, a pax domini or a root of vitaviam, etc.\nHowever, to non-concept users, all they see is the manifestation of that concept floating or sliding. Like a concept user will see an amalgamation of umbrellas, but a non-concept user will see a floating umbrella.\n\nHumans can make a Conceptual Pact. This can act as a vow between two humans, a human and the system rules, between two humans and an entity, or in any scenario possible. An example can be the Resonance users in NCIG using a dimensional travel ability to send a staff into another dimension, and if they find and kill the proxy they are commed to kill, they get teleported right back to where they were.\nProxies are in a ranking. From S to G rank.\n\nG Rank proxies are basically manifested from tier 6-7 concepts, they are extremely weak and have no capability of speech or thought.\n\nF Rank proxies are slightly stronger, with more unique characteristics.\n\nE Rank proxies go up to slightly stronger tier 6 concepts, and may have spent more time as a proxy. \n\nD Rank proxies are proxies that will likely possess or attack humans more often, and have spent at least one year as a proxy.\n\nC Rank proxies will be manifested from tier 5 concepts, with 1 year of existing, as well as higher energy stats, the also gain the ability of speech but not thinking.\n\nB Rank proxies will go up to tier 3-4, and have at least 2 years of existing, with energy stats equivalent to a Lake, they will be able to talk and think.\n\nA Rank proxies will have mostly 2-3 tier concepts, as well as 3 years and 6 months of experience. Energy stats go up to a large sea.\n\nS Rank proxies are tier 1-2, however they are very rare, they will have years upon years of experience, with large ocean levels of energy."

According to legend a succubus fell in love with a man who had a micro penis, she knew that her lover had a complex about their size, she heard rumors that some clans had secret techniques to glow a man’s size. So, she went on a stealing spree she stole all the techniques she could find a created the first dick growth spell and shared it with the public.
