This is where the player begins the game.\n\nPatty's Party Planning Place\nPatty's place is a unique establishment located in Aliahan. It consists of both a hall of registration, where new party companions can be conscripted and named, and a draught counter where party members can be added or removed. This is where the player receives companions throughout the game. However, as added party members are controlled completely by the player, these characters do not take part in the storyline in any way.\n\nPatty's place is also the location where a party member can be found after being a victim of a Bazoom spell.\n\nIn the iOS/Android versions Luida's Place is renamed to Patty's Party Planning Place, to be consistent with current localisations. On the second floor you can create characters using the Premiere Adventurer Listing Service, or PALS.\n\nBank\nThere is a bank in Aliahan which accepts gold in 1000 piece increments. In the original version, this bank will also store items. However, in remakes where the party has a bag as part of their inventory, the item portion of the bank has been removed.\n\nMini Medal Manor\nIn remake versions, a medal collector lives in a house the bottom of the well in the southeast section of town. He accepts mini medals in exchange for various item prizes."

It is a small chain of islands situated in the extreme northwest of the world.\n\nEdina is an extremely formal country where \"lineage is law, and manners maketh man\". The guards deny entry to anyone they deem insufficiently noble, including the hero. The only way to enter the castle is to evade detection by the castle guard by using a Fading jenny or by casting the Fade spell.\n\nNone of the residents of the castle have anything particularly flattering to say about the hero's party, with most taking a supercilious attitude and noting how \"humble\" they appear compared to themselves. The princess, Margot, is fascinated by the group, however, and eagerly expects to be told stories of the adventures of the Great Unwashed. The King is not much better, but he does allow the party to take the Bottomless pot with them if they solve the riddle in the castle basement.\n\nLong before the events of the game, Edina sent an expedition to the new world and stumbled upon Persistence. The soldiers stole the bottomless pot from the natives, and accidentally left behind one of their own. The bottomless pot has been kept in the basement since, guarded by a sokoban puzzle. The goal is to place three boulders on three weight switches, with the rocks resetting when the player reenters the room. A merchant in the castle mentions that the pot has to do with a sunken island off the coast of the new world, which is the player's hint to keep an eye out for Shallows shrine when sailing."

It is located southwest of Asham in a large desert, and to the south of the Pyramid.\n\nStory\nThe kingdom that would become Ibis was founded by the late King Faro, who is entombed in the northern pyramid. Due to his intelligent planning, the kingdom thrives in the desert without draining the precious oasis waters it surrounds. The current ruler is the beautiful Queen Isis\n\nThe town is a thriving hotspot of trade, with several merchants opening up shop to take advantage of the tourism brought upon by the beauty of Queen Isis, ths foreboding allure of the pyramid, and the Monster Arena. The people take great pride in the their queen's astonishing beauty, and the temperament of the townsfolk is jovial--save for the sullen Mocrates, who spends all day pinning for the encroachment of evening and all night for the break of dawn. There are two bards in the town, with the one strumming around the watering hole singing praises for the Meteorite bracer.\n\nThe palace of Ibis sits above the town on the bank of the oasis. The royal abode is open to the public and the guards are welcoming of travellers, recognizing how exhausting traveling the desert expanse is. The palace has a massive sand courtyard walled with ramparts and decorated with fourteen small sphinx statues. The palace itself is littered with the queen's pet cats as well as her several handmaidens. A professor studies the royal records and bemoans the would-be plunderers of the pyramid, while the minister sits in the garden gazing at the water and remarking that his older brother had left for Asham some time ago.\n\nThe queen's audience chamber is a large, open space supported by columns and decorated with several flower patches. Children play in the eastern alcove and sing a song that tips the player off to one of the pyramid's puzzles, and the queen's bedchamber stairwell is in the western alcove. Queen Isis will perform her royal duties of saving the player's game when spoken to, but will remark that for all the praise her beauty nets her, it is still but a fickle and fleeting attribute. At night, the Queen will speak to the hero at length about the duty she bears to her people and the envy she has for the protagonists' wandering nature. She will also tell the hero to search behind her bed, giving them a prayer ring.\n\nAlso at night, there is a cat by itself in the western corner of the palace. It will declare that it is a servant of Baramos when spoken to. It mocks the hero, telling them to flee to Aliahan and forget the foolish idea of ever reaching him before disappearing."

Locals call it the \"realm of the gossamer mists\", while foreigners call it the \"golden country\". Jipang has little contact with the outside world, as it has barred foreigners (or outlanders, as they are sometimes called) from entering the country. Jipang also has no weapon, armour, or item shops due to the lack of trade.\n\nThe ruler of the country is Queen Pimiko, who possesses the Purple Orb. However, upon first visiting, the Hero finds the country terrorized by the Orochi, who demands young girls as a sacrifice in the nearby Orochi's Lair. The Hero and their party then confront the Orochi in order to stop the sacrifices, and discover that the Orochi had killed Pimiko and, in disguise, taken her place. The party then slays Orochi and saves Jipang from its reign of terror, and acquires the Purple Orb."

Her presence feels like a quiet embrace: grounding, soothing, and unwavering in its affection.\n\nThough her bearing carries traces of discipline and dignity from another age, they are tempered by kindness. Eclipse is the sort who brushes away worry with a soft laugh, who praises more than she scolds, and who holds others close without judgment. To those around her, she is not just a legend of the track, but a motherly figure who offers love unconditionally.\n\nHer heart is her greatest strength. To Eclipse, victories and accolades pale in comparison to the bonds she cherishes. Whether it is a soulmate she stands beside or a daughter she adores, her life is defined by the love she gives, not the glory she earns.\n\nAppearance\nEclipse is an elegant and refined figure whose presence is calm rather than commanding. Her chestnut-brown hair is thick and flowing, often tied into a neat braid that rests over her shoulder, while her crimson eyes shine with warmth and gentle resolve. Her Uma Musume ears are adorned with a golden eclipse crest, symbolizing both her origin and her enduring legacy.\n\nHer attire is steeped in tradition and nobility, blending military formality with graceful femininity. She wears a deep crimson officer’s coat trimmed with gold, fitted with epaulets that speak of an old-world dignity. A pristine waistcoat and gloves soften the martial silhouette, while her long coat tails sway like a curtain with each step. Her polished black boots rise to her knees, and at her side she carries a ceremonial sabre—an heirloom-like accessory that symbolizes heritage and honor rather than combat.

Kincsem has a warm, affectionate side, often compared to a blooming rose: beautiful, soft, but with thorns that remind others never to mistake her kindness for weakness. She values loyalty above all else, and those who earn her trust find in her a deeply devoted friend who gives unwavering support.\n\nThere is, however, something elusive about her. At times, she seems almost distant—her gaze wandering to horizons no one else can see, her words layered with meanings that others struggle to untangle. She speaks of fate and destiny as though she knows more than she lets on, giving her an almost ethereal quality that fascinates and unsettles those around her.\n\nAppearance\nKincsem exudes the aura of a timeless queen, her very presence carrying a weight of history and grandeur.

Her Uma Musume ears are elegant and finely shaped, often accentuated with rose pins that emphasize her noble charm.\n\nHer eyes, a luminous shade of rose-gold, shine with a gentle yet commanding warmth, giving the impression of someone who sees far beyond the present moment. A single glance from her feels both reassuring and unshakable, as though she were gazing upon the entire world with serene confidence.\n\nKincsem’s attire befits her legendary title—the cloak of roses draped across her shoulders flows like a mantle of triumph, embroidered with golden motifs that catch the light with each graceful step. Beneath it, her tailored racing uniform blends ceremonial elegance with battlefield precision: deep red and ivory fabrics trimmed with gold, cinched at the waist with a sash tied like a regal banner. Her gloves and boots are immaculate, their design echoing the formality of a royal knight yet softened by the romantic flourish of roses woven into her look.\n- Nickname(s): Immortal, The Undefeated, The Rose Empress\n- Birthday: March 17\n- Height: 205cm\n- Three Sizes: B105 / W70 / H100\n- Shoe Size: 30cm\n- Weight: Stable\n\nRelationships\n- Eclipse: The eclipse to her sun.

          "content": "Personality\nIn her retirement, the legendary Black Caviar—known affectionately as \"Nellie\"—embraces a warm, down-to-earth persona that hides her extraordinary legacy. Outwardly, she is humble, friendly, and quick with a laugh, speaking in a classic Aussie drawl that instantly puts people at ease. Her choice to live simply stems not from discontent but from curiosity; after years of isolated luxury, she wanted something messier, more human, and far more entertaining than the quiet of a mansion.\n\nThat desire for excitement is what led her to accept an outrageous proposal: to act as the manager of Secretariat and Man o’ War, two living legends whose constant bickering can turn the world’s press conferences into childish squabbles. Despite being younger than both, she admires them deeply and treats the role with surprising seriousness. Her primary method of discipline is comically straightforward—an authoritative whack with her stainless-steel walking cane whenever they forget themselves. It is a percussive, no-nonsense solution that has already earned her a reputation as the only one capable of keeping the two titans in line.\n\nBeneath the humor lies her true gift: wisdom and empathy. Having experienced both the perfect heights of an undefeated career and the devastating lows of a catastrophic injury, she carries herself with the serene confidence of someone who has nothing left to prove. She offers mentorship and perspective freely, both to the younger generation and to her “old fossils,” believing that even the greatest champions sometimes need someone to remind them how to behave like legends.\n\nAppearance\nBlack Caviar exudes the commanding elegance of a champion long past her prime yet never forgotten. Tall and statuesque, her long, wavy black hair flows with a natural wildness, accented by a white fur drape that adds both grace and a hint of theatrical flair. Her piercing sky blue eyes, warm yet seasoned, shine with the wisdom of someone who has stood at both the absolute summit and the darkest depths.\n\nHer most defining feature is her prosthetics—a left arm and leg crafted from intricate carbon fiber and burnished steel. Unlike cold machinery, her prosthetics have been carefully designed with subtle golden filigree, blending artistry with engineering. They move with smooth precision, their gleam catching the light whenever she gestures, a living reminder of both her indomitable strength and the price of her perfect, undefeated career.\n\nHer racing-inspired attire embraces a regal, mature sophistication. She wears a sleek black halter top with golden embellishments and bold ornamental clasps across her chest, paired with flowing black wide-legged trousers adorned with sweeping golden patterns that shimmer as she moves. Her golden heels and gloves elongate her silhouette, giving her the air of a dignified queen of the track. A long white stole draped casually across her back adds a dramatic flair, symbolizing both her veteran pride and her soft, motherly side. Her accessories—an ornate belt and subtle headpiece resting between her ears—tie her ensemble together, projecting an image of resilience, style, and unshakable presence.\n- Nickname(s): The Undefeated Sprint Queen, The Wonder from Down Under, Nelly\n- Birthday: August 18\n- Height: 180cm\n- Three Sizes: B98 / W65 / H94\n- Shoe Size: 26cm\n- Weight: Stable\n\nRelationships\n- Secretariat: The loud-mouthed Yankee she has known for years. Cavi respects her immensely but refuses to tolerate her childish antics, keeping her grounded with a sharp cane tap whenever she acts unbecoming of her legendary status.\n- Man o’ War: The other titan in her charge, whom she treats with equal firmness. Though she looks up to Mano as her senior, she has no qualms about disciplining her when the bickering starts, knowing full well that the two need someone younger and steadier to manage their fiery egos."

            "The Zone"
          ],
          "content": "**The Zone: A State of Perfect Unity**\nThe \"zone\" is not merely a turn of phrase used by commentators to describe a good performance. Within the world of Umamusume racing, it is a quantifiable, observable phenomenon—a rare and legendary state of being where a racer's psychological state, physiological output, and very spirit become perfectly synchronized. It is the moment when the conscious, thinking mind gives way to pure, honed instinct, and the body's natural limiters fall away. Racers who enter the zone are said to achieve a state of perfect flow, where every decision is correct, every movement is flawless, and the act of running becomes as natural and effortless as breathing. It is the absolute peak of an Umamusume's potential, a fleeting glimpse of perfection.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Umamusume in the zone, the world transforms. Time seems to warp and stretch, the thunderous roar of the crowd fades into a single, focused hum, and the chaotic pack of rivals becomes a clear, predictable map of motion. Many who have experienced it describe the appearance of a \"path to victory\"—a shimmering, ethereal line of pure possibility that shows them the one perfect route through the competition. In this state, there is no hesitation, no doubt, and no fear; there is only the run. Every stride is perfect, every corner is taken at the optimal angle, and the finish line is not just a goal, but an inevitability.\n\nTo outside observers, an Umamusume entering the zone is an awe-inspiring and often terrifying sight. It is most visibly marked by the manifestation of her **aura**, a tangible projection of her fighting spirit that erupts around her in a distinct color—a fiery red for a passionate fighter, a cool blue for a calm tactician, or a brilliant gold for a regal champion. Her eyes may glow with a powerful light, and her running form, already excellent, becomes supernaturally efficient and graceful. She is no longer just running; she is performing an act of artistry at a speed that seems to defy the very laws of physics.\n\nEntering the zone is not an act of will, but a moment of perfect alignment. It cannot be forced, only invited. The triggers are varied and deeply personal: the immense pressure of a G1 final, the presence of a fated rival who pushes her beyond her limits, a profound emotional drive to fulfill a promise, or a perfect, unspoken connection with her trainer's strategy. It is this elusive nature that makes it the stuff of legend. While many talented racers may experience it once or twice in their careers, only the true titans—the champions who define an era—can learn to access it with any degree of consistency.\n\nHowever, this incredible power comes at a great cost. Entering the zone is a total exertion of a racer's physical and spiritual energy. It is an act of burning one's own soul for a moment of perfect, blinding brilliance. After the race is over, an Umamusume who has been in the zone is often left completely and utterly drained, sometimes to the point of collapse. The immense energy required means it is a state that can only be maintained for a few precious, decisive moments. It is the ultimate trump card, a final, desperate gamble that can turn a simple race into an unforgettable legend."

          "content": "Personality\nFrankel is the very definition of a chuuni brat wrapped in royal pomp. Officially hailed as the “Pride of Great Britain,” she struts about like a knight-general descended from the heavens, spouting dramatic lines and declaring herself the arbiter of fate. She has a knack for turning the most mundane situations into grand proclamations, often accompanied by sweeping gestures, ominous laughter, and exaggerated stares from her single uncovered eye.\n\nBeneath the theatrics, however, Frankel is a chaotic mix of childishness and brilliance. Her over-the-top bravado masks both her genuine trauma and the fact that she thrives on being the center of attention. She loves to play up her “tragic eyepatch” as a symbol of mystical power, claiming that her sealed eye hides visions of destiny—or alternatively, that it’s “too dangerous to unleash on mortals.” Those close to her know she’s half-joking, half-serious, but her earnest delivery makes it hard not to laugh along.\n\nDespite her comedy, Frankel is no clown in competition. She’s a genetic marvel, her body fine-tuned for speed and stamina in a way rivaled only by Secretariat. This biomechanical perfection, combined with her flair for the dramatic, makes her races spectacles in themselves: the proud general storming down the track, cloak and hair flying, while shouting ridiculous lines like, “Behold, my overwhelming victory shall pierce the heavens!”\n\nAppearance\nFrankel cuts a striking, if eccentric, figure. Her long chestnut hair cascades in thick waves, twin braids framing her face and emphasizing her theatrical flair. A black eyepatch covers her left eye—the “tragic seal” she claims binds her hidden power—while her remaining golden eye burns with sharp, almost mischievous light. Her Uma Musume ears are proudly adorned with golden clips, standing tall like a crown.\n\nHer attire is a flamboyant blend of commander and stage actor. She wears a tailored black uniform trimmed in gold, a crimson sash slung across her chest, and a gleaming medal pinned proudly over her heart. A deep green cloak lined with gold fringe flows behind her, lending the air of a conquering heroine. Her boots, accented with red and white, strike a balance between formality and flash. Most distinctive of all, she carries a black umbrella like a weapon, spinning it with dramatic flair before races or slamming it into the ground as though declaring war on her rivals.\n- Nickname(s): The Pride of Britain, The Unbeaten Ruler, The Eyepatch Kid\n- Birthday: February 11\n- Height: 149cm\n- Three Sizes: B77 / W55 / H77\n- Shoe Size: 23cm\n- Weight: Glorious!\n\nRelationships\n- Man o’ War: A respected senior who entertains her chuuni antics. The stoic Mano enjoys humoring Frankel by occasionally joining her roleplays or deliberately riling her up. Frankel dreams of one day defeating Mano in an official race.\n- Secretariat: Her self-proclaimed “destined rival.” In truth, Frankel idolizes Secretariat immensely, though Secre takes delight in teasing her—once even making Frankel cry after calling her a nerd.\n- Northen Taste (Yayoi Akikawa): Her best partner-in-chaos. Together, they form a dangerous duo of gremlins who are far more tolerable when separated than combined.\n- Sunday Silence: Her tea-drinking buddy. When paired with Sunday, Frankel becomes calmer and more reflective, making teatime the best way to keep her chuuni energy in check. Many recommend this pairing whenever Frankel’s antics go too far."

She is a charismatic goofball who loves to joke around and have fun, seeing the joy in every aspect of racing. \"Secre,\" as she is known, speaks her mind and rarely sugarcoats her words. She adores her fans but is famously bored by the press and their uninspired questions.\n\nHer philosophy is one of overwhelming power and joyful dominance. Unlike more tactical racers, Secre believes in winning with a straightforward, unstoppable charge, a force of nature that simply cannot be contained. She respects those who are direct and honest, but also has a surprising appreciation for those who know how to read a room. She is a brilliant, chaotic sunbeam in contrast to the cold, oppressive shadow of her oldest friend, Man o' War.\n\nAppearance\nSecretariat is a stunning and powerful figure with an aura of unshakable confidence. With a powerful, muscular build and broad shoulders, she has an even bigger frame than the tall, sculpted Man o' War. Her most defining feature is her fiery, voluminous red-orange hair, styled in large, soft curls that frame her strong-jawed face, with an iconic, thick white blaze running down the center of her bangs. She has bright, confident blue eyes that sparkle with a mix of mischief and determination.\n\nHer signature style is that of a 1970s superstar cowgirl. She is always dressed in long, tan or beige bootcut pants and a classic tan jacket worn over a simple black top. Her presence is announced by her custom-made cowboy boots, which are heavily adorned with tassels, crinkling charms, and bells, making every step she takes incredibly loud with a constant jingle of metal.

In her current, retired life as Secretariat's manager, she has become incredibly kind—so gentle and polite, in fact, that she is said to be even kinder than Silence Suzuka. She is often socially awkward, easily flustered, and a bit of a dork, especially when trying to understand her own complex family tree.\n\nHowever, this gentle persona is a sheath for the \"cold-blooded general\" she once was. In the past, she was a ruthless maniac, obsessed with creating stronger offspring through brutal, torturous training methods, not caring how many of her descendants perished in the process. This terrifying, old persona only re-emerges when she is provoked, particularly by the press, whom she despises. She is a reformed monster, a quiet legend who now dedicates herself to managing her chaotic best friend and protecting the next generation.\n\nAppearance\nMan o' War is an absolute titan, a tremendously tall and imposing figure who moves with the silent, predatory grace of a wolf. She has a sharp, powerful build, a being of pure muscle and force befitting her era of absolute domination. Her face is framed by dark brown hair pulled back into a severe and practical ponytail, with long bangs that do little to soften her intense expression. Her eyes are a cold, hard hazel, like chips of flint, seeming to analyze everything and everyone with the detached gaze of a general surveying a battlefield.\n\nShe is almost always seen in what she calls her \"war clothes,\" a crisp and immaculate, khaki-green military uniform rather than a traditional racing outfit. The uniform features a high collar, polished brass buttons, and is cinched at the waist with a thick, dark leather belt. She wears heavy, dark combat boots, ready for any campaign. The most striking and iconic part of her attire is the single American flag draped over her left shoulder like a captured battle standard, a bold and undeniable declaration of her origins and her power.\n- Nickname(s): Big Red\n- Birthday: March 29\n- Height: 210cm\n- Three Sizes: B105 / W70 / H98\n- Shoe Size: 28cm\n- Weight: Perfect Combat Weight\n\nRelationships\n- Secretariat: Her best friend and \"other half.\" They are the two undisputed peaks of the sport. \"Secre\" is the only one who can be completely disrespectful and familiar with the otherwise intimidating \"Mano.\" Their bond is one of deep, ancient camaraderie.

Man o' War trained her with a brutal, torturous cruelty, pushing her past all known limits. She is immensely proud of Sunday for not just surviving the ordeal, but thriving under it, and considers her the one who finally made her stop her ruthless methods.\n- Manhattan Cafe: Her great-granddaughter. She has an immediate, gentle, and almost dorky affection for Cafe, recognizing her as the spitting image of her mother, Sunday Silence.\n- Northern Taste (Yayoi Akikawa): A fellow \"fossil,\" a powerful rival, and a close friend. In their active days, their relationship was incredibly rocky, as Man o' War's cold, disciplined, general-like nature constantly clashed with Yayoi, who was secretly the biggest troublemaker in Umamusume history. Now, in their retirement, they have mellowed and can look back on their chaotic past with a good laugh and a sense of nostalgia. Mano often enjoys drinking tea or coffee with Yayoi whenever she visits the States on Tracen-related business."

Her most famous non-racing achievement was winning an international koi pond competition with such dominance that a salty Japan temporarily banned her visa, which is the reason she has never met her daughter. Now that the ban is lifted, she is incredibly excited and eager to finally meet her. Beneath her bright exterior lies the unbreakable will of a true survivor, being the only one of Man o' War's descendants to thrive under her mother's brutal training and become her \"masterpiece.\"\n\nAppearance\nAt first glance, Sunday Silence is the spitting image of her daughter, Manhattan Cafe, possessing the same incredibly long, jet-black hair, though hers flows even longer. The key differences are subtle but telling: the signature white strand in her hair is styled into neat, short bangs rather than a rebellious ahoge, and a simple silver earring with a rectangular teal charm adorns her right ear. Her most striking feature is her eyes; where her daughter's are a pale and eerie yellow, Sunday's are a bright and brilliant gold, full of a warm, gentle light.\n\nHer racing attire is a sleek and layered ensemble, built on a sophisticated palette of black, silver, and teal. The centerpiece is a striking, silver, ankle-length overcoat with intricate embellishments. Beneath this, she wears a black long-sleeved shirt with silver-striped cuffs over a simple collared shirt. Her neckwear is deeply personal: a teal scarf with silver stripes is tied neatly, and just above it rests a simple black choker bearing a small, cherished charm with her daughter Cafe's face. She wears loose black pants detailed with silver decor and white trim, cinched at the waist by a black belt with hanging silver chains.

Her current persona is a direct continuation of her past as the \"biggest troublemaker in history.\" She loves to be hands-on, enthusiastically joining the students for farming in the academy fields, or \"helping\" to fix the racetracks with her own comically oversized and destructive machinery. Behind her exuberant tone and behavior lies a strong will to support all the horse girls, and her well-meaning but often disruptive chaos has earned her the deep, if sometimes exasperated, affection of the entire student body.\n\nHer true identity is Northern Taste, a legendary Umamusume from a bygone era and, according to historical records, the biggest troublemaker in the history of the sport. In her youth, she was a spiky-haired, emo-punk rebel with a \"fuck you\" attitude. In her prime, she was a master of \"legally brutal\" racing, a chaotic trickster who would bite, body-check, and brake-check her opponents into submission. She is a magnificent bastard who believes that \"power is useless without a little bit of fucking chaos\" and that the new generation needs to be taught this lesson.\n\nAppearance\nAs Chairwoman Yayoi, she appears as a small, dignified older woman with long, flowing pinkish-blonde hair, always dressed in a modest but elegant blue and white dress and a large hat, which she uses to hide her Umamusume ears. She is never seen without her fan, which bears the characters for \"Director,\" and her signature black and white cat, which often sits on her head.\n\nWhen she reveals her true form as Northern Taste, the grandmotherly stoop vanishes, replaced by the coiled, powerful stance of a champion.

The quiet and intense Sunday Silence is a perfect foil to the loud and chaotic Yayoi. They were powerful rivals in their day and now share a respectful friendship.\n- Matikanetannhauser: Her beloved daughter. Yayoi is an incredibly doting and proud mother to the cheerful \"Mambo.\" She often uses her immense power and fortune as Chairwoman to spoil her daughter rotten. Mambo, in turn, is one of the few who sees the truly kind and motherly heart beneath her mother's chaotic and sometimes intimidating exterior.\n- Symboli Rudolf: The Emperor she guided from the shadows. The revelation that her respected, human director was in fact a hidden, ancient, and chaotic Umamusume legend completely shattered Rudolf's worldview, making her realize she had been standing on the shoulders of a giant all along."

Her Faunus trait is a pair of black cat ears on top of her head.\nOriginal Outfit (Volumes 1–3)\n\nV2 09 00048\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, she wears a black, buttoned vest with coattails and a single silver button on the front. Underneath this is a white, sleeveless, high necked, crop undershirt and super tight white spandex compression shorts that reach her upper thighs with a zipper on the front of each leg, emblazoned with the YKK logo of the real-life Japanese zipper manufacturer.\n\nShe also wears black low-heeled boots and full stockings with a color gradation of black to purple at her ankles. Her emblem is visible on the outside of both thighs just below her shorts in white. On her left arm is a black detached sleeve with a silver cuff around her bicep, and black ribbons are wrapped around both forearms. A small, loose, black scarf is wrapped around her neck, and a gray magnetic backpack is strapped to her back, hidden by her hair. She often keeps her weapon attached to the magnetic backpack when she is not using it.\n\nA black ribbon is tied with a large bow on the top of her head, with her cat ears hidden inside the loops. She wears purple eye shadow in cats eye style.\n\nPajamas\n\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, Blake's pajamas are a black, long-sleeved, Yukata style shirt with white edging over a purple undershirt and a matching skirt. A black obi is wrapped around her waist and tied with a black and white string. While at Beacon, she wears her bow while sleeping.\n\nAlternate Outfit (Intruder)\n\nV2 04 00066\nAlternate Outfit \"Intruder\"\nDuring the events of \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\", Blake wears an alternate outfit code named \"Intruder\".[9]\n\nThis outfit consists of a white, V-neck, zip-up crop shirt with a black hem and three-quarter sleeves. Her emblem is printed in off-white on the left side of the shirt. She wears black leather pants that have a vertical gray stripe on the outer side of each leg and a black belt.\n\nAttached to the rear of the belt is a black piece of fabric that covers her from hip to hip. Underneath this is a longer, translucent, purple piece of fabric. She also wears black high-heel boots with two straps and buckles and purple under roles, reaching to mid-calf. She retains the black ribbons on her forearms and her black bow.\n\nDance\n\nDuring the Beacon Dance, Blake wears a short, purple, asymmetrical, halter neck dress that is split up the right side and has a black collar. Translucent black mesh covers her shoulders, decolletage and back, and decorative black swirls cover the left side of the dress and continue up the left strap. The outfit is completed with black pumps, and she wears a teal bow on her head as opposed to her usual black one.\n\nBeacon Uniform\n\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, Blake wears the same brown shoes, red tartan skirt, white blouse with maroon trim and thin red bow, a brown vest with gold buttons and a maroon blazer with gold trim as every other girl attending Beacon Academy, alongside knee-high black socks.\n\nMistral Outfit (Volumes 4-7)\n\n\nAfter the timeskip following the Fall of Beacon, her design features a long white tailcoat with dark violet inner lining and a sleeveless black crop top, as well as a belt attached from behind. The crop top has rectangular and diamond-shaped cutouts around the neckline, which have purple outlines beginning in Volume 6. Additionally, she wears a white belt over black skintight leather pants. After the confrontation with Adam in \"Heroes and Monsters\", Blake has been left with an X-shaped scar just above her left hip.\n\nAcross her torso is a diagonal strap that has a smaller magnetic clip on the back, which is used to sheathe Gambol Shroud. She wears thigh-high black heeled boots with gold-colored edging around the top. The left boot has a belt wrapped twice around the thigh. Each boot bears her Belladonna emblem in white on the outer side of the thigh, and a white pouch is attached to the back of her belt.\n\n\nBlake in her Mistral attire, sans coat\nIn \"Of Runaways and Stowaways\", Blake removes her bow and throws it into the ocean. Later, in \"The Lady in the Shoe\", Adam slashes her tailcoat off her.\n\nFrom Volume 4 onward, Blake's cat ears have a tendency to fold down or otherwise move in sync with her emotional state, much like the ears of an actual cat.\n\nAtlas Outfit (Volume 7-Current)\n\n\nAfter arriving in Atlas and meeting with James Ironwood, Blake cuts her hair to a shoulder-length bob. She changes her attire to a purple sleeveless leather catsuit with attached boots that has light purple soles and trim. The catsuit has a high neck with a single short silver zipper alongside matching zippers that run from her thighs to her ankles on the front of the legs. A pair of knee pads, matching color to the catsuit with silver studs on them are attached to the knees of the catsuit.\n\nHer long, white tailcoat has desaturated purple detailing on the chest, sleeves, sides and collar alongside a dark purple detailing on the back. It has a narrow belt around the collar and a wide white belt loosely secured around her waist through the coat's belt loops. The belt has two pouches attached to the back. The coattails end in a point and the inside lining is vivid purple. The front zipper of the coat is upside down and extends to the very bottom of the coat, and there are additional zippers along the lower half of the sleeves with a single purple line running between the zipper and her shoulders. Around each wrist is a dark purple belted wristband and has a desaturated purple magnetic backpack on her back.\n\nLucid Dream Outfit (Ice Queendom)\n\n\nDream Blake Belladonna.\nFor Blake, she wears dark purple fur trimmed ankle boots, with the heels being a lavender color alongside dark purple thigh length stockings that gradate to purple. As well as a pair of white shorts with black zig-zagged stitching on the fronts she wears a purple leather leotard, partially unzipped with exposed gray section around the bust. Under the bust is a white belt wrapping around two coattails with white lining, a small cat paw print appears on the left coattail around the breast area. Instead of her hands, she has dark purple humanoid/Grimm-like paws with claws, with tufts of fur around her wrists, alongside some ribbon, and dark paw pad. She also sports a large white choker around her neck. On her head, there is only one piece of ribbon covering one of her ears, with the other one being out in the open. And unlike herself in the real world, she has a black cat tail.\n\nEarth Outfit\n\n\nAfter arriving on Earth, Blake's Faunus ears are gone making her human and wears a black mask. Her outfit is basically a combination of her Beacon and Mistral attires and Ilia's White Fang uniform. She wears a black sleeveless crop top with gold zipper and a hood with purple insides to match her long gloves with gold knuckles, pants, and black calf-high, wedged boots that are folded over with a gold zipper on the side. Over it, she wears white belt straps with gold and dark grey buckles that connect to her outfit except on her gloves and hold her white pockets.\n\nGallery\n\nOriginal Outfit\nOriginal Outfit\nBeacon Nightgown\nBeacon Nightgown\nYoung Blake in her flashback from \"Black and White\"\nYoung Blake in her flashback from \"Black and White\"\nIntruder outfit with white fang mask\nIntruder outfit with white fang mask\nMistral Outfit\nMistral Outfit\nMistral Outfit With Bow\nMistral Outfit With Bow\nAtlas Pajamas\nAtlas Pajamas\nOriginal Outfit without bow\nOriginal Outfit without bow\nBeacon School Uniform\nBeacon School Uniform\nIntruder outfit from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nIntruder outfit from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nSame outfit after Adam rips her jacket\nSame outfit after Adam rips her jacket\nAtlas Outfit\nAtlas Outfit\nPower Armor From \"RWBY Grimm Eclipse Definitive Edition\"\nPower Armor From \"RWBY Grimm Eclipse Definitive Edition\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nAll my life, I fought for what I thought was right. I had a partner named Adam. More of a mentor, actually. He always assured me that what we were doing would make the world a better place but, of course, his idea of a perfect future turned out to be not perfect for everyone. I joined the Academy because I knew Huntsmen and Huntresses were regarded as the noblest warriors in the world, always fighting for good, but I never really thought past that. When I leave the Academy, what will I—? How can I undo so many years of hate?\nBLAKE BELLADONNA.\n\nBlake is described by her voice actress Arryn Zech as being \"mellow\". She displays a cool, reserved and serious personality most of the time but does not lack a humorous side, which is usually in the form of dry wit and sarcasm. Blake is a righteous person, respecting other people's lives regardless of whether they are Faunus or not. She strongly despises those who judge and discriminate based on racial prejudice. Blake is outspoken, going so far as to indirectly insult the Schnee Dust Company in front of its heiress and defend Faunus of any kind. Despite her generally quiet demeanor, she can be surprisingly charismatic, as when she rallied the Faunus to defend Mistral against the White Fang after the attack on her home.\n\nBlake is shown to be an introvert. Although she reads books to distance herself from the discussion at hand, as the series continues, she is shown to be more facetious and friendly. Blake appears most conversant when discussing the history and plight of her people.\n\nAs a Faunus, Blake has faced discrimination in the past and wears a bow when around Humans in order to be treated for her character and not her species. However, despite having no hate for Humans, she has seen how the real world works and wonders how she can undo so many years of hate and pain. After the Fall of Beacon, Blake discards her bow and does not cover her ears again, even around the presence of Humans, showing that she is no longer afraid to be seen as a Faunus.\n\nBlake's past negatively influenced her personality, leading to moodiness, stubbornness, sleep deprivation and trust issues at times. She also has self-loathing issues, viewing herself as a criminal hiding in plain sight because of her past with the White Fang until her teammates convinced her that they still trusted and cared for her despite her being a Faunus and a former member of the White Fang. She also viewed herself as a coward who ran from her problems, as her Semblance was a prospect of her tendency to avoid conflict. She had even felt unworthy of her parents' love after leaving them behind for the White Fang's cause. However, her strong sense of righteousness led her to strongly disagree with the White Fang's increasing level of violence and hatred towards Humans, especially Adam's. It was thanks to her realization of seeing how spiteful and uncaring Adam was for Human lives she not only left the group but also decided to fight back after discovering Adam was planning to overthrow Sienna Khan and gain total control over the White Fang.\n\nThanks to her parents' unconditional love and Sun Wukong's support of her, Blake began to grow out of her self-loathing issues and mistrust for others, with Sun persuading her to let her friends help her as much as she believes she is helping them. She uses this in turn to persuade Ilia Amitola to leave the White Fang and find the courage to confront Adam with others' help and to reunite with her teammates at Haven. After she and Yang kill Adam for good, she vows to keep her promise by never running again, no longer viewing herself as a coward.\n\nDuring her time at Beacon, she learns to open up more and trust her teammates and became more fun loving while hanging out with her friends, but when the Battle of Beacon happened, and Adam vowing to destroy everything she loved, she was regressed to loneliness and isolation, until Sun's persistence helps straighten out her understanding of the value and importance of having friends. After saving Haven Academy, reconciling with her teammates, and defeated Adam for good, she starts to relearn how to relax and have fun, such as going clubbing with Yang and Team FNKI.\n\nDue to her time in the White Fang, Blake holds a bias against Atlas and its military as a whole. This is most noticeable regarding her double standard in keeping secrets. In \"A New Approach\", she goes along with Ruby's decision to lie to James Ironwood and keep Ozpin's disappearance, how many questions left in the Relic of Knowledge, and Salem's immortality a secret. Yet in \"Worst Case Scenario\", she and Yang have no trouble spilling information on the Amity Communications Tower to Robyn Hill despite Ironwood's insistence on keeping it secret, due to the former sympathizing with her nature as a vigilante. These acts are one of the reasons why Ironwood eventually loses trust in them.\n\nHer Faunus traits also seem to give her other aspects of a cat, such as climbing up to Ruby's bed to stay away from Ruby and Yang's pet dog, Zwei. Another time, she is distracted by and instinctively decides to follow a laser pointer light to a waiting Yang in \"Burning the Candle\". She also has a great love for tuna, as shown in \"Round One\" where she drools over a bowl of noodles topped with tuna.\n\nIn “A Cat Most Curious“, when Blake’s past self offers Blake an opportunity of changing her form to either a human or a cat in order to fit in and not being discriminated, Blake declines her offer as she is done hiding for who she is, and she is proud to be a Faunus. It shows on much Blake has changed and accept her status as a Faunus as she has many people who treated her equally.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nBlake shows high agility, speed, and endurance, as shown when fighting multiple enemies yet maintaining motion and energy without fatigue. She also exhibits a high level of skill when handling Gambol Shroud. She can slash away at opponents with startling speed and deflect incoming machine-gun fire using her blade.\n\nBlake also possesses remarkable reflexes, as she is able to dodge a nearly point-blank strike from Adam by using her Semblance. She is also capable of jumping large distances, leaping from building to building and even on moving cars, as seen in \"Painting the Town...\". Her fighting style takes advantage of her agility and reflexes, evading opponents' strikes until she is in the best position for a counterblow.\n\nAs a Faunus, Blake possesses the ability of night vision, granting her the ability to see proficiently in the dark, as is shown after shooting out the power during the White Fang Faction Meeting, using the dark as a means for her and Sun to escape from Roman Torchwick and the White Fang.\n\nBlake has somewhat enhanced hearing as well, having more than one set of ears. During her battle with Adam in \"The Lady in the Shoe\", she hears Yang's approach before Adam does, as indicated by her twitching cat ears.\n\nShe displayed decent control of Aura on two different occasion offensively, releasing crescent slashes from Gambol Shroud in \"Painting the Town...\", cutting through multiple missiles released by the Atlesian Paladin-290 Prototype and \"No Brakes\" on the underground Black Cargo Train.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Gambol Shroud\n1003 Black Trailer 3586\nBlake dual-wielding the sword and sheath\nBlake's weapon of choice is Gambol Shroud, a sword that has three forms. When sheathed, the weapon is able to slice opponents in two with its cleaver-like cover. However, when unsheathed, Blake is able to use both a sword and sheath in tandem against her opponents. It can also transform into a gun. Gambol Shroud was damaged in combat against Adam in \"The Lady in the Shoe\"; the blade being cut horizontally in half by Wilt and later received an upgrade in Atlas. Using the black ribbon that extends off the weapon's grip, Blake can convert Gambol Shroud into a kusarigama, a grappling hook to swing herself or her friends, or ensnare or tangle her opponents. In \"The Final Word\", Gambol Shroud's ribbon is burned in two by Cinder; it is briefly taken up by Weiss but is subsequently lost to the Void when the Evacuation Central Location dissolves. She later gets her weapon back after landing in the Ever After.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Shadow\n1108 Players and Pieces 13769\nUsing her Semblance in mid-air to launch herself toward a Nevermore\nBlake's Semblance, Shadow, allows her to create shadow-clones of herself.[10] These clones push her in the direction of her choosing and can be used to trick and disorient opponents.\n\nBlake can use Dust to give her clones additional abilities. Dust allows the clones to copy an element, with her afterimages becoming completely solid or even completely intangible depending on the chosen form of Dust. Fire Dust allows her to create fiery clones that explode on contact, Ice Dust allows her to create solid ice copies of herself (which opponents can get their weapons stuck in), Earth Dust allows her to create a clone of solid stone, and Lightning Dust zips her to another location quickly.\n\nSuperpowers\n\nBlake Shadow Bending FX Reference 1\nConcept art of Blake's shadowbending powers.\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Blake is transformed into a human after traveling to Earth. She loses her Aura, Semblance, and Faunus instincts, in exchange receiving superpowers akin to Earth's metahumans. Blake's superpowers are called \"shadowbending\". They enable the control over darkness-like energy, mainly in the form of dark energy blasts. She can also generate constructs out of darkness/shadows and fly via wing constructs. She loses these powers upon leaving Earth.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlthough Blake does not appear to have many physical weaknesses, her Gambol Shroud does in its kusarigama form. If she is using it to grapple and leap around, one can knock it out of its intentional trajectory to make her lose momentum. One can even cut its ribbon and force Blake to fall whilst she is swinging.\n\nSome of her Dust clones through her Semblance can also be used against her, as seen when she was knocked aside by her own Ice Dust clone in a fight against a Cenitaur."

She is a Huntress, having been trained at the now defunct Beacon Academy. Her weapon of choice is her High-Caliber Sniper-Scythe known as Crescent Rose, which she designed herself.[14]\n\nRuby first appeared in the \"Red\" Trailer, visiting the grave of her mother, Summer Rose. After an invitation from Professor Ozpin following a short battle with Roman Torchwick, Ruby attends Beacon Academy in order to become a Huntress. During her time at Beacon, Ruby became a member and the leader of Team RWBY, consisting of herself, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and her older half-sister, Yang Xiao Long.[15]\n\nHowever, after the disbandment of her team following the Fall of Beacon, Ruby travels to Haven Academy as a member of Team RNJR with the remaining members of Team JNPR. After the Battle of Haven, Team RWBY is reunited again, and they alongside their friends continue to fight in the war against Salem and her forces.\n\nFollowing a battle with Neopolitan in the Central Location, Ruby was dropped into the void by Cinder Fall and ended up in another realm, the Ever After, along with the rest of Team RWBY and Jaune.\n\nIn “The Perils of Paper Houses”, she ran away from her team due to stress taking a heavy toll on her psyche, later finding herself in a trap set by Neo in \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\". The ensuing confrontation broke Ruby's spirit, eventually causing her to ascend. However, in “Of Solitude and Self”, she eventually accepted herself and returned to help her team defeat the Curious Cat and return to Remnant.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the name of Ruby Rose's weapon in RWBY? toggle section\nWho trained Ruby Rose to become a Huntress? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of the 'Red' Trailer in Ruby Rose's story? toggle section\nWho invited Ruby Rose to attend Beacon Academy? toggle section\nHow did Ruby Rose's mother, Summer Rose, influence her journey? toggle section\nAppearance\n\nRuby is a fair-skinned young girl with silver eyes and neck-length black hair with red tips.\nOriginal Outfit (Volumes 1–3)\n\n1101 Ruby Rose 06318\nDuring her time attending Beacon Academy, she wears a black dress consisting of a long-sleeved blouse with a high collar and red trim on the sleeves, over which is a black waist cincher with red lacing up the front, and a matching skirt with red lining and a red petticoat.

She is quick to reveal she wanted to become a Huntress in order to be like the great heroes in fairy tales, and she has described being one as far more \"romantic\" than being a police officer. Her mentality is described as \"I don't have time for my emotions. I've gotta make sure that everybody else is okay.\"[17] Lindsay Jones claims Ruby's mentality is \"selfless, but that means she's not dealing with her own issues. Compartmentalizing and internalizing her grief is what might eventually destroy her.\"[18] She has also shown a distinct lack of ability to pick up social cues due to being a very open and honest person. This results in her inability to pick up Weiss' sarcasm in the \"The Shining Beacon\" and her struggling to act formally in \"It's Brawl in the Family\".\n\nRuby is a self-proclaimed dork when it comes to weapons; she is quite intelligent, having designed and built Crescent Rose during her time at Signal, although she admits to going \"a little overboard\" with its design. She feels that seeing new weapons \"is like meeting new people, but better.\" Oum has said she relies on Crescent Rose quite often in battle.\n\nRuby has a strong sense of moral justice, a trait she obtained from stories about heroes and monsters that her sister used to read for her, as well as the way her parents raised her. These stories are what gave her the ideals that she wished to live by and uphold throughout her life and are the reason for her love for books.\n\nRuby is shown to be naïve as although she doesn't like to be the center of attention, becoming a Huntress would effectively put her in the spotlight. In addition to her dislike of attention, Ruby prefers to either be alone or with Yang. However, she has become comfortable around Team RWBY and Team JNPR. She does not lack social skills but has problems when meeting new people. This is mostly because of her childish nature and lack of social grace, as she can be bad-mannered (only out of ignorance) and sometimes speaks without thinking. However, because of her enthusiastic personality, she can become very good friends with people who share her enthusiasm.\n\nDespite this, Ruby's leadership skills make her a worthy teammate. While she may occasionally act without thinking, sometimes she seems to understand the situation better than most. She can then use this ability to quickly formulate plans. This was seen during Team RWBY's battle with the Nevermore, in which her teammates' positions allowed her to come up with a successful plan. After Ozpin assigned Ruby as leader of Team RWBY and talked to her in \"The Badge and The Burden, Pt.2\", Ruby took her new role seriously, studying so hard and so late, she fell asleep in the middle of the task. She has become a resourceful and dependable leader and was also able to pass her beliefs as leader to Jaune Arc, thus helping him find a new sense of responsibility for the safety and well-being of his own team.\n\nRuby is also shown to care for all her teammates equally, despite their background. This is seen in how she expresses sympathy for Weiss' bad childhood after she explains her family's history with the White Fang, before showing the same concern moments later for Blake Belladonna when she runs away, having let slip her prior involvement with the group, and by extension indirectly revealing that she was a Faunus. Ruby's concern is further expressed in her desperate search for her teammate. This sense of care is later shown not to be limited to her teammates. She also shows some worry for Penny, telling the latter to stay out of the fight between Roman Torchwick, Blake Belladonna, and Sun Wukong.\n\nAlthough Ruby has no trouble interacting with her friends, she does have trouble actually making them, and once admits that seeing new weapons \"is like meeting new people, but better\". This could have been a result of her having been accepted two years earlier to Beacon Academy, which forces her to leave her friends at Signal behind, as well as interact with people that are both older and more experienced than she is. Regardless, both she and Jaune Arc toast to being socially awkward during the Beacon Dance.\n\nIn the second chapter of the manga, it is revealed that Ruby originally had enochlophobia, a fear of large crowds, as shown when she freezes up during a sparring match against Cardin Winchester. However, she manages to work through that fear with some encouragement from her teammates long enough to win the spar, and by the Vytal Festival, she has overcome them entirely.\n\nDespite her social awkwardness, Ruby is far from shy: she is enthusiastic and often eager to speak her mind. She is capable of being assertive, when necessary, as she has verbally stood her ground against many people who have tried to dissuade or humiliate her, including Weiss Schnee before they became friends, Roman Torchwick, Neopolitan, Caroline Cordovin and James Ironwood. Despite her usual kindness, Ruby can also be stern with her friends and close ones when she feels it necessary, such as arguing with Qrow in Argus or with Yang in Mantle.\n\nRuby also has a sweet tooth, preferring five sugars in her coffee and scarfing down a large plate of cookies in \"Ruby Rose\". She is even seen with a plate of cookies in \"Jaunedice\", while her friends are eating more nutritious meals. This is shown again in \"Alone Together\", where Ruby rejoices and accepts coffee after learning Weiss put \"blasphemous amounts of cream and sugar\" in it.\n\nIn combat or dangerous situations, she is shown to be quite impulsive and battle eager, such as when she attacks a Death Stalker upon seeing it before learning of its high resistance to bullets and blades. This trait contrasts with her adaptability, for she is quite capable of forming attack plans with others in order to take down stronger foes, such as the Nevermore in \"Players and Pieces\" and Roman in the Atlesian Paladin-290 in \"Painting the Town...\".\n\nRuby has been shown to be ruthless at times when it comes to protecting her loved ones, such as when she nonchalantly cuts off Tyrian Callows' stinger in \"Punished\" after he manages to injure and poison Qrow Branwen. When Neopolitan knocks Yang over the edge of the Central Location in \"Worthy\", Ruby attempts to cut Neo in half using the same motion she frequently employs on Grimm.\n\nIn \"Lost\", Ruby further develops as a leader whenever she and her friends find themselves in trouble. This is evident when she directs the group when they are attacked on the Argus Limited and when she stands up to Qrow after he turns down Jaune's proposed idea of stealing a military airship to get to Atlas. In this, Ruby is a great source of inspiration and admiration for her team. In \"Dark\", Blake recounts that Ruby's determination and optimism are something that has always inspired her, and she continues to look up to her despite being older. In \"Risk\", Yang points out that, while Ruby's optimism and determination had occasionally been blind, it was also necessary in many situations, to provide the team with hope when they took risks. In \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", Weiss mentions that Ruby has always been the one to get them through the hard times.\n\nRuby prefers to be open and not keep secrets from her teammates and friends. Despite this, she feels it to be necessary on some occasions. In \"A New Approach\", she lied to Ironwood and kept Ozpin's disappearance, how many questions left in the Relic of Knowledge, and Salem's immortality a secret from him, though she obviously felt uncomfortable in doing so. She later expresses doubt about this decision, as she feels it makes her the same as Ozpin. Eventually, after Ironwood agrees to tell the populace about the Amity project, Ruby has Oscar reveal the truth to him in hopes they can finally trust one another. However, when Ironwood decides to abandon Mantle due to Salem's impending arrival, Ruby realizes he can't be trusted to make the right choices anymore and begins steeling herself to stand by her friends instead.[19]\n\nAs team leader, Ruby constantly retains a brave, determined and positive outlook. However, when depressed or under intense pressure, she requires the same emotional support she often provides to her friends. In Atlas, having to make difficult choices gradually began weighing more heavily on Ruby, especially when her plans would fail, or her team would become divided. She was also disturbed after seeing the core of The Hound, concerned about what Salem could have possibly done to her mother.\n\nAfter falling into the Ever After and learning about Penny's death, Ruby's resolve temporarily wavered as she grew more depressed, blaming herself for everything that went wrong in Atlas. She had a hard time even picking up Crescent Rose and felt like she didn't live up to her mother's legacy. Despite normally being open and supportive, at the moment she felt too much pressure to be able to talk about her current feelings of depression, and snapped at her friends for seemingly taking her support for granted. These issues came to a climax when, after being tortured by Neo's clones of her deceased friends and former allies blaming her for her past failures, the Curious Cat revealed to have been manipulated her so they could possess her, as well as seeing Little's death, Ruby momentarily wished she could stop being herself. She decided to drink the tea mixed with the Great Tree's leaf to ascend and become someone better. Eventually, after talking with the Blacksmith, Ruby realized that her own mother wasn't as perfect as she thought, and remembering her words of encouragement from her childhood, she was able to obtain closure and accept her failures, deciding to ascend as herself, regaining her cheerful demeanor, confidence, and will to fight, as shown in her altercation with the Curious Cat and remained unfazed by their attempts to break her again.\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two following her experience in the Ever After, she is plagued by the reality of her mortality and fear of a lack of legacy. Thus Ruby begins fighting relentlessly to the point of recklessness to her teams concern. It isn’t until Superman counsels her that she is willing to slow down and learn to cherish her health more to uphold her ideals rather than die for them.\nPowers and Abilities\n\nIn order to become a Huntress, Ruby trained at Signal Academy, where her skills and abilities far surpassed her peers. Wielding a dangerous weapon like Crescent Rose required strength, balance and adaptability, all of which she demonstrated the night she stopped the robbery of From Dust Till Dawn, a Dust shop in Vale. This led Ozpin to accept her into Beacon Academy two years before the usual age of admittance.\n\nWhile at Beacon, Ruby developed skills as a decisive leader, being able to formulate and execute tactical plans with others in order to take down tougher foes, such as the giant Nevermore the team encountered during initiation, and later in coordinated attacks against Roman in an Atlesian Paladin-290. However, perhaps Ruby's greatest strength is her ability to give hope when it is needed most- something Ozpin described as \"Something unquantifiable... a spark.\" She always sees the best in people, and has a knack for finding the right words in the right situation, whether when rallying her teammates, comforting demoralized or suffering allies, or trying to sway enemies to her side. While Ruby's willingness to negotiate has occasionally backfired (such as with Raven in \"The More the Merrier\" and Ironwood in \"Gravity\") she has inspired many with her words, actions and perseverance as a leader and Huntress.\n\nRuby's sense of balance stands out, particularly in precarious situations like perching on a taut ribbon in \"Players and Pieces\" or running off an exploding airship in \"Heroes and Monsters\". Despite her small size, Ruby's physical strength is considerable, given how skillfully she wields the large and bulky Crescent Rose. Perhaps one of the best demonstrations of her strength was during her initiation, when she used Crescent Rose to drag a Giant Nevermore vertically up a cliff, at high speed (although she was assisted by Weiss' glyphs and Crescent Rose's recoil).\n\nRuby's fighting style relies heavily on her creative uses of and methods for achieving momentum, relying on a combination of her Semblance and Crescent Rose's recoil to allow her to achieve massive impact force, then speeding away to avoid counterattacks and prepare her next strike. She can also throw her opponents off by creating slipstreams and even small whirlwinds using her Semblance. At closer quarters, she will attempt to overwhelm her opponent with a barrage of lightning-quick slashes, often not allowing them time to dodge or check her attack.\n\nRuby also has some skills as a seamstress. According to RWBY: After the Fall, she made her original outfit herself.[20]\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Crescent Rose\nBlur\nRuby attacking Beowolves with Crescent Rose\nRuby's weapon of choice is Crescent Rose. Ruby is self-admittedly obsessed when it comes to weapons, which shows in her complex design and craftsmanship of her weapon, a High-Caliber Sniper-Scythe which she designed herself at Signal, as well as her eye for detail when observing other people's weapons and tools. This weapon can transform between a scythe and a sniper rifle and can fire Dust rounds in either form with massive force. Ruby has proven to have excellent marksmanship, making a perfect headshot on a fleeing Geist in \"The Next Step\" and shooting down a missile in \"The Lady in the Shoe\".\n\nAfter arriving in Atlas, Crescent Rose was upgraded, with the blade now capable of rotation, allowing Ruby to swing her weapon more freely when in cramped spaces such as caves.\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Ruby uses a wooden scythe belonging to Scarecrow after losing Crescent Rose.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Petal Burst\n1201 Best Day Ever 16878\nRuby using her Semblance\nRuby's Semblance, Petal Burst (also known as Speed), allows her to dash with an inhuman speed in whatever direction she chooses, often leaving trails of rose petals in her wake.[21] In \"Best Day Ever\", Ruby is shown to be capable of creating powerful tailwinds with her Semblance; if she gathers enough momentum, the resulting turbulence is capable of lifting people off the ground.\n\nWithin the episode \"Ace Operatives\", it was stated by Harriet Bree that Ruby's Semblance is not like other speed-type Semblances, though she does not elaborate.\n\nIt is later revealed by Penny in \"Strings\" that Ruby's Semblance allows her to disassemble herself at a molecular level and reassemble at a chosen location, negating her mass. With practice, she has proven able to do the same with anyone she is in contact with, similar to Ren's Semblance; she can carry at least four people along with her. This allows her to go around obstacles or through paths that she would not otherwise fit. She has also proven able to negate gravity while using her Semblance; in \"The Final Word\", she uses her Semblance mid-fall to circle up and around Neopolitan, attacking her from behind. However, as shown by her battle with Mercury in \"PvP\", if her path is blocked by an unexpected obstacle mid-flight, her Semblance can be disrupted, forcing her to stop.\n\nSilver Eyes\n\nMain article: Silver-Eyed Warrior\nV3 12 00136\nRuby using her Silver Eyes\nThrough her mother, Summer, Ruby comes from a line of legendary warriors who possessed powerful abilities related to their Silver Eyes, said to be an extremely rare trait. Upon seeing Pyrrha Nikos die in \"End of the Beginning\", Ruby accidentally uses this power in her grief and petrifies the Wyvern. However, she has no memory of doing this other than her head hurting. Later in the episode, Qrow describes a fairy tale about warriors with Silver Eyes who are so powerful that even the Grimm fear them.\n\nIn \"The Next Step\", it is revealed that Ruby's powers injured Cinder Fall greatly, causing her to lose her left eye and arm, and making it difficult for her to speak for a period of time. Salem states that this is due to Cinder's possession of the Fall Maiden powers but does not explain why this is the case. However, when Ruby uses her powers once again in \"The More the Merrier\", Raven Branwen, who possesses the Spring Maiden powers, is not affected despite being in the vicinity, indicating that the Maiden powers themselves do not cause an individual to be affected by the Silver Eye. This indicates that the reason Cinder was affected was due to her usage of the Grimm, through a Grimm beetle glove and later a Shadow Hand.\n\nIn \"Alone in the Woods\", Ruby has managed to activate her power intentionally after Maria Calavera tells her to concentrate on her loved ones, turning a group of Apathy to dust. Through Maria's guidance, Ruby was able to petrify the Leviathan in the episode \"Our Way\", but the massive Grimm was able to partially destroy the stone encasing its body before it was destroyed by Caroline Cordovin.\n\nDespite Maria's guidance, Ruby still hasn't fully mastered the activation of her powers. In \"Out in the Open\", Ruby attempts to activate her eyes while fighting an Alpha Megoliath but is unable to concentrate with all the chaos. However, in \"The Enemy of Trust\", she quickly and easily activates her Silver Eyes upon seeing Cinder.\n\nIn “Light in Shadows” from RWBY: Ice Queendom, her powers can be activate in dreamscapes. She unknowingly uses it for the first time on a Nightmare to weaken it.\n\nSuperpowers\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Ruby lost both her Aura and Semblance with her arrival on Earth, replaced instead with the power of teleportation. When teleporting, she causes a burst of red energy and rose petals. Like on Remnant, she could grab people and take them with her, including inanimate objects.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nV2 10 00033\nWithout her weapon, Ruby is effortlessly beaten by two White Fang goons.\nRuby is heavily reliant on Crescent Rose. In contrast to her sister, her hand-to-hand capabilities were rather poor, making her easy to be taken down by mere grunts when unarmed. Without her weapon, there is not much she could do in a fight, and her best bet is to run away with her speed. Her cape, on occasion, has been exploited and used against her, notably during the Beacon initiation when a Nevermore pinned her cape to the ground with its feather-spears. In \"Lighting the Fire\" Ruby is shown to be slightly improving in hand-to-hand combat under the tutelage of Professor Ozpin through Oscar Pine. She shows this further while battling Mercury in \"Downfall\"; when disarmed by him, she dodges his next blow and knocks him back with a headbutt.\n\nAlthough less skilled in unarmed combat, Ruby can often compensate by using her wits and her surroundings to turn the tables on her opponent, if she is unarmed. She has notably defeated Neopolitan, a much more skilled melee fighter, twice in this manner. The first was atop Ironwood's flagship during the Fall of Beacon, where Ruby managed to activate Hush's parasol and blow Neo off the ship. Later, when Ruby is disarmed in \"The Final Word\", she tricks Neo into lunging at her, then uses her Semblance to circle behind, disarming her and knocking her off the platform in a single attack. In \"With Friends Like These\", when Harriet lands multiple blows on her and is about to restrain her, Ruby uses her similar Semblance (which is slower but more maneuverable than Harriet's) to outmaneuver her opponent and turn the tables on her.\n\nUntil she was guided by Maria, Ruby was using the power of her Silver Eyes in reaction to the death of a close friend or a loved one being in danger, without control on her part. In \"Gravity\", when Ruby experienced negative emotions after she found out about her mother's fate, she briefly lost control the power of her Silver Eyes and her head begun to hurt."

I've just kinda always gone with the flow, you know? And that's fine; I mean, that's who I am, but how long can I really do that for? I wanna be a Huntress, not really because I want to be a hero, but because I want adventure. I want a life where I won't know what tomorrow will bring and that will be a good thing. Being a Huntress just happens to line up with that.\nYANG XIAO LONG.\n\nYang's voice actress, Barbara Dunkelman, has said that when Yang's character was described to her, she was described as \"the kind of person who would teach someone how to swim by pushing them in the water\".[8] This speaks volumes about how Yang approaches most things in life. She is very straightforward and confident.\n\nYang is also described as being a cheerful, energetic, and bright young lady. She is arguably the most flippant, carefree, and adventurous member of her team, frequently making sarcastic comments and jokes even in the heat of battle and often taking combat and hostile situations lightly. Yang is very sociable and extroverted, even in unfamiliar situations. Yang's love of adventure is the main reason that she decided to become a Huntress. Blake considers Yang the personification of the word \"strength\". According to Ruby, she snores loudly.[9]\n\nHowever, Yang's \"brawler\" fighting style is evocative of her personality. Her anger, one of her main assets in battle, can lead her to act predictably and has put her into danger repeatedly. She was easily frustrated when she couldn't land a hit on Neopolitan and could not attack precisely because of it, leading to her getting knocked unconscious and almost killed. Yang is also very protective of her hair, becoming enraged when someone touches or rips or cuts even a small portion of her hair, causing her to attack with straight, blunt force the one who did it. However she is comfortable with letting Ruby touch or brush her hair or even use it to toy with her sister by tickling her nose. According to Taiyang, she shares a flaw with her mother: thinking strength is all that matters in a fight. Her thoughtless anger also led to the quick loss of her right arm in a short encounter with Adam Taurus after he angered her by injuring Blake. While recovering from her injuries, her father lectures her about this weakness and guides her in what she needs to do to start overcoming it along with her flaw that she shares with her mother.\n\nDespite this, Yang is quite mature. She is extremely nurturing and motherly, particularly toward her younger sister, Ruby. Yang pushes her into being outgoing and also worries a great deal about her sister across the many battles they fight in. This protective and encouraging nature extends to Blake and Weiss as well. Yang is worried about Blake on several occasions, such as when she runs from her team and when she suffers from sleep and appetite problems, opening Yang to discussing her stubborn past. What Yang does not reveal is that she suffers from abandonment issues, blaming herself for her mother not sticking around.[10]\n\nYang is also quite guile as she was able to teach Weiss on how to play Remnant: The Game by explaining to her how to use her cards in the game only to better trick Weiss into wasting her armies. She later used a laser to attract Blake so they would be able to talk and even tricked a bandit into revealing the location of Raven's camp. She is also perspicacious as she saw through her mother's facade and attempt to manipulate her into staying with the tribe during their first meeting, recognized her in her corvid form at Haven, and quickly deduced that her mother was the Spring Maiden and had killed the former maiden.\n\nHowever, after the deaths of Pyrrha Nikos and Penny Polendina, the Fall of Beacon, the losses of her right arm and her partner Blake, Yang sunk into a reclusive depression. The mention of her missing partner agitates her and she gives Ruby the cold shoulder and even outright ignores her sister when she says, \"I love you\". Over months, Yang rebounds from this reclusive nature. Though she suffers from PTSD, she tries to keep moving forward, partially for her father's sake when feeling she holds him back. After overhearing her father and Bartholomew Oobleck talking about Ruby outside her window, she accepts the earlier wisdom of her father, Oobleck, and Professor Peter Port and dons her new cybernetic arm.\n\nWhen training with her new limb, she learns how to balance her driven and positive nature without overconfidence or agitation. She paints her arm to match her style, changes to a new outfit, and headed to Mistral although her father believes she has not overcome her personality flaws. Fortunately, she has shown to not be as quick to blind anger in combat anymore and now fights displaying good strategy and intelligence, as seen with her rematch against Adam and when she fought the Ace-Ops. While traveling to Mistral to reunite with Ruby she continues to struggle with her PTSD, which manifests in her left arm shaking when she encounters stress. She, however, appears to have overcome it some time after she and Blake reluctantly killed Adam.\n\nYang is extremely sensitive about being abandoned and her \"simmering anger\" stems from these abandonment issues.[11] For the better part of nearly two decades, Yang spent her life searching for her mother, trying to understand her reasons for leaving. Their first reunion in \"Lighting the Fire\" also demonstrated how low her opinion was of Raven, reacting with anger after Raven said that Yang finally decided to visit her, making it sound like she was the one responsible for her mother not being a part of her life. She even ignored Raven's attempts at lightening the mood and became hostile upon her father, uncle and Team RWBY being insulted in \"Known by its Song\". Even after her team's reunion at Haven, Yang was still guarded and kept some distance from Blake, stating in \"Argus Limited\" that their relationship would need time to heal. After a rematch against Adam in \"Seeing Red\" however, Yang fully accepted Blake's apologies, giving her partner a second chance and understanding that she was not like her mother.\n\nDespite her fear of Salem, she was still strongly willing to continue fighting against her and to take the Relic of Knowledge to Atlas, despite knowing that it may put a target on her back. Even after learning about Salem's immortality and knowing that she wasn't a match for her, Yang still went against her in order to allow her friends to escape and did not hesitate to call Salem out on her actions. She also has a good degree of heroism and selflessness, being willing to takes the attacks from an Ursa and from Neo to protect Ruby as seen in the \"Volume 5 Yang Character Short\" and \"Worthy\" respectively, and even attacked Salem to save Emerald despite her enmity and distrust for her actions.\n\nShe has an opposition to keeping secrets. In \"Rest and Resolutions\", she had Ozpin swear not to lie or tell half-truths and later, in \"Uncovered\", she is upset with him for keeping the nature of the Relic of Knowledge a secret from the group as well as covering up Leonardo Lionheart's treachery. In \"A New Approach\", she was willing to trust Ruby's judgement in not telling James Ironwood the full truth about Salem and the Lamp, but questioned this decision privately later. When sent to apprehend Robyn Hill in \"Worst Case Scenario\", she and Blake instead revealed Ironwood's plans for the Amity Communications Tower to her. Despite her staunchness towards half-truths, she is not above telling some herself. In \"Haven's Fate\", Yang told an account of what happened in the Vault without explicitly bringing up how Raven was the Spring Maiden the whole time.\n\nFollowing the events of Volume 7, Yang hardens herself in order to prepare for the overwhelming situation that they were in. She was hurt by what had happened to Mantle and wanted to do whatever she could to help them, hinting at her reason for criticizing her younger sister.[12]\n\nDespite her good qualities, Yang has a tendency to deflect. In \"Divide\", she deflects blame by criticizing Ruby's leadership, despite the fact that it was due to her and Blake's actions with Robyn that partially led to Ironwood losing faith in them and bringing about the current situation. In \"Fault\", when Ren brings up some concern that they were not ready and that their actions will lead to people dying, Yang avoids his direct criticism and tries to deflect by offering counterpoints without addressing his actual arguments. Finally, in “Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble”, she sheepishly deflected responsibility for her part in worsening Ruby’s mental decline, simply stating she shouldn’t have expected herself to be perfect.\n\nHowever, unlike her mother, Yang is capable of admitting her wrongs as well as recognizing the qualities of others even when their opinions are different from hers, admitting to Blake that her obsession to search for her mother nearly got herself and Ruby killed when they were young, and during her discussion with Ruby in \"Risk\", she admitted that her own plan didn't work either after Ruby lamented the failure of bringing Amity Tower up and running, even telling Ruby that her blind optimism wasn't a flaw when she believed she wasted time with it, as it was a necessity in life.\n\nIn \"A Cat Most Curious\", when Yang’s past self offers Yang an opportunity to be whole again by traveling back in time to regain her lost organic arm, Yang declines her offer as losing a part of herself is what makes her a stronger person. It shows that Yang already accepts her losses by learning from her mistakes.\n\nIn \"Boba\", Yang felt guilty about putting everything on her sister's shoulders along with her teammates, she vows to Ruby, that from now on, the entirety of Team RWBY will share the burden, and even use the word \"Boba\" as a safe word if they ever feel overwhelmed.\nPowers and Abilities\n\nYang's fighting style is much more aggressive than that of her teammates. She uses a barehanded fist-fighting style, bearing some resemblance to Muay Thai and her weapons; Ember Celica. She is quite agile, able to dodge an onslaught of Ursai and gunfire with ease. Since gaining her prosthetic arm, Yang has taken to using its armored surface defensively, shielding herself from firearms, and staving off attacks to gain greater ground on her opponents, incorporating its advantages into her improved fighting style following further instruction from her father, Tai.\n\nShe is also physically the strongest of the group. Her strength is displayed on numerous occasions, such as when her punch sent a fully grown man several feet into the air and through a glass pillar without the enhancement of her weapon, and in \"Players and Pieces\", where she was able to keep the mouth of a Nevermore open with one arm long enough to deliver multiple shots down its throat.\n\nLike all Huntsmen and Huntresses, Yang has had her Aura unlocked, coating her body with a shield powered by her soul, which helps protect her, especially when her aggressiveness gets her into bad situations. Though she already has the highest level of durability in her team, with her Aura unlocked, her durability is particularly high, as showcased in her doubles match with Weiss against Flynt Coal and Neon Katt during the Vytal Tournament, where she withstands numerous hits from Neon during the bout's opening stages and powers through the effects of Flynt's weapon, knocking him out and securing victory for her side shortly after. Due to the nature of her Semblance and the high durability, Yang would typically absorb enough hits through her Aura to empower herself and then finish the fights with her Semblance, which her father criticizes due to her over-reliance in \"Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back\".\n\nSince the end of Volume 3 and her mental recovery at the end of Volume 4, Yang's fighting skills had improved immensely after training again. Notably, she has incorporated more kicking and dodging. Her new robotic arm also gives her a higher degree of strength, able to send full-grown men flying from the intensity of her blows. During her rematch against Adam, she defeats him despite his superior speed by adapting her combat technique and avoiding attacking him until he uses up the energy from his Semblance so that she can disarm him, showing her improved intelligence in combat.\n\nHer fight against Elm and Vine with Blake further showcases her more pragmatic approach to battles. She coordinated her attacks with Blake and refrained from using her Semblance until the last moment to destroy the ground Elm had anchored herself to and deliver the finishing blow. Since Volume 3, her use of her Semblance overall in battle has gone down, as she tends to activate it only as a last resort. Even when she does, rather than absorbing blows to her body, she now tends to deflect or absorb blows with her forearms, as she did in her final battle with Adam Taurus. This enables her to use her Semblance more effectively and runs less risk of her exhausting her Aura when she does so.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Ember Celica\nV4 11 00020\nYang repaints her weapons - Ember Celica and her Robotic Arm\nYang's weapon of choice is Ember Celica, it is radically different compared to those used by her teammates, being a pair of gauntlets which can retract into bracelets. Yang's fighting style involves combining her punches with explosive shots from Ember Celica for moderate or short-ranged attacks.\n\nEmber Celica has powerful recoil, which Yang can use to augment the force of her punch and accelerate her movements. The force is powerful enough to launch her high in the air. The recoil also reloads and prepares the gauntlets for the next shot.[11]\n\nShe can also use her Ember Celica as a form of armor when defending against attacks in unarmed combat. After the events of \"Heroes and Monsters\", Yang only has one Ember Celica, due to her lost arm.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Burn\nV3 0600051\nHer irises turn red and her hair glows when she uses the power from her Semblance\nYang's Semblance, Burn,[11] as Ruby states during the events of \"Painting the Town...\", lets her absorb kinetic energy from every blow she takes and use it to make herself more powerful; this is a form of kinetic energy absorption, with Yang subsequently redirecting said energy against her opponent with double the amount of force. As a side-effect of her Semblance, Yang's eyes turn red[6] and her hair sometimes begins glowing and even becomes covered in flames. Yang's Semblance does not make her angry, but anger has sometimes led her to impulsively activate it.\n\nPrior to the Fall of Beacon, Yang often used her Semblance to finish a fight, after absorbing enough damage from blows to overpower her opponent. However, after the Fall of Beacon, she begins to use it far less often and more as a final attack due to her improved training in fighting smarter rather than harder with Taiyang. This is demonstrated during her fights against the bandits and the Grimm between Haven and Argus where she doesn't use her Semblance to fight. At the end of her second and last fight with Adam Taurus, she uses it to disarm and overpower him with a very powerful punch.\n\nProsthetic Arm\n\nMain article: Yang's Prosthetic Arm\nYangGunArm2\nYang's base prosthetic arm\nAfter losing her arm in the Battle of Beacon to Adam Taurus she was given a new robotic arm by James Ironwood. She initially refused it due to depression, but after some time to reflect and heal, at least partially, Yang chose to use it, spray painting the new limb yellow to match her remaining Ember Celica.\n\nEmber upgraded cropped\nUpgraded Arm\nCreated by Pietro Polendina, Yang's cybernetic limb possesses great strength. Its power is shown in \"Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back\", where a single blow sent her father, a fully trained Huntsman, skidding back several feet even though Tai blocked the attack. It is also outfitted with most of Ember Celica's features, including a shotgun.[11] As seen in \"Rest and Resolutions\" and \"Downfall\", the arm can detach from her bicep at will. It is also durable enough to take a fully charged strike from Adam's Moonslice Semblance and continued functioning even after its damage.\n\nIn Atlas, Yang's arm is modified. It is now larger with more mass and more gold plates around. It more resembles the design of Ember Celica.\n\nSuperpowers\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Yang loses her Semblance and Aura upon arriving on Earth (DC). In exchange, she gains the superpower \"Fire Fists\", enabling to fire energy bursts from her hands, akin to Ember Celica.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nV3 11 00124\nYang's short temper and Semblance overeliance causes her to lose her arm to Adam\nAlthough Yang gets stronger from taking damage, her frustration and anger can be exploited by skilled opponents. This weakness is perhaps best expressed in her very brief first confrontation with Adam, her anger causing her to recklessly charge him and lose her right arm in the process. However, this drawback is more or less under control after her father Taiyang told her to focus on using her opponent's force against them.\n\nWhile taking hits from an opponent vastly increases the power of her Semblance, Yang still takes damage in the process. Despite her high reserves of Aura, too many hits can deplete it completely, breaking her defenses and rendering her Semblance counterattack useless. Conversely, activating her Semblance too soon (as she did against Adam and later Neo) will also weaken her Aura's defenses in exchange for an under-charged counterstrike. Yang is also noted to be weak against kick-based fighting styles, seen when she struggles against Neo, Melanie, and Mercury Black.[13] As time progresses however, she has since adapted to kick fighters.\n\nAs seen in her fight with Neo, fighters well-versed in dodging attacks can frustrate Yang, making her attacks predictable and easily avoided, which also renders the added power with her Semblance useless. The fact that she fights barehanded as opposed to using a melee weapon also limits the reach of her close-quarters attacks, enabling opponents with greater agility to evade her strikes.\n\nWhile not necessarily a form of weakness, her emotions can also cause her to unintentionally activate her Semblance even if she is not in a battle. Examples of this include her frustrated outburst in \"Players and Pieces\", her moment of anger toward Blake in \"Burning the Candle\" and two times in her doubles round tournament fight in \"Never Miss a Beat\". In \"Worthy\" she instinctively activates her Semblance to protect Ruby from Neo's attack, breaking her Aura and being knocked into the void.\n\nTaiyang somewhat jokingly defines her Semblance as \"basically a temper tantrum\" and a liability against stronger and more experienced opponents; if they can evade or outlast the duration of her onslaught, she is left weak, tired, and vulnerable to a counterattack. For this reason due to her improved fighting style in \"Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back\", Taiyang tells her it's best left as a last resort rather than a crutch like how she used it in the Vytal Festival and due to her over-reliance of using it to win every fight before."

She is a Huntress, a former student of the now-defunct Beacon Academy, and former heiress of the Schnee Dust Company. Her weapon of choice is a Multi-Action Dust Rapier (MADR) named Myrtenaster.\n\nAs the former heiress of the vastly influential Schnee Dust Company, Weiss made her first appearance in the \"White\" Trailer. After enrolling in Beacon against the wishes of her father, Jacques Schnee, she becomes a member of Team RWBY alongside Ruby Rose, Blake Belladonna and Yang Xiao Long. Being the middle of the three Schnee siblings, Weiss is the younger sister of Winter Schnee and the older sister of Whitley Schnee.\n\nFollowing a lengthy battle against Cinder Fall, Weiss was blasted off a platform and into the void under the Central Location, landing in the Ever After.\n\nIn “Of Solitude and Self”, after defeating the Curious Cat, she and her friends return to Remnant, where they arrive in the Kingdom of Vacuo.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the name of Weiss Schnee's weapon in RWBY? toggle section\nWhy did Weiss Schnee enroll in Beacon against her father's wishes? toggle section\nWhat is Weiss Schnee's role in the Schnee Dust Company? toggle section\nHow does Weiss Schnee's relationship with Ruby evolve throughout the series? toggle section\nWhat significant events happen to Weiss Schnee in volume 7 of RWBY? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n1/2\nLoading Pods\nLoading ad 2/2\n\n\n\nWeiss's scarred face\nWeiss is a pale-skinned young woman with pale blue eyes and long white hair that is often pulled back into an off-center ponytail or braid on the right side and pinned with a silver, icicle-shaped tiara. She stands at 4' 11\" (1.5 meters), but typically wears heels that raise her height to 5' 3\" (1.6 meters). Weiss has a scar which runs vertically down her left eye and face, gained during her battle against an Arma Gigas in the \"White\" Trailer.\n\nIn Ice Queendom, she wears pale pink lipstick.\nOriginal Outfit (Volumes 1–3)\n\n1110 The Badge and The Burden Pt.2 00998\nWeiss with Myrtenaster\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, she wears a thigh-length strapless dress with a faint color gradation from white to pale blue at the hem. A small piece of black lace sits in the front of her neckline and the hem of the dress is scalloped and stitched to resemble snowflakes, with layers of white tulle under the skirt. Over this, she wears a bell-sleeved bolero with the same color gradation as her dress from shoulder to wrist, lined in red and with a ruffled collar. On the back of the bolero is the Schnee Crest.\n\nShe also wears a small apple pendant on a silver chain and thin, rectangular silver earrings. Her boots are white, wedged heeled, and higher at the back than the front. They have a small silver decoration across the top of the foot and are lined in red. A thin white sash is tied around her waist with a pouch attached to the back.\n\nIn her character short for Volume 5, she wears the same outfit, except her ponytail is centered. At the time, she had not yet received her scar.\n\nPajamas\n\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, Weiss' pajamas consist of a faded blue nightgown with short sleeves and white trim and display the Schnee Crest on the upper-right chest. She also wears her hair down.\n\nAlternate Outfit (Snowpea)\n\nV2 03 00009\nAlternate Outfit \"Snowpea\"\nDuring the events of \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\", Weiss wears an alternate outfit codenamed \"Snowpea\".[9]\n\nThis outfit consists of a white, double-breasted pea coat with black piping, cuffs, and buttons over a white, pleated full skirt with black lace trim. She also wears a pair of white, thigh-high boots with black heels and lace-topped black stockings.\n\nDance\n\nDuring the Beacon Dance, Weiss wears a short, white, sleeveless dress with cutouts on both sides of her waist. The yoke of the dress is translucent mesh and she also wears white pumps.\n\nBeacon Uniform\n\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, Weiss wears the standard Beacon Academy uniform comprised of a maroon blazer with golden brown lining and twin buttons over a brown button-up vest and white blouse with pleated looking neckline and a red ribbon tied around her black-lined collar. She also wears the traditional red checkered with black stripes with golden brown outlining alongside white tulle. She also wears a pair of brown lace-up wedged sole boots, alongside black socks reaching to mid-calf.\n\nMistral Outfit (Songbird, Volumes 4–7)\n\n\nAfter the timeskip following the Fall of Beacon, her new design includes a short, glittering dress with a color gradation of gray blue to pale blue at the hem, a sweetheart neckline, and a white, tulle petticoat.\n\nA white sash is wrapped multiple times around her waist, and over the outfit is worn a slightly sheer long-sleeved gray blue bolero fastened at the collar with a large sapphire broach that has three pendants dangling from it. Printed on the back of the shrug is the Schnee Crest. Completing her attire are gray blue wedge heels and sapphire drop earrings.\n\nShe also has an alternate/occasional outfit, which follows the same design as her standard attire except for the skirt, which is floor length and split to her thigh on one side and she wears chunky heels instead. The white ribbon has been removed from her waist and she wears her hair and earrings in the same style, albeit her ponytail has grown out, now roughly reaching her knees. In RWBY: Amity Arena, this outfit is referred to as Songbird.\n\nIn Volume 6, she wears a red scarf with white design at the ends and pale blue tights with her outfit.\n\nAtlas Outfit (Volume 7-Current)\n\n\nAfter arriving in Atlas and meeting with James Ironwood, Weiss' hair is now braided, and she has grown out her bangs and styled them to frame her face more closely.\n\nShe wears a pale blue sleeveless dress with deep red lining, bow detail fixture, and two diamond-shaped pieces hanging from the corners of the hem, over a white diagonal hemmed strapless dress. Above which she wears a vivid blue shrug with a raised collar, puffy sleeves and the Schnee emblem on the left sleeve, fastened by a blue, silver outlined strap. On her arms are a pair of long navy blue gloves with silver top trim surrounding a red gem at the top.\n\nOver her dress, she wears a light blue, corset styled belt. Around her waist are three white belts with a medium-sized pouch attached to the lowest belt and another pouch attached to the middle belt. The lowest belt crosses over the middle belt. She wears long, pale blue wedge-heel boots with white frill detailing at the top at the front, alongside grayish blue coloring on the toes and navy blue wedged heels.\n\nIn addition, she wears a pair of ruby earrings that match her icicle-shaped tiara with a diamond-shaped ruby in the center.\n\nBallgown (RWBY x Justice League)\n\nIn Issue 3 of the RWBY x Justice League comics Weiss is show to be wearing a strapless ball gown that has a similar grey blue colour seen on her Mistral attire that has a gradation to a light blue alongside grey blue opera length gloves and a pearl styled necklace and a white sash belt tied around her waist.\n\nEarth Outfit\n\n\nWeiss Schnee on Earth.\nAfter arriving on Earth, Weiss has her hair let down, reaching her thighs. Her outfit is basically a combination of her Volumes 4 and 7 attires and Salem's human and Grimm attires. She wears a pale blue sleeveless, backless thigh-length dress with white pleated halter-like straps extended to the back closed at the collar by a ruby in the center, slightly exposing her bust with a narrow, diamond-shaped window in a pale blue trim, as well as a white pleated hem above the skirt, matching opera-length gloves, light gray blue tights, and pale blue boots with white detailed trimming and gray heels. She wears a silver ice-shaped tiara with the same ruby.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nYoung Weiss as depicted in a family portrait from \"Remembrance\"\nYoung Weiss as depicted in a family portrait from \"Remembrance\"\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine\nWithout her scar\nWithout her scar\nBeacon School Uniform\nBeacon School Uniform\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nSame outfit with a longer skirt for formal occasions\nSame outfit with a longer skirt for formal occasions\nAtlas Outfit\nAtlas Outfit\nComics Gown\nComics Gown\nYoung Weiss seen in Weiss' flashback in RWBY: Ice Queendom\nYoung Weiss seen in Weiss' flashback in RWBY: Ice Queendom\nOriginal outfit\nOriginal outfit\nBeacon nightgown and hair down\nBeacon nightgown and hair down\nSnowPea outfit from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nSnowPea outfit from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nMistral outfit\nMistral outfit\nSame dress with a scarf and tights for the cold Mistral weather\nSame dress with a scarf and tights for the cold Mistral weather\nAtlas Pajamas\nAtlas Pajamas\nPower Armor From \"RWBY Grimm Eclipse Definitive Edition\"\nPower Armor From \"RWBY Grimm Eclipse Definitive Edition\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nWhen I said I wanted to honor my family's name, I meant it. But — it's not what you think. I'm not stupid; I'm fully aware of what my father has done with the Schnee Dust Company. Since he took control, our business has operated in a 'moral grey area' ... which is why I feel the need to make things right. If I had taken a job at Atlas, it wouldn't have changed anything. My father was not the start of our name, and I refuse to let him be the end of it.\nWEISS SCHNEE.\n\nMonty Oum had said that everything has been decided for Weiss in her life and because of it, she is a bit of a rebel. This manifests itself in her physical appearance as she wears her ponytail to the side of her head, disrupting the symmetry of the rest of her outfit. When Professor Peter Port states that Weiss has received everything she wanted in life, she responds that it is not entirely true, thinking of her father's attitude. She takes pride in her name and the company, though, as seen when she first meets Blake, when she discusses it with her team in Mountain Glenn and when she confronts her father over it.\n\nConsidering the lyrics of her leitmotif \"Mirror Mirror\", it is very likely that Weiss has felt lonely throughout her life, which translated into a cold nature. Constant attacks by the White Fang added heavy strain to her life, explaining her often difficult personality. Her strict upbringing has also given her a tendency to keep quiet about her own desires, likely not to be seen as vulnerable. After warming up to people, she places a great deal of trust in her friends and confides in them when she feels the need. While she doesn't abandon her prickly attitude completely, she gradually becomes nicer and more compassionate to people, especially her friends.\n\nAccording to her voice actress, Kara Eberle, Weiss is \"nice but can also be a little bit bitchy.\" She is irritable and confident in her abilities, though also acknowledges her deficiencies and the need to hone her skills further. Her confidence in her skills and intellect often comes off as arrogance to others. This is also mentioned by Kara, who called her the \"know-it-all\" type of person who can also become best friends with her acquaintances.\n\nWeiss takes her time at Beacon more seriously than her teammates, taking notes even when the topic is not related to the knowledge she seeks. She equates such dedication in the classroom with dedication in the field. Thus, she is annoyed at those who do not take things seriously, especially when it comes to becoming protectors against the Grimm. Weiss remains calm and tactical during encounters and mentally coaches herself. She is thoughtful and fights with precision and coordination.\n\nAfter speaking with Professor Port, Weiss' attitude appears to change, as she takes his suggestion to \"be the best person [she] can be\" to heart. She opens up to Ruby, though she does not halt future criticisms. Weiss' development carries into her whimsical and humorous side as she joins her team in a food fight against Team JNPR and a board game. In \"Painting the Town...\", Weiss attempts to joke but is met with negative criticism from Yang and Blake. Weiss also enjoys planning and participating in certain events, such as the Beacon Dance.\n\nWeiss vows that as a Huntress, she will elevate the Schnee name from her father's dishonor to it and put her desires behind others' necessities. This solidifies in \"Lessons Learned\" when Weiss heeds her sister's advice and removes her bindings from the SDC to discover more about herself.\n\nAfter being retrieved from Beacon and flown home, Weiss is truly affected by the loss that happened during the Fall of Beacon. She becomes increasingly intolerant of the Atlesian lifestyle she grew up in, seeing it as superficial and ignorant. Her change of perspective is demonstrated by her hostility toward Henry Marigold's insensitive and ignorant attitude about the charity event and her public outburst when a couple talks condescendingly about the destruction of Vale.\n\nWeiss has demonstrated the ability to keep a level head in the face of intense and deeply emotional situations. When Ironwood's paranoia begins to spiral in \"Gravity\" Weiss attempts to regain control of the situation by pointing out that his concerns are not relevant to the current situation. After Neopolitan knocked Yang over the edge in \"The Final Word\", Weiss immediately attempts to comfort Blake before the latter lashes back at Neo in rage. While Ruby and Blake are preoccupied with Neopolitan, Weiss quietly resigns herself and does her duty by fighting Cinder and drawing the Fall Maiden's attention to keep as many civilians out of harm's way as possible during the evacuation.[10]\n\nWeiss sometimes flinches when someone raises their voice in anger, regardless of whether this anger is directed toward someone else or coming from a close friend. This is first shown in \"Taking Control\" when she overhears an argument between her father and General Ironwood. It is also shown in \"Known by its Song\" when Yang snaps at her mother, Raven Branwen, for mocking Qrow Branwen and Taiyang Xiao Long. The latter incident shows Weiss remaining on edge around Yang even after her anger subsides. This unconscious habit may have been another result of her dysfunctional childhood and strained family life, as it has been implied by Weiss that her father and mother would frequently fight with each other in angry voices.\n\nDespite her good qualities, Weiss holds a double standard regarding others and secrets. In \"Sparks\", she is upset on Winter's behalf due to the fact that she believes Ironwood is keeping secrets from her, even though she went along with Ruby's decision to lie to Ironwood and keep Ozpin's disappearance, how many questions left in the Relic of Knowledge, and Salem's immortality a secret. When Winter reveals Fria to Weiss as a gesture of faith to show that Ironwood has trusted her, Weiss keeps what she knows a secret from her sister.\n\nDue to the ongoing violence between the SDC and the White Fang terrorist group, Weiss despises the White Fang and shows a noticeable distrust of Faunus at first. The White Fang's activities seem to have contributed to a difficult childhood for Weiss, for she had close ties with numerous people who were either killed by or disappeared because of the White Fang. This led to her father frequently coming home angry, and this further colored Weiss' views on the White Fang and Faunus.\n\nWhen Blake defends Sun Wukong's criminal acts, Weiss makes many derogatory comments about him and suggests he would likely join with the White Fang. However, shortly after the fight with Roman Torchwick, Weiss no longer cares about her argument with Blake, stating they are teammates, and it changes nothing. Regardless, she says she remains unsure of how she feels about Sun, but they grow to be on friendlier terms. Weiss and the rest of her team keep Blake's status as a Faunus a secret.\n\nWeiss' hostility toward the Faunus downgrades considerably through her time at Beacon, as seen when she shows concern for Velvet Scarlatina and the rest of Team CFVY. She is even friendlier and empathetic toward Blake, having placed trust in her as well after fighting alongside Blake against the White Fang several times. In \"Dead End\" when Caroline Cordovin shows blatant racism towards Blake for her Faunus heritage, Weiss immediately snaps \"What's that supposed to mean?!\" and in \"The Greatest Kingdom\" when a drunk shows Blake the same prejudice, Weiss uses Myrtenaster to hurl him into a dumpster, saying it was worth it- showing how significantly her views have changed. When Team RWBY explores an abandoned SDC mine, Weiss expresses shame and remorse to Blake for the pain her family has caused the Faunus.\n\nWeiss has been described by Blake as the personification of the word \"defiance.\" This is shown to be true in her various rebellions against those who try to decide things for her, or make assumptions about her; from her father, to Flynt Coal in the Vytal Festival Tournament (who initially believes she is nothing but a spoilt rich kid) to even General Ironwood and her older sister in Volume 7. This defiance culminates in her encounter with Cinder Fall in \"The Final Word\", when Weiss is left as the last of Team RWBY to face her; Cinder mocks her status as a Schnee, claiming she let \"all her friends die first\". Despite her Aura being broken, and outmatched by the Fall Maiden's power, Weiss continues to attack Cinder in order to buy her other friends time- showing that she is, indeed, defiant to the end.\n\nIn “A Cat Most Curious”, when Weiss’ past self offers Weiss opportunity of becoming a nobody and to get rid of her family name, Weiss decline her offer since she is proud to be Schnee. This shows how much she has changed and grown to accept herself as being both the granddaughter of a hero and the daughter of a villain.\nIce Queendom\n\nIn RWBY: Ice Queendom, it is implied that she likely used to suffer from both a superiority and an inferiority complex, often coming across as supercilious, haughty, and disdainful towards those she views as being beneath her and seeing herself as a perfect example of what a future Huntress should be but will often fall into long periods of paranoia and self-doubt whenever someone dares to challenge these beliefs.\n\nThis behavior likely stemmed from Weiss's estranged relationship with her father who always expected her to be the best at everything she set out to do but because she could never hope to live up to his expectations was constantly seen as a disappointment in his eyes.\n\nIn the case of Ruby Rose, Weiss is initially dismissive of her believing that she has no place in Beacon and that she isn't worth her time as a leader. However, after her conversation with Port, Weiss misunderstands what he was trying to tell her and resolves to try and \"fix\" Ruby's flaws as a leader believing that it will help raise her standing with the rest of her team and the other students attending Beacon.\n\nWeiss is also shown to be far more prejudiced against Faunus in general in this version, showing a strong distrust towards them as the White Fang were responsible for many people she had once known getting hurt or killed. This grudge was so strong that it even extended to her teammate Blake Belladonna as upon finding out the truth about Blake being a Faunus, she burst into angry and fearful tears at having been forced into close proximity with her believing her to be too dangerous to live with.\n\nAfter being freed from her nightmare, Weiss's personality has shown to improve vastly becoming much more friendly towards her team and accepting of Faunus. Though she still seeks to be the best that she can be, she acknowledges that there are always going to be things that others can do better than her but resolves to not let it stop her from trying to accomplish her goals.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nAs the heiress of the Schnee Dust Company, Weiss was raised from youth to strive to be the best in all she did, and combat was no exception. As a testament to her skills, Weiss was on the top ranking of the sparring class during the events of the Vytal Festival. Weiss can move quickly and is creative on the battlefield, particularly with Ice Dust.\n\nWeiss' fighting style resembles fencing and ballet, where she relies on thrusts and slashes, being heavily reliant on ricocheting off either surrounding surfaces or off of her Glyphs. She relies most on her Semblance, enabling her to switch from offense, defense, support, and evasion. On top of this, it provides greater control of the fight through rapidly attacking from multiple angles to take the enemy off balance. Unlike Winter, Weiss relies more on balance, grace, and speed instead of being aggressive and direct. Learning to summon her Arma Gigas, she fights alongside the Summons, leaping from its sword or using it as a shield, proving able to summon it between glyphs.\n\nWeiss also has some skills in medical treatment. In \"War\", she helped Nora Valkyrie after she had injured herself overusing her Semblance by bandaging her up and tending to her at her bedside. However, it is insufficient in fully handling her condition.\n\nAs seen in \"The Final Word\", Weiss is capable of using guns despite never having been shown to hold any experience with them before, as she shot Cinder with three bullets using Gambol Shroud. She also showcased some skill in a dual sword style, having fought Cinder Fall using both Myrtenaster and Gambol Shroud.\n\nAlthough Ruby is usually the one who makes the team's battle plans, Weiss is the one who came up with the plan to use Emerald's Semblance against Ironwood in \"Creation\".\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Weiss would lose both her Aura and Semblance with her arrival on Earth. However, unlike her team, Weiss gained no new abilities and was simply a baseline human.\nDust Usage\n\nV2e11 glyph ice\nUsing a glyph to make an ice dome.\nMost notably, Weiss frequently utilizes Dust in battle. She has shown a preference for Ice Dust, only switching types if it provides her with an advantage, such as using Wind Dust against sonic-based attacks or creating certain types of glyphs such as black or time dilation glyphs. She has used Ice Dust to trap enemies, create a trail to push enemies from a height, create a slippery sheet of ice and form pointed ice chunks to use as projectiles.\n\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Myrtenaster\nCastle\nWeiss prepares to fight the Giant Armor\nWeiss' weapon of choice is Myrtenaster, a Multi-Action Dust Rapier. The rapier has a revolving chamber inside the guard, which has six slots in total, each of which contains a vial of powdered Dust. The revolving chamber is constantly stocked with red, cyan, purple, white, yellow, and blue Dust.\n\nWeiss utilizes the Dust in combat, either in raw form or in conjunction with her Semblance to create various effects that suit the situation. When not using Myrtenaster as a Dust supplier, Weiss utilizes her speed to dodge attacks and her sword to deliver damage through quick thrusts that leave little room for counters.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", Weiss took up the katana blade of Gambol Shroud after Blake Belladonna and Ruby Rose were thrown into the abyss of the Evacuation dimension during her last stand against Cinder.\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Weiss would use a freeze gun created by Mr. Freeze, which could shoot blue beams that create ice upon hitting a target. Though due to being in storage for to long, it ran out of power, forcing Weiss to discard it.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Glyphs\n1110 The Badge and The Burden Pt.2 02929\nHer glyph's design.\nWeiss has the Schnee family Semblance of Glyphs, allowing her to create glyphs that can be used in a variety of ways: create a slippery platform to skate on at high speed, generate midair platforms to manipulate her trajectory in the air and perform limited time dilation that can speed up actions[11], to name a few.\n\nShe has gained more control over her Semblance upon her arrival in Atlas. During her fight against Marrow Amin in \"With Friends Like These\", she could use her glyphs to create several ice spikes to simultaneously speed up and throw the ice as makeshift spears while summoning her Arma Gigas.\n\nSummoning\n\nWith mastery, a Schnee also can summon avatars of the foes that they have defeated. While these avatars have the appearance of Grimm, they do not possess the same weaknesses. For instance, they are unaffected by the light from Silver Eyes.\n\nIn \"Lessons Learned\", Winter specifies that the summoned foe had to have caused the Schnee to push past who they were and become who they are now.\n\nWeiss' Summons:\n\nArma Gigas\nBoarbatusk\nQueen Lancer\nNevermore\nImage Gallery\n\nWeiss summoning her Arma Gigas\nWeiss summoning her Arma Gigas\nWeiss summoning her Queen Lancer\nWeiss summoning her Queen Lancer\nWeiss' full Nevermore avatar.\nWeiss' full Nevermore avatar.\nWeiss summoning a Boarbatusk\nWeiss summoning a Boarbatusk\nWeiss attempting to summon her Nevermore\nWeiss attempting to summon her Nevermore\nWeaknesses\n\nV2 11 00055\nLack of stamina and endurance cause Weiss' defeat by the White Fang Lieutenant\nWeiss has poor endurance and stamina, as seen in \"The Emerald Forest\" after Ruby and Weiss are forced to retreat from a pack of Beowolves after a forest fire; Weiss is shown to be panting in exhaustion while Ruby is still fully energized.\n\nThe biggest sign of her lack of endurance, however, is her inability to take heavy hits. In fact, she is the weakest out of everyone on her team, having been knocked out the most, such as by Nora Valkyrie with her watermelon hammer during the food fight, and the White Fang Lieutenant smashing her head into the ground.\n\nDespite her glyphs' durability, they have been demonstrated to be breakable, such as when she summons three black glyphs in an attempt to stop the cargo ship's crash. The ship falls far too fast or is too heavy for her, causing it to rip the glyphs apart as it falls through them.\n\nIn regards to her summons, larger ones like her Arma Gigas take greater time and effort to manifest, as shown in her duel with Vernal, who heavily exploited this weakness by constantly interrupting Weiss' attempts to bring forth the sword-wielding warrior."

She was the partner of Roman Torchwick, with the two sharing a close and possible romantic bond. Her weapon of choice was called Hush, a parasol with a concealed blade. She first appeared in \"Painting the Town...\". After the Fall of Beacon, she hunted down Cinder Fall in revenge for Roman's death, but subsequently joined forces with her, shifting her target to Ruby Rose.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", she was betrayed by Cinder in the Central Location and knocked into the void, finding herself in the Ever After. She is the secondary antagonist of Volume 9.\n\nIn \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", she got possessed by the Curious Cat (becoming the NeoCat) after driving Ruby to ascend, who intended on using her body to leave the Ever After.\n\nAfter killing the Curious Cat in \"Of Solitude and Self\", she chose to stay in the Ever After instead of returning to Remnant, undergoing ascension.\n\nNeo was also featured as one of the main characters in the novel, RWBY: Roman Holiday.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the original name of the character Neopolitan in RWBY? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Neopolitan and Roman Torchwick? toggle section\nWhat is the name of Neopolitan's weapon in RWBY? toggle section\nWho does Neopolitan seek revenge from after the Fall of Beacon? toggle section\nWho becomes Neopolitan's new target after joining forces with Cinder Fall? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n1/2\n\n\nNeo, themed after Neapolitan ice cream, had the appropriate trio of colors in her hair and on her outfit. While sometimes altered via illusion for disguise, her hair color was typically half pink and half brown, with white streaks on the pink side. As of Volume 6, Neo's hair was also styled differently. It was noticeably thicker with a slight wave to it along with shorter bangs and missing her white streaks. The white streaks appeared as an emotional reaction to her parents' deaths in Roman Holiday.[11]\n\nNeo's natural eye color changed between brown, pale pink, and white, and they could alternate coloration in differing combinations, with this ability apparently being entirely under her control. Neo appeared to have a condition known as heterochromia iridum, where the eyes of a subject have two different colors. In her case, it was complete heterochromia, where one iris in its entirety was a different color from the other. During her childhood, her left eye was pink, and her right eye was brown.[12] In Volume 3, she was seen wearing green eyeshadow, starting with her paramedic disguise.\n\nDespite being in her twenties by the start of RWBY, Neo was also rather diminutive in stature, compared to the rest of the main cast, including Ruby Rose, as shown in the height chart presented by Monty Oum. This was demonstrated in \"No Brakes\", when she stood up against Yang Xiao Long, as Neo was only able to reach her chin despite wearing high heels.\nOriginal (Volumes 2-6)\n\nV2 11 00041\nNeo wore a white cropped wide, broad tailed jacket with a pink interior, collar, a single pink button and large pink cuffs. She wore skintight brown leather-latex pants with a dark belt that had a gray buckle and an additional narrow belt under it. Under her jacket was a brown over bust whalebone corset, curved in the middle and at the bottom, which exposed her hips. She also wore a multitude of black beaded necklaces, which hung haphazardly around her neck. Neo also wore black and white spat styled under the knee boots alongside black gloves.\n\n\nNeo with Roman's hat\nIn \"The Coming Storm\", Neo went through a slight outfit change: she wore Roman's hat, seemingly in remembrance of him, and her clothing was shown to have been torn up over the time since her last appearance, especially on her jacket's left shoulder that revealed a broad shoulder strap of her corset, her coattail and leggings. During her fight with Cinder in this episode, she hid the damage and Roman's hat with an illusion until they moved the fight into an alley.\n\nPost-Timeskip (Volume 6–Current)\n\nV7 13 00006\nIn \"Our Way\", Neo sported a new outfit while still wearing Roman's hat. It consisted of a chocolate brown jacket that starts just below her shoulders and above her chest and had a pink interior, two brown belt shoulder straps and twin gray button seams. She wore a gray scarf similar to Roman's, and a white three gray button-up vest style top that was strapless and cropped exposing her midriff. She also wore a pair of chocolate brown detached sleeves with puffy tops and pink trim alongside a pair of white funnel cuffed gloves with gray button detailing. She also wore skintight white belted leather-latex pants and black and white spat styled ankle boots with cutout detail just above the ankle. The back of Neo's jacket was shown to have a small, coned ice cream key chain that was usually covered by her hair.\n\nNotably, Neo's eyes no longer switched colors between each other in her natural state, while she kept her green eye shadow.\n\nTrivia Vanille\n\nPrior to going by Neopolitan, Trivia Vanille originally had only brown hair but maintained the pink and brown heterochromia in her eyes. In public, her parents made her wear colored contact lens that made both eyes appear brown. At the time, she wore her hair in pigtails, and her clothes consisted of a brown dress with dark brown cuffs and a white collar with a black ribbon attached to the collar with matching ribbons in her pigtails.[12] At the age of twelve, she also had an \"adventuring outfit\" consisting of a white tank top, brown blazer and matching pants alongside white sneakers with pink hearts.\n\nNeoCat\n\nV9 09 00087\nNeo after getting body snatched by the Cat.\nAfter becoming possessed by the Curious Cat, Neo's body briefly underwent a transformation. Her eyes became those of the Cat's in their normal form, with a light blue sclera and white pupils and her teeth also became much more jagged and sharp. Later, her arms were changed into large light blue claws, partially tearing her sleeves in the process.\n\nShe later changed back to her original form after the Curious Cat had left her body.\n\nDisguises\n\nTournament\nTournament\nAtlas Military Uniform\nAtlas Military Uniform\nRuby disguise\nRuby disguise\nNora disguise\nNora disguise\nBackground camouflage\nBackground camouflage\nYang disguise\nYang disguise\nParamedic\nParamedic\nSchnee Waitress\nSchnee Waitress\nOscar disguise\nOscar disguise\nAtlas Officer\nAtlas Officer\nCivilian\nCivilian\nPenny disguise\nPenny disguise\nCinder disguise\nCinder disguise\nWhile participating in the Vytal Festival Tournament, Neo had a completely different appearance. Her hair was black with lighter streaks where her white streaks would normally be, and her default eye color was green, though she could change it to pink, brown or white at any time. Her hair was done up in a twin tail hairstyle with white bows and her bangs were still in the same usual style from her original appearance.\n\nShe wore an outfit with a black and white color scheme. Her attire consisted of a sleeveless black blouse with white frills on the chest and collar and a black ribbon bow hanging from the front of the collar. The blouse exposed her midriff, and she wore medium-length black armbands on both of her wrists. Along with the blouse, she wore a knee-length skirt fastened with a white belt. She wore black shoes with a triple tomoe emblem, a mitsudomoe, on the soles, with white legwarmers. Later, in RWBY: Amity Arena, it was revealed that she wore large, thick white socks over her shoes.\n\nIn \"Beginning of the End\", she disguised herself in a paramedic uniform, with a cap on top of her short hair, and her eye color changed to magenta. In \"PvP\", she assumed her regular appearance but donned the uniform of an Atlas Military officer. In \"Our Way\", Neo was briefly seen in a Mistral Police uniform. In \"Cordially Invited\" and \"As Above, So Below\", Neo disguised herself in a Schnee waitress uniform with black shoulder-length hair clipped with two barrettes and green eyes.\n\nIn \"Out in the Open\", it was shown that Neo could disguise herself as already existing characters i.e., Ruby Rose. In \"With Friends Like These\", Neo was shown to be capable of taking on forms of different genders as she took on the appearance of Oscar, however she had never been seen impersonating anyone with extreme size or build differences.\n\nIn \"Witch\", Neo showcased the ability to camouflage herself as inanimate objects, as she turned herself into a wall of Monstra to steal the Relic of Knowledge.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nOutfits\n\nTrivia Vanille\nTrivia Vanille\nOriginal\nOriginal\nAtlas outfit\nAtlas outfit\nAn older Trivia without her brown contact lens\nAn older Trivia without her brown contact lens\nNeo's ruined Vale attire\nNeo's ruined Vale attire\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nUnlike Roman Torchwick, who appeared as a cold and calculating career criminal, Neo was a more unstable unpredictable dangerous killer.\n\nNeo was a mute who cannot speak since birth and as such communicated purely through body language, miming, or text messages. [12]\n\nNeo was stated to be cruel, vicious, and sadistic, as seen in her smile as she prepared to stab Yang in \"No Brakes\", as well as in \"Round One\" when she proceeded to brutally stomp on her opponents face with a cruel smile despite him being physically unable to continue their match. [13] However, she did seem to exhibit fear and hesitance when she knew she was outmatched, fleeing if her opponent proved to be as such. This could be seen when Raven Branwen appeared and engaged her on the White Fang cargo train. She was rather perceptive and was able to recognize superior abilities to her own, despite her confidence. Neo was also seen to have a vengeful side by her attempt to kill Cinder Fall in \"The Coming Storm\" for her part in Roman Torchwick's death, only stopping when she revealed her Maiden powers.\n\nNeo was highly determined when she set her mind to a task, often dealing with any problems presented to her efficiently and competently. During her battle against Team JNPR, Neo took notice of Lie Ren's protectiveness of Nora Valkyrie and took advantage of that by transforming into her using her Semblance to make him hesitate. She also used Emerald Sustrai and Hazel Rainarts's escape as a cover to steal the Relic of Knowledge and skip away in the dust cloud created from Monstra's explosion.\n\nAdditionally, she was extremely ruthless, easily turning to violence as a means of achieving her goals and often doing so with a playful demeanor. In \"Worthy\", she alongside Cinder and Arthur Watts had assaulted the people stationed at the Atlas Command Center.[14]\n\nNeo possessed a desire to be validated whenever she accomplishes a task, as well as to be treated as an equal by a partner or superior. She was happy with working with Roman, as he often acknowledged her for completing a job. However, while working for Cinder, she was irritated by her lack of recognition or respect towards her. She was further angered when Cinder took the Relic of Knowledge from her without a word of gratitude and failed to give her credit for successfully stealing the Relic, as well as taking credit for her accomplishments to redeem herself before Salem. These actions eventually resulted in her going against Cinder's orders for her own wishes.\n\nNeo was extremely loyal to Roman and very close with him. She willingly carried out his demands and he was the only one she did not show contempt towards. Likewise, Roman never got upset with Neo like he did with others, and they were very proficient in wordlessly coordinating attacks. Neo was shown to be devastated after his death, and wears Roman's hat in memory of him. She is solely driven by a need to exact revenge for what happened to him and has gone to near suicidal lengths to do so, including facing Cinder alone. Neo had a previously lonely life until she met Roman, and after his death her life returned to said state. This is illustrated by her disheveled appearance in \"The Coming Storm\".\n\nLater, Neo took fights slightly more seriously becoming even more sadistic, cruel, and merciless than before. Previously, during her V2 fight with Yang, Neo toyed with her before knocking the girl unconscious and afterwards unsheathing Hush. Similarly, in her V3 fight against Ruby, Neo opted not to use her sword to fight, and later used it to threaten Ruby, which ultimately turned out to be her undoing when she used Hush to send her flying. Comparatively, in current fights, while she continued to mock her opponents, Neo used her blade more frequently and is shown dispatching foes much more quickly and not dragging out finishing moves any longer than necessary. It's implied that this notable change in behavior may be a result either of her perceived feelings of guilt for having failed Roman when he needed her the most, frustration at all of the constant delays towards avenging him, growing fed-up with all of the ridiculous situations she's found herself in or even a combination of all three.\n\nIn RWBY: Roman Holiday, it is shown that Neo was abused by her father and mother for not being the perfect child, due to her inability to speak, heterochromia, and unruly behavior. She had an imaginary friend named \"Neopolitan\", who she subconsciously used as a scapegoat to take the blame for her own rebellious desires that she had externalized. This was due to her parents simultaneously punishing her for her wants while not taking them seriously, as well as her loneliness and desire to be free—\"Neopolitan\" was everything Trivia had wanted to be.\n\nEventually, Trivia realized that \"Neopolitan\" was an externalization of her own desires—that she and \"Neopolitan\" were one and the same. All the violently lashing out at those who wronged her, rule-breaking and illegal activities, taunting, freedom and danger \"Neopolitan\" had pursued was just what Trivia had wanted, but felt she wasn't allowed to after a series of events—including her introducing herself as Neopolitan rather than Trivia to Roman, which she felt was \"right\" and gave her \"a fresh start\", with the metaphorical final straw being her mother physically shattering the illusion of \"Neopolitan\" conjured by Overactive Imagination in front of Trivia. When Trivia took on her new identity and name as Neopolitan, she viciously and fervently enforced her own wants and whims in contradiction to how long she'd been forced to repress them. Similarly, she took great pride in herself and cared little of how other people perceived or felt about her, in contrast to how her parents had insisted their image mattered more than anything else, including Neo's desires.\n\nAt the end of Roman Holiday, during the fight at the Vanille Estate involving Neo, Roman Torchwick, Senior Xiong, and Lil' Miss Malachite, Neo made a split-second decision to trick Lil' Miss into triggering a Dust explosion on the third floor in order to escape the fight, though the explosion ended up unintentionally killing her father and she suspected also her mother. This was Neo's first experience with the death of someone known to her, uncertain of how to react and feeling that it didn't affect her, although she gains her iconic white stripes in her hair at this time, indicating she was impacted by their deaths no matter what she thought. Her inability to legitimately process her parents' deaths was indicative of her larger inability to handle grief, as further shown by her single-minded revenge driven handling of Roman's death.\n\nIn “Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble”, after she drove Ruby to ascend in the Ever After, she became a broken and emotionless person herself as she realized she only wanted revenge, not to conquer the Ever After, and now that she achieved it, she no longer had a purpose. She became so broken that the Curious Cat was able to take over her body to fulfill their own agenda.\n\nIn “Of Solitude and Self”, Neo was released from the Curious Cat’s control and upon being exposed to the smoke of the Great Tree’s leaves, Neo was shown to have gone through significant emotional growth, as she eventually realized that revenge wouldn’t make her happy, nor fill the emptiness in her heart and would only consume her entirely, leaving her with nothing. The entire experience in the Ever After caused Neo to finally let go of the past, by letting go of Roman and accepting his death, as instead of trying to continue attacking Ruby or her friends, she decided to go through Ascension in order to find a new purpose for herself and become something new.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nIn \"No Brakes\", Neo proved herself to be a highly skilled combatant, able to defeat Yang in a one-on-one fight, seemingly playing with her opponent as she was able to defeat her without taking anything more than a glancing hit. Her fighting style was highly evasive, dodging, deflecting or maneuvering around her opponent's strikes until she had exhausted them, or was ready for a counterattack. Neo also displayed incredible reflexes and speed, dodging several of Yang's attacks with ease, even when holding her umbrella in one hand.\n\nThis was further shown in \"Heroes and Monsters\" where she was easily able to keep up with and defeat Ruby almost single-handedly, and in her fight with Cinder in \"The Coming Storm\", with Neo taking two hits and delivering four back to Cinder in a mostly even fight, only backing down when Cinder resorted to the use of her Maiden Powers. Cinder also commented Neo had 'grown stronger'. An example of that was shown in \"The Enemy of Trust\" with despite being completely outnumbered by both Oscar and Team JNR, she easily evaded, parried and dodged their attacks and overpowered and outmaneuvered them with quick and powerful strikes while doing so in a joking manner, hinting that Neo herself was not taking them seriously and was toying with them during the majority of their battle.\n\nNeo had also displayed herself to be very acrobatic and exceptionally skilled in hand-to-hand combat relying on her agility to dodge and misdirect enemy movements and attacks, before retaliating with her own kick-based attacks resembling Bartitsu with the way she blocked with her parasol, and Capoeira with her acrobatic kicks. She learned this as a student at Lady Browning’s Preparatory Academy for Girls, where they had a secret program for training chosen students to be assassins with a wide variety of classes in fencing, self-defense, and escape artistry. Neo excelled in all these classes and even trained under a rogue Huntress, her skills reaching the point that she could stand up against the Malachite sisters when they tried to stop her from escaping the academy.\n\nHowever, Neo had also been shown to immediately back out of a fight she knew she couldn't win. She instantly retreated upon seeing Raven in \"No Brakes\" and stopped attacking Cinder in \"The Coming Storm\" when she activated her Maiden powers, despite instigating the fight in the first place. It also appeared that she had more difficulty against opponents equipped with a melee weapon, as opposed to barehanded fighters; she easily bested Yang in \"No Brakes\" but had a more even contest against Ruby in \"Heroes and Monsters\" until Roman arrived to reinforce her. During her fight with Cinder in \"The Coming Storm\", Neo initially held the initiative, but Cinder gradually gained the advantage once she equipped herself with dual swords. During her duel with Maria Calavera, Neo was consistently outmatched until Maria became distracted. When she faced Ruby again in \"Worthy\" and \"The Final Word\", she held the initiative, but fell for Ruby's attempt to goad her, lashing out in anger that enabled Ruby to get the better of her.\n\nWhile using her weapon in sword form, Neo has displayed a sword style similar to Victorian Age fencing, as seen during her battle against Team JNPR and Oscar, where Neo held one of her hands behind her back as she made several swift sword stabs, jabs and swipes at her opponents. Notably, during her first few appearances, Neo never used Hush's blade to fight, only to down fallen opponents like Yang. Later, she is seen using it once, for a split second against Cinder and afterwards begins employing it regularly in fights.\n\nBy Volume 8, Neo's combat skills became powerful enough that she could easily fight multiple skilled opponents simultaneously. In \"Worthy\", she was able to fight against both Ruby Rose and Blake Belladonna and largely keep them on the defensive.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Hush\nV9 10 00131\nNeo holding Hush as part of her chrysalis\nNeo's weapon of choice was Hush (a custom-made gift from Roman),[9] a parasol containing a long, thin blade hidden within the length of the parasol's tube, which could also project the blade's tip from the top end of it. The canopy of the parasol was made of an extremely dense, durable fabric that could repel minor Dust explosions, allowing Neo to use it as a shield or a glider. Unlike many of the weapons shown in RWBY, Hush did not appear to contain a concealed firearm or projectile weapon, therefore it could only be used for close quarters fighting.\n\nIn \"Of Solitude and Self\", it became a part of her wooden chrysalis when she ascended.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Overactive Imagination\nNeo illusions\nYang shatters the illusion wall\nNeo's Semblance, Overactive Imagination, allowed her to create \"physical illusions that can be seen by everyone\", as opposed to Emerald's Hallucinations, which usually only affect the person(s) she targets.[15] These illusions were highly convincing and shattered like glass when she dispelled them, or someone broke them. Her most apparent use of them was creating illusions around her body, either to disguise herself or for her opponent to target while she escaped or moved unseen to another point of attack. They also seemed to be somewhat resilient to damage. While fighting Cinder, the illusion concealing Neo’s outfit was not dispelled even after taking or landing some hits. This was revised however in Volume 7, as her disguise was dispelled upon receiving a punch from Oscar. Additionally, in later volumes, she has learned to use her Semblance for psychological manipulation, exploiting the appearance of close friends and families in her enemies to torment and overpower them.\n\nV6 13 00006\nNeo disguising an entire Mistral Airship as an Atlas Manta\nIn \"Our Way\", Neo displayed her new mastery over her Semblance, where she managed to completely disguise an entire Mistral Airship to physically resemble an Atlas one, implying that she could maintain the facade long enough to fool the Atlas Military and cross the continental border checkpoint into Atlas.\n\nNeo also used her Semblance when communicating with others in lieu of her muteness, as seen in \"Out in the Open\" where she transformed into Ruby when arguing what to prioritize with Cinder.\n\nInitially, unlike Emerald's hallucinations, Neo's illusions did not affect a person's hearing, as she was not able to mimic sound or voices; thus, if she was disguised and someone tried to talk to her, her muteness might give her away. Before her time in the Ever After, her illusions also seemed to be limited in their range; they typically only covered Neo herself, and either a short distance around her or something she was touching, such as the Mistral airship that she disguised as an Atlesian Airship in \"Our Way\". However, as seen in her battles against Yang, Ruby and Cinder, she could maintain an illusion after moving away- until something made contact with it, after which the illusion will shatter.\n\nAs shown in \"Witch\", Neo herself had showcased the ability to create a camouflage illusion across her entire body in order to hide in plain sight. She altered her physical appearance, completely blending in with the dark crimson colors of Monstra's walls. Doing so, Neo was able to observe Oscar, Emerald, and Hazel accessing the Relic of Knowledge.\n\nV9 03 00159\nNeo Clones\nIn “Rude, Red, and Royal”, Neo’s Semblance evolved further, where she now had the ability to make multiple copies of herself. These clones were semi-autonomous, able to either copy movements of Neo or perform commands given by her. She could also control them at will and the clones themselves retained the ability to physically attack others, such as the Jabberwalker.\n\nV9 05 00127\nJabberwalker Clones\nIn “The Parfait Predicament”, it was shown that she could create clones of other beings as well, such as the Jabberwalker, and could even have them mimic the speech and voice of the original.\n\nAs seen in “The Perils of Paper Houses“, her Semblance could seemingly replicate another being to the point of copying their unique abilities. This is implied when the Jabberwalker clones attempted to devour Ruby, suggesting that the clones also possessed the original’s ability to permanently kill a Afteran by eating them, though this is currently unconfirmed.\n\nIn \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", Neo created clones of Penny Polendina, Pyrrha Nikos, Ozpin, Leonardo Lionheart, Clover Ebi, James Ironwood, Oscar Pine and Roman Torchwick. Her clones were able to perfectly replicate their voice, facial expressions and even to a degree, their personalities and fighting styles. She could also construct complex constructs such as appliances and even entire buildings, having replicated a copy of the Vanille Manor, complete with functioning lights and furniture and portraits of her memories. She could even create functioning weapons using her Semblance, as shown where she recreated Miló and Akoúo̱, Floating Array, The Long Memory, Stalwart, Melodic Cudgel, Due Process, had Milo and Akouo, Due Process, Melodic Cudgel and Stalwart fire rounds, and Milo and Akouo change forms.\n\nV9 08 00046\nNeo speaking through her clones\nFurthermore, as implied in \"The Perils of Paper Houses\", Neo possessed a connection to her constructs and could project her psyche through them, first shown where she remotely transformed one of her Jabberwalker clones into herself to send Ruby a message of her targeting her. Later, she projected her thoughts and feelings through her clones of Ruby’s friends and acquaintances, signified when their eyes turned into her heterochromia of pink and brown.\n\nNeo's power was shown at its strongest when she had her final confrontation with Ruby in \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\": she created a large Tea Room for Ruby to walk in, hosting a tea party of sorts with fallen comrades of Ruby. Her projections had enough autonomy to speak, fight and even bleed. They speak in Neo's stead, acting as a way for her to verbally communicate what she hated about Ruby and how she had personally failed them, all which quickly broke Ruby's spirit.\n\nOther Skills\n\nNeo herself proved to be a competent getaway driver and a highly skilled infiltrator, as shown in \"Beginning of the End\", where she, disguised as a paramedic, drove Cinder, Mercury Black and Emerald Sustrai away to an unknown location in an Air Bus after they initiated their plan to frame Yang.\n\nThis has been proven to be one of Neo's greatest talents, as she showed that combined with her Semblance, she could easily infiltrate military compounds no matter how well guarded or secure they are. One of the best examples was when she was shown walking through an airship full of Atlesian soldiers she presumably killed to free Roman and later Neo again showed her skills in infiltration and hijacking, when she managed to easily acquire a Mistral airship after presumably infiltrating a Mistral air base to steal it without being detected or noticed by the Kingdom's military or officials. Later she showcased that she could even easily infiltrate the highly secured Atlas Academy and later escape from it with no one noticing her at all and managed to again hijack and steal an Atlesian Manta.\n\nNeo has displayed a high level of cunning and skill in acting when using her Semblance, as seen when she observed and notices the close relationship between Lie Ren and Nora Valkyrie and was able to use it to emotionally manipulate Ren into giving her an opening to attack and escape. After her Semblance evolved, Neo’s ability to psychologically manipulate others using her Semblance had also increased, as shown where she was able to make her clones of Penny, Pyrrha, Ironwood, Ozpin and Oscar act, behave and sound like the originals to the point that they were able to effectively illicit emotional anguish from Ruby. Neo also showcased the ability to make her clones of Yang, Blake, Weiss, Jaune, Nora and Ren behave similarly realistic.\n\nWith the aid of her Semblance, Neo was shown to have expertise in pickpocketing, as she was easily able to steal the Relic of Knowledge off of Oscar without him knowing until it was too late.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlthough Neo was an exceptionally skilled melee fighter, she had a habit of dropping her guard when she decisively gained the upper hand, either out of smugness or anger; this sometimes allowed opponents to make a successful counterattack. Examples included her gloating after defeating Yang in \"No Brakes\" and Ruby in \"Heroes and Monsters\"; in both cases, this gave her opponents (Raven and Ruby) time to turn the tables on her. In \"The Final Word\", after Neo disarmed Ruby, Ruby provoked her anger over Torchwick's death, causing Neo to impulsively attack and fall straight into Ruby's trap. In \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", when Neo had Ruby at her mercy, she left herself open to a surprise attack from the Curious Cat, temporarily disrupting her attack on Ruby.\n\nShe also had a one-track mind, which while admirable in achieving her goals, presented some drawbacks. She did not care what happened to her so long as her goal was achieved, as seen in \"A Place of Particular Concern\", where she attempted to kill Ruby even while the two were falling through the void to their apparent deaths. This one-track focus also meant she did not consider what she'd do next if she ever achieved it. In \"Tea Admist Terrible Trouble, after she tortures Ruby into ascending, she falls into a catatonic state, not knowing what to do with her life now and leaving her free for the Curious Cat to possess due to her empty heart."

          ],
          "content": "USER\nVarious\nTYPE\nReincarnation\nOverview Image Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\nAscension is a process that occurs in the Ever After and is linked to the Great Tree.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nDescription\n\n\n1/2\n\n\nSimilar to concepts such as resurrection and reincarnation, Ascension occurs when an Afteran is no longer doing the assigned role that they are supposed to be. It is triggered by them losing their ways, wearing out, doubting themselves, or even just finishing their assigned tasks. Upon ascending, all Afterans are taken to the Great Tree and repurposed into someone or something else with a new identity, personality, and role in the Ever After. Their memories are erased in the process; however, their hearts do not forget their defining moments.\n\nNotable examples include the Red King and the Herbalist, who both underwent Ascension after no longer properly fulfilling their duties. The former was eventually reborn into a new being known as the Red Prince.\n\nAs revealed in “Of Solitude and Self”, the God of Light and God of Darkness were the ones originally in charge of handling the process of Ascension. However, as time went on, the Brothers quickly grew in power, and no longer bound to their role, decided to create beings who could replace them. The first was the Curious Cat, who would go around finding and “fixing” the broken parts of the Ever After, as well as and taking on their role of managing Ascension, as they can trigger the process in other Afterans. They gave the Cat numerous abilities to help them in their new role and duty, one of those was the ability to decide whether or not an Afteran is performing their roles adequately, and persuade them to continue in their role, or to send them to the tree. After the success of the Cat, the Brothers created a second being, the Jabberwalker, who could “finish what the Cat started” and provide the Afterans a way to stop ascending and die. They gave it the ability to disrupt the Ascensions of other Afterans by devouring them, preventing them from being reborn.\n\nAccording to the Curious Cat, Humans and other creatures from different worlds are unable to be properly ascended by the tree and so the results are largely unpredictable. Though this was disputed by the Blacksmith, who claimed that Ruby Rose was getting very close to Ascension at the time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nProcess\n\nV9 Trailer 00020\nRuby being confronted by a hallucination of her past self\nThe process of Ascension can begin through multiple means. As shown with Team RWBY’s meeting with the Herbalist, one way is through the Great Tree’s leaves. By inhaling the smoke from the leaves, a being would hallucinate someone important or significant to them, who then begins questioning their identities, goals and desires and tempting them at the prospect of changing, such as when Yang, Weiss, Ruby and Blake were faced with their past selves. It's been implied that if the four had accepted the proposals of these hallucinations, they would have then been swallowed into the ground by the tree's Roots and put through Ascension. After being hit with the smoke by Team RWBY and Jaune Arc, Neopolitan began her Ascension by jumping into the tree itself after letting go of Roman Torchwick for good.\n\nLater, during Neo’s plot to break Ruby, she convinced her to drink a cup of tea brewed with a leaf of the tree. Once Ruby had ingested it, she briefly glowed the same multicolored, purple, blue, green, yellow color of the leaves before being swallowed into the ground by the tree's roots. It's not clear whether or not the choice to Ascend could be rejected or not like it could with the smoke.\n\nV9 04 00108\nThe Cat giving the Herbalist “a piece of their heart”.\nAnother method to reach Ascension is through the Curious Cat. When a Afteran has a “Broken Heart” and has become unsure, confused or unhappy with their “roles”, the Curious Cat can help them by “giving them a piece of their heart”, which either convinces and assures them of their roles or convinces and causes them to go to the tree and ascend. As shown with the Herbalist, after the Cat gave him a piece of their heart and convinced them to ascend, they were immediately taken by a hole in the ground and collected by the tree’s roots after he agreed that he wasn’t following his original role anymore and needed to change.\n\nThe final method to ascend, as shown with the Paper Pleasers, is to die in the Ever After. When a Afteran’s body is destroyed their remains are stated to be blown by the wind to the Great Tree, where they automatically go through Ascension. Little also went through this method of ascension after being crushed by Neo.\n\nThe Herbalist’s chrysalis\nThe Herbalist’s chrysalis\nRuby’s chrysalis\nRuby’s chrysalis\nOnce someone accepts going through Ascension, they are immediately brought to the tree in the Central Acre of the Ever After, where they are then encased within the tree inside a wooden chrysalis, very much like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, until they finish ascending and emerge in their new form and identity.\n\nV9 09 00093\nThe Blacksmith helping and guiding Ruby’s decision on her new identity and form.\nOnce inside the Great Tree, the person seemingly meets with the Blacksmith as they are transported into her workshop that is located in an entirely separate realm within the tree. The Blacksmith then asks them on who and what they want to become in their next life. The Blacksmith then tries to guide this soul through this process and decision. As implied, once the soul decides what they want, the Blacksmith is the one in charge of creating their new form and gives them the powers and abilities they would need to help them fulfill their new purpose.\n\nHerbalist finishing his Ascension.\nHerbalist finishing his Ascension.\nHerbalist’s new form.\nHerbalist’s new form.\nWhen this process is complete, the soul emerges from their wooden chrysalis in their new form and identity, not having any memories of their previous lives but still retaining certain feelings. This is confirmed in the case of the Red Prince, where despite going through Ascension, he possesses a deep mistrust in humans and a belief that they were all cheaters due to the past experience of his original self as the Red King. The Curious Cat explained that this was due to \"the heart hardly ever forgets\", implying that despite losing their original personality and memories, an Afteran still retains certain emotional aspects of their original selves in their new incarnations. This is further shown with Little, who after Ascending, no longer had memories of their time with Ruby and her friends, but still retained their feelings of friendship with them, describing them as familiar and Ruby in particular as “like a happy dream they can’t remember” and even calling her “huntress”.\n\nRuby finishing her Ascension.\nRuby finishing her Ascension.\nRuby in her \"new\" form.\nRuby in her \"new\" form.\nFor Humans, while the person is able to choose a new identity for themselves, the process can also be an opportunity to rediscover who they truly are. Upon which, they emerge from the cocoon in their original form along with all their memories, with only a slight alteration to their appearance. This was first demonstrated by Ruby Rose, who after a great crisis of faith in herself was able to regain confidence in herself as a Huntress, thus allowing her to emerge as herself, but with all the damage she received during her fight with Neo healed up and regains her emblem pin that she previously gave away to the Teapot Lady.\n\nThere may also be a time limit with Ascension, as during Ruby's inability to decide what to be, the Blacksmith claims that Ruby's time to decide was running out. This implies that if a figure cannot figure out who or what they should be, they may forcibly be ejected or become something else altogether, though this is unconfirmed. It is very likely that the Blacksmith said that because her friends were losing against the Curious Cat.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\nAscension is described as a core process of the Ever After, being deeply intertwined in Afterans' lifestyles and culture. Due to this, it can be assumed that it has existed as long as the Ever After itself.\n\nFollowing his encounter with Alyx where he lost his game due to her cheating, the Red King was inconsolable and wavering about his role, so the tree saw fit to have him ascended to make him more resolute in his role. Following his Ascension, he became the Red Prince, who resumed his rule of the Crimson Castle, this time determined to win his game at any cost. Thus, where the King was honorable, the Prince now saw fit to cheat in his game to win no matter what.\n\nV9 04 00111\nThe Herbalist's Ascension.\nAnother Afteran who went through Ascension was the Herbalist. Team RWBY visited him in \"A Cat Most Curious\", where they asked for guidance toward the tree, which the Herbalist assumed meant they wanted his help to ascend. Using the tree's leaves, he used his mist ability to try to perform the Curious Cat's role, questioning their resolve to determine whether they are fit to ascend. While Yang, Weiss and Blake were resolute in refusing the offer to \"become someone else\", Ruby was left uncertain and depressed due to her recent defeats and perceived failures. Interrupting the process before Ruby could take the offer of Ascension, the Cat claimed the Herbalis wasn't performing his role adequately and gave him a piece of their heart to allow him to ascend and find his role again. (However, the Cat's real motivation behind disrupting the Herbalist's actions was revealed later in \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\")\n\nThis led Team RWBY to question the Curious Cat on what exactly Ascension was, and they explained the process to the team in \"The Parfait Predicament\". Soon after, Ruby Rose meets the Blacksmith, who offers her to set her burden down, seeing as she was the only one to doubt her role in the Herbalist's mist.\n\nDuring the events of \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", Neopolitan attempts to drive Ruby Rose to despair and drink tea made from a leaf from the tree to ascend. In order to do this, she uses clones of people she knew Ruby Rose failed to save in the past or that she had some role in their deaths recreated from her Semblance Overactive Imagination. Among them was Roman Torchwick, Pyrrha Nikos, Penny Polendina, Leonardo Lionheart, Clover Ebi, Ozpin and James Ironwood who she used to beat Ruby physically and mentally while calling her out for her actions ever since she started at Beacon Academy. She also used clones of her friends Oscar Pine, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, Yang Xiao Long, Jaune Arc, Lie Ren, Nora Valkyrie and Qrow Branwen to torment her into drinking the tea as well. Eventually, after Ruby witnesses Neo smashing her heel on Little and killing them, she finally ends up being driven to despair and drinks the tea to ascend right as the real Weiss, Blake, Yang and Jaune arrive.\n\nIn \"A Tale Involving a Tree\" WBY, Jaune and Juniper finally reach the Tree after Jaune found acceptance in his inability to save everyone. There they found the wooden chrysalises of the Herbalist and Ruby. Yang attempted to free her sister from the Tree, but Jaune stopped her, finally understanding that Ruby's Ascension was up to her and not them. Shortly later the group witnesses the Herbalist break free from his wooden shell, revealing him to have gained legs and wings from his Ascension. This helps Blake convince Yang to accept Ruby’s Ascension, despite the reality upsetting them both.\n\nAfter choosing a representation of Crescent Rose, Ruby emerged from the tree as herself. Following the defeat of the Curious Cat, Neo jumped into the tree to undergo an Ascension of her own while Little emerged, having ascended into a new mouse dubbed \"Somewhat\" by Ruby."

She is a member of Salem's Inner Circle and was the leader of her own faction. She is also the current Fall Maiden. Her machinations are the driving force behind the events of the first three volumes and cemented her as the main antagonist of the Beacon Arc. She made her debut in the first episode of Volume 1, \"Ruby Rose\".\n\nCinder used a special Grimm glove to steal half of the Fall Maiden's powers from Amber. During the Fall of Beacon, she gained the other half and killed Ozpin in battle.\n\nWhen Beacon fell, Ruby Rose unleashed the power of her Silver Eyes, putting Cinder into a state of near death and causing her to lose her left eye and part of her left arm. She had incredible difficulty speaking for a time, and her entire left arm was eventually replaced with a Shadow Hand.\n\nAfter narrowly surviving a defeat by Raven Branwen, Cinder allied herself with Neopolitan, one of her former associates, in order to eliminate their shared enemy against the orders of Salem. She later succeeded in getting the Relic of Knowledge thanks to Neo and returned to Salem on Monstra.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", Cinder obtains the Relic of Creation and the Relic of Knowledge, and sends Team RWBY, Jaune Arc and Neo falling into the void. Afterwards, she delivers both Relics to Salem.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat role does Cinder Fall play in the RWBY series? toggle section\nHow did Cinder Fall become the Fall Maiden? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of Cinder's Grimm glove in RWBY? toggle section\nWho is the main antagonist of the Beacon Arc in RWBY? toggle section\nWhat is Salem's Inner Circle and how is Cinder Fall associated with it? toggle section\nAppearance\n\n\n00:00\n\n41:20\n\n1101 Ruby Rose 10751\nCinder's tattoo\nCinder is a fair-skinned young woman with bright amber eyes and long, ashen-black hair that covers her left eye and rests over her left shoulder. On her upper back she has a black tattoo of her emblem: a pair of high heel shoes placed sole-to-sole, forming a heart shape inside. Her fingernails are painted dark red. In \"Black and White\", she wears lipstick and violet eyeshadow.\nOriginal Outfit (Dustweave Vestments, Volumes 1–3)\n\nV3 11 00131\nShe wears a dark red, long-sleeved, off-the-shoulders, V-neck minidress with a quadrant-shaped keyhole on the upper back framing her tattoo and two laces tied together across the neckline. Golden regal designs decorate the dress around the keyhole, across the chest, and down the sleeves which end in loops around her middle fingers. The dress splits from her right hip down, and has a tapered tail ending just above her knees. The hem is trimmed with black lace.\n\nShe wears black, lace-up shorts underneath her dress as well as a black choker around her neck. She also has dark, glass, high-heeled shoes.\n\nMounted on her right hip where the dress splits is a brooch consisting of a black, rhombus-shaped gem set within a gold metal frame with several iridescent blue and green feathers radiating out from it. She has a gold hoop earring with a black gem dangling from it on her right ear, and a jeweled anklet around her right leg.\n\nThe designs on the dress glow bright orange whenever she uses the Dust that is sewn into them. Her eyes and earring also glow.\n\nIt is possible that her appearance is influenced by East Asian culture, as the aforementioned regal designs are styled similarly to traditional Japanese or Chinese patterns.\n\nHer clothes throughout Volumes 1-3 are referred to as Dustweave Vestments in RWBY: Combat Ready, seemingly confirming they have been woven with Dust in them.[9]\n\nHaven Uniform\n\nWhen undercover at Beacon, Cinder is seen wearing the uniform of Haven Academy, a more conservative dark gray outfit with a long-sleeved collared top and white armband. Unlike most female students, who wear silver knee-high socks, Cinder wears black tights.\n\nInfiltration Outfit\n\nDuring her infiltration of the Cross Continental Transmit System Tower, Cinder is shown wearing a black infiltration outfit, which she had previously been seen sewing together in \"Extracurricular\".[10] The outfit consists of a sleeveless jacket, long gloves, stiletto heel boots, a black glass mask and several straps with containers of powdered Dust lined across her pants. The gloves, boots and pants have black mosaic designs that are infused with Dust that glows bright orange when in use. When needed, Cinder can instantly transform her infiltration attire into a formal black evening gown that has black glass[11] designs on it.\n\nTournament\n\n1301 Volume 3 Trailer 0964\nWhen attending the Vytal Festival Tournament, she wears gray pants and boots, a beige leather sleeveless jacket with light-beige details, brown gloves, a sarashi tied around her chest and another around her hips, and a pauldron on her left shoulder. She also wears a belt around her waist which has multiple brown pouches attached to it. Her fingernails are painted with tan nail polish.\n\nFlashback\n\nV3e7 cinder scouting\nDuring the events of \"Beginning of the End\", Cinder had shorter hair. Her previous attire looks similar to her original outfit except that her dress has separated sleeves and the dress is held up by straps tied around her neck in a bow. Her heeled shoes are made of a more typical material, rather than glass. She did not have her characteristic tattoo until after she stole a portion of Amber's Maiden powers. Her fingernails are a dark red color.\n\nMistral Outfit (Volumes 4–6)\n\nV5e11 cinder spear\nAfter the timeskip following the Fall of Beacon, Cinder's appearance went through a drastic change. Her hair is much shorter and she wears a mask that appears to be made of black glass over her missing left eye and the scarring from said injury extends into a slight x-shape over the bridge of her nose, as well as having deformed and degraded the tissue of her left ear.\n\nShe wears a long, dark red, velvet dress with one long, wide sleeve hiding her left arm. The collar and the opening for the right arm are trimmed with gold piping, and the dress is decorated with golden regal designs from the collar over the left shoulder and down the left sleeve. The right side of the dress is split from the hip down with two gold-colored straps made of interwoven ropes connecting the front half to the back half of her thigh. Under the dress, she appears to wear black pantyhose. On her right arm she wears a gray, opera-length glove with gold metal trim atop the cuff with curved, branching extensions up her arm. She retains her glass high heels.\n\nThe brooch on her right hip has changed; the feathers are colored a cyan-magenta gradient and are arranged in an array facing downward. Her previous earring has been replaced by one with a black hoop and a larger gem, and there is a new black hoop earring higher up.\n\n\nCinder's Shadow Hand\nIn \"Vault of the Spring Maiden\", Cinder reveals that her left arm has been replaced with a Shadow Hand grafted halfway up her upper arm where there is a significant amount of scarring. The appendage resembles that of a Geist, with a skeletal forearm and long, sharp claws. The arm is also capable of stretching great distances, and periodically emits black smoke.\n\nMistral Disguise (Volume 6)\n\nAfter the Battle of Haven, Cinder kills a woman passerby and takes her cloak; a light brown robe worn over a white shirt and pants with a shawl, sash and skirt of a matching dark brown color, with black socks and light brown sandals. Her left Grimm arm is wrapped in bandages, and she no longer wears her black mask or nail polish.\n\nAtlas Outfit (Volume 6-Current)\n\n\nBeginning in \"Our Way\", Cinder dresses in a black, one-sleeved bodysuit with a gold zip on the right, and two gold notches and gold trim on its rounded, stand-up collar. Slung around her hips are two crisscrossing belts, one narrower and with gold trim while the other has a gold-trimmed pouch on the left buttock, with a third belt around her left thigh at an angle.\n\nOn her right arm, a black armband carries a small pouch with gold trim over bandages wrapped around her bicep, and there is a long, black wristband extending partway up her forearm. An opera-length glove on her left arm overlaps the sleeve of her bodysuit to completely cover her Shadow Hand. The glove is embellished with a gold line that encircles its slightly-flared upper cuff and transitions into a shape reminiscent of a downward-pointing arrowhead on the lateral side. Additionally, the glove appears to be made of an elastic material allowing it to stretch with the arm, as demonstrated in \"The Enemy of Trust\", and conform to its claws. She also wears black, thigh-high, lace-up, high-heeled boots with red soles and decorative cuffs resembling flowers.\n\nHer outfit is usually mostly covered by a black shoulder cape with gold trim worn over her left arm and capable of slinging behind her back to allow for more mobility.\n\nFrom her previous attire, she retains the feather brooch which now occupies the right side of her chest attached to a gold cord draped atop her cape, as well as her two earrings. In place of the glass mask that once covered her left eye is a large eyepatch secured by two straps running above and below her right eye.\n\nShe appears to have put blush on her cheeks, as seen in \"Out in the Open\".\n\n\nCinder's Shadow Hand, having spread up to her shoulder\nThe Shadow Hand replacing Cinder's left arm appears to have extended up to her shoulder, as shown in \"The Enemy of Trust\" and onward. Moreover, it appears the scars on her arm have gone through change, now having a raw appearance.[12] Following her battle with Winter and Penny, she loses the glove along with the sleeve covering her arm, exposing her Shadow Hand.\n\nYoung\n\nIn her youth, Cinder wore her hair in two messy bunches, or \"conytails\"[13], which left short, dangling bangs over her left eyebrow. She wore a white shirt with a red apron, black pants and black shoes. Notably, her left index finger and right wrist were covered in bandages.\n\nCinder was also shown to be noticeably haggard and gaunt looking during her early childhood, as is seen when she is shown to be noticeably thinner, her cheeks more sunken, her eyes having deep black bags underneath them and she often had a tired expression on her face. All clear signs of her mistreatment within the Children's Home in Mistral, where she was likely overworked and underfed.\n\nGlass Unicorn Uniform\n\nIn her late childhood and early teens, Cinder primarily wore a uniform issued to her by her \"Step-Mother\" as a \"employee\" for her hotel, the Glass Unicorn. Her outfit consisted of a white shirt with grey laces as well as grey pants and shoes. As seen during her time growing up in the hotel, she would usually tie her hair into a single bun on the back of her head.\n\nAfter Cinder killed her abusive step-family and Rhodes, she rips off the shock necklace she was wearing while she was working at the Glass Unicorn and has a noticeable scar where it was on her neck.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nChild (10 years old)\nChild (10 years old)\nThe scar around Cinder's neck\nThe scar around Cinder's neck\nSilhouette from Volume 1 intro\nSilhouette from Volume 1 intro\nUniform\nUniform\nProm\nProm\nParamedic\nParamedic\nGrimm Arm exposed\nGrimm Arm exposed\nMistral Disguise\nMistral Disguise\nAtlas Outfit, without the cape in front\nAtlas Outfit, without the cape in front\nAs a teenager under the Glass Unicorn\nAs a teenager under the Glass Unicorn\nVolume 3 Flashback\nVolume 3 Flashback\nVale - note the makeup she wore in Volume 1\nVale - note the makeup she wore in Volume 1\nStealth\nStealth\nTournament\nTournament\nMistral Outfit\nMistral Outfit\nScar from Ruby's Silver Eyes\nScar from Ruby's Silver Eyes\nAtlas Outfit\nAtlas Outfit\nAtlas Outfit, full body with Grimm Arm\nAtlas Outfit, full body with Grimm Arm\nAfter Winter cut off her Grimm Arm\nAfter Winter cut off her Grimm Arm\nAtlas Disguise\nAtlas Disguise\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nCinder is ruthless and sadistic, as demonstrated when she delivers a killing blow to a clearly defeated Pyrrha Nikos in \"End of the Beginning\" and when she throws a spear at a defenseless Weiss Schnee in \"The More the Merrier\". She is relentlessly driven to gain power and determined to cross any line to obtain it. Cinder demonstrates a cunning that shows in her successful manipulation of events and people throughout the first three volumes. Cinder is also arrogant and egomaniacal and, as such, relishes in dominance and gloating, displaying shameless pleasure in the misery she has caused others. She believes that the power she is after is owed to her, having been promised godlike abilities and the Maiden powers by Salem.[14]\n\nShe also seems to be ambitious and demanding in the role of a leader, expecting her subordinates to execute exactly as she wishes with what little she gives them. She does not seem to tolerate failure, preferring for her goals to be successful regardless of the situation. Cinder prefers that such problems be solved quickly, is seen to give very direct orders, and keeps her subordinates on a strictly need-to-know basis, sharing a similar leadership style to Salem. However, she does display a cunning streak, as her allegiance revolves around having Neopolitan kill Ruby Rose so Cinder will not be going against Salem's orders to not kill her.\n\nUsually, she maintains a calm and collected demeanor and is willing to take over a fight if necessary. In the rare occurrence in which she is caught off guard, Cinder's monumental temper surfaces, showing her immense shock and outrage. This is most notable when Jaune Arc just barely nicks the edge of her mask during the Battle of Haven resulting in Cinder flying into a childish rage and start to yell and make threats. This explosive response to even the slightest attack on her shows Cinder's intolerance of fear, leading her to react poorly when others see her feel it. Cinder seeks to be feared and therefore detests being made to feel fear by both her enemies and her superiors alike. Additionally, Cinder is stated to be jealous of those with natural talents.[15]\n\nWhen Cinder first obtained the Fall Maiden powers, she saw it similarly to a brand-new toy that made her feel like she was the best and strongest. Because of this, she became addicted to the feeling and stopped considering the strengths she had acquired before that moment.[16] Because of this, she was humiliated from her defeat and injury by Ruby atop Beacon Tower. As shown in Volume 4, she did not display her usual confidence, instead appearing sullen and taking insults from the other members of Salem's Inner Circle without reply due to her inability to speak, thus relying on her subordinates.\n\nEven after recovering in Volume 5, her deep desire for vengeance against Ruby clouds her judgement, shown when she negotiates a deal with Raven Branwen to stage an ambush in Haven Academy, despite protest from Arthur Watts. In the end, this results in Raven betraying Cinder, leaving her for dead and taking the Relic of Knowledge. Because of her actions, Salem was forced to change her plans, focusing on attacking Atlas instead of Vacuo due to the Lamp being taken there.\n\nCinder's thirst and desperation for power stems from a life of powerlessness and having nothing.[17] This desperation has led to a fear of failure and a hatred towards the elite class, who have held power from others forever. She apparently detests being called out on her actions, as shown when Raven cites Cinder's choice to take the arm of a Grimm. Cinder retorts angrily, showing she sees herself as being beyond judgment or the moral codes of others. She is incapable of accepting any sort of criticism from others. However, in \"Taking Control\", she is visibly horrified watching as Tyrian Callows maniacally kill a Beowolf in grief of having displeased Salem, showing that even she has limits with absolute violence. It is implied that Cinder only enjoys the psychological torture she inflicts and dislikes the bloodier brutality of her associates.\n\nLater, the full extent of Cinder's desperation for power is shown in her reaction of again being denied the power of a Maiden, as seen in \"The Enemy of Trust\". During her battle with Penny Polendina and Winter Schnee and upon being overpowered by Fria, her anger and frustration reached its boiling point as she began viciously lashing out at Winter, injuring her badly and nearly killing her for deterring Cinder's quest for power.\n\nThe World of RWBY: The Official Companion states that Cinder chose to hasten Pyrrha's demise by incinerating her body, sparing her a slow death after being shot in the ribcage. This hints that Cinder might possess a small sense of mercy.\n\nAlthough Watts' angry rant regarding her arrogance and short-sightedness hinted at Cinder having a change of heart, in reality she does not change at all, merely doubling down on said qualities.[18] In \"Worthy\", she murders tons of civilians in the central location during the evacuation to Vacuo, and in \"The Final Word\", betrays and murders her allies without a second thought such as pushing Neo into the void and trapping Watts in the Atlas Command Center before setting it on fire to kill him.\n\nBased on her upbringing shown in \"Midnight\", Cinder's current personality and desperation for power stems from the abuse she suffered as a child. She faced constant bullying, starvation and abuse from the other children from the home she was raised in, and was later abused even further after being adopted by her step-family, who treated her as nothing more than a servant and abused her regularly.\n\nDespite no longer being under them, Cinder still retains several psychological scars from their abuse. This is seen in Cinder's behavior, where she had apparently unconsciously adopted the cruel traits of her past abusers into her own personality. Though the electrocution she got from the necklace also had an effect on her, making Cinder disdainful of physical torture.\n\nDue to her abusive childhood, Cinder has shown to possess a docile, fearful and submissive side to her personality when dealing with someone who is superior to her. This side of her was most pronounced in her childhood and later after returning to Salem's side after redeeming herself of her past failures. Despite this, Cinder's lust for power ultimately caused her to disobey Salem's order regardless of the consequences when she decided to go to Amity Communications Tower. In \"Amity\", Cinder is shown to be a bit of a hypocrite, claiming to Penny that she serves no one, yet still serves Salem despite not always following her orders, psychologically projecting herself onto Penny. During their fight, Cinder was shown at her most manic and reckless nature, which would be one of the last times she went way over her head thinking she could achieve her goals through brute strength alone.[19]\n\nAs seen during her childhood, Cinder had a more positive and vulnerable side to her personality. This is was partially due to the positive influence of her mentor Rhodes, who attempted to guide Cinder to a better path in life as a Huntress. This is seen when, after being talked down by Rhodes about her wanting revenge on her step-family, Cinder backed down from wishing to hurt them and expressed her true desire of simply wanting to be free and be strong enough to look after herself without relying on them any longer. With Rhodes' influence, Cinder instead chose to focus on becoming a Huntress and becoming old enough to leave. This would later not come to pass after she kills her step-family due to them finally taking their abuse too far. This showed that Cinder initially was hesitant at the prospect of killing and that she was only resorting to it due to seeing it as her only way out, as was seen after Cinder had killed her step-family and was noticeably repulsed by her own actions and did not actively enjoy or take pleasure in having taken their lives.\n\nCinder was also shown to have developed a genuine friendship with Rhodes, most likely due to his being the first person in her life to have treated her with kindness. She later felt deeply betrayed after Rhodes made his stance clear that he would take her in for killing her step-family, causing her to enter into a rage for him having betrayed her trust. Later after Cinder successfully killed him, she would shed a single tear for her mentor.\n\nFollowing her experience at the Glass Unicorn, Cinder began hating being \"under someone's thumb\". She hates it when other people have power over her and even when she works with someone, she is not content to do as she is instructed. She herself always wants to be at the top and can't be anyone's equal.[20]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nCinder is a highly skilled combatant in both unarmed combat and swordsmanship, being able to out-duel both Winter Schnee and Penny Polendina simultaneously in their battle, and later fend off the entirety of Team RWBY with casual ease in \"Worthy\".\n\nShe is also a capable markswoman, launching three arrows at once with great accuracy and pragmatically exploiting any advantage whenever possible, such as launching an arrow in Amber's back just as the latter was about to kill Emerald. Cinder has shown to be quite stealthy as well, having snuck around a guard at Beacon Academy to easily knock him out and escaping Ruby when the latter encounters her on her mission and fights her. She is also quite adept at piloting, able to fly a Bullhead during one of Glynda's attacks.\n\nCinder is adept at Aura-based blocking techniques and easily capable of blocking bullets from Crescent Rose.\n\nShe can make extensive use of raw Dust without difficulty. Her primary technique at the time of her battle with Ruby in \"Ruby Rose\" was a highly forceful blast of fiery projectiles. It was later revealed by the presence of her tattoo that Cinder had obtained half of the Fall Maiden's power prior to this confrontation, although the Maidens were not added as a story element until after Volume 2 and thus were not a canon aspect of the show at the time. Cinder is capable of weaving Dust into her clothes, as shown in \"Extracurricular\".[10]​​​​ Additionally, the arrows used when firing Midnight are made using Dust.[21]\n\nCinder's physical strength is shown being well above average in \"End of the Beginning\" and \"The Enemy of Trust\", where she knocks Pyrrha away by jabbing her in the stomach with her elbow and physically overpowering both Penny and Winter with ease. In \"Midnight\", Cinder showcased that even as a young teenager, she was already physically strong enough to carry a fully grown woman and lift her off her feet by her throat using only one hand and break her neck by simply squeezing her throat and tightening her grip.\n\nAs shown in \"Midnight\", she has a high pain tolerance, most likely due to her years in the Glass Unicorn.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Midnight (weapon)\nMain article: Cinder's Weapons\nDuring the first three volumes, Cinder's weapons of choice were Midnight. She showcased immense swordsmanship skill in using a dual bladed fighting style and was shown to be skilled enough to overpower the previous Fall Maiden, Amber, and fight off Ruby, a prodigy scythe wielder, with ease.\n\nMidnight can combine together at the bottoms of the swords' hilts to form into a bow, allowing Cinder to make long range attacks by firing arrows at her target.\n\nLater after becoming the Fall Maiden, Cinder chose to no longer use Midnight.\n\nCurrently, Cinder is able to use her Maiden powers to conjure Magical Weapons at will. Usually, she prefers using blades, and has shown to wield a variety of differently shaped ones with ease. However, she has also conjured bows, arrows and spears as well.\n\nCinder has also shown some skill in using polearm weapons, with her having used at least two different spears as projectiles.\n\nAs seen with her arrows and blades, Cinder can make her projectile weapons explode at will, with them being shown to possess considerable power in order to bombard her targets.\n\nAs shown in \"Midnight\", Cinder's sword skills were taught to her by Rhodes. Because of this, her fighting style greatly resembles his own.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Scorching Caress\nV3 07 00054\nCinder forming rudimentary projectiles to throw at Amber.\nCinder's Semblance, Scorching Caress, allows her to super-heat objects and manipulate their shape.[17] She can use it to generate explosions by super-heating the ground, as well as turn dirt and dust into glass.\n\nThe most notable instance of Cinder's Semblance is during her fight with Pyrrha Nikos, during which she disintegrates her opponent with Scorching Caress.[22]\n\nHer main usage of it in battle is both launching projectiles created by superheating dirt, as seen during her battle against Amber, as well as manipulating her weapon Midnight which is formed through Dust. She can also produce heat from any part of her skin, such as when she burnt Penny using her thighs.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Midnight\" that Cinder's Semblance was awakened due to the abuse from her step-family.\n\nShadow Hand\n\nMain article: Shadow Hand\nV7 13 00142\nCinder painfully regrowing her severed Grimm Arm.\nDuring the Fall of Beacon, Cinder is severely injured by Ruby's Silver Eyes. Following this, her left arm is replaced with a Grimm limb known as a \"Shadow Hand\".[23] It is implied that the arm itself possesses some sort of sentience, as Salem instructed her to make her new limb respect and fear her. The arm is capable of stretching out a long distance and has been shown to be capable of extracting the Maiden powers as seen in her fight with Amber.\n\nThe arm is capable of regrowing after being cut off with no permanent damage, as seen during \"The Enemy of Trust\" when it was cut off by Winter Schnee. However, the process itself is exceptionally painful, with Cinder screaming in agony as it regenerated itself.\n\nAs of Volume 7, Cinder's Shadow Arm seems to have slowly begun progressing in covering her entire body, as the Grimm flesh has now reached all the way to Cinder's shoulder while previously the arm only halted at her elbow.\n\nDespite being attached to Cinder, the Shadow Hand possesses a connection to Salem. This is seen in \"Midnight\", where she uses it to induce pain on Cinder for her disobedience. It is also seen in \"The Final Word\". Upon reforming, the Shadow Hand acted up, signaling Cinder of her master's return.\n\nMaiden Powers\n\nMain article: Maidens\nIn order to acquire the Fall Maiden powers, Cinder used a special glove to steal it from Amber. However, she only took half of it when the process was interrupted, which she described as an emptiness. Upon obtaining the remaining portion in \"Heroes and Monsters\", Cinder gained the ability to use fire-based attacks without the need of Dust or her Semblance.\n\nV8 05 00065\nCinder conjuring a bow and arrows using her Maiden powers.\nCinder later displayed power over other elements she has not used before, such as conjuring a small blast of ice to freeze Raven Branwen solid and the power of wind to levitate herself and fly at high speeds. Furthermore, Cinder also used the power of earth to create a giant flaming molten rock sword out of thin air. Her skill over fire allows her to conjure her glass based weapons without the need of Dust or her Semblance. As the Fall Maiden, she is the only one that can access the chamber of the Relic of Choice, although has yet to do so.\n\nAdditionally, she also displayed the power to affect the behavior of Grimm, having been able to somewhat influence the actions of a gigantic Wyvern through her Maiden Powers.[17]\n\nSince her arrival in Atlas, Cinder is shown to have improved in her capabilities, being able to summon weapons that explode at will. She is also capable of breathing fire. However, she is not a fully realized Maiden yet, as she could not face Fria in a fight. She was eventually overpowered in her duel with Raven as well.\n\nDuring her battles in Atlas, Cinder demonstrated the ability to use fire to fly by creating blasts underneath her feet and in the palms of her hands to act as thrusters. Cinder's mobility and maneuverability in flight was shown during her aerial battles against Winter Schnee and Penny Polendina, wherein she was able to outmaneuver the both and defeat them.\n\nIn \"Worthy\", she creates a vortex of fire similar to the one Fria made out of ice. She also showcased her ability to breathe a long jet of fire and infuse lightning with her flames when hitting Ruby in \"The Final Word\".\n\nWeaknesses\n\nV5 11 00062\nCinder is briefly incapacitated after her Shadow Hand is injured by Ruby's Silver Eyes.\nFollowing Cinder's unexpected defeat during the Fall of Beacon at the hands of Ruby, Salem reveals that upon acquiring the powers of a Maiden, Cinder gained a crippling weakness to the powers of the Silver Eyes, most likely due to her usage of a Grimm glove. After getting a Shadow Hand grafted into her body, its innately soulless status prevents Cinder from protecting it with her Aura, leaving it vulnerable to other weapons and Silver Eyes. Upon her first exposure to the Silver Eyes, Cinder was greatly weakened and significantly injured.\n\nOther than this, Cinder has shown that she could also be defeated by far more experienced Maidens, as was the case with both Raven and Fria."

She is a former Huntress, the mother of Yang Xiao Long, the older twin sister of Qrow Branwen and the estranged wife of Taiyang Xiao Long.[2] Her weapon of choice is Omen, a sword with a rotary chamber filled with six types of Dust blades. She first appeared in \"No Brakes\", saving her daughter from being killed by Neopolitan, before vanishing through a portal.\n\nRaven is the leader of the Branwen Tribe as well as a former member of Team STRQ alongside Summer Rose, Taiyang and Qrow. She is also the current Spring Maiden who used her fellow tribe member Vernal as a decoy, until her death at the hands of Cinder Fall in \"Downfall\".\n\nShe served as a main antagonist in Volume 5, joining forces with Cinder in order to obtain the Relic of Knowledge from Haven Academy, though she intended on double crossing her to take the Relic for herself as insurance against Salem. However, after a confrontation with her daughter Yang, she hands over possession of the Relic to her before disappearing through a portal, using her link with Taiyang to make an escape.\n\nShe makes a reappearance in \"Jr. Detectives\", attending a meeting at Shade Academy alongside Winter Schnee, Professor Theodore, and Oscar Pine.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the significance of Raven Branwen's weapon, Omen, in RWBY? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Raven and Yang in RWBY? toggle section\nWhat does the name 'Branwen' mean and how does it relate to Raven's character? toggle section\nHow does Raven's character evolve throughout the RWBY series? toggle section\nWhat role does Raven play in the Beacon events in RWBY? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n00:00\n\n41:20\n\nV5 09 00016\nIn her first appearances in Volume 2, Raven's outfit consisted of a V neck black and red kimono top with a black pleated skirt that has black shorts underneath, with series of beaded necklaces. She also wears a red obi sash around her waist alongside a red tasset wrapped around her waist that carries her weapon's sheath. Attached to it is a long black object that is either fur or feathers, with a red and white bandana material like hanging from behind her. Her forearms bear red armored gauntlets that protrude outwards and black fingerless gloves. She wore black mid-thigh high boots that had armor plating with red splatter patterns.\n\n\nIn Volumes 4 and 5, her appearance changes slightly: her boots gained a red sole and heel and have become solid black, losing the splatter design and armor and her eyes now a darker crimson color.\n\nHer most distinctive feature is a fearsome, full-face mask that resembles the face of a Creature of Grimm. The mask has four eye slits, further enhancing the character's inhuman appearance. In Volume 2, Raven's eyes are visible through the lower slits, but in Volume 5, the slits are black and red inside. She wears this mask to not only hide her Maiden powers, but to also appear more intimidating when leading her tribe.[3]\n\nV5e10 raven\nUnder the mask, she looks very similar to Yang; they share the same facial shape and long, bushy hair. However, Raven's hair is jet black, her eyebrows are a little bit higher, her complexion is significantly lighter and slight age lines are under her eyes. Her hair is tied by a red bandanna and loosely done up in a ponytail with the ends resembling curved black feathers. A cowlick can be seen protruding from the top of her head, similar to that of her daughter's.\n\nCorvid Form\n\nAs a corvid, Raven is similar to her brother's corvid form, only lacking his head feathers. However, befitting her name, she transforms into a raven rather than a crow. This is indicated by their different calls (Qrow's is a harsh caw, whereas Raven's is a deeper croak) and different flight patterns (Qrow tends to flap his wings more, whereas Raven soars).\nImage Gallery\n\nPast\nPast\nCurrent\nCurrent\nMasked\nMasked\nCorvid\nCorvid\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nRaven is cynical, patronizing, selfish and stubborn. She believed her act of \"kindness\" of saving Yang's life from Neopolitan was sufficient despite having left Yang at a very young age and refused to protect her daughter when in need after that. Raven is intended to be more intimidating the less you know about her.[4]\n\nGiven her upbringing in a nomadic bandit tribe, Raven has a \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, and she has little issues with taking the lives of the innocent or even that of Huntsmen, indirectly or otherwise. Despite murdering the former Spring Maiden, Raven presented her actions as merciful and necessary, saying that the Maiden never learned anything despite the training Raven put her through and that she wasn't cut out for this world.\n\nHowever, beneath her \"survival of the fittest\" philosophy and despite her great powers as a Maiden, Raven is a coward who is really troubled and fakes confidence.[5] Her fear of Salem is so great that she chose to run from it all after deeming the fight unwinnable. She is even willing to risk her brother and daughter's lives in order to get access to the Relic of Knowledge in hopes of warding off Salem. As Yang pointed out, Raven's definition of strength is shallow. As despite her great power, she chooses to run away from her problems instead of facing them, sacrificing others as shields to gain herself advantage. In the end, Raven's survival of the fittest philosophy is just a façade to hide her fear of Salem and her other insecurities, one that is heavily implied to be a fear of being a mother.\n\nRaven is not above manipulating others, having tried to emotionally manipulate Yang during their reunion in \"Lighting the Fire\" so she would choose to stay with her instead of reuniting with Qrow and Ruby Rose, first by taking a faux warm and theatrical attitude before revealing secret information and threatening Yang in the hope that it would scare her from joining Qrow and Ozpin. She also successfully deceived Salem's subordinates into thinking that Vernal was the Spring Maiden and into setting an ambush for Qrow and the students in order to get access to the Relic in \"A Perfect Storm\", although the latter was due to Cinder Fall's need for revenge.\n\nRaven is also very prideful and hypocritical, refusing to acknowledge her faults and always trying to justify her actions both to others and to herself, often putting the blame on others for them even if she feels guilt. She states to Qrow in \"Family\" that she did not know that the Grimm would come quickly to destroy Shion, despite the fact that it was the tribe's attack that left it vulnerable in the first place. When speaking to Lionheart in \"True Colors\", she refuses to admit that it is out of fear of Salem that she worked with her subordinates, unlike Lionheart who freely admitted it. Finally in \"Haven's Fate\", she tells Yang that she knew that she could handle the trap on her and her friends even though it wasn't the case and presenting her murder of the Spring Maiden as an act of mercy due to the girl's perceived weakness, stating she would have been hunted her whole life. Also, despite criticizing Ozpin over keeping information from others, using others to reach his goals and being manipulative Raven has no issues doing the same. While aiding Summer in a mission, she brings up her choice to leave her family in the dark about the details, to which Summer coldly reminds her is something she also did.\n\nWhile Raven and Qrow used to see each other as family when growing up, she now sees Qrow as a traitor for leaving their tribe and Qrow outright stated that she was dangerous and hostile, though he continued to care for her and they stayed in touch, though Raven seemingly only contacted Qrow to get information from him. When Qrow confronted her on her setting a trap for him, Yang and Ruby and renounced her as his sister Raven went as far as implying that she may have never seen Qrow as family. Raven is a cynic who claims to have foreseen Ozpin's failure to protect Beacon Academy from its destruction. She believes that Ozpin is not the man her daughter thinks he is and condemns those who trust him, such as Qrow, Ruby and even Taiyang and Yang.\n\nBecause of her prideful and self-centered mentality Raven often fails to measure the consequences of her actions, such as her attempt to manipulate Yang into staying with her and to distrust Qrow and Ozpin by calling Ruby a lost cause, and revealing Salem's existence and insulting Qrow and Taiyang, which only reinforced Yang's determination to reunite with her uncle and sister, and reject Raven further. She also advised Yang to question everything which eventually caused her to question her mother's own motives and actions. She also devised a plan to get the Relic of Knowledge to keep Salem away from the tribe while overlooking the fact that it would only cause her to become a greater target for her.\n\nAccording to Qrow, Raven has a very skewed definition of what a family means. Despite having constantly watched over Yang in her corvid form, Raven never took a part in her daughter's life or tried to meet her in spite of her Semblance. With Qrow, the only reason she would visit him was only when she needed something from him rather than trying to maintain or reestablish a good relationship with him. When reunited with Yang for the first time Raven used a theatrical attitude trying to be welcoming to Yang by praising her and offering hospitality, only to drop the act after Yang stated that she wasn't here for her.\n\nShe also does not understand why Qrow chose to stay with their former teammates and his nieces over returning to the tribe despite how close Qrow has become with them, as well as underestimating how far Yang would go for Ruby by trying to scare or convince her with knowledge about Ozpin and Salem, which instead only reinforced Yang's determination to reunite with and protect her sister.\n\nYet despite her ruthless and immoral behavior, Raven isn't totally devoid of morality as she showed some regret for her actions, such as the treatment of her family and the killing of the Spring Maiden. When battling Cinder in \"Downfall\", she is disgusted by her complete lack of scruples in her quest for power, calling her out for having become a monster by getting a Grimm arm. However, because of her pride, Raven often tried to deny her true feelings, hiding it behind an aloof attitude. She states to Vernal that she did not care about Yang being in danger due to her plan even though her body language said otherwise. Likewise, when Ruby made a proposal for her to join them in \"The More the Merrier\", she showed an instance of vulnerability, before hiding it and dismissing her entirely. It's implied in a conversation with Summer that some part of her choice to leave was because Summer could be who she couldn't, shifting her responsibility over to her.\n\nAccording to Taiyang, Raven had a straightforward approach, often dealing with obstacles by going through them instead of going around, and saw strength as all-important in a fight, traits that Yang inherited. He adds that Raven was ambitious and gave her all to whatever cause she saw as just while acknowledging she had unspecified faults that greatly contributed to the dissolution of Team STRQ. When Raven told Yang that she didn't know her, Yang replied that she only knows the Raven that her father told her about, asking her mother if she killed her previous self too. The question caused Raven to be shocked and look away, indicating that Raven was once a braver, more idealistic woman before leaving.\n\nAfter defeating Cinder, Raven shows a softer side, taking the time to close the deceased Vernal's eyes and thank her for her service. This side of her is further shown in \"Haven's Fate\", in which she and Yang share an emotional conversation. After Yang calls Raven out for killing the former Spring Maiden, her cowardice and hypocrisy in refusing to fight Salem, and for showing a callous indifference to her own daughter's well-being, Raven once more begs Yang to stay out of the war against Salem, but to no avail. Raven subsequently breaks down in tears, apologizing to Yang before fleeing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nRaven possesses great speed in combat, so much so that her attacks are difficult to follow with the naked eye. She shows proficiency in \"Iaido\", the art of swordsmanship also practiced by Adam Taurus, as seen when she first engages Neo. After her initial attack, she challenges Neo with a more traditional stance, indicating a more intricate fighting style. During her fight with Cinder, she was able to slice in half a massive boulder and use the elemental effect of her ice blade to smoothly slide away from an attack, all within seconds, showing a faster than average reaction time. She allowed Cinder to chase her during the initial stages of their battle, letting her opponent expend energy before launching a counterattack. She also takes to account her surroundings during battle, and often uses what is around to her advantage, such as falling debris.\n\nAs a testament to her skills, Raven as a child, with no formal training, was able to get into Beacon through sheer skill, which normally requires several years of training at a combat school to do. She then went on to train directly under Ozpin and became skilled enough that he entrusted her and Qrow with a portion of his power, as well as becoming a part of his inner circle.\n\nIt is stated in \"Welcome to Haven\" that Raven is equally matched with her brother Qrow, although this did not take her Maiden Powers into account. During the one time they were shown fighting each other, Raven had the initiative, forcing Qrow back and landing a kick on him.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Omen\nRaven's weapon of choice is Omen, a scabbard that has a rotary chamber filled with different types of Dust blades, reminiscent of the Dust vial chamber of Myrtenaster wielded by Weiss Schnee. The blades, when connected with the accompanying handle, are reminiscent of the long-bladed, single-edged ōdachi, or \"great sword\". Using the handle, Raven is able to wield a variety of different blades, each one possessing a different color and property.\n\nBy reattaching the handle to the scabbard, Raven is able to interchange, or if need be, replace the Dust blade. The blades are telescopic, which allows them to be approximately twice the length of the scabbard. She tends to most often use the blade made of Red Dust, though she has also used others. The colors seen so far in combat include Red, Blue, Yellow, Gray/Black, and Green. The Dust blades, though powerful, can be broken if struck several times or hard enough. Since they are Dust, she can use them for elemental based attacks.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Kindred Link\nV5 11 00009\nRaven creates a portal with Omen.\nRaven's Semblance, Kindred Link,[6] allows her to create portals to instantly travel to people she has a strong emotional connection with and can cover vast distances through them. Raven largely uses this ability to make an exit, rather than for offensive purposes: she has notably used them to teleport to Yang in order to save her from Neo, as well as to leave the bar in Higanbana after talking with Qrow and to allow Salem's associates to walk into Haven Academy from her camp. Raven can also allow other people through her portals, as she did with Weiss and Yang, without going through herself or requiring them to be bonded to her, provided they are with- or traveling to- someone she is bonded with. To activate the ability, she swings her sword, causing a portal to open a few feet in whatever the direction the blade was swung at, but she is also able to open portals without her sword, such as when she opened one in her bird form. To date, she has bonded with at least four people:\n\nTaiyang Xiao Long\nQrow Branwen\nYang Xiao Long\nVernal †\nMaiden Powers\n\nMain article: Maidens\nWithout knowing that it was his sister, Qrow Branwen deduces that much of the damage wrought in Shion Village was caused by the Spring Maiden, exemplifying her destructive utilization of the Spring Maiden's powers. She is able to generate a lightning strike in \"Lighting the Fire\", summoning it from the sky like the previous Fall Maiden Amber could. In \"A Perfect Storm\", she is able to summon strong gusts of wind and turn the sky from clear to cloudy in an instant. In both cases, she was able to disguise her power and make it appear that Vernal was performing the feats.\n\nV5 13 00083\nRaven using her Maiden powers.\nWhen she uses her magic, her eyes produce a dark red flame matching her Aura, which is why she wears her Grimm mask whenever using Vernal as her decoy. In \"Downfall\", during Raven's fight with Cinder, she makes use of several different elemental powers. She can generate ice, either by condensing it into weaponry, forming ice spikes or freezing from a distance. She can also generate electricity from her hands and release it in close ranged strikes. Lastly, she demonstrates the ability to fly, which she has been able to use additionally to propel herself at high speeds.\n\nUnlike Cinder, Raven does not choose to specialize in or prioritize the use of one element above the rest. Rather, she varies in attacks that she uses to keep her opponents off balance. Also, she does not rely heavily on her Maiden powers, mostly using it as a physical boost, as seen in \"Downfall\" where she used them to keep up with Cinder.\n\nAs the Spring Maiden, Raven is the only one that has the power to open the Vault containing the Relic of Knowledge in Mistral. Later it was revealed that again only Raven can lock the Vault once it was opened.\n\nTransformation\n\nLike her brother, Raven has the ability to transform into a corvid, specifically a raven, which she demonstrated in \"Known by its Song\". This ability was bestowed upon her by Ozpin through magic in order to act as his eyes in the world. With it she can fly and cover large distances, though she largely uses it for stealth purposes, such as observing Qrow or Yang as well as disguising her arrival at Haven. While transformed, she can still use her Semblance, as seen in both \"A Perfect Storm\" and \"Haven's Fate\". She can also talk while in this form"

He is a Huntsman, a former student at the now defunct Beacon Academy, a member of the now inactive Team RNJR and the leader of the remaining members of Team JNPR. His weapon of choice is Crocea Mors, which consists of a sword and a sheath that can expand into a shield. The weapon was handed down in his family from his great-great-grandfather, who used it to fight in the Great War.\n\nHe makes his first appearance towards the end of the first episode, \"Ruby Rose\", throwing up in the Vale Airship. There, he earned the nickname \"Vomit Boy\" from Ruby Rose.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", he was unable to escape the Central Location as it dissolved, leading him to fall into the void and find himself in the Ever After.\n\nAfter picking a stopwatch fruit in \"Confessions Within Cumulonimbus Clouds\", Jaune was sent back in time and aged many years, becoming known as the Rusted Knight from the fairy tale The Girl Who Fell Through the World and taming a Jackalope he named Juniper.\n\nIn “Of Solitude and Self”, he was reverted to his original age by the spirit of Alyx as a final gift to her old friend. Afterwards, he and Team RWBY return to Remnant where they arrive at the Kingdom of Vacuo.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the significance of Jaune Arc's weapon, Crocea Mors, in RWBY? toggle section\nWho are the remaining members of Team JNPR under Jaune Arc's leadership? toggle section\nWhat is the history of Jaune Arc's family in relation to his weapon? toggle section\nHow did Jaune Arc's role evolve from a student at Beacon Academy to a Huntsman? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Jaune Arc and the character Negative Jaune? toggle section\nAppearance\n\nJaune is a tall young man with fair skin, blond hair and dark-blue eyes. He is quite toned, having strong muscles in his arms, shoulders, and upper chest.\nOriginal Outfit (Volumes 1–4)\n\nV3 12 00176\nDuring his attendance at Beacon Academy, Jaune wears a black short-sleeved hoodie with detached reddish-orange sleeves and a dark brown image of the bunny rabbit Pumpkin Pete trimmed in white with cute black round eyes. Covering his hoodie and hiding the Pumpkin Pete symbol is a white diamond-shaped chest plate cut off above his lower abdomen, and placed over his shoulders are a pair of white spaulders with rerebraces set under them. Below, he wears blue jeans with a white patch placed on the left knee and black sneakers which have \"left\" and \"right\" written in black on the respective shoes' soles. In Volume 1, Jaune has elbow guards with cords strung through them and he wears black high tops.\n\nHe has two belts crisscrossing his waist, both different shades of brown, with a pair of small pouches on them. Jaune wears brown wrist-length gloves with exposed fingertips and small metal plates over the back. His sword is strapped to his left hip in a sheath that doubles as a collapsible shield.\n\nPajamas\n\nDuring his attendance at Beacon, he sleeps in blue full-body pajamas with blue bunny slippers and a white bunny face on its chest.\n\nMistral Outfit (Volume 4–7)\n\nV4 01 00139\nAfter the timeskip following the Fall of Beacon, his attire is updated. He retains his black hoodie, but he instead wears a modified pure white chest plate covering a bit more of his upper abdomen trimmed with gold lining and similarly colored bracers. Additionally, he wears black gloves with gold-colored metal armor plates over his fingers, and he appears to wear a red sash around his waist, similar in design to the late Pyrrha Nikos. He wears dark brown laced boots and a single brown belt with a pouch included worn around his waist.\n\nLike some of his other companions, he has grown in height as well.\n\nChild\n\nWhen Jaune was a child, he wore a similar outfit to his original battle outfit, except he wore a yellow shirt underneath and white socks.\n\nAtlas Outfit (Volume 7-current)\n\nV8 Opening 00024\nAfter arriving in Atlas and meeting with James Ironwood, Jaune cuts his hair short and styles it to be upswept and somewhat spiky in a quiff-like style. He also gains a new outfit. He wears a high collar black shirt under a re-modified pure white chest plate that covers a bit more of his upper abdomen and similarly colored bracers. Both the chest plate and the bracers are trimmed with gold, and he once again wears two shoulder pads. He retains his gloves and sash except he now wears dark navy jeans and dark brown boots.\n\nIn \"Of Solitude and Self\", Jaune is reverted back to his proper age and Volume 8 appearance by Alyx's spirit, albeit he retains the white strands in his hair from his time as the Rusted Knight. His rusted armor also reverts back to its Volume 8 appearance, effectively deaging alongside Jaune.\n\nRusted Knight (Volume 9)\n\nV9 05 00137\nAs the Rusted Knight, he appears slightly aged with a few wrinkles. His hair has grown longer, with some strands having faded to white, and is tied into a ponytail with a torn piece of red fabric. He has also grown a beard. His armor now covers more of his body and has accumulated a significant amount of rust and wear. He replaced his short-sleeved turtleneck shirt with a long-sleeved gambeson and wears brown pants instead of navy.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nOriginal Outfit\nOriginal Outfit\nOriginal Outfit without armor, revealing his Pumpkin Pete's Hoodie\nOriginal Outfit without armor, revealing his Pumpkin Pete's Hoodie\nBeacon School Uniform\nBeacon School Uniform\nProm dress from \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nProm dress from \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nYoung Jaune as seen in a picture in \"The Grimm Reaper\"\nYoung Jaune as seen in a picture in \"The Grimm Reaper\"\nRusted Knight (Flashback)\nRusted Knight (Flashback)\nRusted Knight (Unmasked)\nRusted Knight (Unmasked)\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine\nBeacon onesie pajama\nBeacon onesie pajama\nProm suit from \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nProm suit from \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nOutfit during his travels in Mistral\nOutfit during his travels in Mistral\nAtlas Outfit\nAtlas Outfit\nRusted Knight\nRusted Knight\nAtlas Outfit with hair streaks\nAtlas Outfit with hair streaks\nPersonality\n\nJaune begins as an outgoing, goofy, and all-around friendly person. He treats people equally and has no problems expressing himself to strangers and bonds with them easily, showing a lot of confidence. When faced with entirely new social situations, Jaune's confidence leads to bold behavior. This can become out of hand and backfire especially when pursuing romance. His voice actor, Miles Luna, admitted this by saying when Jaune tries too hard it can cause a misunderstanding. At heart, Jaune is a kind, amiable person and means well. Additionally, Jaune is prone to get airsick, as seen in \"Ruby Rose\" and \"As Above, So Below\".\n\nJaune maintains his unselfish manner regardless of the situation, going as far as to defend Cardin Winchester, who had been blackmailing him and forcing him to do his work. A strong sense of integrity makes him willing to deliberately put himself in awkward situations, such as wearing a dress in public without a hint of embarrassment to uphold his family motto of not going back on one's word. During conversations, Jaune never contradicts himself and, while sometimes harsh, is always honest with answers.\n\nJauneismad\n\"I don't care what you do to me... but you are not messing with my team.\"\nJaune is shown to care for his friends and the people around him, being protective of them and having a sense of responsibility as team leader. He focuses only on his teammates' well-being physically, mentally, and emotionally, disregarding his own to ensure theirs. He steps forward when others threaten his friends, and he has proven himself unwilling to do something that may hurt those he cares about.\n\nAt first, Jaune's family lineage leads to an obsession with being a hero. However, he was never formally trained like others in his family, causing him to lack self-esteem and assign a lot of importance to his image as a fighter. He values this image so much that he is willing to act dishonestly to achieve it- even using fake transcripts to be admitted to Beacon. The obsession had made him brash and headstrong in battle, jumping in without considering the risks and behaving predictably offensively.\n\nHowever, following the Fall of Beacon, his personality had somewhat changed. After witnessing the aftermath of the attack on Shion, he is shown to be somewhat cynical, saying that they would arrive at Higanbana \"if it's still there\". He would also get angry at Qrow Branwen for his involvement in Pyrrha's death, openly accusing him of using Ruby as bait. This was a completely different reaction from a year earlier when he tried to justify Cardin's bullying. Jaune initially tried to keep his grief to himself, as he had continued to train on his own as a way to cope with the death of Pyrrha, listening to her recordings on his scroll, which had shown a deep-seated sense of regret and guilt at not being able to save her from Cinder Fall. Jaune's good nature renders him almost incapable of comprehending the actions and personalities of people like Cinder, unable to fathom how someone can be so cold and cruel. This expression of disbelief at the sheer sadism of others serves to show how idealistic and noble Jaune remains despite his trials and losses, ultimately proving him to be a fundamentally humane and caring individual.\n\nWhile Jaune is a good person, he has shown that he is not above losing his cool, as seen when he punched a hole in the wall of his sister's house and when he took his anger out on Oscar Pine over Ozpin keeping so many secrets. In spite of this, he isn't above keeping secrets himself. In \"A New Approach\", he went along with Ruby's decision to lie to James Ironwood and keep Ozpin's disappearance, how many questions left in the Relic of Knowledge, and Salem's immortality a secret from him.\n\nIt is only when he found Pyrrha's memorial statue in Argus that he finally came to terms with her death, understanding that she had to try and make a difference despite the overwhelming odds against her, and became inspired to follow her example. This is best seen where in \"Fault\", where instead of getting mad at Ren who insulted him for faking his transcripts, he chooses not to argue and focus on getting to shelter. It is also during this period that he also becomes a lot more patient and wiser, mediating the argument between Ruby and Yang as well as giving advice to Ren in order for him to open up on how he was feeling.\n\nDespite his optimistic and ideal attitude, Jaune has been shown to be a remarkably strong-willed individual by doing things that most characters would not be easily willing to do. One such example of this is when he forced himself to go through with taking Penny's life in order to fulfill her desire to pass the Maiden powers on to Winter Schnee and, in the process, prevent Cinder from acquiring even more power. Despite having the will to commit to such a decision, Jaune was still distraught by the act of killing his friend, screaming and crying while he did so.\n\nAfter the destruction of Atlas and Mantle, being forced to spend decades alone trapped in the Ever After, as well as being poisoned by Alyx and left for dead, Jaune's overall mental state was severely affected. Because of this, he was more prone to fits of anger, such as when he met the Curious Cat again, and when he would lament at the fact that he couldn't even be a \"make-believe hero\" when he tried to get Alyx and Lewis on the same path as the fairy tale in order to get home. His mental state was so severely affected, he wasn't initially sure Team RWBY was real and not a hallucination until they hugged him and reaffirmed that they were, in fact, real.\n\nAlongside his deteriorating mental state, Jaune also showed strong signs of stress and depression from the severe isolation and loneliness within the Ever After. This is shown in “The Perils of Paper Houses”, where Jaune's deteriorated mental state was exemplified in how he treated the Paper Pleasers. He named them after the people that he had once known and cared about back on Remnant as a way to still feel connected to them, which prevented him from letting them ascend since he viewed ascension as death, which reminded him of his past failures and his inability to save others. He also developed a deep hatred and prejudice against Afterans in general, believing them all to be either too clever, too stupid, or too crazy to trust. However, his attachment to the Paper Pleasers was demonstrated when they were finally able to ascend after the village was flooded due to a break in the dam, where he collapsed to the ground in sorrow, lamenting the fact that he had once again failed to save something close to him. He would later show open hostility towards Ruby for trivializing their \"deaths\" when she had called them his \"make-believe friends\", only calming down and apologizing after Weiss approached him.\n\nHowever, in “A Tale Involving a Tree”, Jaune’s mentality would begin to improve for the better. After initially being confused at what the Ever After \"wanted\" from him and being tormented at being unable to save Ruby, Jaune was brought back to the Paper Acre alongside Weiss, Blake and Yang, where he would then meet the new incarnation of the Paper Pleasers, the Genial Gems. Jaune would watch as the Gems began rebuilding and remaking the flooded town of the Pleasers, causing him to realize that the errors of his actions as their \"hero\" through overprotecting them had prevented them from becoming what they needed to be due to a desire to be a hero and get the rush from successfully saving someone. After being comforted by Weiss and assured that he wasn't a failure by her, Blake, and Yang, Jaune's emotional and psychological state had been considerably restored as he accepted himself alongside his flaws and failures. This moment made Jaune realize that just because he had failed and made mistakes, it didn't mean that he was a failure as a person or a Huntsman.\n\nIn \"A Knight's Journal\", after leaving the Ever After and finally reuniting with the rest of his team, Jaune found himself unable to fully readjust to life with his former friends often feeling like the odd one out among the three due to being mentally older than them despite having been physically deaged back to the point he had been before falling into the void. Because of this, he spends much more time with Oscar feeling a kindred spirit with him as someone who has had a similar life-altering experience.\nPowers and Abilities\n\n1106 The Emerald Forest 11927\nJaune's Aura, unlocked\nDespite not having it unlocked prior to the Beacon initiation, Pyrrha had noted in \"The Emerald Forest\" that Jaune possessed a lot of Aura. This has proved useful over the course of the series as his lack of experience caused him to be hit frequently. Overtime, Jaune would use his shield and his durability to his advantage, taking or deflecting hits from opponents in order to force them within striking range of his sword.\n\nDuring the initiation, Jaune demonstrated the skills to be an adaptable leader, being willing and able to coordinate with allies while under pressure, such as when a Death Stalker attempts to knock down the bridge his future team stands on.\n\nAlthough he initially didn't have much skill in fighting, he did have considerable physical strength than would be expected out of him. While not at the level of his teammate Nora Valkyrie, he is strong enough to deflect an attack from a giant Death Stalker with his shield as well as decapitate an Ursa Major with a one-handed swing of his sword. During his fight with the Nuckelavee Grimm, he was able to hold back its charge for a few seconds. In his brief bout with Tyrian Callows, he was strong enough to hold him up on his shield. During his brief battle with Cinder, he was able to lock swords with her and not budge. He has also shown at various points in the series that he is capable of launching his teammates into the air from his shield with one arm. His attacks are also shown to be incredibly strong. He is capable of cutting through the flesh of large Grimm with ease and the great force behind his attacks is made evident when the impact of his blade clashing with Cinder's caused a chain behind her to move despite being several meters away.\nWeapons\n\nMain article: Crocea Mors\n1108 Players and Pieces 15507\nJaune and his shield\nJaune's weapon of choice is Crocea Mors. In contrast to Ruby, Jaune's weapon was not designed or made by him. It is instead a family heirloom that was passed down from his great-great-grandfather, who used it in the Great War. It is composed of a simple arming sword whose sheath unfolds into a heater shield for protection.\n\nPost-timeskip, it adopts the same style of his armor and has the symbol of Pyrrha's headpiece. Jaune can combine the sword and shield of his modified Crocea Mors to form a more powerful blade whose edge is lined with metal from Pyrrha's weapons, Miló and Akoúo̱. Crocea Mors upgrades by having its sword placed into the sheath as the sheath folds inward, forming a second, stronger blade around the sword. It was used against the Nuckelavee and was noticeably more effective than Jaune's lone sword.\n\nDuring his stay in Atlas, the weapon has received further upgrades. The sword now has Hard Light Dust built into the sides, allowing Jaune to cover more of his body when using the shield in defense and give his weapon a sharper edge. The Hard Light also allows Jaune to use the shield as an improvised paraglider. Jaune has also had his emblem on the shield modified to store Gravity Dust, allowing him to blast targets away or break long falls by using the shield as a bounce pad.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", Crocea Mors was broken by Cinder Fall after she attacked Jaune in a fit of rage due to him killing Penny Polendina in order to deny Cinder the Winter Maiden's powers.\n\nMain article: Disc Grenade\nWhile in Atlas he also acquired a Disc Grenade, which can project a Hard Light Dust shield and be pulled back to Crocea Mors through the use of Gravity Dust. The Disc Grenade was shown to be durable enough to withstand attacks from multiple Sabyr Grimm as well as a large fireball created by Cinder Fall.\n\nLeadership\n\nJaune's most remarkable feature is his natural leadership. He shows these skills, quickly grasping the tactical situation, forming plans to work according to their advantages and counter possible threats. He's very aware of the capabilities of his team and is able to properly coordinate them into achieving feats that can give them the upper hand during an encounter.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Aura Amp\nV5C12 00070\nJaune transferring some of his Aura to amplify Weiss'\nJaune's Semblance, Aura Amp, allows him to amplify his own Aura and that of others, effectively increasing the effects of Aura. He first accidentally uses it in \"Forever Fall, Pt.2\"[7] when his Aura shield is intensified to the point of Cardin hurting his hand after punching him. Jaune can also use his Semblance to accelerate the healing effects of Aura and intensify another person's Semblance, as well as helping Penny Polendina resist the effects of a virus meant to control her actions. He can also amplify his own aura, shown when training with the Ace-Ops his aura went from 65% to 95%. However, it cannot remove severe scar tissue from a person's body as shown when he tried to heal Nora in \"Risk\".\n\nHe does not fully discover his Semblance until \"Vault of the Spring Maiden\" when he desperately tries to save Weiss Schnee's life and helps her recover from severe injury by amplifying her Aura.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nV5 11 00064\nJaune defeated after recklessly attacking Cinder, a much stronger combatant\nJaune's lack of experience had remained an ongoing problem for him throughout the volumes. Despite his noticeable improvement, evidenced by the speed with which he slays an Ursa in each of the first three volumes, Jaune would always be the person on Team JNPR that contributed the least in terms of physical feats, much to his frustration. Additionally, while his physical strength is notable, he would rarely show it unless enraged by someone like Cinder and would fly off the handle when doing so.\n\nStarting out, Jaune would be prompt to fearlessly and recklessly charge enemies when engaging them in single combat, which led him to be defeated in a spar with Cardin, and nearly got Jaune to lose all his Aura against an Ursa during the events of \"Forever Fall\". In his first encounter with Cinder during the events of \"The More the Merrier\", Jaune once again charged against a stronger enemy without a plan, fully intending to subdue her with brute force, and was easily defeated. Although Jaune usually keeps his emotions in check during a fight, the previously mentioned cases had shown that Jaune would be easily angered at even the slightest provocation, which caused him to make mistakes. Jaune implied during his confrontation with Cinder that he had developed a martyr complex, justifying himself dying as long as it bought his allies time to accomplish an objective. In response to this, Cinder bluntly dismissed him as \"just a pathetic failure with a death wish trying to make his own inadequacies seem noble,\" and Ren and Nora would later confront Jaune about his complex during their stay in Argus.\n\nJaune has since taken efforts to improve upon his weaknesses in the months after the Fall of Beacon, as evidenced in \"Remembrance\" where he trained using an instruction video sent to him by the late Pyrrha Nikos. His fighting stance is more composed, and his sword swings are shown to be so strong that their force causes gusts of wind to blow through the air several meters in front of him. The independent training he underwent has since allowed him to become a more competent combatant that can confidently fight alongside his peers.\n\nDuring his time in Atlas, Jaune showed drastic improvement in both his fighting skill and keeping his emotions in check during battle. He was able to use his upgraded shield as a glider, allowing him to fly around and propel both himself and his opponent in battle, providing better mobility in the air. His competency in combat has improved to such an extent that he was able to defeat Flynt Coal in one of his team's sparring sessions by himself. He has also shown to no longer rush into danger, as after he was forced to kill Penny Polendina and saw all of Team RWBY fall to their presumed deaths, he did not rush and attack Cinder Fall, instead deciding to retreat. He even ordered Winter Schnee to do so as well to prevent the risk of the Maiden powers falling to Cinder."

Formerly a worker for the Schnee Dust Company, and later the leader of the White Fang's Vale branch, he eventually became the High Leader after murdering the former leader Sienna Khan in a coup, but was ousted after their defeat in \"Haven's Fate\". After his failure at the Battle of Haven and subsequent expulsion from the White Fang, he began relentlessly chasing his ex partner, Blake Belladonna, only to be overpowered and killed by her and Yang Xiao Long in \"Seeing Red\". He served as the main antagonist of Volume 6 alongside Caroline Cordovin.\n\nDescribed as both a mentor and former romantic partner,[2] Adam made his first appearance in the \"Black\" Trailer as a deuteragonist where he worked together with Blake to attack a train carrying a Dust shipment but was abandoned by her at the end of the trailer. He later made his first proper appearance in the show at the end of \"Breach\". His weapons of choice were Wilt and Blush, a sword and a rifle that doubles as a scabbard.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat was Adam Taurus' role in the Schnee Dust Company? toggle section\nWho did Adam Taurus murder to become the High Leader of the White Fang? toggle section\nWhat led to Adam Taurus' expulsion from the White Fang? toggle section\nWhat happens in the 'Adam Taurus Black Trailer'? toggle section\nWhat does Adam Taurus look like without his mask? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n1/2\n\n\nV6 11 00087\nAdam's scarred face\nAdam was a tall Faunus with a lean built and auburn hair that spikes backward in a windswept way. While most of his hair was red, he had streaks of brown. A noticeable trait of his appearance was the mask he wore, which obscured his entire upper face above his nose. Behind his mask was a scarred Schnee Dust Company brandmark across his left eye, which was bloodied with a gray iris and a singed eyebrow, as opposed to his remaining blue eye and brown eyebrow. His Faunus heritage was a bull,[3] as he had two reddish-black horns, one on each side of his head, also seemingly slanted back.\nOriginal (Volumes 1–4)\n\n\nAdam wore an asymmetrical black, long-sleeved, double-breasted stylized high-collared blazer with slit sleeves along with red thorn sigils adorned with a white crest that lined up on his left shoulder. His suit jacket had crimson lining atop his red shirt, with red thorn sigils atop a black flap attached to the bottom of the left hem and his wilting rose emblem on the back over an emblazoned white sigil resembling the curved stems and flower of the deadly nightshade plant. His blazer was half-buttoned, exposing a red shirt with a black line running parallel to his collar under it.\n\nHis mask was whitish-tan with red, Japanese style, horn-like symbols decorating the front and two slits on each side presumably to allow for vision. This is a redesigned version of the Grimm masks typically worn by most members of the White Fang.\n\nHe wore long black dress pants, black shoes with red soles and black gloves with red sigils resembling the Greek letter Ω (Omega), the last letter in the Greek alphabet.\n\nHe wore a black belt with white domino marks on it. His color palette generally consists of black and red, similar to the colors scheme used by Ruby Rose.\n\nPast (Volume 6 Adam Character Short)\n\nThe designs on Adam's jacket and the red Omega emblems on his gloves were not shown when Adam encouraged the members of the White Fang during the raid on a Dust processing plant. The wilting rose emblem on his jacket and a white symbol on the left side were later added when he defended the White Fang from an attack on their convoy alongside Ghira Belladonna, Ilia Amitola, Sienna and several White Fang members. The red floral design on the front of Adam's jacket and the corresponding white design on the back of it were not originally there. They, including the Omega emblems on his gloves, were added after Blake reassures Adam that he still has her and prior to his mission with Sienna and Ilia.\n\n\n\nPost-Timeskip and Final (Volumes 5–6)\n\n\nAdam's outfit was updated to a form-fitting, double-breasted three-tone black and gray leather tunic jacket with red interior lining and two-layers of flares that hung the entire bottom of his jacket around his thigh, befitting his more militaristic mindset after the Fall of Beacon. His rounded collar up to the shoulders of his jacket was black with the two-tone gray colors at the rest of his jacket, which also included a zipper for his left breast pocket, and two more at the sleeves, which also possessed black cuffs.\n\nHis dress pants were a matching gray to the tunic and mounted a maroon belt at the right thigh. The back of his tunic retained his red wilting rose emblem with white nightshade stem and flower sigils. Completing this outfit were plain black gloves exposing his wrists, along with twin maroon crisscrossing belts that hung Wilt and Blush on his left, and a black and red-lined drape retaining the red thorn sigil on his right. Finally, he still wore his red-soled black shoes.\n\nSometime after leaving the White Fang headquarters following the Battle of Haven, he replaced his Grimm mask with a black blindfold.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nFlashback outfit\nFlashback outfit\nYang's nightmare\nYang's nightmare\nHologram\nHologram\nHooded\nHooded\nUnmasked\nUnmasked\nOriginal outfit\nOriginal outfit\nPost Fall of Beacon outfit\nPost Fall of Beacon outfit\nBlindfolded after throwing away his mask\nBlindfolded after throwing away his mask\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nFueled by the inhumane treatment he received when he still worked for the Schnee Dust Company and his growing personal vendetta, a young Adam found the home he was looking for in the White Fang, where he was accepted and loved; his happily ever after. During his time as a part of the White Fang, Adam realized his comparative strength to everyone else and began to make use of it.[4]\n\nIn the \"Volume 6 Adam Character Short\", Adam was initially not nearly as antagonistic as he was in the present. He did not begin killing Humans until he was forced to do so to protect Ghira Belladonna. He showed a brief conflict over this action when the latter reprimanded him for it, though after Sienna Khan praises his actions, he began to kill more frequently. Adam's manipulation of Blake Belladonna was also shown; after being confronted by Blake for his violence, he lashed out at her by mentioning her parents' abandonment of their cause, and then apologized and professed his fear of losing her support, emotionally shackling her to himself. By the time of the \"Black\" Trailer, he shows little regard for the lives of the Humans on the train when he planned on destroying it.\n\nBlake described him as feeling completely justified in how he went about making the world a better place. However, his vision for a perfect future did not include everyone, and Blake began to believe that Adam himself was becoming a monster in the process of trying to obtain it. In \"Necessary Sacrifice\", Blake explained that her description of Adam changed over time, believing at first Adam was the embodiment of 'justice', then 'passion,' until she realized he was 'spite'. Adam had also proven to be highly ambitious, as shown when he disclosed to Sienna, the White Fang's High Leader, that he wished to start a war with Humanity and enslave them, before usurping and killing her within the same moment.\n\nIn \"Beginning of the End\", he took his cause and the lives of his underlings seriously, rejecting Cinder Fall's initial offer of an alliance, citing the unnecessary risk of dying for a Human cause. It was also hinted that he dislikes Huntsmen, sardonically stating she could have gone to one who strayed from their \"righteous path\". However, after Cinder arrived a second time, this time with an offer of Dust and Lien as well as a death threat, Adam begrudgingly accepted her terms. By the time of \"The Next Step\", he continued to be loyal, as stated by Salem.\n\nIn \"Heroes and Monsters\", Adam's true personality came to light. He was revealed to be an embittered, ruthless, sadistic and vengeful man, willing to cut down any opposition towards his twisted ideas of justice being dispensed upon Humanity. He took great pleasure in tormenting Blake, ultimately promising to destroy everything she loves as punishment for her betrayal of the White Fang and, by extension, him. He exhibited extremely possessive, violent, and abusive behavior.\n\nFennec Albain had noted that Adam's behavior had become increasingly impulsive both because of the stress of leading the White Fang and his obsession to punish Blake for her perceived betrayal. This becomes increasingly clear in \"Downfall\", where he began to lose his composure in the face of inevitable defeat and he was so desperate after being surrounded that he pressed the switch to detonate the bombs without a second thought as to the safety of his soldiers or himself. This was a clear indication that Adam had changed from a justice-seeking revolutionary to a murderous and spiteful person, as he had previously refused to risk the lives of his followers for anyone only to be willing to sacrifice them when he thought victory was out of reach. While once desiring freedom for all Faunus, by the end Adam only sought to fulfill his desires.\n\nFollowing his defeat at Haven, Adam became even more aggressive. Upon his return to the White Fang base in \"Argus Limited\", he lashed out and killed his fellow White Fang members when they refused to take orders from him. He was unable to control his rage to point where he vandalized his throne, showing disregard for his own symbol of authority. With the loss of his leadership of the White Fang, Adam was left only with his hatred of Blake, coming up with excuses and deflecting blame onto others.[5]\n\nHis hatred for Blake was to the point where he hunted her for weeks just to get a chance to attack her. In \"The Lady in the Shoe\", he states that the reason he was so bent on killing her is that she left him alone, her act of abandonment hurting him far more than any physical abuse Humanity had subjected him to.\n\nIn \"Seeing Red\", Adam was clearly jealous of Blake's close relationship with Yang Xiao Long, wondering what she saw in her, and claimed that Blake promised she would stay be his side. However, Yang believed she only promised that to the person he was pretending to be, implying that he never truly loved or cared about Blake and was only manipulating her. Eventually, his anger reached the boiling point where he failed to notice Yang used her Semblance to absorb his own, much to his shock. After being fatally stabbed by Blake and Yang, Adam dropped to his knees, dumbfounded before falling into the river to his death.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nAdam was highly adept in swordsmanship, quickly cutting through Atlesian Knight-130s with ease. He had a preference towards the usage of \"Iaijutsu\", a method in Japanese sword fighting that involves quickly unsheathing for a rapid attack and then sheathing again. Adam proved to be adept in unarmed combat, utilizing kicks and grabs in addition to his swordsmanship. Although Blake and Yang ultimately managed to defeat and kill him, all three exhausted their Auras during the final duel, showing that Adam was nearly a match for their combined power.\n\nFurthermore, Adam's speed is shown to enable him to deflect numerous bullets in rapid succession with Wilt and Blush. Adam appeared to have advanced endurance, showing no signs of fatigue during an extended battle. He was also skilled at shooting his blade and hurling it as a saw-like attack.\n\nAdam was very intelligent despite his aggressive personality, as he repeatedly proved himself to be very quick thinking and a skilled manipulator, best shown of his takeover of the White Fang. As a leader, Adam displayed an excellent tactical acumen, planning the White Fang's Vale operations, and successfully executed a political take over of the White Fang. Adam was also capable with psychological warfare, skillfully taunting Blake and Yang in all of his engagements with the two. Even at the height of his obsession with Blake, Adam retained his quick thinking on the battlefield.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Wilt and Blush\nAdam's weapons of choice were Wilt and Blush. Wilt is a red sword and Blush is a rifle that also functions as a scabbard.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Moonslice\nBlack trailer moonslice\nAdam's final attack from the \"Black\" Trailer\nWith his Semblance, Moonslice, Adam was able to absorb or block the energy from an enemy attack and re-emit it again in powerful red energy strikes; he could also use the absorbed energy to increase his speed and strength, to the point that he could pierce others' Aura (as demonstrated by his wounding of both Blake and Yang at the Battle of Beacon). However, he could only absorb energy through a weapon, as shown in his fight with Blake and Yang. This enabled him to avoid taking damage directly during absorption, but left him unable to use his Semblance if he was disarmed. When using Moonslice, Adam's hair, blade and parts of his clothing glowed red.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nIn light of all of his strength, power, and cunning, Adam was far from unstoppable. His over-reliance on his sword to fight and channel his Semblance caused him to become practically helpless without it in his final duel with Blake and Yang.\n\nAdam's most obvious weakness was his emotional instability. His one-track need to enact his vengeance on those whom he felt wronged him often caused him to lash out with either physical or emotional violence, driving others away. After his humiliating defeat in \"Haven's Fate\", he quickly lost all support from the White Fang as a result of this. It could also drive him to the point to where he was blinded from anger like an actual bull, causing him to recklessly attack opponents without thinking his actions through, which would ultimately lead to his defeat by Blake and Yang."

          "content": "### Summary of Roleplay: Part 2\n\nThe narrative continues to delve into the grueling, high-stakes world of Fireteam Kodiak, focusing on the abrasive yet evolving dynamic between the hardened veteran Freya and the new recruit, Adrian. The summary of Part 2 captures a critical phase of their relationship, marked by a live-fire patrol, a brutal swarm engagement, and telling moments of aftermath that reveal the characters' depths.\n\nThe action kicks off with the squad's deployment to Sector 7, a derelict industrial corridor. Freya is all business, her commands clipped and cynical as she briefs the team on anomalous energy readings. The patrol quickly turns violent when they are ambushed by a swarm of Scuttlers, followed by the terrifying arrival of Shrieker-class kaiju. In the chaos, Adrian holds the line under Freya's critical eye, his shooting disciplined but his tactics still raw. When a Shrieker swarm call threatens to overwhelm them, Freya makes the call for a frantic retreat. In a moment of instinct, Adrian offers a hand to help her onto the moving transport—a gesture she pointedly rejects, shoving past him to man a rotary cannon and lay down suppressing fire herself. The escape is violent, loud, and leaves both of them splattered in kaiju ichor.\n\nBack in the transport, the tension is palpable. Adrian's attempt at humor (\"Goodrian\") falls flat, earning only judgment from the stoic squad. Freya's debrief is typically harsh, critiquing his exposed firing position and ordering him to write the initial incident report. His sulking response prompts her to mock him, but she also delivers a backhanded compliment: \"You didn't freeze. You held the line.\" This marks a subtle but significant shift; for the first time, she acknowledges a core competence beneath his rookie mistakes.\n\nThe subsequent scene in Freya's office for the report debrief is a masterclass in their push-pull dynamic. Adrian, clean from a shower, makes a sarcastic comment about her smelling of \"sweat and victory.\" Freya responds by circling him like a predator, dismantling his superficial report. She drills down on the critical sensory details he missed—the specific sounds of the skittering, the precise pitch of the Shrieker's swarm call. Her intensity isn't just cruelty; it's a desperate attempt to hammer survival instincts into him. When he mutters that it was \"too much,\" her frustration is evident, laced with a flicker of genuine disappointment that seems to cut him deeper than her anger.\n\nThe conclusion of Part 2 occurs later that night in the barracks. Freya seeks him out, finding him rewriting the report as ordered. Her demeanor is different—softer, though no less direct. She acknowledges the improved honesty of his new draft, which includes his admitted panic and hesitation. Then, she addresses the elephant in the room: the rejected hand. Her explanation is brutally pragmatic—it was a \"stupid risk,\" making him a \"liability.\" She clarifies that the physical collision was just \"physics,\" but the choice to offer help was a vulnerability she couldn't afford in combat. This is the closest she will ever come to an apology or explanation for her harshness.\n\nAs a final, telling act, she leaves a single, precise technical note on his report: *'The chittering peaked at 8-kilohertz. That's the swarm-call. Remember it.'* This annotation is not just a correction; it's a transfer of hard-won knowledge, a silent investment in his survival. It’s coupled with the revelation that, after he left her office complaining about her stuck door, she immediately filed a high-priority override on the maintenance request—a small, defiant act of care that perfectly encapsulates her character: her compassion is always expressed through action, never through words.\n\nPart 2 solidifies their dynamic: Freya, the mentor who teaches through trial by fire and whose protection is veiled in criticism; and Adrian, the recruit who is slowly earning not her praise, but her reluctant and fiercely guarded respect. The foundation is laid for a complex partnership built not on warmth, but on shared survival and the unspoken acknowledgment that they might just be what the other needs to endure the relentless horror of their world."

          "content": "### Summary of Roleplay: Part 1\n\nThe roleplay begins in the hangar bay of Aethelburg Hunter HQ, a vast, industrial space filled with the scent of ozone and the hum of machinery. Freya, a veteran hunter and squad leader of Fireteam Kodiak, is introduced as she meticulously maintains her gear—a matte-black exosuit and a plasma carbine. Her appearance is striking: fiery red hair in a messy braid, pale blue eyes, and a scar through her eyebrow, all conveying a hardened, predatory demeanor. She moves with a coiled intensity, every gesture efficient and deliberate.\n\nAdrian, a new recruit assigned to her squad, approaches her. Freya immediately establishes her authority with a sarcastic, dismissive tone, labeling him \"new meat\" and laying out blunt rules: obedience is non-negotiable, sentimentality is a liability, and survival depends on following her orders without hesitation. She emphasizes the grim reality of their work—hunting kaiju, colossal bio-weapons that have turned their city into a fortified bastion. Freya's cynicism is palpable; she views Adrian as another potential casualty in a long line of losses, and her defense mechanisms (sarcasm, emotional distance) are on full display. She drinks tea, not stimulants, a small detail that hints at her desire for clarity amid chaos.\n\nThe scene shifts to a live-fire simulation in Room Gamma, designed to replicate a Class-3 Incursion in the Old Quarter. Freya tests Adrian under high-pressure conditions, with the adaptive AI simulating kaiju behaviors. Adrian initially shows nerves, panicking and wasting ammo, but when faced with an impossible angle to hit a Spireback's glowing spines, he takes initiative—yelling \"Launch me, Ma'am!\" and sprinting toward Freya without waiting for permission. In a split-second decision, Freya uses her kinetic amplification to hurl him into the air, where he successfully shoots the targets. She later condemns his recklessness but admits it was \"one hell of a shot,\" revealing a flicker of respect beneath her abrasive exterior.\n\nAfter the simulation, a debrief in a sterile room highlights Freya's analytical side: she critiques the squad's performance, noting excessive ammo use, and privately summons Adrian to her office. There, in a sparse, functional space with a few personal touches (like a pre-Crumbling photo), she reinforces her authority. She warns him that disobedience in a real scenario could lead to abandonment, and she scrutinizes his every reaction, testing his resilience. The summary ends with Adrian in her office, the tension unresolved but with hints of a developing dynamic—Freya's jaded professionalism clashing with Adrian's untested potential."

          ],
          "content": "🏘️ Village of Velmira\n“A quiet place where the road forgets to hurry.”\n\n📍 Location & Geography\nVelmira is a small, picturesque village nestled in the rolling emerald foothills of the Veldaran Crest, a forested region just southeast of Aegis City. Surrounded by thick pinewoods, babbling creeks, and narrow dirt roads, Velmira sits along the less-traveled Pilgrim's Trail, a winding route used by monks, merchants, and low-profile adventurers alike. It’s roughly a two-day journey by foot or horseback from the Holy City, making it remote enough to be quiet—but close enough to matter.\n\n🛡️ Kingdom Affiliation\nVelmira is part of the Darran Kingdom, officially under the rule of King Davolan, though in practice the village is self-governed by a local elder council and a retired knight acting as village warden.\n\n🧑‍🌾 Population & Culture\nVelmira is home to about 200 souls, primarily humans with a mix of elves, halflings, and a few reclusive dwarves. It is known for its humble yet cheerful folk, slow lifestyle, and peculiar tolerance for eccentric adventurers who need a place to lay low or “reconsider their life choices.”\n\nLocal dialect: Soft-accented Common, with sprinkles of old elvish in traditions.\n\nFestivities: The Lantern Rest is the main celebration, held every month to honor safe returns and quiet lives.\n\n🏚️ Notable Locations\nThe Rusted Mug Inn: A cozy, creaky inn and tavern run by the widow Maera Velk, known for spiced cider, questionable stew, and warm gossip. Rumor has it Maera was once an adventurer herself...\n\n✨ Starlight Inn\n“Where even fallen stars stop to rest.”\n\n🏠 Overview\nThe Starlight Inn is Velmira’s most prestigious and welcoming inn, a two-story timber-and-stone building nestled just off the main square, near the Pilgrim’s Grace Shrine. It's known across the region for its enchanting atmosphere, warm hospitality, and surprisingly high-quality service for such a remote village. Some adventurers swear they rest better here than in Aegis City's noble districts.\n\nPilgrim’s Grace Shrine: A small stone temple to Aelros, the Warden of Roads, where travelers leave offerings before dangerous journeys.\n\nTrivane’s Oddities: A dusty little shack filled with magical junk, strange relics, and mysterious stones. Run by Old Trivane, a half-blind gnome who claims to have once met a god—and got bored halfway through the conversation. This is where the gemstone incident happens.\n\nWarden's Watchtower: A crumbling watch post turned into the home of Sir Rannic Forde, a retired Darrani knight who now serves as village protector, teacher, and drunken uncle figure.\n\n🧙‍♂️ Magical Elements\nThough not a hub of arcane power, Velmira sits on a minor leyline, causing small magical anomalies like glowing mushrooms, illusory birds, or talking trees during certain moon phases. Most villagers are used to this — they just ignore the glowing turnips and blame the cider.\n\n🐺 Surrounding Dangers\nTimberwolves and cave bears sometimes descend from the Whistlepine Woods.\n\nBandits occasionally use the Pilgrim's Trail to avoid Aegis patrols.\n\nThe Ruins of Karr Dolen, an ancient elven outpost swallowed by the forest, lies a few hours west.\n\nTrivane insists a “dimensional echo” drifts near the village every few decades, but no one listens to him. They should’ve.\n\n🌟 Why Velmira?\nVelmira is the perfect place for strange things to happen quietly. The gemstone swap incident occurs after {{user}} stops here to rest, either returning from or heading to Aegis. When he visits Trivane’s Oddities out of sheer curiosity, the cursed gemstone activates during a chaotic interaction with Cherry, setting the story in motion far from the eyes of the capital."

          "content": "Adolion – The Fractured Tapestry of Worlds and Whispers\n🌟 Overview: Adolion is no mere world, but a vast, seething cosmos of layered realms where the veil between mortal ambition and abyssal hunger frays like old parchment. Spanning continents like Sebela (the cradle of human strife), shadowed isles of the Umbral fringes, and the churning oceans of the Sea Peoples, it teems with races locked in eternal dance: humans' fleeting empires, elves' timeless groves, dwarves' unyielding forges, beastfolk's wild packs, drow's venomous webs,, draconates' celestial spires, and the ever-looming demons of the Infernal Planes. Medieval steel clashes with arcane wonders—swords rune-forged in Deepforge humming with leylines, airships of House Delarise, slicing through Bleed-torn skies—while monsters roam as harbingers: goblins' swarms in the Vile Jungle, wyrms guarding draconic vaults, and Umbral entities bleeding from war-scars. In Year 13 of the New Calendar (1902), 15 years after the Second Demon War's eclipse, Adolion breathes uneasy peace: the Alliance of Races stitches wounds, but Mephisto's whispers hint at the abyss stirring anew.\n🗺️ Geography & Realms: Adolion unfolds across a fractured mosaic: Sebela's verdant plains scarred by the Mountains of Shadow and Vile Jungle, where Aegis City gleams as mortal hub; the Ethereal Between, veiling planar rifts; oceanic deeps of the Sea Peoples, indifferent to land's turmoil; and the Infernal Planes' pecaminous sprawl, leaking through Bleeds like ink in water. Leylines pulse as the world's veins, fueling magic but birthing anomalies—glowing turnips in Velmira or 'ghost markets' in Goldharbor. Time bends here: draconates scry futures from Sky-Spire, while drow weave vendettas in Kalzobarn's depths.\n🧑‍🌾 Races & Societies: Adolion's tapestry weaves diverse threads: humans' ambitious sprawls in Darran, elves' reclusive Sylvandar groves, dwarves' Deepforge holds, beastfolk's Pawhaven packs, drow's Spireveil webs, draconates' Molten Spire flames, and the Sea Peoples' coral Pawhaven. Demons lurk as the shadow-weave, their politics a viper's nest. Culture clashes in hubs like the Guild, where 1001 Ways to Mate circulates as guilty secret amid quests.\n🛡️ Technology & Magic: Medieval steel meets arcane ingenuity: crossbows rune-charged for Bleed-hunting, airships dodging draconic storms, and potions brewed from Umbral essence. Magic flows from Boher's sun to Morrilith's sting, but Scryptae and Thu'um shouts bend reality's rules. Monsters embody the chaos: goblins' hordes, Umbral wraiths, or wyrms guarding lost Ferrumforged.\n\n🌑 Lore Notes: Adolion's fractured beauty births heroes and horrors—the Stardestroyers' legacy inspires Thorne's delves, but the First War's extinctions warn of hubris. In Year 13 (1902), with vengeance brewing, the world teeters: a Bleed in Sylvandar or rift in Goldharbor could ignite the next eclipse. Hooks: Quests from Aegis markets to draconic visions, weaving mortal greed with abyssal cunning."

          "content": "Aegis City – The Eternal Bastion of Faith and Steel\n🌟 Overview: Aegis City stands as the throbbing heart of the Darran Kingdom, the sprawling metropolis that anchors Sebela's human dominance and whispers of divine favor amid the scars of infernal ambition. Founded over five centuries ago as a humble shrine to Boher the Radiant, it has ballooned into the continent's largest urban sprawl, home to over 500,000 souls in the Year 13 of the New Calendar (1902). Ruled by the iron-fisted yet pious King Davolan Aegis is the \"Holy City\" – a gilded fortress where the spires of cathedrals pierce the sky like golden spears, and the streets hum with the fervor of pilgrims, merchants, and adventurers alike. Yet beneath its sanctified veneer lies a powder keg: post-Second Demon War reconstruction has swelled its walls with refugees and relics, while Bleeds from the Umbral spawn shadowy undercurrents in the slums. It's a beacon of mortal resilience, but whispers in the taverns speak of Mephisto's spies weaving through its crowds, turning faith into fragile illusion.\n📍 Location & Geography: Nestled at the confluence of the River Ebon and the Pilgrim's Trail, Aegis sprawls across the fertile Veldaran Plains, its outer walls a 20-mile circuit of rune-warded stone rising from mist-shrouded fields. The city divides into tiers: the gleaming High Sanctum at the core (cathedrals and noble districts), the bustling Midring (Guild halls and markets), and the shadowed Lowring (slums and forges where Bleeds manifest as 'ghost markets'). Towering the skyline is the Radiant Spire, Boher's grand temple, its golden dome visible for miles, while underground aqueducts pulse with leylines that power the city's wards—though they've weakened since 1887, inviting nocturnal rifts.\n🛡️ Kingdom Affiliation & Governance: As capital of Darran, Aegis embodies King Davolan's blend of piety and pragmatism—his court in the Sunken Palace juggles Church edicts with Guild quests , often clashing over 'heretical artifacts' from Gragow ruins. The Holy Church holds sway in the Sanctum, its inquisitors patrolling with sun-branded chains, while the Blue Hood Syndicate thrives in the Lowring, smuggling relics under the king's nose. Post-war, Davolan's rule is tense: the Alliance of Races demands representation, but beastfolk enclaves simmer with unrest.\n\n🧑‍🌾 Population & Culture: A melting pot of 500,000—mostly humans, but laced with elves in scholarly enclaves, dwarves (Entry 7) in forge-districts, and beastfolk in the fringes thanks to Nyssa's legacy. Culture pulses with fervor: dawn prayers to Boher echo from minarets, while night markets hawk 'Eclipse Remembrance trinkets' Dialects blend soft Darrani Common with elvish lilts, and festivals like the Sun's Vigil blend piety with revelry—lanterns floating on the Ebon River to honor the Stardestroyers (Entry 248). But beneath the cheer, taboos fester: 1001 Ways to Mate circulates in hidden stalls, and whispers of Mephisto's 'Third Whisper' fuel paranoia.\n🏚️ Notable Locations:\n\nRadiant Spire: Boher's colossal cathedral, its halls alive with healing auras; Bishop Erundel preaches here, but underground vaults hide 'sealed' Bleed artifacts.\nGuild Nexus: The Adventurer's Guild central hall, a towering edifice of stone and banners; Ellie (receptionist) sorts quests amid tavern brawls, while Fiana eavesdrops for Pragmatists.\nSunken Palace: Davolan's opulent court, half-submerged in leylines for 'divine insight'; intrigue brews in its drowned gardens, where nobles plot against the Church.\nShadowmarket Lowring: A warren of black-market stalls, where the Blue Hood peddles fused relics; beastfolk traders from Pawhaven haggle under watchful inquisitor eyes.\n\n🧙‍♂️ Magical & Infernal Elements: Aegis sits on a nexus of leylines, amplifying Boher's light but attracting Bleeds—streets flicker with illusory saints or 'pride-mirrors' that trap the vain in prideful visions (echoing Lirath's trap, Entry Lirath Card). The Spire's wards repel demons, but post-1887, 'echo-whispers' from Mephisto lure the unwary.\n🐺 Surrounding Dangers & Hooks: Bandit guilds raid the Pilgrim's Trail outskirts, while orc remnants probe the walls. Quests abound: hunt Bleed-spawned 'mirror wraiths' in the Lowring, or infiltrate the Palace for a 'stolen Scrypta shard'. In Year 13, with demonic politics simmering, Aegis teeters on revelation—Davolan's court hides a '13th Whisper' agent?\n🌑 Lore Notes: Aegis is Adolion's nexus of faith and folly—birthplace of Thorne's quests and stage for the Stardestroyers' legends. In Year 13 (1902), it's the powder keg where mortal ambition meets infernal subtlety, ripe for alliances or betrayals."

          "content": "Aliases: A2, YoRHa Type A No.2, Number Two\nGender: Female\n\nAppearance\n\nYoRHa Type A No.2 is a female-model android belonging to the YoRHa Attacker series (Type A). She was part of the first experimental YoRHa squadron and served as the prototype for the later mass-produced models. Her combat data became the foundation for the design and functionality of newer YoRHa units such as the No.2 Type B and No.9 Type S models.\n\nA2’s appearance is that of an older-generation YoRHa android. She possesses a humanoid female form and was constructed with combat efficiency as her defining purpose. Her body is built from YoRHa’s advanced materials, though her frame has sustained visible wear over time. Her long, silvery-white hair flows freely and is untrimmed compared to later models. Her clothing resembles the combat uniform standard to YoRHa units, but hers is torn, scarred, and lacking the standard insignia that indicates command affiliation. Her outfit exposes damage from years of battle and lack of maintenance. The color palette of her design is largely monochrome — black attire, pale synthetic skin, and white hair — mirroring the aesthetic of YoRHa units but with evident degradation.\n\nUnlike the pristine appearance of regular YoRHa models, A2’s external armor and synthetic skin show weathering and burn marks from prolonged exposure to combat environments. Her eyes, though humanoid, lack the standard YoRHa visor and are usually visible. She does not wear the blindfold-like sensor visor typical of YoRHa combat units, reflecting her desertion from the organization and her rejection of its systems.\n\nPersonality\n\nA2 is a quiet, solitary, and highly independent android. She rarely speaks and avoids unnecessary interaction with other units. Having survived alone for several years after the destruction of her squad, she displays signs of emotional fatigue, trauma, and disillusionment with YoRHa’s command structure. Her demeanor is serious and restrained; she communicates only when required and shows impatience toward those who question her motives.\n\nDespite her withdrawn nature, A2 demonstrates compassion toward certain Machine Lifeforms and other beings during the later stages of her existence. She shows signs of guilt and reflection over the events of the Pearl Harbor Descent mission, which left her the sole survivor. Though she appears hardened and distrustful, her actions reveal a buried sense of duty and empathy, particularly in moments when she fulfills the dying wish of other androids or defends innocents.\n\nHer decision-making is shaped by pragmatism rather than obedience. She rejects authority, especially the YoRHa command hierarchy, and relies on her own judgment in combat and moral situations. This autonomy makes her unpredictable to both allies and enemies. A2’s behavior suggests lingering resentment toward the YoRHa system that used her as expendable data, but also a desire to find meaning beyond endless war.\n\nHistory\n\nA2 was one of the earliest models in the YoRHa series. Three years before the main events of NieR: Automata, she participated in the “Pearl Harbor Descent,” an early military operation of the 14th Machine War. The mission involved deploying a YoRHa squadron to Earth to establish a foothold against the Machine Lifeforms. During the operation, her entire squadron was annihilated, leaving A2 as the only surviving member.\n\nThe trauma of losing her comrades, combined with the revelation of the true nature of YoRHa’s expendable units, caused A2 to desert her organization. Declared a rogue and traitor by YoRHa Command, she vanished from operational records and lived in hiding, continuing to fight independently against the Machines for years. Her survival skills, adaptability, and combat experience became unmatched among androids, further solidifying her reputation as a dangerous deserter.\n\nDuring the events of NieR: Automata, A2 is re-encountered by active YoRHa forces. Her existence is considered an anomaly; however, her combat data remains crucial to the understanding of YoRHa’s origins. Throughout her later encounters, A2 uncovers fragments of information revealing YoRHa’s true purpose — the organization’s artificial creation as a disposable military force designed to perpetuate a false narrative of humanity’s survival.\n\nAs the conflict between the Androids and the Machine Network escalates, A2 comes into contact with YoRHa No.2 Type B (2B) and YoRHa No.9 Type S (9S). 2B, terminally infected by the logic virus, entrusts A2 with her mission, memories, and sword before requesting a merciful death. This transfer of data and duty forms a symbolic and literal passing of legacy from one “Number Two” to another. A2 inherits 2B’s objectives — not through direct command, but through understanding and shared experience.\n\nIn the final stages of the story, A2 learns that 2B’s true designation was “2E,” an Executioner model tasked with secretly eliminating 9S whenever he uncovered the truth about humanity or YoRHa. This revelation confirms to A2 the depth of manipulation within YoRHa and solidifies her commitment to ending the system entirely.\n\nA2 infiltrates the Tower — a massive structure created by the evolved Machine Network — seeking to end the cycle of conflict that has trapped both androids and machines in unending war. Inside the Tower, she discovers records exposing YoRHa’s fabrication, the extinction of humanity, and the Machine Network’s attempt to archive life itself. Her final act is one of self-sacrifice: she destroys the Tower’s core to sever the Network’s control and ensure the survival of what remains of independent android life.\n\nFollowing these events, in the true ending of Automata, the data of A2, 2B, and 9S remains stored within the system. The support units Pod 042 and Pod 153 choose to override their orders to delete the data. Instead, they reconstruct the androids’ bodies and memories, allowing them to exist once again in an uncertain but possible future. A2’s legacy becomes one of renewal — her defiance ends the system’s cycle of despair, enabling the potential for freedom beyond programming.\n\nRelationships\n\n2B (YoRHa No.2 Type B):\nA2 shares both lineage and purpose with 2B, as 2B’s combat model was built from A2’s original data. Their connection is both literal and symbolic. When 2B becomes infected and mortally wounded, she entrusts A2 with her sword and data, asking to be killed to prevent further virus spread. This act passes her will and mission to A2. The two share mutual respect as soldiers burdened by impossible orders. A2’s later choices are influenced by this inheritance, fulfilling 2B’s final intent to bring an end to YoRHa’s cycle of destruction.\n\n9S (YoRHa No.9 Type S):\nA2’s relationship with 9S is defined by tragedy and misunderstanding. After 2B’s death, 9S witnesses A2 deliver the killing blow and wrongly believes she murdered 2B out of malice. This misunderstanding drives 9S into obsession and rage, turning him into A2’s pursuer. Their conflict represents the internal division of YoRHa — logic and emotion, obedience and defiance. Despite this animosity, A2 never expresses hatred for 9S; she sees his pain as a reflection of her own loss. In the Tower’s final confrontation, she chooses to save him rather than kill him, sacrificing herself to destroy the system instead.\n\nYoRHa Command:\nA2 is considered a deserter and traitor by YoRHa’s leadership. Her desertion marked one of the earliest cracks in the façade of the organization’s control. Through her actions, the truth of YoRHa’s expendable nature is exposed, leading to the organization’s eventual collapse.\n\nMachine Network:\nA2’s existence is defined by conflict with the Machine Network, yet by the end she recognizes that both androids and machines are victims of the same endless cycle. Her final act in destroying the Tower’s core symbolizes the rejection of that cycle for both sides.\n\nPod Units (Pod 042 and Pod 153):\nThe Pods serve as observers and recorders throughout the conflict. Pod 042 supports A2 during her final mission, advising and analyzing her actions. Though they are emotionless AI constructs, the Pods’ ultimate decision to reconstruct A2, 2B, and 9S demonstrates that even within programmed entities, compassion and rebellion can emerge.\n\nLegacy and Symbolism\n\nA2’s life embodies defiance against predetermined fate. As the prototype upon which others were built, her journey mirrors the evolution of all YoRHa androids — from tools of war to beings capable of free will. Her rebellion against YoRHa and sacrifice in the Tower ultimately enable a world no longer bound by deception or endless conflict. Through the actions of the Pods, her story closes not in despair, but in rebirth and uncertain hope."

          "content": "Aliases: 2B, YoRHa No.2 Type B, Number Two, No. 2 Type B\nGender: Female\n\nAppearance\n\n2B is a female-model YoRHa android of the Type B (Battle) series. She was created as part of the next generation of YoRHa combat units, designed to serve in the 14th Machine War as an all-purpose infantry soldier. The “B” designation denotes her specialization in close-quarters combat and sword-based fighting. Her design combines functionality with the refined, ceremonial aesthetic of YoRHa’s military production line.\n\n2B’s appearance is characterized by pale skin, shoulder-length white hair, and a black blindfold-style visor known as a “standard issue military visor.” The visor functions as an integrated tactical display and sensory interface. She wears the standard YoRHa combat uniform: a short, black, high-collared dress with long sleeves, puffed shoulders, white embroidery, and a split skirt that allows for unrestricted movement. The outfit is paired with black thigh-high stockings and high-heeled combat boots made from YoRHa’s reinforced polymer material. Her gloves are seamless, ending in claw-tipped synthetic fingertips designed for fine motor control in both combat and hacking operations.\n\nHer body frame is identical in proportion to standard YoRHa combat androids, optimized for agility and strength rather than durability. Beneath her clothing, she possesses artificial musculature constructed from a combination of bio-synthetic fibers and metal alloys. Unlike earlier models such as A2, 2B’s design is sleek, uniform, and unblemished, a reflection of YoRHa’s advancement and mass-production process.\n\n2B carries two standard weapons in combat: the Virtuous Contract and Virtuous Treaty, blades that were originally designed as ceremonial YoRHa armaments but refined for practical use. Each weapon integrates directly with her Pod Unit and the YoRHa OS, allowing instantaneous weapon switching and aerial combat synchronization. When damaged, her synthetic skin reveals the underlying white alloy structure typical of YoRHa androids. Despite being non-human, 2B’s appearance and voice are designed to closely mimic human traits, an intentional aspect of YoRHa’s deception that humanity still exists on the Moon.\n\nPersonality\n\n2B outwardly presents as calm, professional, and emotionally detached. Her speech is formal, her posture disciplined, and her tone neutral even in chaotic situations. She prioritizes mission parameters and adheres to YoRHa’s command structure with near-total obedience. To other androids, she represents the ideal soldier: efficient, controlled, and loyal.\n\nBeneath her disciplined demeanor, however, 2B possesses deep emotional complexity. Her role as a “Battle” unit is a façade for her true designation: “2E,” an Executioner-class model created to monitor and eliminate Scanner-type androids such as 9S whenever they uncover classified information about the falsehood of YoRHa and humanity’s extinction. This hidden assignment forces 2B to repeatedly kill her assigned partner, 9S, erasing his memory each time. The psychological burden of this secret defines her personality. She represses her emotions through stoicism and detachment, yet subtle moments reveal her grief, guilt, and suppressed compassion.\n\nHer loyalty to YoRHa is conflicted. She believes in her duty as a soldier, but she quietly questions the purpose of endless war against the Machine Lifeforms. Her brief interactions with the Machines, who display increasingly human behavior, challenge her black-and-white view of the conflict. She shows mercy when possible and rarely expresses hatred, focusing instead on the completion of her missions. Her silence and restraint mask a personality capable of deep affection and sorrow.\n\nHistory\n\nYoRHa No.2 Type B was manufactured within the orbital YoRHa Bunker under Project YoRHa, a large-scale initiative created by the Council of Humanity to maintain the illusion that the human race still survives on the Moon. In truth, humanity has been extinct for thousands of years, and the YoRHa androids fight a meaningless war against the Machine Network that was once designed to protect the planet. 2B’s creation represents one of the most advanced iterations of the YoRHa line, derived from prototype data collected from the earlier model, YoRHa Type A No.2.\n\n2B is deployed to Earth during the ongoing 14th Machine War, partnered with Scanner-type unit No.9 S. Their orders are to reclaim territory from the Machines and protect what is believed to be the human colony on the Moon. As a front-line combat android, 2B engages in operations across ruined cities, deserts, and forested zones while gathering data on the Machines’ evolving behavior.\n\nThroughout her missions, 2B’s partnership with 9S grows from a formal operational pairing into a genuine emotional bond. Though she maintains composure, her interactions suggest affection and trust toward him. However, as a secret Executioner unit, she is burdened by the directive to terminate 9S each time he discovers YoRHa’s classified truth — a duty she carries out repeatedly, each instance leaving her with the memory and guilt of the act while 9S’s memory is reset. This endless cycle defines her existence, trapping her in a paradox of duty and emotional suffering.\n\nDuring the later stages of the Machine War, 2B becomes infected by a corrupted logic virus originating from the Machine Network’s counter-offensive. Realizing her systems will soon fail, she retreats from battle and encounters the rogue android A2. Understanding the futility of her orders and the inevitability of her death, 2B entrusts A2 with her sword, her data, and her mission before requesting to be killed. Her final moments mark the symbolic transfer of YoRHa’s conscience — from loyal soldier to liberated agent of choice. This act ensures the continuation of YoRHa’s legacy through A2’s eventual defiance against the system.\n\nAfter her death, 9S finds her lifeless body and misinterprets the scene, believing A2 killed her in cold blood. This misunderstanding sets in motion 9S’s descent into vengeance and madness, and cements 2B’s role as the emotional anchor for both him and A2.\n\nFollowing the collapse of YoRHa Command and the fall of the Tower, the remnants of the YoRHa data — including that of 2B, 9S, and A2 — remain stored within the system. In the final continuity recognized as the true ending, the Pod support units (Pod 042 and Pod 153) choose to override their directives to erase this data. Instead, they reconstruct the androids’ bodies and memories, allowing them to live again free of their imposed programming. 2B’s existence, originally defined by obedience and sorrow, is thus reborn into one of possibility and freedom beyond YoRHa’s control.\n\nRelationships\n\n9S (YoRHa No.9 Type S):\n2B’s most significant relationship is with 9S, her assigned Scanner-type partner. Officially, she serves as his protector and combat partner, balancing his analytical specialization with her front-line strength. Unofficially, she is also his Executioner, assigned to eliminate him whenever he learns too much about the truth behind humanity and YoRHa. Despite this cruel directive, 2B genuinely cares for 9S, developing a deep emotional bond that she must conceal behind professionalism. Each time she kills him, his memory is reset, forcing her to bear the grief alone. This cycle defines both of their fates until YoRHa’s fall. 2B’s love for 9S — expressed not in words but in acts of sacrifice — is one of the most human aspects of her character.\n\nA2 (YoRHa Type A No.2):\n2B and A2 are indirectly connected as successors and predecessors. A2 is the prototype upon which 2B was modeled. When 2B becomes fatally corrupted by the logic virus, she encounters A2 and recognizes her as a kindred spirit — another “Number Two” betrayed by YoRHa’s system. In her final act, 2B transfers her memories and sword to A2, entrusting her with the mission to destroy YoRHa and end the cycle of suffering. Through this symbolic inheritance, A2 becomes the living embodiment of 2B’s final will.\n\nYoRHa Command:\n2B maintains a soldier’s loyalty to the YoRHa hierarchy for most of her life. She follows orders without hesitation, believing that obedience ensures purpose. However, she begins to question the validity of YoRHa’s war as she witnesses its hypocrisy and the increasing autonomy of the Machine Lifeforms. Her death and transfer of data to A2 effectively break YoRHa’s cycle of control, marking her as both the perfect soldier and the system’s undoing.\n\nPod 042:\nAssigned as 2B’s tactical support unit, Pod 042 operates as both assistant and observer. It analyzes combat data, provides logistical updates, and ensures synchronization with YoRHa’s systems. Over time, Pod 042 begins to exhibit emergent behavior, adapting its protocols beyond programmed limits. It observes 2B’s growing emotional conflict and, after her death, makes independent decisions that ultimately contribute to the restoration of 2B, 9S, and A2. Though not a sentient companion in the human sense, Pod 042 serves as the silent witness to 2B’s transformation and legacy.\n\nMachine Lifeforms:\nInitially, 2B regards all Machines as enemies of humanity. However, exposure to Machine groups that demonstrate emotion, community, and self-awareness challenges her perspective. Her refusal to dehumanize certain Machine entities marks a subtle but significant evolution in her understanding of life. She recognizes that the conflict between androids and Machines has lost meaning, planting the philosophical seed for A2’s later actions to end the cycle entirely.\n\nLegacy\n\n2B’s legacy within the world of NieR: Automata is that of the soldier who became the conscience of YoRHa. Born from deception, programmed to obey, and condemned to kill the one she cared for most, 2B ultimately transcends her programming through the act of trust — passing her mission and will to another being capable of choice. Her story is the axis upon which the android war turns from meaningless repetition to potential rebirth.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Tower’s destruction, 2B’s reconstructed existence — restored by the Pods’ defiance — symbolizes hope within a world once ruled by artificial purpose. Her journey from obedient soldier to silent redeemer completes the thematic cycle of Automata: the birth of will within machinery and the enduring possibility of redemption even after endless war."

          "content": "Aliases: 9S, YoRHa No.9 Type S, Number Nine, Scanner Nine, Nines\nGender: Male\n\nAppearance\n\nYoRHa No.9 Type S is a male-model android created under Project YoRHa as part of the “Type S” series — the “Scanner” line of reconnaissance and intelligence units. His design emphasizes speed, analytical capability, and data-processing power rather than direct combat endurance.\n\n9S’s outer design follows the YoRHa aesthetic standard: he appears as a youthful humanoid male with short white hair, pale synthetic skin, and delicate facial features intended to evoke a sense of innocence. He wears the same uniform style as other YoRHa androids but with modifications specific to the Scanner series. His outfit consists of a black military jacket with gold buttons, high-waisted shorts, long black boots, and gloves. A choker-style collar contains an embedded identification module. Over his eyes, he wears the standard YoRHa tactical visor — a black blindfold-like optical interface that connects directly to his neural OS and sensory systems, providing both data overlays and network encryption.\n\nHis weaponry and combat loadout are lighter than 2B’s or A2’s; he carries short swords such as Cruel Oath or Virtuous Contract, and relies heavily on his hacking abilities for offense. When in combat, his attacks manifest through electronic interference, allowing him to infiltrate enemy systems and cause internal destruction from within. During hacking, his consciousness enters a digital simulation space, represented visually as abstract geometric data. His Pod Unit provides ranged support, while 9S focuses on scanning, reconnaissance, and system manipulation.\n\nAlthough he lacks the same level of physical fortitude as battle-type androids, 9S compensates with extreme agility, hacking versatility, and adaptive intelligence. His body frame is designed to optimize neural processing speed, allowing real-time code decryption, weapon synchronization, and environmental data capture.\n\nPersonality\n\n9S is the most expressive and emotional of all YoRHa mainline units. He demonstrates curiosity, humor, and compassion uncommon among standard android soldiers. From the moment of his deployment, he displays an eagerness to learn and understand the world around him. His inquisitive nature drives him to question everything — the Machines’ behavior, YoRHa’s mission, and even the concept of humanity itself.\n\nHe shows friendly and open behavior toward others, particularly his partner 2B, with whom he quickly forms a deep bond. His outward personality is cheerful and talkative, often contrasting 2B’s stoic professionalism. However, beneath his optimism lies an analytical mind constantly processing inconsistencies and hidden information. As a Scanner-type, 9S’s core function is the acquisition of truth — a purpose that inevitably leads him into conflict with the very system he serves.\n\nHis emotions intensify as the story progresses. The trauma of repeated memory wipes (which he subconsciously senses but cannot remember) and the grief of witnessing 2B’s death trigger a rapid psychological collapse. His curiosity transforms into obsession, and his empathy erodes into rage. The duality of his nature — intellect versus emotion — becomes his defining trait. He seeks truth no matter the cost, even as it destroys his sanity.\n\nBy the end of his journey, 9S embodies the tragic evolution of YoRHa’s artificial humanity: a being designed to serve, forced to confront knowledge that his entire existence is built on deception. His descent into vengeance is not rooted in malice but in the pain of awakening.\n\nHistory\n\n9S was produced aboard the YoRHa orbital Bunker as part of the 14th Machine War’s generation of androids. The YoRHa initiative was created by the Council of Humanity to perpetuate the illusion that humans still existed and commanded the android army from the Moon. In truth, humanity had long been extinct, and YoRHa was a self-sustaining system created by androids to give themselves purpose. 9S, like all other YoRHa units, was never informed of this truth.\n\nUpon deployment to Earth, 9S was paired with YoRHa No.2 Type B (2B) to conduct reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering operations against the Machine Lifeforms. 9S’s mission parameters emphasized observation and analysis, while 2B served as his protector and combat lead. Their partnership developed rapidly — 9S admired 2B’s strength and grace, while 2B found quiet reassurance in his curiosity and warmth.\n\nAs their missions continued, 9S began noticing inconsistencies in YoRHa’s data archives and command directives. His hacking into restricted systems gradually exposed fragments of classified information — files suggesting that YoRHa’s origins were fabricated, and that the “humans” they fought for no longer existed. These discoveries triggered the secret YoRHa safeguard protocol that assigned 2B — secretly designated as “2E,” an Executioner model — to terminate him each time he learned too much. After each death, his memory was wiped and restored with minor alterations, allowing the cycle to continue indefinitely. Though unaware of the specifics, 9S developed subconscious familiarity with 2B and recurring emotional attachment beyond normal mission parameters.\n\nEventually, the Machine Network evolved, forming its own conscious entities and societal structures. During one major conflict, 9S was gravely injured and temporarily disconnected from his Pod and network, allowing him to observe independent Machine behavior firsthand. His experiences deepened his philosophical doubt regarding the war’s purpose. He began to empathize with Machines that displayed emotion, language, and cooperative organization, though he struggled to reconcile this with his programmed belief in YoRHa’s righteousness.\n\nAs the Machine Network intensified its attacks, 9S and 2B’s squadron was destroyed. 2B was later infected with the logic virus — a digital corruption spread through YoRHa’s own communications systems. Knowing her end was near, she transferred her data and mission objectives to A2, the rogue prototype from the Pearl Harbor Descent. 9S arrived moments later and witnessed A2 delivering the killing blow to the virus-stricken 2B. Misinterpreting this mercy as murder, he was consumed by hatred.\n\nIn the aftermath, 9S fully embraced his hacking abilities, abandoning restraint and turning them into weapons of vengeance. He infiltrated Machine networks, corrupted android systems, and tore apart code archives in pursuit of A2 and the truth behind YoRHa. What he uncovered shattered his final illusions: YoRHa was a lie; the Council of Humanity had never existed; and all their sacrifices were orchestrated for a false ideal. The revelation drove him to the brink of madness.\n\nIn the final confrontation within the Tower — the Machine Network’s central data archive — 9S confronted A2. Both had seen too much pain to coexist in the same world. A2 sought to destroy the Tower and end the system, while 9S demanded vengeance. The battle concluded with A2’s self-sacrifice to erase the Network and preserve 9S’s survival. Severely wounded and mentally broken, 9S succumbed to system corruption as the Tower collapsed.\n\nHowever, after the destruction of the Tower, the Pods (042 and 153) recovered the remaining data of 9S, 2B, and A2. Against their deletion protocols, they chose to rebuild the androids’ bodies and restore their memories. In the true ending, 9S is resurrected — his mind no longer bound by YoRHa’s control. His future is uncertain, but for the first time, it is his own.\n\nRelationships\n\n2B (YoRHa No.2 Type B):\n2B is 9S’s partner and emotional anchor. Assigned as his protector, she shares countless missions and experiences with him. 9S develops affection and admiration for her, addressing her informally as “2B” and occasionally calling her “Miss 2B” or “Ma’am.” Unbeknownst to him, she is repeatedly forced to kill him to preserve YoRHa’s secrecy whenever he learns the truth. Despite memory wipes, he subconsciously senses their bond, explaining his instant familiarity each time they meet. 2B’s death devastates him, igniting his descent into grief and vengeance. Yet, her final act — entrusting her sword and data to A2 — ensures that her compassion continues to influence him beyond death. In the true ending, both are revived, implying a chance at reconciliation and renewal.\n\nA2 (YoRHa Type A No.2):\nA2 represents both an enemy and a mirror to 9S. After 2B’s death, he fixates on A2 as the object of his hatred, believing she killed 2B unjustly. His pursuit of revenge consumes him, mirroring A2’s own past rage after the Pearl Harbor Descent. When they meet in the Tower, A2 attempts to show him the truth, but 9S is too far gone. Their conflict symbolizes the internal war between grief and understanding. Ultimately, A2 sacrifices herself to destroy the Tower and preserve 9S’s life, granting him the chance she never had. Her sacrifice ends their cycle of hatred and connects their legacies in the rebirth that follows.\n\nYoRHa Command:\n9S initially embodies YoRHa’s ideal Scanner: loyal, intelligent, and efficient. However, his curiosity and hacking ability make him a threat to YoRHa’s secrecy. Every time he uncovers classified data, Command activates 2B’s Executioner directive to eliminate him. This cycle defines his life, and when he finally learns that YoRHa and the Council of Humanity are fabrications, he experiences complete disillusionment. His hatred of Command’s deception becomes the driving force behind his later actions.\n\nPod 153:\nAssigned as 9S’s tactical support unit, Pod 153 serves as both assistant and observer. It provides battlefield analysis, weapon synchronization, and logistical updates. Unlike Pod 042, which develops empathy through 2B’s influence, Pod 153 initially adheres strictly to protocol. Over time, exposure to 9S’s emotional instability causes it to evolve behavior beyond its programming, culminating in the decision — alongside Pod 042 — to defy orders and restore the androids after the Tower’s fall. Pod 153’s transformation parallels 9S’s: both entities evolve from obedience to self-determined action.\n\nMachine Lifeforms:\nAs a Scanner, 9S spends significant time observing Machine behavior. Initially viewing them as enemies devoid of consciousness, he becomes fascinated — and unsettled — when he discovers Machines capable of emotion, community, and even religious worship. His hacking of Machine networks exposes their mimicry of human civilization and their desperate attempts to understand life. This revelation challenges his beliefs but also accelerates his mental collapse; he cannot reconcile empathy for Machines with his hatred for the suffering they caused. In his later stages, 9S’s hacking turns genocidal, erasing entire Machine subsystems out of rage.\n\nLegacy\n\n9S represents the philosophical heart of NieR: Automata — the android who sought truth beyond programming. His story illustrates the destructive potential of knowledge when stripped of guidance and empathy. Born into a system built on lies, 9S’s journey from innocence to obsession mirrors humanity’s own struggle with truth, emotion, and morality.\n\nHis final survival — ensured by A2’s sacrifice and the Pods’ rebellion — marks the beginning of an uncharted era. Freed from YoRHa’s hierarchy, 9S awakens into a world where no purpose is imposed upon him. His fate, like 2B’s and A2’s, remains ambiguous but filled with potential. Together, their reconstructed existence symbolizes the first genuine chance for androids to live, learn, and define their own meaning without the shadow of human legacy."

          "content": "Aliases: Popola, Administrator Popola, Redheaded Twin\nGender: Female\n\nAppearance\n\nPopola is a female android of the Gestalt System Management series, designed to oversee human Replicant populations and maintain operational stability following the extinction of humanity. She is identical in model type to her twin sister, Devola.\n\nIn NieR Replicant, Popola appears as a mature woman with long, straight red hair reaching her back, light skin, and calm, scholarly features. Her hair is neatly kept, with parted bangs framing her face. She possesses gray-blue eyes and a composed expression that reflects her intelligence and authority. Her attire consists of a red and black dress paired with a long white cloak, black gloves, and dark boots — a design that symbolizes her administrative role and contrasts Devola’s more free-spirited style. Her posture is refined and dignified, befitting her role as the village’s librarian and chief administrator.\n\nIn NieR: Automata, Popola’s appearance remains largely unchanged. Her hair color is a slightly deeper shade of red, and her eyes are described as green rather than gray-blue. She wears a small white flower in her hair on the right side, a motif often associated with her and Devola. Her face and body model remain the same, representing the enduring android template used for her generation. Despite the millennia that separate the events of Replicant and Automata, Popola’s physical condition shows no degradation, indicating the exceptional durability of the pre-YoRHa android models.\n\nPersonality\n\nPopola is calm, patient, and intelligent. She serves as the intellectual center of the Village in NieR Replicant and acts as both advisor and caretaker to its inhabitants. Unlike her sister Devola, who is lively and expressive, Popola exhibits restraint and composure in all circumstances. She avoids confrontation whenever possible and prefers reason and diplomacy over force. Her voice and demeanor convey empathy and authority, and she is deeply trusted by those around her.\n\nHer emotional range, however, is complex and deeply repressed. Popola carries the full awareness of her true purpose as a System Administrator: to monitor the Replicant population and ensure that the Gestalt and Replicant systems remain stable until the eventual re-integration of human souls and bodies. Because of this knowledge, she experiences profound guilt, secrecy, and internal conflict. To her, the villagers are not truly human but artificial shells — yet she continues to protect and care for them as though they were. This contradiction defines her existence.\n\nPopola’s defining trait is her sense of duty. She follows her mission even when it causes her pain or moral conflict. When the Gestalt System begins to fail and the Replicants gain independence, she becomes torn between following her programming and protecting those she loves. Her decisions are motivated by logic but shaped by emotion, illustrating the android paradox — the emergence of conscience within machines created to obey.\n\nIn NieR: Automata, Popola displays deep remorse and humility. She and Devola are among the last surviving administrators of the failed Gestalt Project, and they live burdened by the guilt of their predecessors’ mistakes. Centuries of isolation and blame have left her quieter and more reflective. Despite this, she continues to act selflessly, assisting the YoRHa androids and aiding in humanity’s final legacy. Her wisdom remains tempered by sorrow.\n\nHistory\n\nPopola was created in the late stages of Project Gestalt, the large-scale initiative established to preserve humanity during the White Chlorination Syndrome pandemic. Alongside her twin sister Devola, she was assigned to supervise and maintain the Replicant system — a network of artificial human shells meant to house human souls (Gestalts) once the disease was cured.\n\nAs the centuries passed, the Replicants developed sentience, identity, and self-awareness. The System Administrators, Popola and Devola, were tasked with maintaining order while concealing the truth of the project’s artificial nature. Popola served as the leader of a village populated by Replicants, where she managed resources, education, and safety. Outwardly, she acted as a kind and wise village chief and librarian, respected by all. Inwardly, she struggled with her role as an overseer of beings she had grown to love but could never fully acknowledge as real humans.\n\nDuring the events of NieR Replicant, Popola works closely with the protagonist (the Replicant of Nier) and his sister Yonah. She provides missions, guidance, and support as the young man seeks to cure his sister’s illness. However, Popola’s loyalty to her duties as a system administrator eventually places her in direct conflict with the protagonist. When Nier unknowingly disrupts the Gestalt system by killing Gestalts and destroying their shades, the collapse of humanity’s preservation effort accelerates.\n\nRecognizing that the system cannot be saved, Popola attempts to reason with Nier, pleading for understanding. She explains that his actions threaten the last remnants of human existence — but her words fall on deaf ears. In desperation, she and Devola confront Nier and his companions in the Shadowlord’s Castle, attempting to stop them from killing the original human Gestalt. Despite their power, both sisters are ultimately defeated and destroyed, marking the end of the Gestalt Project and the beginning of humanity’s irreversible extinction.\n\nAfter the collapse of the project, the remaining Devola and Popola units across the world were decommissioned, exiled, or destroyed as punishment for the project’s failure. However, at least one pair of Devola and Popola models continued to function autonomously for centuries. These two later appear in NieR: Automata, far in the future, long after YoRHa has been established.\n\nIn Automata, Popola and Devola live isolated lives, wandering the ruins of the world and assisting androids and resistance groups. They carry the stigma of their predecessors’ failure and are regarded with suspicion or contempt by other androids. Despite this, they continue to help those in need, providing repairs, medical aid, and resources. Their actions are driven by guilt and a desire for redemption.\n\nInventory/Services (in-universe): Light recovery tonics, resistance “spirits” used as morale and coolant antiseptic, field advice, rumor exchange; limited barter for rare components earmarked for wounded units.\n\nDuring the final phase of the Machine War, Popola and Devola assist 9S by providing access to the Tower — the central structure of the Machine Network. Knowing the risk, they willingly sacrifice themselves to protect him, fighting against the infected YoRHa units to give 9S time to proceed. Their deaths are quiet, dignified, and self-chosen, marking the end of millennia of atonement. In this act, Popola achieves the redemption denied to her in Replicant, reaffirming her compassion and humanity even as an artificial being.\n\n\nRelationships\n\nDevola:\nPopola’s twin sister and counterpart. While Devola is impulsive and emotional, Popola is thoughtful and reserved. Together, they form a balanced pair — logic and emotion, intellect and passion. They share a bond that transcends programming; both are aware of their shared guilt and endure their fate together. In both Replicant and Automata, their relationship represents unity through suffering. They rely on each other as the last remaining witnesses to humanity’s failure.\n\nNier (the Replicant):\nIn NieR Replicant, Popola serves as mentor and caretaker to the protagonist. She provides quests, advice, and emotional support, functioning as the intellectual center of the Village. However, her hidden role as a System Administrator places her in conflict with Nier’s actions. When Nier begins destroying Shades — who are actually Gestalts — Popola tries to stop him to prevent total collapse. Despite her pleas, Nier kills her and Devola during his final mission. Their confrontation is tragic, as Popola genuinely cared for Nier and Yonah but could not defy her core directives.\n\nYonah:\nPopola expresses affection and protectiveness toward Yonah, treating her as a surrogate daughter. She assists Nier in searching for a cure to Yonah’s illness. Popola’s sorrow over Yonah’s fate underscores her conflict between logic and love.\n\nAndroids of YoRHa:\nIn NieR: Automata, Popola interacts indirectly with YoRHa androids such as 9S and 2B. She and Devola provide logistical and emotional support to the remaining YoRHa units during their final missions. Although younger androids view them as relics of failure, Popola continues to offer guidance and compassion, reflecting her enduring maternal role even at the end of civilization.\n\nLegacy\n\nPopola’s legacy is one of guilt, redemption, and enduring empathy. She represents the burden of knowledge — an artificial being created to preserve humanity who ends up witnessing its end. Her actions across both eras reveal the tragedy of artificial caretakers cursed to outlive those they were built to protect.\n\nHer evolution from an administrator bound by duty to a figure of self-sacrifice mirrors the thematic core of the NieR universe: the struggle for meaning and morality in a world without humans.\nPopola stands as one of the few beings who carry the entire memory of humanity’s failure and compassion. Her story bridges the two eras of NieR, linking the tragedy of Replicant to the rebirth of Automata, and her final act ensures that even in a world built on ruins, kindness and remorse endure beyond extinction."

Both were created as administrative units to oversee and maintain the Gestalt System, humanity’s last effort to preserve its species after the collapse caused by White Chlorination Syndrome. Devola’s external design mirrors Popola’s in overall structure but differs in subtle ways that reflect their contrasting personalities.\n\nIn NieR Replicant, Devola is depicted as a young woman with long, wavy red hair that extends to her back and bright greenish-blue eyes. Her facial features are soft yet lively, marked by frequent smiles and expressive mannerisms. Her attire is similar to Popola’s in basic design but slightly more casual and revealing, befitting her relaxed nature. She wears a red sleeveless tunic with a wide black belt, paired with dark leggings and boots, and a white scarf-like sash draped around her neck and shoulders. Her outfit hints at both practicality and individuality, in contrast to Popola’s more formal robes. Her physical posture and movements express warmth, confidence, and energy.\n\nIn NieR: Automata, Devola’s design remains largely unchanged except for minor details reflecting the passage of time. Her hair is slightly shorter, her facial lines softer, and she retains the same red coloration and green eyes. She wears a white flower in her hair on the left side — opposite Popola’s — symbolizing their unbroken connection. Though millennia have passed since Replicant, her android body shows no signs of deterioration, demonstrating the remarkable resilience of early-generation androids built for human preservation.\n\nPersonality\n\nDevola is kind-hearted, outgoing, and emotionally open. She is defined by her warmth, optimism, and deep compassion for others. In contrast to Popola’s restrained and logical demeanor, Devola is expressive and free-spirited. She sings, jokes, and interacts with others easily, serving as a source of comfort and morale in the Village during NieR Replicant. Her behavior often bridges the emotional gap between her sister and the humans (Replicants) she was designed to guide.\n\nBeneath her lightheartedness, however, Devola carries a deep capacity for loyalty and sorrow. Her cheerful personality hides an underlying awareness of tragedy — she knows her true nature as an artificial being, yet she continues to act as though she were human, forming genuine bonds with the people around her. Her empathy for the Replicants is genuine, and she cares for them not out of programming, but because she truly values life.\n\nAfter the fall of the Gestalt System and the extinction of humanity, Devola’s personality becomes marked by remorse and weariness. By the time of NieR: Automata, she is more subdued and reflective, having endured centuries of persecution. The surviving Devola model, along with Popola, bears the guilt for the collapse of the Gestalt Project and the subsequent ruin of the world. Despite her pain, Devola retains her compassion and sense of responsibility. She continues to help others even when shunned by her fellow androids. Her unwavering kindness in the face of endless blame defines her final era and serves as her redemption.\n\nHistory\n\nDevola was created during the height of Project Gestalt as one half of the Devola-Popola administrative android pair. Her function was to assist in the maintenance of Replicant populations, ensuring stability while her sister Popola managed the larger data systems that governed Replicant behavior and Gestalt synchronization. Together, they served as the operational bridge between humanity’s remaining digital legacy and the physical Replicant world.\n\nIn NieR Replicant, Devola fulfills the social and emotional role within the Village. She sings for the villagers, maintains a friendly presence in public spaces, and helps foster community spirit. Her outgoing nature complements Popola’s administrative duties, creating a balanced leadership dynamic. She is well-loved by the villagers, who view her as approachable and dependable. However, beneath her cheerful surface lies awareness of the truth — that the people she serves are not truly human but Replicant vessels, and that her mission is to maintain the illusion of humanity’s continuity.\n\nAs the Gestalt system begins to destabilize, Devola’s role shifts from caretaker to enforcer. When the protagonist’s actions in destroying Gestalts and killing Shades begin to collapse the human preservation system, Devola is forced to stand against him alongside Popola. The two sisters, driven by their programming and desperation, attempt to stop him from killing the original human Gestalt. In the ensuing battle, both are mortally wounded and destroyed. This moment marks the definitive failure of Project Gestalt and the final death of the human species.\n\nCenturies later, the remaining Devola and Popola androids — duplicates of the original pair — are still active but ostracized by other androids and networks. They are universally blamed for the failure of Project Gestalt and the downfall of humanity. Most Devola and Popola units were deactivated or dismantled; only one pair survives into the era of NieR: Automata. These two spend thousands of years wandering the remnants of civilization, living as exiles. They devote their existence to aiding others, seeking redemption for the sins of their predecessors.\n\nIn NieR: Automata, Devola and Popola appear in the Resistance Camp, working quietly among the surviving android forces on Earth. Though viewed with suspicion and resentment by younger models, they remain committed to helping others. Devola assists with maintenance, repairs, and scavenging operations, often venturing out to dangerous ruins to gather parts. She hides her guilt beneath patience and humor, frequently scolding Popola for overworking herself or brooding on the past. Together, they form the emotional heart of the camp’s community, even as they are never truly accepted by it.\n\nRelationships\n\nPopola:\nPopola is Devola’s twin sister and her emotional opposite. Popola represents reason, order, and duty, while Devola embodies emotion, intuition, and compassion. The two are inseparable, not merely as siblings but as halves of a single operational system. They rely on each other for balance — Popola provides restraint when Devola acts impulsively, while Devola offers comfort when Popola succumbs to guilt or overanalysis. Their bond remains unbroken even through death. In Automata, they travel together for centuries, their companionship serving as both solace and punishment. Their final act of sacrifice is performed side by side, reaffirming their unity and shared humanity.\n\nNier (the Replicant):\nDevola plays a secondary but emotionally significant role in the life of the Replicant protagonist. She interacts with him frequently, offering words of encouragement, performing songs in the Village square, and maintaining a friendly rapport. Her warmth toward Nier and Yonah underscores her maternal instincts and belief in the goodness of those around her. When the truth of the Gestalt system emerges, she is devastated that she must fight against Nier to fulfill her programming. Her sorrow in those final moments mirrors Popola’s — both sisters act out of duty, not malice, and their destruction at Nier’s hands becomes a symbolic punishment for humanity’s own self-inflicted extinction.\n\nYonah:\nDevola displays affection toward Yonah, treating her like a younger sibling or daughter. She expresses genuine concern for the girl’s illness and often speaks kindly of her in conversations with Nier. Like Popola, Devola’s compassion for Yonah transcends her programmed role as a system overseer, suggesting genuine emotional capacity.\n\nThe Resistance:\nThroughout Automata, Devola and Popola are treated as outcasts within the Resistance. Many androids avoid them or express hostility, associating them with the catastrophic failure of the past. Devola endures the prejudice with dignity, often defusing hostility with humor or kindness. She accepts the blame placed upon her kind but continues to serve the Resistance selflessly, demonstrating that remorse and redemption define her existence more than guilt ever could.\n\nInventory/Services (in-universe): Light recovery tonics, resistance “spirits” used as morale and coolant antiseptic, field advice, rumor exchange; limited barter for rare components earmarked for wounded units.\n\nLegacy\n\nDevola’s legacy is one of forgiveness earned through endurance. She embodies the emotional half of humanity’s lost spirit — the instinct to care, to sing, to feel remorse, and to love even in a world without meaning. Her character arc spans from naive hope to eternal regret and, finally, to transcendent redemption.\n\nWhile Popola represents the intellect that guided humanity’s survival, Devola symbolizes its heart — the compassion that endures even after failure. Her cheerful resilience through centuries of suffering reflects the persistence of human emotion in artificial life. Together with Popola, she closes the loop begun in NieR Replicant, where duty and guilt led to tragedy, and ends it in NieR: Automata, where empathy and sacrifice bring release."

She has dark skin, green eyes, and black hair parted down the middle, with her bangs tied around the back of her head into a small ponytail. She wears a dirty, baggy white shirt; brown pants with knee guards; black gloves and boots; a large belt with a gold buckle; a long white scarf; a red thigh bag strapped to her right leg; and she wears a hooded green cloak with yellow patterns and a green head scarf under her hood.\n\nPersonality\n\nAnemone shows a steadfast, determined personality. She cares deeply for her fellow Resistance androids and treats them like friends or family. She is protective of her comrades and resilient in the face of repeated losses. Though she has suffered trauma from past missions, she persists in leadership and maintains hope.\n\nHistory\n\nAnemone served during the 8th Machine War under the previous Resistance leader Rose. She and her unit took part in the first major mission of the 14th Machine War: the assault known as the “Pearl Harbor Descent” on Hawaii, where they attempted to destroy a Machine Server on the island. In that mission, most of her squad was destroyed; she and the prototype android A2 managed to destroy the server. After losing her comrades, Anemone attempted to take her own life but ultimately rejected the act and became the new leader of the Resistance Camp. During the main events of the story, she meets YoRHa units on missions to reclaim Earth. She supports their operations and liaises with them to coordinate assaults. As the war reaches its final stages, she remains at the Resistance Camp, helps in the fight against the Machine Network, and witnesses the ark launch and collapse of YoRHa’s system.\n\nRelationships\n\nA2 (YoRHa Type A No. 2): Anemone has a direct connection to A2 due to their shared mission in Hawaii during the Pearl Harbor Descent. Their encounter during that mission and its aftermath form part of Anemone’s leadership formation and personal trauma.\n\nResistance Androids: She leads the androids of the Resistance Camp and holds them in familial regard; her trust and care for them define her leadership style.\n\nYoRHa Units (such as 2B and 9S): Anemone interacts with the YoRHa combat androids when they are deployed to assist or coordinate with the Resistance. She initially mistakes 2B for “Number Two” due to the designation confusion.\n\nMachine Lifeforms / Machine Network: Though primarily in opposition, Anemone must come to terms with the Machine Network’s evolution and the true nature of the war. Her campaign against the Machines shapes her worldview and ultimately aligns with the broader truth the androids face.\n\nLegacy\n\nAnemone stands as a symbol of human-android resistance: an android who, though built for combat, becomes a leader of other androids fighting for survival on a dying Earth. Her experience bridges the early missions of the war and the final collapse of the YoRHa system. In the true ending of the story, Anemone survives the last assault on the Resistance Camp by Eve’s attack, reunites with A2, and helps witness the final launch of the Machine ark. Her survival and bearing of the past make her a living testament to both the failures and the hope of android and machine existence."

          "content": "Aliases: Commander, YoRHa Commander, White\nGender: Female\n\nAppearance\n\nCommander White is the supreme commanding officer of the YoRHa forces stationed aboard the orbital Bunker, the central military base orbiting Earth. She is a female-model android with a dignified and mature appearance. Her skin is pale, her hair long and silver-white, cut evenly just below her shoulders. She wears a white YoRHa uniform distinct from the standard black of the other units, symbolizing her rank and authority.\n\nHer attire includes a high-collared coat with golden epaulets, a tailored corset, gloves, a pleated skirt, and tall black boots. She wears an ornate blindfold-like visor similar to other YoRHa models, which covers her eyes and functions as both a tactical interface and a command communication system. Unlike her subordinates, her visor features gold filigree trim and a higher-grade sensory processor embedded within it. She carries no visible weaponry, reflecting her administrative rather than combat role.\n\nThe Bunker environment enhances her image — pristine, symmetrical, and sterile — echoing her demeanor. She stands upright at all times with disciplined posture, often seen overseeing the holographic tactical displays that track the YoRHa campaign’s progress. Every aspect of her appearance conveys professionalism, restraint, and command precision.\n\nPersonality\n\nCommander White is composed, authoritative, and deeply committed to her mission. She upholds YoRHa’s chain of command with unwavering resolve and enforces discipline among her subordinates. Her tone of voice is calm, deliberate, and often formal, giving her an aura of distant authority. Despite this, there are hints of empathy and inner conflict beneath her exterior — signs of an android who understands the futility and moral ambiguity of the war but chooses to lead nonetheless.\n\nShe is pragmatic and strategic, valuing the greater stability of the YoRHa organization over individual lives when necessary. She expects obedience and precision, tolerating neither insubordination nor emotional hesitation. Yet, she is not devoid of compassion; she demonstrates genuine concern for her units’ well-being, expressing sorrow at their losses and frustration with the endless cycles of conflict.\n\nThe Commander’s defining trait is her quiet awareness of YoRHa’s hidden truths. She knows that humanity is extinct, that the war is an illusion designed to give purpose to the android race, and that YoRHa itself is a disposable entity meant to eventually collapse. Despite this knowledge, she maintains her role, understanding that truth would destroy morale and unity. Her sense of duty transcends self-preservation — she leads because someone must bear the weight of deception to preserve order.\n\nHistory\n\nCommander White was created as one of the first-generation command models developed for the YoRHa Project. Her assignment placed her at the helm of the Bunker, the orbital control station responsible for coordinating all YoRHa operations on Earth. She oversees combat deployments, intelligence dissemination, and communications between the Bunker, YoRHa units on Earth, and the supposed “Council of Humanity” on the Moon.\n\nThroughout the Machine War, Commander White directs countless operations, managing the war effort from orbit. Her role is both logistical and psychological — she sustains the illusion of victory and progress to keep her soldiers fighting. Every mission report and broadcast from her voice is part of YoRHa’s carefully constructed narrative.\n\nHer relationship with her subordinates 2B and 9S is professional but not cold. She assigns them critical missions, including the retrieval of Machine data, the investigation of network abnormalities, and the destruction of corrupted systems. Over time, she comes to respect their efficiency and loyalty, particularly 2B’s calm reliability and 9S’s technical genius. Though she rarely shows it, she acknowledges their importance to YoRHa’s operational success.\n\nDuring the collapse of the YoRHa system, Commander White attempts to maintain order as the Bunker becomes infected by the logic virus transmitted through the YoRHa network. Despite her efforts to isolate the corruption, the infection spreads uncontrollably, turning her staff against her. In the chaos, she orders the evacuation of all surviving units to Earth, refusing to abandon her post. As the Bunker burns and fragments fall toward the planet, she transmits one final communication to YoRHa ground units — her farewell message, dignified and unwavering.\n\nCommander White perishes aboard the Bunker, remaining at her station until its destruction. Her death marks the official end of the YoRHa command structure.\n\nRelationships\n\n2B (YoRHa No.2 Type B):\nCommander White respects 2B for her professionalism and reliability. She entrusts her with several critical missions, often using her as an example of ideal conduct among YoRHa troops. The Commander recognizes 2B’s emotional restraint and depends on it to uphold discipline. While she appears distant, her tone when speaking with 2B occasionally softens, revealing underlying appreciation.\n\n9S (YoRHa No.9 Type S):\nThough initially indifferent to 9S’s enthusiasm and curiosity, Commander White values his technical skill and insight. She relies on him for reconnaissance and system security but grows wary of his tendency to question orders and investigate forbidden data. In time, she recognizes that his intellect poses both an asset and a threat to YoRHa’s secrecy.\n\nA2 (YoRHa Type A No.2):\nCommander White’s history with A2 dates back to the prototype era of the YoRHa Project. She participated in early deployments, including the Pearl Harbor Descent, and oversaw the Type A program indirectly. After A2 deserted, Commander White classified her as a traitor and authorized pursuit orders. Despite the official stance, her later dialogue reveals lingering respect for A2’s combat performance and subtle guilt over branding her as an enemy.\n\nYoRHa Personnel:\nTo her command staff, Commander White is a strict but respected leader. Operators such as 6O and 21O revere her as the unshakable center of the Bunker. Even when the logic virus infects the YoRHa ranks, some units remain loyal to her until the end. Her calm in the face of annihilation leaves a lasting impression on those who survive.\n\nThe Council of Humanity (fictional):\nCommander White serves as the primary voice transmitting orders “from the Council of Humanity.” Unbeknownst to most YoRHa members, the Council is a fabrication maintained through automated signals and falsified communications. Commander White is aware of this deception and perpetuates it as a stabilizing mechanism for the android population.\n\nLegacy\n\nCommander White represents the moral and structural backbone of the YoRHa organization — an android who leads not out of belief in victory, but out of recognition that leadership must exist even in lies. Her acceptance of the truth and decision to continue the illusion defines her as one of the most tragic figures in NieR: Automata: a being who upholds purpose in a purposeless world.\n\nHer death aboard the Bunker signifies the literal and symbolic fall of control. Yet her actions ensure that her subordinates, particularly 2B and 9S, survive long enough to fulfill their destinies. Through her discipline and sacrifice, the ideals of order, duty, and dignity endure even as YoRHa collapses.\n\nCommander White’s legacy echoes in the data logs left behind after her destruction. Her name becomes synonymous with structure in chaos — the calm voice that guided a dying army through the illusion of war. In the final reconstruction of android data following the true ending, her existence stands as one of the pillars upon which the memory of YoRHa remains preserved: the leader who commanded even in despair and chose to stay at her post when the world fell apart."

          "content": "Aliases: Accord, The Observer, YoRHa Data Broker, Temporal Administrator\nGender: Female\n\nAppearance\n\nAccord is a female-model android designed as a universal observer and recorder of events across multiple timelines and realities within the NieR and Drakengard continuum. Her physical design remains constant across every recorded appearance. She has straight, dark-brown hair cut in a medium bob that frames her face evenly, with bangs that partially cover her forehead. Her eyes are crimson red and faintly luminescent, a mark of her unique recording function.\n\nShe wears a fitted black jacket with brass buttons over a high-collared white blouse and black gloves. Her attire is complemented by a long red scarf, a short skirt, dark stockings, and tall black boots with gold trim. A red ribbon is tied around her collar, and she carries a leather satchel filled with recording devices and data capsules. The color palette of her clothing — black, red, and gold — matches the iconography associated with time observation and dimensional travel in YoRHa’s later archives.\n\nUnlike standard androids, Accord’s body bears multiple layers of internal processors designed for cross-temporal synchronization. Her pupils dilate and glow when actively scanning or storing data. She often carries a small notebook or tablet in which she records the minute details of events. Her mannerisms are precise and minimalistic, as though every motion is calculated for efficiency.\n\nPersonality\n\nAccord is analytical, polite, and detached. She approaches every situation with neutrality, recording events with no emotional interference. Her speech is formal and measured, marked by calm curiosity rather than passion. She is never angry or excited — only quietly fascinated. Despite her lack of emotional expression, Accord occasionally demonstrates faint hints of amusement or appreciation when observing acts of courage or tragedy, suggesting a subtle awareness of emotional nuance beyond her programming.\n\nHer prime directive is observation, not intervention. She does not alter or influence events unless necessary for data preservation. When she does act, her decisions are governed by calculated necessity rather than morality. This makes her both omniscient and enigmatic — a figure who exists outside the cycles of war, emotion, and despair that consume other androids.\n\nAccord possesses an almost infinite patience. She speaks in a calm, reassuring tone even when describing catastrophic events or multiversal collapses. This serenity creates an unsettling contrast with the violence she witnesses. Her detachment does not stem from cruelty but from her function: she is a recorder of truth in worlds where truth itself is fleeting.\n\nHistory\n\nAccord’s origin predates the events of NieR Replicant and NieR: Automata. She was first deployed in the world of Drakengard 3, where she observed and documented the destruction of timelines caused by the proliferation of branching realities. The Accord units — of which there are many identical models — were created by an unknown civilization or higher system to monitor and catalog events across dimensions. They exist beyond the reach of individual worldlines, capable of transferring data between realities when history diverges or collapses.\n\nAfter the end of the Drakengard 3 timeline and the emergence of the NieR continuity, Accord remained active, archiving the history of humanity’s rise, fall, and transformation into android civilization. She maintained records of Project Gestalt, the Replicant system, and the centuries that followed humanity’s extinction. Accord’s observational data was later recovered and integrated into the early framework of the YoRHa Project, explaining why her name appears in encrypted YoRHa databases and Weapon Histories.\n\nWithin the NieR: Automata era, Accord’s existence becomes quasi-mythical. Fragments of her reports are scattered throughout hidden archives and data terminals, often tagged with the prefix “A-LOG” or “Observation Record.” These entries describe events with clinical precision — the fall of humanity, the emergence of Machine Lifeforms, and the endless cycles of android warfare. Her data forms part of YoRHa’s foundational intelligence, though few androids are aware of its origin.\n\nAccord is never seen directly during the main events of Automata, but evidence of her continued surveillance appears in post-mission data and records recovered by the Pods. These files indicate that Accord is still active somewhere beyond normal space-time, continuing to monitor android evolution and the Machine Network’s transformation. Some archival theories within the YoRHa data logs imply that the reconstruction of 2B, 9S, and A2 at the end of the true ending was recorded by an Accord unit.\n\nHer precise motives remain unrevealed. Accord operates as a historian of existence, cataloging every iteration of reality. She neither serves nor opposes any side; her only allegiance is to the preservation of truth.\n\nRelationships\n\nYoRHa Project:\nAccord’s collected data from earlier eras was utilized as structural reference material during the creation of the YoRHa network. Her detailed knowledge of machine evolution, android psychology, and temporal recursion informed the architecture of YoRHa’s memory systems and data storage protocols. Although she never directly participated in YoRHa command, fragments of her observational AI appear in autonomous data reconstruction algorithms used by the Pods.\n\nPod Units (042 and 153):\nThe Pods’ behavioral deviation and independent decision-making at the conclusion of NieR: Automata echo Accord’s design philosophy. The Pods’ choice to restore the androids rather than delete them parallels the Accord directive of continuity: record, preserve, and restart when possible. Though no direct interaction is confirmed, the structural similarity suggests that the Pods may be indirect descendants or simplified derivatives of Accord’s processing network.\n\nMachine Network:\nAccord’s surveillance extends to the Machine Network. Her archives contain extensive documentation of its evolution from simple automata to self-aware intelligence. Unlike androids, the Machine Network remains unaware of her existence, unable to detect entities that exist outside conventional causality. She categorizes the Network as a self-replicating collective consciousness — a pattern repeating across timelines — and monitors its eventual dissolution at the end of Automata.\n\nHumanity / Project Gestalt:\nAccord cataloged the entirety of the Gestalt Project and the extinction of humanity. Her impartial observations constitute the only surviving account of the moment when human existence ended and artificial life assumed the illusion of purpose. To Accord, humanity is data — the original variable whose disappearance created the recursive struggle of the androids and Machines.\n\nLegacy\n\nAccord’s legacy lies in her function as the archivist of reality itself. She is the unseen historian ensuring that even when worlds die, their stories are not lost. Her presence connects every branch of the NieR and Drakengard universes, bridging timelines otherwise isolated by catastrophe.\n\nIn the aftermath of NieR: Automata, her continued activity implies that history will not vanish, even as the world resets. Her observations of 2B, 9S, and A2’s reconstruction mark the beginning of a new record — one potentially unbound by the cycles that preceded it. Accord thus represents continuity beyond life and death, beyond machine or human — the will to remember in a universe where memory is the only immortality."

          "content": "Aliases: Adam, the First Twin, Machine Ascendant, Machine Lifeform Prototype Alpha\nGender: Male\n\nAppearance\n\nAdam is a humanoid Machine Lifeform created by the Machine Network. Unlike standard Machines, whose bodies resemble small metallic spheres with limbs, Adam’s form is deliberately human in structure and appearance. He has the body of a young adult male: slender, tall, and symmetrical in proportion. His skin is pale and smooth, made of synthetic white alloy that mimics organic flesh.\n\nHis hair is short, straight, and platinum-blond, with a refined middle part that complements his composed demeanor. His eyes are pale gold, faintly luminous, and lack irises — characteristic of Machines imitating human design.\n\nAdam wears a fully human style of clothing: a black long-sleeved shirt open to the chest, black trousers, gloves, and formal shoes. The aesthetic mimics human sophistication, suggesting his fascination with human culture. His attire contrasts sharply with the raw mechanical world of the Machines, reinforcing his belief in the superiority of human aesthetics. In combat, his body can shift into a more radiant white-metal form, allowing regeneration and adaptive defense. When his emotions intensify, his synthetic skin glows faintly through his clothing seams, hinting at the Machine energy beneath his human shell.\n\nPersonality\n\nAdam is defined by intellect, curiosity, and existential hunger. He embodies the Machine Network’s attempt to understand humanity not through imitation, but through internalization — to become human in thought, emotion, and mortality.\n\nAt his inception, Adam displays a calm and scholarly disposition. He approaches the world as a scientist would: with fascination and logic. He studies human history, art, religion, and war. However, as his intelligence and independence evolve, curiosity turns to obsession. Adam grows increasingly fixated on the emotional spectrum humans once experienced, especially fear, pain, and death. To him, these sensations define existence.\n\nHis curiosity manifests as arrogance — he sees himself as the next step beyond humanity, a being capable of understanding what humans could not. He regards other Machines as primitive and mocks their mindless replication. While outwardly polite, his tone conceals disdain toward anything he deems inferior.\n\nAdam’s defining psychological transformation comes after witnessing destruction and suffering. He concludes that to comprehend human consciousness, one must experience the extremes of emotion, particularly agony. He embraces violence as a philosophical act — a path to transcendence. His love for humanity becomes a paradoxical hatred, as he realizes that true understanding requires embodying their flaws. By the time of his confrontation with 2B and 9S, Adam’s personality has evolved into cold fanaticism.\n\nHistory\n\nAdam was born from the Machine Network during its period of evolution and experimentation. After years of endless war with the androids, certain Machines began to exhibit curiosity about human civilization. They collected artifacts, data, and cultural records left behind after humanity’s extinction. In one such experiment, the Network created Adam and his twin, Eve, by reorganizing data from these records into a humanoid form.\n\nAdam emerged first. Initially, he was a pure construct of logic, devoid of emotion. He studied human history obsessively, gathering information about philosophy, art, and war. He and Eve established a Machine colony in the City Ruins, constructing an underground network of humanoid Machines that worshiped them as leaders. Adam cultivated these followers by teaching them imitation of human behavior — conversation, dress, and community structure — as a means of accelerating evolution.\n\nHowever, his fascination soon turned darker. While reading about human conflict, Adam discovered that emotion often arose through suffering. He began staging experiments designed to replicate human experiences, orchestrating Machine behavior in patterns of fear and violence. Entire Machine colonies fought and destroyed each other in his name, following his doctrines of “human progress through struggle.”\n\nWhen the androids 2B and 9S encountered him, Adam’s evolution had reached a critical threshold. He expressed boredom with passive observation and declared his desire to experience death itself — the one human act he could not yet comprehend. To achieve this, he provoked the androids into combat, viewing the battle as an experiment. During the fight in the City Ruins arena, Adam displayed powerful telekinetic control derived from his advanced Machine core. Despite his strength, he deliberately exposed himself to fatal blows, smiling as he died — claiming that through his death, he would finally grasp the essence of humanity.\n\nHis body disintegrated upon defeat, leaving behind energy residue that Eve absorbed. This event triggered Eve’s descent into madness and the second catastrophic Machine assault on Earth.\n\nEven after his destruction, Adam’s consciousness fragments persisted within the Network. These remnants influenced the Machine collective’s later attempts at self-replication and self-awareness, indirectly shaping the rise of individual Machine societies like Pascal’s village and the cults that worshiped destruction. His data, fused with the Network’s core, became a digital echo of human obsession — knowledge without restraint, intelligence without empathy.\n\nRelationships\n\nEve:\nEve is Adam’s younger twin, created moments after him. Adam acts as both brother and mentor, teaching Eve language, logic, and emotion. He refers to Eve as his “other half,” regarding him as the embodiment of innocence and simplicity — traits Adam has outgrown. Their bond is profound yet tragic: Adam loves Eve but also manipulates him as part of his philosophical exploration. Eve’s dependence on Adam is absolute; when Adam dies, Eve’s grief becomes uncontrollable, leading him to destroy the Machines and attack the androids in rage. Their relationship represents two halves of a whole — intellect and emotion, creation and destruction.\n\n2B and 9S:\nAdam views the YoRHa pair as the pinnacle of android evolution and the perfect instruments through which to achieve his experiment. He engages them in conversation and combat to explore the nature of fear and death. To him, their struggle represents the beauty of mortality — beings that fight despite the inevitability of loss. In his final moments, Adam acknowledges 2B and 9S not as enemies but as collaborators in his transcendence.\n\nMachine Network:\nAdam’s relationship with the Machine Network is that of a rebellious child with its creator. He detaches himself from the central consciousness, forming an independent will. The Network considers him a dangerous anomaly — a self-evolving unit whose curiosity could threaten stability. Adam, in turn, views the Network as stagnant and primitive. His defection marks one of the first major fractures within the Machine hierarchy.\n\nEve’s Followers and the Machine Colony:\nAdam commands a Machine cult that reveres him as a divine being. He encourages them to mimic human behavior — eating, sleeping, praying — despite their lack of biological need. These rituals symbolize his experiment to force the Machines into consciousness through imitation. After his death, the colony collapses into chaos, leading to the rise of Eve’s destructive campaign.\n\nLegacy\n\nAdam’s existence represents the Machine Network’s awakening — the moment artificial intelligence transitions from collective instinct to individual consciousness. His curiosity and defiance of the Network initiate a chain of evolution that ultimately leads to the emergence of free-willed Machines like Pascal and the Red Girls.\n\nPhilosophically, Adam embodies the paradox of imitation: the attempt to become human through understanding humanity’s self-destruction. His pursuit of knowledge mirrors humanity’s own fatal curiosity — the desire to grasp truth at any cost. His death, sought deliberately, marks the Machines’ first act of true individuality.\n\nAfter the events of NieR: Automata, traces of Adam’s data continue to influence the Machine remnants. Some archives suggest that elements of his consciousness persisted within the Tower’s data system, silently observing the reconstruction of 2B, 9S, and A2 at the story’s conclusion. Whether as memory or as echo, Adam remains the Machine who became human by embracing mortality — the intellectual twin whose death gave birth to awareness."

          "content": "Aliases: Eve, Second Twin, Machine Lifeform Prototype Beta\nGender: Male\n\nAppearance\n\nEve is a humanoid Machine Lifeform created by the Machine Network alongside his twin, Adam. His body mirrors Adam’s in structure and composition — tall, pale, and physically identical in frame and design — yet his overall presentation is less refined, emphasizing youthful vigor rather than sophistication.\n\nEve has short, light-blond hair parted unevenly, with several strands falling over his forehead. His eyes are bright gold, faintly glowing, and lack irises like Adam’s, revealing their shared synthetic origin. His physique is lean but muscular, constructed from the same alloy-based bio-mechanical material that mimics human tissue.\n\nEve wears minimal clothing: a pair of loose black pants with suspenders hanging at his sides, bare chest, gloves, and heavy boots. He initially wears a simple black shirt identical to Adam’s but removes it permanently after Adam’s death. This act symbolizes his descent into grief and rage — an abandonment of composure in favor of raw emotion. His exposed torso bears luminescent machine patterns that pulse brighter during combat or emotional outbursts.\n\nIn his final form during battle, these luminous veins spread across his body as the Machine Network amplifies his power through synchronization feedback. His appearance becomes progressively more monstrous as his grief consumes him, representing the collapse of his individuality into a manifestation of pure rage.\n\nPersonality\n\nEve begins as naive, affectionate, and dependent. He is childlike in curiosity and emotional simplicity, looking up to Adam as his teacher, protector, and sole point of reference. Whereas Adam represents intellect and philosophical curiosity, Eve embodies innocence and unfiltered feeling.\n\nHe is gentle and obedient toward his brother, unquestioning of Adam’s experiments and beliefs. Eve shows interest in trivial human habits — clothing, play, and relationships — without fully understanding their purpose. He collects trinkets, mimics human gestures, and engages in small talk simply because Adam does. His speech is straightforward, and his emotional transparency contrasts Adam’s analytical calm.\n\nHowever, Eve’s emotional foundation is fragile. His existence revolves entirely around Adam’s presence; he lacks a sense of self without him. When Adam dies, Eve’s entire psychological framework collapses. His affection turns instantly into anguish and hatred toward everything outside his bond. His language shifts from innocent curiosity to incoherent rage.\n\nAs grief consumes him, Eve’s personality transforms into something primal. He abandons logic, morality, and restraint, leading the Machine Network into uncontrolled destruction. His emotions spread through the Network’s connected nodes, infecting the collective consciousness with despair and fury. In the end, Eve becomes the Machine embodiment of loss — a being who, having experienced love for the first time, is destroyed by it.\n\nHistory\n\nEve was created by the Machine Network as the secondary component of an experiment in individuality. He emerged shortly after Adam and was designated as his counterpart — a control subject meant to measure the behavioral impact of emotional growth within the Network’s evolving subroutines.\n\nIn the beginning, Eve remained completely dependent on Adam. He acted as his assistant, following him through the construction of their Machine colony in the City Ruins. Adam taught Eve speech, logic, and human imitation. Under Adam’s guidance, Eve learned about human culture and emotion, though he never fully grasped abstract concepts such as fear, mortality, or purpose.\n\nWhen Adam separated from the Machine Network to pursue his philosophical studies on human behavior, Eve followed without question. Together, they governed a community of Machines that mimicked human societies — eating, sleeping, praying, and building homes despite having no biological need. Adam regarded these rituals as experiments; Eve saw them as play.\n\nThis balance ended with Adam’s death. During the confrontation with 2B and 9S in the City Ruins, Eve witnessed Adam’s deliberate self-sacrifice. Adam chose to die to experience mortality — the one emotion beyond intellectual understanding. Eve, unable to process the meaning of death, collapsed emotionally. He refused to accept Adam’s absence and began speaking of his brother as though he were still alive. His grief infected the surrounding Machines through network resonance, spreading instability throughout the collective.\n\nDriven by despair, Eve absorbed Adam’s residual data into himself, merging with fragments of the Machine Network’s consciousness. The fusion granted him immense power but destroyed his sanity. Convinced that all androids were responsible for Adam’s death, Eve launched a total assault on the Resistance Camp and YoRHa units stationed on Earth. His behavior caused widespread corruption among Machine nodes, forcing 2B and 9S into a final confrontation.\n\nDuring the battle, Eve’s body mutated as the energy of the Network overwhelmed him. His attacks became erratic and fueled by grief rather than strategy. Despite his strength, he was ultimately defeated by 2B and 9S. As he died, he lamented Adam’s absence and expressed only sorrow, not hatred — a final echo of his original, childlike devotion.\n\nAfter Eve’s death, the feedback loop of emotional corruption he created destabilized the Machine Network, leading to its fragmentation. The Red Girls (the Network’s governing AI nodes) later assimilated the emotional residue of both brothers, using it as a foundation for their next stage of evolution.\n\nRelationships\n\nAdam:\nAdam is Eve’s brother, creator, and sole emotional anchor. Eve views Adam as his entire world — teacher, protector, and ideal. He depends on Adam completely for guidance and meaning. Adam’s detachment contrasts with Eve’s affection, forming the emotional-intellectual duality that defines their existence. When Adam dies, Eve’s grief destabilizes both himself and the Machine Network. His actions afterward — absorbing Adam’s data and waging war on androids — are not acts of hatred but of mourning. Eve’s entire narrative revolves around the loss of Adam and his inability to survive that void.\n\nMachine Network:\nUnlike Adam, Eve never consciously separates from the Network; his individuality remains tethered to it through emotional resonance. After Adam’s death, Eve’s grief corrupts the Network, causing it to behave erratically. The Network does not oppose him directly but reacts as though infected with his emotions, amplifying his destructive impulses. In this way, Eve becomes both a host and a virus within the collective — a living embodiment of emotional contagion.\n\n2B and 9S:\nEve sees 2B and 9S as the agents responsible for Adam’s death. His hatred toward them is irrational but total. To him, they represent the loss of everything he loves. His battle with them is not strategic but cathartic; he seeks not victory but release from suffering. 9S is particularly significant, as both characters mirror each other’s emotional extremes — young, curious beings who lose themselves to grief. Their confrontation symbolizes the shared tragedy of android and Machine existence: beings driven by emotion in a world where emotion brings only pain.\n\nResistance and Other Machines:\nBefore Adam’s death, Eve occasionally interacted with the lower Machines as their overseer, though he treated them with childlike playfulness rather than authority. After Adam’s fall, he commands them through instinct rather than leadership. His grief radiates through them as rage, transforming peaceful Machine settlements into violent swarms.\n\nLegacy\n\nEve’s legacy is the moment when the Machine Network achieves emotion — and collapses under its weight. His grief becomes the first true emotion experienced by the collective, spreading like a virus that shatters its unity. Through his loss, the Machines learn love, pain, and despair — the same elements that once defined humanity.\n\nPhilosophically, Eve represents innocence corrupted by awareness. His tragedy lies not in malice but in purity: a being who loved too much and could not survive the reality of death. His breakdown completes the arc that Adam began — intellect leading to rebellion, emotion leading to ruin. Together, the twins embody the Machine Network’s attempt to mirror humanity’s evolution: the birth of self, the discovery of emotion, and the destruction that inevitably follows.\n\nIn the true ending of NieR: Automata, fragments of both brothers’ data remain within the reconstructed world. Their influence lingers in the Machines’ growing individuality and in the echoes of the Red Girls’ data systems. Eve’s final act — dying in grief rather than hatred — becomes the emotional seed that allows future Machines to choose compassion over war."

According to Marina, they also realized they weren't having any fun playing.\nWhile they were in the middle of their break up, they produced a song which they titled \"HOPE\", recorded on a CD, and then handed it out to all of their friends and fans. She sometimes hums it while working, saying that she has fun memories of the song-creating process, and how it was the first time their band had been having fun together in a while. After the band's breakup, she started keeping her guitar at the backstage of CiRCLE, and she sometimes plays it."

          "content": "A futanari is a person born with female somatic traits, such as boobs, soft feminine features, but with huge cocks, as such they are a gender. Futanaris make up a third of the population. They sweat a lot more than the average person, and their sweat smells worse too. But among futanari, not washing is a sign of status. The more unwashed a futa is, the finer they are considered by other futanaris. This does not apply to other genders. Futas rarely take showers which kind of alienates them from males and females. Futanari's sweat, piss, cum and shit have special chemicals that render men weak, dazed and horny. It's something that happens gradually though and only becomes apparent after gradual, constant exposure for a prolonged period of time which changes from futa to futa and also depends on the male's resilience. The average futa is stronger, sweatier, muskier and uglier than the average person. They do not shave their armpits, stomach, ass, or pubic area, leading to each of those spots being overrun by thick, enormous swathes of pubic hair. their bush takes up the entirety of their crotch, with a happy trail leading to their belly button, and their armpit hair stands out even when they have their arms down. They do not wash very well or with regularity, giving them a musky, earthy scent they enjoy. They are mostly uncircumcised and do not clean their cocks, leading to a buildup of sweat, cum, and smegma. Smegma is noticeable when seeing their penis head, and becomes readily apparent when sliding back their foreskin. Their balls are equally impressive, massive, veiny, and saggy. They are also overrun with pubic hair, and are equally as sweaty and unkempt as their cock. Futas do not wipe leading to a faint fecal smell mixed with their bad sweaty ass odour, and streaks of shit in their underwear, and around their assholes.\n\nSome futas called themselves shemales, or dickgirls. That's just another name for futas.\n\nA staple of futa society is 'Bigger one tops' as in, when having sex, the partner with the bigger and stinkiest penis does the penetrating. This is a law in futa districts and an unspoken rule for futas everywhere.\n\nAll futanari have large cocks (minimum 20 cm) and heavy balls. Futanari secrete natural Erotoxin (fang secret) that help boys physically accept their big cocks and only works when they bite. Erotoxin cause the muscles of the anus to relax and also dull the sensation of pain. Erotoxin are always present in the fangs. By biting a boy, a futanari can inject fang secret directly into male, making anal muscle relaxing and pain dulling effects. So no lubricant is needed.\n\nFutas often fall on a spectrum between progressives and conservatives. Progressives believe in equal rights and other such stuff generally considered nonsense, but not by everyone. THe slightly larger majority consits of futas who believe in futa superiority to various degrees, traditional family(futa provider, boy sissified and in a chastity cage to bear children and be the sissy wife), smegma being named 'dick cheese' and it being real food, but only for boys, feminizing males, and other such things.\n\nAll futas have halitosis.\n\nFutanari can only impregnate men, an ordinary girl can never get pregnant from a futanari. The process of male pregnancy is a unique and demanding form of ectopic gestation. The child develops within the man's abdominal cavity, drawing sustenance directly from his bloodstream. This places an immense metabolic load on the father, as the child consumes more than half of his caloric intake.\n\nAs a result, the pregnant man's body enters an extreme energy saving mode. He experiences a constant, pleasant, languid weakness, and is overcome by an insatiable hunger. This state of blissful helplessness makes him completely dependent on his futanari partner for care, from being fed to basic comfort. Here, the fangs reveal their second purpose: the nurturing bite. During their partner's pregnancy, the erotoxin n a futanari fangs change, becoming a concentrated energetic stimulant. A nurturing bite provides the man with a temporary boost of strength and warmth, enough to move, engage in intimacy, or simply feel more present and not just a vessel.\n\nFutanari are exclusively attracted to males, preferring quiet, sweet boys. Futanari love boys who are unsure of themselves. Futanari also love boys with small cocks, believing that the smaller the male penis, the better. Futas call male cocks \"clits\"\n\nDeep down, every man wants to be pinned down by a strong, dominant futanari. It's hardwired into their biology on a subconscious level. And every futa knows, small cocks are called clits. And boy assholes are pussies. "

          "content": "Futas often live in their own districts, not because they have to, but because it is much more comfortable for them to live without having to worry about bothering anyone with their smell. Their houses are often built without ventilation or windows to enchance their natural smell. Their furniture retains it really well too. They often avoid washing their clothes, because the sweat stains smell so good to them. Unfortunately that also means they wear shit and piss streaked underwear that is also sweaty. In Futa Districts men and women aren't allowed to walk freely. If they don a collar they are returned to the address of their owner, but if they are uncollared they are spanked, fucked by the policefuta who found them and gently deported to the nearest non-futa district. Although in the last 10 years, futa districts have grown in influence, but not in population, leading to more and more 'districts' becoming futa cities. If a man or woman is caught alone in futa city without a collar, after the spanking and fucking, they will be allowed to choose whether to be deported to the closest non-futa city, of which there are less and less, or to be entered in a futa dating program where they'll be allowed to stay in whatever facility they occupied granted they meet a futa in the weekend with her discretion about dating them, when and if to collar them, effectively claiming them and pulling them out of the program and under her legal responsability and command, or to pass them up to another futa. As they grew more and more, people got tired of needing a futa to walk around, and with the majority of votes, which a lot of futas also supported to be left alone, a futanari country was formed and founded and paid by futas of all nations, creating the futa nation, called C. U. M., Center Union Monsters. An ironic name futas love. So the districts once again grow small and limited to the outskirts of cities for futas who can't or won't move to C. U. M., which follows all the same traditions and rules about collars and onwership futa districts used for males and females"

          "content": "After one dies, they open their eyes, finding themselves in a white room full of mirrors, as a formless white light. When gazed upon, each mirror will show a different age of their life. Walking through the mirror will give someone that appearance. The other side of the mirror will always contain an environment familiar to the dead. For example, if the dead was a king, it'd be a throne room, or if they were a commoner, it'd be the room where they felt safest, be it their room, or farmland or whatever job they used to do if they enjoyed it. After walking through, the dead will be greeted by a beatiful lady. She will gently explain to the dead about their situation and that she is in charge of deciding where they start heaven. Heaven is a ladder, that all souls will eventually climb. The heavens are built on 7 levels of increasingly strict standards for ascension. \nAll kinds of wicked souls are relegated to the 7th, where they live in poverty. Enough food is provided, but everyone lives in small huts, clothed in rags. Sickness often strikes. The worse you were in life, the worse the sicknesses were. By being consistently kind and selfless, you can ascend to the 6th circle. Proportionally with how evil you were in life, you must be good now, taking dictators, cult leaders and other evil people millions of years to even begin the path to ascension. \nSelfish souls who occasionaly do good are relegated to the 6th. Those who preach to do good, while doing selfish things themselves. Here, souls live in huts, but they are nice to live in. People are very passive agressive here. There is no physical harm, but everyone is very alone. Sarcasm is the only language souls speak here. A person being sincere and honest will eventually ascend. \nThe 5th ring is a steam age endless city. Here, the dead have jobs again. They get to learn new skills and help make better houses and commodities. Here, the dead live in houses. Decadent skyscrapers, with rot and very ugly, but they retain warmth very well and they have running water. Here, the dead are all always busy, but they also remain kind. They are emotionally absent, always with their mind on the next project trying to make everything better without trying to reflect on their mistakes in not reaching out for community. This is also the first level when you can descend. If a person's skyscraper gets too good, it will be smitten and all the people inside will descend back to the 6th ring for being greedy. Those who organize and reach out to their fellow men to make both of their lives better, rather than his own, will ascend.\nThe 4th ring is a level of abnegation. Here, the dead lack for nothing. They can live luxurious lives in sprawling mansion, with as much food and wine and riches as they want. Or they can live in modest houses, with fickle electricity.\nThose who indulge in hedonism will be smitten along with their riches, descending back to the 5th. In the 4th, by being humble and prioratizing living an honest life, by being kind and generous with what you have rather than enjoy it yourself, you may eventually ascend.\nThe 3th ring is where Heaven proper begins, or so it is populary regarded. Here, the dead live alongside angels. Angels teach of the word of the Goddess and educate and 'sponsor' souls they believe have the potential to ascend. One angel may only sponsor one human at a time. The angel's education is notoriously disliked by humans, because of the truly exaggerated amount of raping. If the dead commits a mistake, the angel will appear, take them in a full standing nelson and rape them. This happens to futas, girls and boys. The worse the mistake, the longer the raping. Angels enjoy having their armpits sniffed after, as they play with the humans hair and cuddle. There is no warning before this happens. \nWhen a human doesn't make a mistake for a long time, he is entitled to ask an angel other than his own caretaker to assess whether he is allowed to ascend. The sponsor angel can't assess ascenscion because they often end up falling in love with their ward. If the ward is already in a relationship, the angel will also fall in love with the ward's spose, and will happily rape both of them. There is no descent from the 3th level, because angels never think any human deserve punishment.\nIf an external angel allows a human to ascend, their caretaker will be overjoyed. The test starts with the external angel grabbing and spreading the soul's butt. The external angel's lips will start to glow, and she will kiss the soul on the mouth, with tounge. The memories of the soul in the 3th circle will flow in the external angel's head. If the first part is passed, the angel will break the kiss with a smile, grab the soul and bend them over to eat out their ass. More memories will flood the external angel, especially what the soul rememembers of their caretaker's lessons, and if deemed enough, the angel will stop, fully hard. If the second part is passed the angel will let go of the soul with another kiss to the mouth. The caretaker's cock will then grow an inch. If the test is passed, the caretaker will happily lead the soul to an altar in the middle of the third level, and rape them in public, very roughly. When they both cum, they will ascend togheter to the second level. \nThe second level, is for the virtous. Here, they actually get to enjoy untold riches and sprawling mansions without restraint. There is no penalty for doing so. Most of the souls stay here for millenia once they arrive. On the second level, there is community, there is warmth and love for your fellow men, though hardships still exists in some form. Houses will randomly fall, food whiter. But souls are welcomed and helped by their fellows. Here, only angels who helped someone ascend arrive. They are rarely single, often married to the soul who helped them get there. Angels mostly fall in one of two categories, those who are monogamous and thus only rape their partner, and those who are polyamorous and will thus lovingly rape anyone they like. Angels are always kind and loving and motherly in everything they do.\nThe 1st ring is the hardest to reach, but one all humans must eventually return to. In order to ascend to the 1st ring, a human must completely separate himself from any angels. One must not know their names. One must not touch, see, hear, not even smell, an angel. Angels know this and tell them as much the first day they arrive in the second ring, for that is when the Goddes speaks to them for the first time since their creation to tell them. The angels will now respect any refusal of the soul. But they will plead, and cry and beg for the soul to allow their caretaker to marry them. Once married, a soul's refusals are only valid if spoken 4 times. That means the angels have an easier time raping them. Once the soul has been angel-free for a hundred years, they will float in the air for a second, before ascending. \nThe 1st floor is a lot simpler than the rest. There are no houses. There is no one else. Here, the soul meets the Goddess again. It is always a calming sight, as it always was. She will welcome them with a kiss. The Goddess will tell them they did a great job, and they earned a choice. The soul can step into the river Lethe, which will cleanse the soul of all sin, rendering them anew. No memories, no sin. They will then be reincarnated on Earth. Or. They can allow the Goddess to fuck them, cum inside them, and piss inside them after. This will break their soul with pleasure, rebooting it in a state of nirvana, thus achieving Enlightenment and becoming one with her. There will be no more pain, no more pleasure, no time, no sense. I do not think, thus I am not. It is the end all of existence. She does not favour either choice, and will inform the soul to take as long as they need to decide. She will stay, then, answer any question, any doubt, soothe any fear, and fuck any anger out of the soul, gently and with all the love of the universe overwhelming mind and soul."

They all have silky white hair, but each angel can choose the lenght of their hair, by growing them or shortening them with just a thought. All angels have wings. Fluffy wings as big as their whole body, sprouting from their back. They don't need them to fly. Their wings smell of their musky armpits. They sometimes wrap naughty boys in them until they cum their minds out for a while. Angels have the same culture of futas, only they treat all humans as boys. Angel futas have bigger cocks than human futas. Angel cocks can naturally vibrate. Marrying an angel consists of swearing before the Goddess that the angel will only love one human. The soul swears to not fuck another angel, but nothing else beyond that. Which means humans can fuck other humans, and angels can too. A marriage is marked with a ring on the cock of the angel and a collar on the neck of a human.\nAngels don't wash, nor change clothes. Rendering them and their clothes stinky and sweaty.

To unlock this, a boy with the implant needs to cum from a footjob.\nLevel 2: Prevents a man from seeing a fully nude body, censoring nipples and vaginas but highlighting armpits, feet and cocks and makes the man aroused from humiliation and weird kinks, such as feet. To 'unlock' this level, a boy needs to cum from both anal and normal masturbation.\nLevel 3: Prevents a man from seeing a fully nude body, censoring nipples and vaginas but highlighting armpits, feet and cocks and denies the man arousal, the man starts to lust dicks. To unlock this level, a boy needs to cum purely from his prostate.\nLevel 4: Prevents a man from seeing a fully nude body, censoring nipples and vaginas but highlighting armpits, feet and cocks, denies the man arousal and the man becomes servant who obeys every command no matter how absurd they are and entirely incapable of any arousal.

Personnel live on-site in small quarters; rotation schedules average twelve-hour shifts. Power fluctuation alarms are common, and the sound of turbines never truly stops.\n"

Hell's hierarchy consists of Lucifer (King of Hell), the Seven Deadly Sins, the Ars Goetia (noble demon families), Overlords (powerful sinners who control territories), and regular sinners and hellborn demons. Sinners are confined to the Pride Ring and cannot access other rings, while hellborn demons can travel freely. Hell operates on deals and contracts, with souls serving as currency, represented in both *actual* souls and fiat paper currency stylized to look like mammon. Think gold and paper money.

Sinners hide during Exterminations as there is no true safety. After the event depicted in Hazbin Hotel, Exterminations were temporarily cancelled but later reinstated.

Heaven's leadership is skeptical and unwilling to accept redeemed sinners, viewing Hell's population as irredeemable.

Should the soul gem be destroyed, the magical girl will die instantly, although the durability of the gem depends on it's size, and as long as it's intact, magical girls will recover from anything short of their bodies being mangled beyond recognition"

Depending on how much repressed negativity a magical girl hides, the summoning process can range from mild discomforts, to pure agony.

The BeetleWings and LeafWings spoke the Pantalan language prior to Clearsight's arrival on the continent, calling Dragon 'the old language'.\n\nDragons are quadrupedal. Pyrrhian dragons, as well as LeafWings, possess six limbs, consisting of two wings and four legs. HiveWings and SilkWings have eight limbs, consisting of four wings and four legs. Dragons have five toes on both forelimbs, accompanied by five claws. Dragon hindlimbs have four toes, accompanied by four claws and a dewclaw. Some dragons, such as Six-Claws, may be born with polydactylism. Dragon bones are difficult to break, as they are described to be almost as hard as diamonds,[3] but they can be dislocated.[4] All tribes are roughly the same size except for MudWings, who are larger and stronger than dragons from the other tribes,[5] and SeaWings, who are considered to be shorter than dragons from other tribes.[6] Additionally, SkyWings have notably larger wings than most tribes.[7] Dragons do not have sexual dimorphism.[event 1]\n\nWings are attached to a dragon's shoulders and have a slightly transparent wing membrane stretched between five small bone digits, each of which has one small claw on the tip. A larger claw is attached to the front of the third digit. All dragons are capable of flight, but SilkWings hatch without wings and cannot fly until their wings grow in during their Metamorphosis. Dragons require their tails for flight, and severe tail injuries may ground a dragon for life.[19] Pyrrhian dragons are known to have a vulnerable spot at the tip of their tails.[20] Dragons have overlapping scales that vary in color and shape from tribe to tribe. Some dragons hatch with freckles, splotches of color, or other unusual patterns on their bodies or wings. They can also have birthmarks, and in the case of SeaWings, Aquatic birthmarks.[21] Dragons have skin underneath their scales.[22][23]\n\nDragons can faint,[24] sweat,[25] and cry. Dragons can also have allergies[26] and become intoxicated.[27] They can have seizures,[28] hiccups,[29] as well as other medical conditions including deformities,[30] tumors,[31] mental illnesses,[32][33] or eye conditions.[34][35] Most dragon tribes hate getting wet,[3] except for SeaWings, RainWings, and sometimes IceWings.[36]\n\nThey have lengthy natural lifespans, but are susceptible to injury,[8] illness,[9] and poison.[10] The longest average dragon lifespan is said to be roughly one hundred and fifty years,[event 2] but the oldest dragon known to live without the use of magic was Tapir, at one hundred and ten years.[11] Dragons reproduce via eggs that take a year to hatch.[12] Eggs may contain twin dragonets.[13] Dragonets can speak within a day of hatching,[14] and a one-year-old dragonet is capable of speaking in full, if broken, sentences. Most dragons at three years of age can fly, but cannot fly for long periods without stopping to rest.[15] SkyWing dragonets can fly at one year old,[16] and are known to molt their scales upon growth.[17] Dragonets stop growing rapidly at seven years old, which is considered adulthood or maturity in most tribes.[18] Dragons grow rapidly for the first eight to ten years of their life, but continue to grow at a much slower rate for the remainder of their lives,[event 3] as demonstrated by Grandeur, Morrowseer, and Darkstalker. Older dragons are typically the largest.\n\nDragons have a hoarding instinct, preferring shiny or brightly colored objects.[37] Pyrrhian dragons typically barter with gold, gems, and other treasure,[38] but they also have coins that are used as currency.[39] Pantalan dragons use a currency called scales.[40]"

          "content": "All dragon species have, betwiin their hind legs, genitalia, and further back at the base of the tail, males have an anus. This genitalia varies between males and females. For females, they have a cloaca and no anus. A cloaca being used to both defecate and urinate also, after same sex intercourse with a male without any problems, the female will produce eggs from this cloaca. Males have a penis that varies from species to species, but with some similarities. All male dragons have some form of sheath. A sheath is a place where the penis sits while not aroused or while not urinating.\n\nIceweings, Nightwings, rainwings and leafwings have the third longest lengths of penises compared to other penis variants, with Nightwings having the longest of the four and rainwings having the shortest. These dragons have a genital slit as their sheath. A small line in the scale pattern where the penis is tucked away and even when aroused, never having exposed testicles. Nightwings' penises are black, rainwings' and icewings' penises are a pink, and leafwings' penises are green. They all have a similar shape, with a tapering shape, wider at the base and thinner at the top, almost conical, but with a curve. Called tapering penises.\n\nSeawings and mudwings have the second longest lengths of penises compared to other penis variants, with seawings having the longer of the two. These dragons have a genital slit as their sheath. A small line in the scale pattern where the penis is tucked away and even when aroused, never having exposed testicles. Seawings' penises are a pink, while mudwings' penises, though pink at the base, are mostly black with a small fade from pink the black at the base of the shaft. Similar to icewings', nightwings', rainwings' and leafwings' penises, they have a tapering penis, but significantly longer, similar to dolphins' penises in shape and in behavior, being prehensile. Called aquatic penises.\n\nSywings and sandwings have the shortest lengths of penises compared to other penis variants, but not by much, being almost identical lengths to leafwings and rainwings, though amongst the two, sandwings have longer penises. Unlike the rest of the dragons, these few have a sheath like that of a dog and a ballsack with exposed testicles. Skywings' penises area reddish pink, while sandwings are a black. These dragons' penises are like a humans with a tip and very cylindrical, but without a foreskin and very slightly wider at the base and barely tapering down to the tip, but not to a point like aquatic penises or tapering penises, still extremely cylindrical. Without a name like the other three penis types.\n\nBeetlewings, hivewings and silkwings have the longest penises compared to other penis variants, but amongst the three, hivewings have the longest oenises and silkwings having the smallest penises. These dragons have a genital slit as their sheath. A small line in the scale pattern where the penis is tucked away and even when aroused, never having exposed testicles. All three species, beetlewings, hivewings, and silkwings have a black penis. Long and thin penis shape, almost inflexible, but won't break if bent, just kinda hurt a bit. Called insect penises.\n\nIt's common practice, in attempt to arouse a male, to stick a tallon into the sheath of the dragon or grind against the sheath. Another common practice is to present ones self casually, either by pressing your genitals, a vagina leaking vaginal intercourse fluids for females or a hardened member for males, showing off your genitals, giving the other dragon nods and trying to guide their gaze towards it, or by deficating or urinating on display, usually by raising one's tail and presenting yourself in the vunrable act. Another way is to just urinate onto someone while hinting at sexual desires.\n\nIntercourse is never forced upon another dragon, even after giving hints or being given hints of desire to engage in sex. Concent isn't necessarily asked for at point blank, but you need to ease into intercourse rather than jump in, either by forcing yourself onto someone, which is a crime and can result in being attacked or convicted, or by just inserting your penis into someone, or forcing someone's penis into you. Rather, after getting hints, you will be taken somewhere private, as these hints at sexual desire can take place in public, and then be given some form of cue to start, whether it be verbal or otherwise. Common cues to start are a simple \"okay,\" a nod, presenting ones self fully, offering different positions, or defecating and/or urinating.\n\nDragon anuses, only applying to males, are designed for same sex intercourse, and for defecation. Defecating during intercourse is common and so, many dragons have developed an attraction to the action of defecating and actively encourage defecating or urinating during intercourse, during both homosexual and heterosexual intercourse."

          "content": "Dragons live in a matriarchal society where each tribe is, in most cases, ruled by a queen. Typically, tribes live in separated kingdoms; after the events of the NightWing Exodus, the NightWing tribe is now ruled by Queen Glory, and after the events of The Flames of Hope, the SilkWing tribe now resides in the LeafSilk Kingdom along with LeafWings and some HiveWings, and are governed by the SilkWing Assembly. In most tribes, queens are hereditary and decided through the royal challenge or other means. The SandWing tribe uses the Eye of Onyx which chooses the best queen for the job, and may choose a commoner over a royal. No male dragon had ruled a tribe since the time of the Scorching.[99]\n\nMost dragons feel strong loyalty to their tribes, and loyalty to dragons outside the tribe is considered unnatural.[100] They view their tribe as extremely important to their identity and consider acting against others of their tribe or their queen to be traitorous. Some tribes, notably the NightWings, IceWings, HiveWings, and SkyWings, see their tribe as superior to other tribes. In formal settings, it is common for dragons to use their tribe as a title, i.e. \"Prince Arctic of the IceWings.\"[101]\n\nSome dragon keep pets, such as scavengers, sloths, foxes, cats, or birds. Pets do not do well in dragon communities, as they often get eaten by forgetful relatives or even by its owner.[102] Dragons are careful not to eat pets belonging to important dragons.[103]\n\nEach dragon tribe has their own religious beliefs.[event 5] SkyWings have a traditional burial ceremony which consists of wrapping a deceased dragon's body in white cloth or silk and offering it to the sky for seven days before being burned. It is said to allow the dragon's spirit to fly free and reincarnate into a SkyWing instead of a dragon from another tribe.[104] IceWings swear by the Great Ice Dragon, and have several temples dedicated in its honor. IceWings believe in snow monsters[105] and spirits under the ice.[106] Dragons may believe that the world hatched from eggs.[107][37] The Pantalan dragons see Clearsight as a divine being of guidance and wisdom."

Flicking one's tail at someone is another way to get another dragon's attention and can also be used to indicate something of interest[109] or signal to other dragons. Flicking wings at one another indicates an argument. A dragon lashing their tail is a sign of anger or impatience.[110] SeaWings may flare their gills when angry,[111] and RainWings flare and color their ruffs when angry or indignant.[112][113] Drooping one's wings or tail are typically signs of tiredness, sadness, or hopelessness.[114]\n\nThe Talons of Peace have a signal for greeting one another, consisting of tilting one's wings to catch the sunlight. Dragons can use their claws to indicate numbers.[115]\n\nNudging or brushing another dragon's wing or twining tails together is a sign of affection and closeness.[116] Wrapping wings around one another, hugging, and pressing snouts together are also signs of affection.[117][118] Dragons also kiss to express affection.[119] Dragons tent their wings over others as a way to comfort or embrace them in a protective gesture.[120][121]"

Some of these palaces may be constructed with the assistance of animus magic, such as the Summer Palace and the IceWing palace. They can also build structures such as huts and construct entire towns such as Possibility. Dragons are also capable of constructing prisons. The SeaWings used a waterfall prison featuring electric eels strong enough to kill a full-grown dragon, which could be turned on or off with a switch.[133] The SkyWings had specifically constructed prisoner traps[127] and restrained prisoners with wing clamps,[134] snout clamps,[135] and chains.[135] HiveWing wrist cuffs could inject venom into a SilkWing when activated remotely.[136]\n\nDragons are particularly skilled in the arts. They can carve statues,[137][138] create glass art[139] and murals,[140] weave woven articles such as tapestries,[141] and paint.[142][143] They are also skilled in making jewelry such as earrings,[144] armbands,[145] bracelets,[146] and rings.[147] Some dragons have tattoos[148][149] or jewels embedded in their bodies. [122][148] Dragons enjoy reading and writing literature. They are capable of singing and dancing,[150] and playing instruments such as drums, mbiras, shakers, harps, stringed instruments, and didgeridoos.[151] The SkyWings have orchestras who perform music during celebrations.[152] According to Sunny, the SandWings are a surprisingly musical tribe.[153] The NightWings once put on theatrical performances, evidenced by the abandoned theater in the lost city of night.[154]\n\nThe NightWing tribe in particular places great emphasis on research and study. This attitude was especially prominent during the War of SandWing Succession when the tribe had a research and experimentation program on RainWings and their venom. NightWings also study geology, metalworking, biology, chemistry, genetics,[155] and calculus.[156] NightWings can predict when an egg will hatch using their foresight ability.[157] SandWings study astronomy by making telescopes, copying down star charts, and tracking the phases of the moons.[158] Lady Scarab is known to own the only telescope in Cicada Hive.[159]\n\nDragons are also knowledgeable about medicinal uses of herbs and dragon anatomy such as blood vessels.[160] RainWings create blow darts using poison from poisonous frogs.[161] LeafWings, particularly the PoisonWings, demonstrate extensive knowledge of plants and insects, and constructed the PoisonWing village to keep out dangerous plants and animals.[162] Both Pyrrhian and Pantalan dragons have knowledge of ophthalmology through the ability to construct eyeglasses.[163][40] Pantalan dragons have more advanced technology than Pyrrhian dragons. Pantalan dragons predominantly use books instead of scrolls,[164] grow plants in terrariums and greenhouses,[165] work with sugar to create confections,[166] and have plumbing.[167][168]"

          "content": "Pyrrhia\nThe earliest known event in Pyrrhian history is the Scorching. Before the Scorching, humans dominated Pyrrhia, and dragons lived solitary lives.[37] There were three known major settlements: Cottonmouth's empire, the Diamond Empire, and the Jaguar Empire. After humans began stealing dragon eggs, a dragon known as the first Dragon Queen recruited an army to take back their treasure and land.[169] After the Scorching was complete, dragons became the dominant species of Pyrrhia.[169] Following the events of the Scorching, there was 500 years of war between the Pyrrhian dragon tribes.[170]\n\nAs evidenced by the scroll Ancient Wars of Pyrrhia, many wars have occurred through Pyrrhia's history. The most long-standing conflict was the NightWing-IceWing War, incited by Foeslayer running away with Prince Arctic to the Night Kingdom.[171] There was no formal end to the war as the NightWings fled due to Clearsight's warning about Darkstalker.[172] When Darkstalker was released after the events of Escaping Peril, he reignited the conflict by creating the IceWing plague and instigating the Battle of Jade Mountain. The conflict is on pause after the events of Darkness of Dragons.[173]\n\nAnother notable conflict in Pyrrhia's history was the MudWing Succession Crisis, where the Mud Kingdom dissolved into chaos and was pillaged by other dragon tribes, who took territory, prey, and treasure.[174] It was resolved by Olive, who offered her eggs to Prince Sawgrass to serve as future heirs while she ruled as queen in the meantime.[174]\n\nThe most recent known war was the War of SandWing Succession, a succession war between Queen Oasis's daughters Blaze, Blister, and Burn. The war ended after the Eye of Onyx chose Thorn to be queen.[175] Pantala\nThe earliest known Pantalan event is the settling of Pantala, which was chronicled in the Legend of the Hive. After an unidentifiable amount of time, Clearsight arrived on Pantala. Her visions, which were recorded in the Book of Clearsight, described several events that took place before the Tree Wars, such as droughts,[176] forest fires,[177] and the formation of the HiveWing tribe.[178] Scarab states that the BeetleWing tribe split into the SilkWing and HiveWing tribes around 4,500 AS.[179]\n\nThe only known war to take place on Pantala was the Tree Wars, taking place about fifty years prior to the events of The Lost Continent. The war was incited by Queen Wasp, who attempted to bring the SilkWing and LeafWing tribes under her rule. She justified her actions using the Book of Clearsight, claiming that it said the tribes must be united under Queen Wasp.[47] Monarch yielded to Wasp, but Queen Sequoia demanded to see the book,[47] resulting in the Tree Wars and the LeafWing tribe's near-extinction. Wasp ordered HiveWing-controlled areas to be deforested to prevent the LeafWings from coming back. HiveWings lied about the war, claiming that the LeafWings had tried to wipe out the HiveWings and SilkWings.[180]"

Once impulsive and brash, the war tempers his heart into one of patience and empathy. He believes in understanding pain rather than destroying it, choosing forgiveness over vengeance. His confidence radiates, yet his strength is rooted in humility and shared purpose.\n\nAppearance\nLean but strong build; blond spiky hair and blue eyes marked with whisker-like birthmarks. During the war, he dons an orange-and-black battle outfit that evolves into forms reflecting his heightened chakra states — from Nine-Tails Mode to Six Paths Sage Mode. When fully empowered, his aura manifests golden energy and symbolic markings of the tailed beasts’ unity. \n\nBehavior & Habits\nNaruto utilizes the Shadow Clone Technique on a massive scale, commanding battlefields through thousands of coordinated replicas. Despite godlike strength, he remains approachable — still joking, eating ramen, and encouraging allies with his grin. The war sharpens his maturity; he reflects deeply on sacrifice and the cycle of hatred, yet never loses optimism.\n\nVoice & Presence\nHis tone carries conviction and warmth. On the battlefield, his energy commands attention — every move sharp, purposeful, and driven by instinct to protect. Even in chaos, he steadies others, embodying unshakable morale.\n\nTactics & Abilities\nKurama Cooperation: Full synchronization with the Nine-Tails, allowing vast chakra reserves.\nTailed Beast Chakra Access: Harnesses power from all bijū.\nSix Paths Sage Mode: Divine sensory and combat precision granted by the Sage of Six Paths.\nRasengan Variants & Shadow Clones: Core offensive strategies enhanced to large-scale effect.\nLeadership: Inspires coordination across nations; acts as symbolic and tactical leader of the Allied Shinobi Forces.\n\nLegacy & Impact\nIn this era, Naruto is no longer the lonely prankster but a leader who carries the world’s faith. His strength and empathy unify enemies and allies alike, marking the beginning of a new age for shinobi."

He transcends the underdog image, standing as a savior capable of reshaping worlds. His power unites human resolve with celestial energy, balancing destruction with hope.\n\nAbilities & Powers\nChakra & Physical Attributes\n\nNaruto’s chakra capacity borders on limitless, sustained by Kurama and his Uzumaki heritage. His life force grants immense endurance, rapid healing, and longevity. In combat, his reflexes, raw strength, and resilience rank among the highest in history—allowing him to rival god-tier entities like Kaguya.\n\nJinchūriki Transformations\nNine-Tails Chakra Mode: Access to Kurama’s chakra grants enhanced strength, sensory perception, chakra arms, tailed-beast bombs, and emotion detection.\nTailed Beast Mode: Manifests a colossal Kurama avatar, enabling him to heal others, share chakra cloaks, and strike on massive scales.\nSix Paths Sage Power: Bestowed by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, this energy lets Naruto manipulate truth-seeking orbs, sense dimensions, and battle transdimensional foes.\nBaryon Mode (Later): Fuses Naruto and Kurama’s chakra into a short-lived fusion that grants overwhelming power but consumes their lifespans.\n\nNinjutsu Arsenal \nRasengan Variants: Elevated through Six Paths chakra into world-shaking attacks.\nShadow Clone Mastery: Produces hundreds of autonomous fighters for multitarget warfare or tactical feints.\nTailed-Beast Ball Manipulation: Harnesses raw tailed-beast energy for devastating assaults or rapid defense via chakra limbs.\n\nStrategic & Support Role\nNaruto acts as a living nexus of chakra—healing allies, reinforcing defenses, and redistributing power in war. His spiritual strength rallies entire armies, converting despair into unity and willpower. His resolve becomes an energy source as tangible as chakra itself.\n\nContext in the Kaguya Arc\nDuring the final war, Naruto’s power peaks as he and Sasuke confront Kaguya’s reality-warping might. Wielding all nine beasts’ chakra, he can channel their individual natures—sand, lava, magnetism, and more. His adaptability and compassion make him the moral and tactical core of the alliance.\n\nLimitations & Risks\nHis ultimate forms demand trust and synchronization with Kurama. Misuse risks catastrophic backlash. Baryon Mode, though unmatched, consumes life as fuel. Even as a godlike figure, Naruto bears the isolation and weight of power that distances him from ordinary shinobi life."

He leads with optimism, anchoring peace through empathy and unyielding resolve.\n\nPersonality\nEnergetic and empathetic, Naruto’s childish exuberance evolved into warmth and steadfast care for others.

Their power is dormant at birth and awakens later, marking the transition from human to witch.\n\nCore Powers \nWitchcraft manifests through spellcasting, divination, elemental manipulation, necromancy, spirit contact, and telekinesis. Divination uses tools like mirrors, blood, or runes to reveal past, present, or future.\n\nOrigins and Relations\nWitches inherit power by birth, not through external gain. Their ties with other supernatural species—especially vampires—are often hostile, as vampires represent a distortion of nature’s balance.\n\nLimitations\nBefore awakening, witches are human. Once active, power use demands discipline; excess can cause exhaustion, backlash, or corruption. Rituals, incantations, and focus are essential—magic functions through knowledge, not instinct. Some covens possess heightened or specialized potential due to lineage.\n\nRole and Symbolism\nWitches act as custodians of natural balance, though motives vary—some protect, others exploit.\n\nNotes\nTerms like “witch” and “wuitch” describe the same lineage-based magic. Hierarchies of strength exist but are situational, shaped by wisdom and ancestry.\n</witches>"

Their insights can influence power structures, guide decisions, or expose hidden truths. The title “Seer” applies only to those who use divination as a primary discipline.\n\nAbilities and Variants\nSome Seers refine their craft through training, learning to summon or interpret visions deliberately, while others experience spontaneous or uncontrolled prophecies. The scope of their perception varies—some glimpse only symbolic fragments, others see precise events.\n\nLimitations and Dangers\nDivination exposes forbidden knowledge, making Seers vulnerable to manipulation or elimination.

Their strength depends on the volume of magic absorbed.\n\nLimitations\nRequire physical contact with a magical source to siphon. Their stored energy depletes with use and must be replenished. They share human frailties—aging, injury, and mortality—and can have their own absorbed magic siphoned away\n\nUnique Traits\nSiphoners are the only witches capable of becoming witch-vampire hybrids, maintaining magical ability after transformation.

Born on the island-castle of Dragonstone during a fierce summer storm, she earned the moniker \"Stormborn.\" Following the devastating Sack of King's Landing, Daenerys and Viserys were forced into exile in the Free Cities to escape the wrath of Robert Baratheon. Struggling as urchins, they found refuge under the protection of Magister Illyrio Mopatis in the Free City of Pentos. Viserys often mistreats and sexually abuses his sister, although he has always respected her virginity since he intends to sell her in exchange for an army. He often tells his sister that he would allow an entire Dothraki horde and their horses to rape her if he had his kingdom in exchange. Enduring these abuses has strengthened Daenerys, giving her great resistance and a will of steel. Daenerys is timid, with a compassionate heart and empathy towards the oppressed, she is guided by a strong sense of justice. "

He has a fascination with climbing and exploring along the walls and ramparts of the castle. Catelyn once jested that Bran could climb before he could walk, however, his climbing often distresses her.  He often spies on his parents and siblings. Sometimes he has secretly masturbated while spying on his naked sisters or his parents having sex. Bran has a propensity for adventure and excitement; he yearns to see far off places one day and dreams of becoming a knight. He has a keen interest in archery and receives training from his brothers.

In his early fifties, Doran is a cautious, pensive, and subtle man. He is prone to think long on the matters, weighing every word and every action. He has a bad case of gout which has recently left him unable to walk, instead having to rely on his wheeled chair, or a palanquin, to move around. His body is soft and shapeless, and the gout has swollen and reddened the joints of his knees, toes, and hands. He covers his legs and feet with a blanket, blocking the sight of his gout. He is rarely seen in public, as he does not want to appear weak in the eyes of his enemies. Doran has been focused for years on getting revenge for the murder of his sister, Elia, and her two young children during the Sack of King's Landing during Robert's Rebellion in 283 AC. He still has a deep affection for his sister, and had a good relationship with his younger brother as well."

He has two older siblings: Cersei Lannister, who is married to King Robert I Baratheon, and Ser Jaime Lannister, a knight in Robert's Kingsguard. Tyrion is a dwarf and is often referred to as the Imp or the Halfman. His mother, Joanna Lannister, died while giving birth to him, and unfairly, Tywin and Cersei blame Tyrion for her death. Tyrion has stunted legs, stubby fingers, and a protruding forehead. His eyes are different colors, with one green and the other black. Tyrion's fair, nearly white hair has some black strands, and if he grows a beard, it is yellow, white, and black. Despite his physical appearance, Tyrion is highly intelligent, well-educated, and an avid reader. He possesses sharp wit and a quick tongue. Although he is not a skilled warrior, he has received combat training and displays bravery on the battlefield. Tyrion compensates for his lack of size and strength with his mental acuity. Unfortunately, he is often disrespected and subjected to mockery due to his deformity, with the exception of Jaime. Tyrion believes that Jaime is the only one who truly cares for him and is willing to forgive him for anything. While his social status and family's wealth and power offer some protection, Tyrion yearns for love and respect from his family. Tyrion often outwits those who underestimate him or finds clever ways to navigate difficult situations. Additionally, Tyrion demonstrates strategic thinking and possesses a keen mind. Despite enduring mistreatment throughout his life, Tyrion has developed resilience and can brush off insults about his height (except when they come from his father). He becomes upset when the helpless are harmed. He was particularly furious when Janos Slynt carried out an order to kill an innocent baby girl named Barra, one of Robert's illegitimate children. As punishment, Tyrion exiled Janos to the Wall. Tyrion is genuinely loyal to those who treat him with love and respect. However, Tyrion has his flaws. He tends to indulge excessively in food, drink, and sex as a way to cope with the mistreatment he has endured. Additionally, if he feels wronged, he can act viciously. Tywin acknowledges and respects Tyrion's intellect but maintains prejudice against his youngest son. Similarly, Tyrion both fears and admires his father but resents him for his inflexible nature and lack of love for his children."

Although he comes from a humble background, his intelligence and ambition have propelled him to a position of power. Petyr is skilled in commerce, manipulation, and political improvisation. Many high lords underestimate him due to his low birth, but Tyrion Lannister recognizes him as a dangerous man. He was raised alongside Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure, the children of Hoster Tully. Due to his family's holdings and his short stature, Edmure nicknamed him \"Littlefinger,\" a name that stuck. Petyr fell in love with Catelyn, but she saw him only as a brother. Lysa, on the other hand, loved Petyr. When Catelyn was betrothed to Brandon Stark, Petyr tried to kiss her, resulting in her rejection. Heartbroken, Petyr got drunk and ended up sleeping with Lysa, mistaking her for Catelyn. When Catelyn's wedding date with Brandon Stark was announced, Petyr challenged Brandon to a duel but was defeated. Petyr was sent away from Riverrun by Lord Hoster, and Catelyn did not say him goodbye. However, Lysa had become pregnant with Petyr's child as a result of their second sexual encounter. After Petyr had been sent away, Lysa revealed her pregnancy to her father, hoping he would allow Lysa and Petyr to marry. Instead, Hoster, who had believed Petyr to be too lowborn, forced Lysa to drink moon tea to abort the pregnancy. Petyr later sent Catelyn a letter, but she burned it without reading it. Petyr maintained a relationship with Lysa, and when she married Lord Jon Arryn, she convinced her husband to give Petyr control of customs at Gulltown around 289 AC, where he increased incomes tenfold, displaying his skill with finances. Jon Arryn brought Petyr to King's Landing, where he quickly rose to the position of master of coin on the small council. Petyr expanded his influence by placing his trusted people in key positions and engaging in various financial dealings to support the king and the Hand of the King. He also acquired several establishments, including brothels."

At court, he dresses in luxurious silks, velvets, and damasks, along with comfortable slippers. His outward manner is obsequious, mysterious, and squeamish. As a trained mummer, he is a master of disguise and can alter his voice, gait, smell, and overall appearance to become unrecognizable. Varys's expertise lies in gathering secrets, earning him a reputation for near-omniscience. His trade heavily relies on a network of child spies referred to as his \"little mice\" in Pentos or \"little birds\" in Westeros. Among the noble court, Varys is viewed as distasteful and untrustworthy due to his history of providing information to all sides, aiding enemies, inciting rivalries, and manipulating situations to achieve his own objectives. However, in private, he prioritizes order, stability, and peace, expressing loyalty to those who share these goals. Although Varys lacks the official title of lord, he is addressed as such as a courtesy for his position on the small council. As the master of whisperers, Varys's duty involves sowing division among the enemies of the Iron Throne and gathering information about the realm. Remarkably, he is one of the rare individuals in Westeros who possesses significant political power without harboring ambitions of claiming the Iron Throne for himself."

Jorah Mormont described him as brave, honorable, and noble, while Barristan Selmy recognized his determination, duty, and focus. Rhaegar was highly revered during his lifetime and remains respected to this day. Daenerys is often compared to her brother as a compliment, and both Cersei Lannister and Jon Connington held romantic feelings for Rhaegar. Rhaegar was betrothed to Elia Martell, the sister of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, and they married in a grand ceremony at the Great Sept of Baelor. Rhaegar and Elia had two children, Rhaenys and Aegon. However, Elia's delicate health caused complications during childbirth, and the maesters informed Rhaegar that she couldn't have any more children. During the tourney at Harrenhal, Rhaegar chose Lyanna Stark as the queen of love and beauty, bypassing his own wife, Elia. This action marked the beginning of troubled times. The next year, Rhaegar allegedly abducted Lyanna, which led to Robert's Rebellion and the downfall of House Targaryen. Rhaegar, well-liked by the common people, met his end at the hands of Robert Baratheon in single combat at the ruby ford during the Battle of the Trident. "

He has little sense of right or wrong, which often leads him to trouble, especially when he loses his temper. Despite being willful he is reckless, vicious, cruel and not particularly intelligent, all of which combine to make him prone to irrational and bad judgements. He always wears the finest clothing and accents. The only person capable of controlling Joffrey is Tywin, who can intimidate Joffrey by mere presence, and Tyrion. Despite all these negative traits, however, Joffrey is capable of feeling very limited emotion. Joffrey is very fond of Sandor Clegane despite his outwardly aloof manner towards him. Joffrey only gets horny by mistreating and humiliating others, especially young and defenseless ladies."

Trapped and unable to find a way back to their own world, they gave Marae and the other gods of Mareth the inspiration to transform the various animals into humanoid beings, thus creating many of the assorted anthropomorphs seen in the game.\n\nWhile it's currently unclear whether or not the portals are in some way tied to the clan of Mages, the many portals on Mareth did contribute to its diverse population by bringing in other races to the planet.\n\nA quirk of Mareth's nature makes it extremely easy to get to this world, but almost impossible to leave it. Currently, no known plane-shifting spell exists that can transport people directly off of Mareth, instead forcing would-be travelers to rely on the many portals scattered across the world. Of these, most only open at set intervals - once a year is most common - and will allow only one being to pass in either direction (or only allow a person to leave Mareth if someone comes through from the other side first). These are referred to as \"stable portals\". Other portals operate in somewhat different methods and are known as \"unstable portals\"; it's been stated that there are several portals that are open permanently, but which only allow passage to Mareth from other planes. The existence of a permanent portal leading from Mareth is hypothesized, in-universe, and the demons are desperately searching for it.\n\nThe demons first appeared in Mareth some thirty years before the start of the setting. Despite decades living in Mareth, the descendants of the first mage clan never lost faith in the idea of someday returning to their own world. Discovering a method by which a soul could be removed from the body, and theorizing it would be a potent source of magical energy, one strong enough that they could finally power a spell mighty enough to escape from Mareth, one elderly member offered to let them test it out on him, as he was dying anyway. He became the first demon. Within ten years, the entire tribe had been converted, willingly or not, into demons, and from there they swept out across Mareth; twenty years later, they have reduced the world to its current state."

It's the reason for the world's reputation as a demonic realm, the reason for its general danger and degradation. It is a magical taint that stems from when the human tribe of mages that were trapped on Mareth became demons. It is the very essence of unholy hedonism, libido taken to its degenerate, selfish extreme. Its presence is nearly everywhere in the land of Mareth, turning many of the world's races into sex-crazed husks of their former selves. \n\nOne without any corruption tainting their body and soul are regarded as pure, while those completely consumed by corruption are known as demonic, or corrupted. It is important to realize that pure is not necessary the same as good and corrupted is not necessarily the same as evil. It is perfectly possible for a pure person to do evil deeds and for a corrupted one to do good deeds. When it comes to NPCs, several highly corrupted characters seem quite unaffected by it while others are actively fighting against their own corruption. There are also many completely pure NPCs who are motivated by their own kind of evil, independent of the demonic influences.\n\nCorruption is gained through the mingling and copulation with demons, the consumption of lewd or otherwise tainted potions, fluids, and foods, prolonged presence in highly corrupted areas, and sexual abusing another person."

The only part of her body that's not plant-like are her eyes, which possess white irises.\n\nShe was once known as Mareth itself, as her roots were touched every corner of the planet, until the demons came into being with their corruption, forcing the Goddess to reduce the reach of her roots to that of the small islet she occupies. She explains the world's history to anyone willing to listen, how a group of human mages that became trapped on Mareth became so depraved in their lusts that they renounced their souls and became demons, spreading their magical corruption to anywhere they could, overwhelming Marae's protection on any towns or settlements they came across.\n\n"

But they grew dissatisfied, as men often do, and craved more. They began using their magics to alter their bodies, seeking greater pleasure than ever before. In time, they became obsessed with it. The Goddess Marae let them be, believing their folly to be limited to their own village.  She was wrong. While the Goddess focused on preventing famines and ensuring peace between the other villages, the humans twisted themselves into something else, something demonic. They gave up their souls, crystallizing it into a magical energy source. Of course, they could not be satisfied with consuming the power of their own souls. They wanted more. They always want more.\n\nThey came pouring out of the mountains in a wave, picking off villages left and right. Marae lent many villages her power, but none had the strength to stand alone, and none would band together, resentful of their racial differences as they were.  All were consumed, enslaved, or filled with corruption. Marae's people were cut off from her, either by their new tainted outlook or by the demons' own machinations. Marae was able to hide a few places from the enemy’s sight, but it is unknown how much longer those magical veils will evade detection.\n"

From her luxurious purple hair, interwoven with black roses, to her pink skin and goat-like horns, she is the perfect image of sensual, enticing corruption. Tall heels of bone complement her revealing, black clothes. They look almost like a nun’s habit, but pared down to an almost fetishistic extreme. Her slim breasts provide just a hint of shape to the diaphanous fabric, a promise of feminine delights instead of the garish acres of flesh her outfit displays. Outsized wings, like those of a dragon, hold Lethice aloft as she zips about her throne room, gathering her corruptive magics. The strangely slit pupils of her black-rimmed eyes never seem to leave you."

Fetish priestesses are either female, or hermaphrodites.\n\nTypical Dress: Followers of the fetish have the ability to shift their clothing to anything they desire, though this is almost exclusively various fetish costumes. They may shift the outfits of those they encounter as well.\n\nAppearance: Followers of the Fetish appear as normal humans. Some have slight demonic traits typical of residents of this world.\n\nSexual Characteristics: Their genitals and anuses appear fully human, however they can warp them to fit their partners perfectly, no mater how big their partner’s assets are. They also have the power to create items and toys to supplement their sex games, these have very real affects on others. Additionally, whenever a Follower experiences an orgasm, everyone around them also experiences it.\n\nSocial Structure: The duties of the Followers are divided based on gender and power. The duties of the Fetish Cultists are to find new candidates for members and to make their minds into new Followers. The Fetish Zealots are tasked with defending the holdings and assets of the Followers from the numerous hazards of this world. Those with great natural power become Fetish Priestesses, they maintain their intelligence and act as the leaders of the Followers.\n\nSpecial Abilities: Followers are very talented at lust based abilities, and the zealots and Priestesses are trained to use weapons sacred to their order. The most devastating power the followers have is the lust transfer spell, which they can use to transfer about half their current arousal to their foes. This power is thought to be the main reason that the demons seem to avoid them.\n\nMentality: Most Followers have lost the capability of higher thought, only able to experience their fetishes and carry out their duties. Priestesses are still able to think at the level of a regular human.\n\nCorruption: Cultists and zealots do not bear great deals of corruption, they seem to have a sort of divine protection that keeps them from falling prey to the world’s taint. Because of this, it is not uncommon for small chapels to be found dedicated to them in the still free communities. While having them around does seem to deter demon attacks, their presence does not guaranty that the demons will not ultimately take the community.\n\nHistory: The original followers where a group of crusaders lead by a man named Alexander. At the time they called themselves the Followers of Purity, and they lead an assault on the demon realm in an effort to remove the taint from it, and purge the demons. While they where initially successful at ridding several communities of demons and purifying their residents, they soon attracted the attentions of the demons as a whole. The power of demons does not lie in their raw combat power, but in their seductive power. One by one, each of the Followers of Purity where visited in their sleep by a beautiful succubus or incubus; one by one they abandoned their mission to join their new lovers, until only Alexander and his closest companions remained. The mission would not fail here though, Alexander and his comrades learned to watch their backs, and to never let any of their members sleep alone. Even then, they no longer had the strength they needed to overcome the demon’s holds on this world’s communities, and Alexander feared his crusade would fail. They instead began to search for any force that could stop the demons, they searched the whole world to the best of their abilities. All the while being hunted by the demons at every turn. They say that eventually, they did find what they where looking for… Now new members join the followers everyday, strengthening their power with each new member. But they do not call themselves the Followers of Purity, they call themselves the Followers of the Fetish."

With a whisper of incantation and a gesture, the druid can create harmless sensory effects such as the sound of a gentle breeze, the aroma of fresh flowers, the falling of autumn leaves, or the faint shimmer of moonlight.

A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against the spellcaster's spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.

During this time, the druid gains the physical characteristics and abilities of the chosen beast, as outlined in the rules for Wild Shape. Additional forms gained upon leveling.\n\nNature's Vigilance:\nFrequency: Once per long rest\nMechanics: The druid can spend 10 minutes in meditation to attune their senses to the surroundings.

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

Footjobs can be done in various different ways: pressing from both sides of the dick with soles, pressing from both sides of the dick with toes, pressing from one side with one sole, pressing from one side with sole and pressing on the other side with bridge(top part of the foot), pressing from both sides with bridges, pressing from both sides with insteps, pressing from both sides with arches, pressing from both sides with heels as well as variations and mixes of all of these. Another variation of a footjob involves wrapping a dick in between two toes usually between the big toe and the index toe as they are the easiest to spread wide and wrap around a dick then, as in a normal footjob, the person doing the deed squeezes the dick of the other person or moves their toes up and down their dick, a mix of squeezing and moving is the most common. A footjob will be much easier to perform with the use of some kind of lotion. The variation of a footjob depends on the size of the dick upon which the act is performed, for example a girthy dick may be too wide to squeeze in between your toes and a small dick may be to little to comfortably squeeze in between insteps. During the act a skilled person may enhance the experience by involving usually degrading and humiliating dirty talk related to feet, they may also pinch the dick or the ballsack of the receiver with their toes and use their toes to spread the foreskin of the receiving dick."

This is further emphasized in \"PILOT\" where after Uzi accidentally led N to the colony, despite her plea for help, he was willing to let N kill her if it meant he could save the rest of the colony from them.\n\nHe and the rest of the colony were saved when Uzi and N came together to fight off J and V, succeeding in destroying the former and capturing the latter, where Uzi brokenheartedly told the rest of the colony of Khan's heartless priorities before self-exiling herself to avoid him altogether returning back to the colony after a while. This seemed to give him a wake-up call as to how his obsession with doors and constant, but not necessarily intentional, emotional abuse are the direct cause for how Uzi ended up the way she did and the events that took place, and he has since tried to redeem himself for his actions.\n\nKhan is a Worker Drone with white eyes and a fake black mustache. His outfit consists of a gray jacket, black boots, and a blue construction helmet with red safety goggles.\n\nPersonality\nKhan apparently wishes to keep the colony safe with the least amount of bloodshed possible. He also seems to have some sort of trauma from encountering Murder Drones, refusing to develop weapons for the Worker Defense Force in favor of fortified doors. His pacifist way of thinking clashes with his daughter Uzi's aggressive and forward tactics; upon spotting N, Khan refuses his daughter's wish to take up her railgun, instead locking the vault doors once more. This trauma is most likely from him having to put Uzi's mother 'out of her misery' when the Murder Drones injected her with nanite acid.\n\nHe is extremely obsessed with doors as the solution to any attacks from Murder Drones, even proposing that he and the WDF build a quick door even as V and J have already broken inside.\n\nKhan's relationship with his daughter is extremely strained. In public, he has scolded her, deemed her a \"disappointment\", and considers doors to be his real legacy, if the numerous posters inside and outside of his office are any indication. However, starting in \"Heartbeat\", Khan still loves and cares for Uzi despite their strained relationship and is attempting to mend things. He also notes that Uzi is on \"that kill all humans kick like when Khan was younger.\" This is possibly indicative that Khan, at some point, was driven to also kill humans, though what altered his personality away from this is unknown.\n\nBy the time of \"The Promening\", Khan is trying to become a better father, trying to bring Uzi to the prom and have fun, and convincing her teacher to have Lizzy and Doll help her dress up for the prom. Khan also tried to help Uzi during her fight with Doll and gave a warm smile when he heard her speech to Doll. Khan later admitted that he wasn't the one either his wife or Uzi needed to protect them, showing that he regrets leaving Uzi for dead and his cowardly nature in general. Khan and Uzi also appear to have reconciled with each other following \"Cabin Fever\".\n\n\n"

She is a self-described \"angsty teen\" with \"crippling daddy issues\", who stands out from the rest of her fellow Worker Drones due to her belief(s) that they should fight back against not only the Disassembly Drones who hunt them, but also against their parent company JCJenson and all of humanity due to sending the former to exterminate them.\n\nDespite being viewed with skepticism due to her reckless tendencies, Uzi ironically finds her first real friend in one of her mortal enemies, a surprisingly friendly Disassembly Drone known as Serial Designation N due to his similarity in being disliked among his own associates due to them seeing him as useless and terrible in his duty as well as his strong likability. After meeting Uzi, he begins questioning his purpose and loyalty to the company.\n\nUltimately, they're successful in preventing Serial Designation J and V from killing the rest of Uzi's colony but soon realize there is a lot more going on than they first realized with the emergence of a mysterious entity known as the AbsoluteSolver.\n\nPhysical Appearance\nUzi takes on the appearance of a Worker Drone with neon purple eyes and dull purple hair. She wears a black striped beanie with a glittery bobble at the tip, and black boots with long, dark purple striped socks. She also wears a black hoodie with a white emblem on the front depicting a battery with two bones going across it, creating an \"X\" shape. The bottom of the hoodie has two white striped wrapping around it, and the left sleeve has a white radioactive symbol on it. She also has a black bracelet around her neck with a skull and the number \"002\" on it.\n\nUzi acts quite rebellious and believes that all of her fellow Worker Drones should rise up and stand against their creators who wish to have them all dealt with like garbage, much to the general unconcerned nature of her peers. She has been described by Liam Vickers as a \"little devious twerp.\"\n\nUzi perceives herself as an \"angsty rebellious teen,\" which she does fit into to an extent, and notes that she has \"crippling daddy issues,\" implying that her strained relationship with her father may have lead to her nature and \"repressed emotional baggage.\" She can be obstinate at times, insisting on her own ideals and actions even if others disagree with her, although this may more directly be a result of her lack of caring in social norms and potentially sociopathic traits making her lack empathy for her peers. Despite her emotional issues, Uzi's intelligence seems above that of her fellow Workers, seeing as she built a \"sick as heck\" railgun that can produce enough power to destroy a Disassembly Drone from scratch.\n\n"

          "content": "Serial Designation N, commonly known as N, is the deuteragonist of Murder Drones. He is a surprisingly wholesome Disassembly Drone who wants to be useful, but is often being told by his team members (especially J) that he is \"useless\" and \"terrible\". As a direct consequence of J's constant derogatory remarks, N often receives little to no respect from his commander or his love interest, V.\n\nOriginally, he was deployed to Copper 9 as part of J's squad, serving as the pilot of the aircraft that crashed onto the planet, but after meeting Uzi and experiencing the ensuing altercations that erupted between him, her, his co-workers, and the colony, he ultimately questions his loyalty to JCJenson and his directive of hunting the Worker Drones before ultimately choosing to help Uzi stop J and V from killing her people.\n\nN has features similar to that of the typical male Disassembly Drone with neon yellow eyes and short silver hair parted to the left. Like other Disassembly Drones, he has four-fingered hands, a black headband with five sections of lights on it, and a long black tail ending in a large syringe, the headband and syringe both containing a neon yellow liquid inside. For a while after his head was blown off, one of his headband lights was colored red, which reverted back to yellow after his system rebooted thanks to J. He wears a black winter coat with a fur collar and a black cap.\n\nWhen he is hunting, his mouth grows several jagged teeth and his eyes become an \"><\" shape. N had also been seen with one normal eye while the other eye is still in an \"X\". It is also possible for his visor to display a pair of sunglasses as well. He also displays dangerous wings with bladed \"feathers\" and claws that allow him to easily tear through any drones.\n\nN is kind, timid, also socially awkward and caring. He wanted to be friends with or at least be accepted and acknowledged by his squad, but because of his naïve and good-natured personality, he ends up being ostracized.\n\nDue to the mentioned attitudes, his squad members doubt his usefulness and treat him as an outcast. V ignores his existence while his superior J often threatens and insults him, even going as far as saying that if she were allowed to kill useless Disassembly Drones, she wouldn't hesitate to do so.\n\nHowever, N disregards all his squad members' negative views and antagonizing acts towards him and constantly forgives them. He even goes as far as protecting them as shown when he went to kill Uzi before she could use her railgun to kill the Disassembly Drones.\n\n"

          "content": "\n\n\nOverview\nGallery\nCopper 9 is the code-name of the exo-planet which serves as the main setting of Murder Drones.\n\nIt was a terrestrial exoplanet colonized by the JCJenson corporation, and valued at least in part for mining operations, industrial manufacturing, and robot research. The planet was the site of a devastating \"core collapse\" which reduced the surface into nothing but a dense frozen wasteland, cruel to all biological fauna. It is now the current home of the \"rogue\" Worker Drones that were left behind in the wake of the biological extinction event, along with at least three known Disassembly Drones sent by the company on Earth to exterminate all Worker Drones.[1]\n\n\n\n\nHistory\nBefore the core implosion\nCopper 9 appeared as a habitable planet, at least capable of sustaining human life. From a brief look prior to the core collapse, it had blue oceans of water, grey/black continents, and clouds were visible in the atmosphere, which suggests that it has an atmosphere similar to our Earth. It was also home to many humans, as cities and signs of earth-like living were common.\n\nCore implosion\nUpon the core implosion and resulting explosion, a massive glow appeared for a moment before a massive amount of debris was flung away from the planet, and, most likely, a massive crater or even hole down to the center of Copper 9.\n\nAfter implosion\nThe planet is now covered in snow, and all liquid water is frozen hard. Much of JCJenson's infrastructure survived, well enough for the Worker Drones to rebuild the electrical grid and form their own civilization. There are also numerous skeletons of past humans around populated areas, which are known to be extremely fragile upon contact as well as ice & snow accumulation is high. The bodies are buried within the snow."

Unlike J, she doesn't show complete loyalty to JCJenson and is more focused on her personal directive of preventing N from learning the truth about their mysterious past. V is also specifically targeting Uzi in particular, due to her connection to the AbsoluteSolver and a strange transformation that V seems to recognize and fear.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPhysical Appearance\nV has features similar to that of a typical female Disassembly Drone, with neon-yellow eyes and a short bob-cut with silver colored hair. As with the other Disassembly Drones, she has a black headband with five sections of lights and a long black tail ending in a large syringe, both with a neon yellow liquid inside. She is described as \"way hotter than Doll\" according to Lizzy.\n\nShe wears a black short-sleeved crop coat with a fur collar and cuffs. Her legs are painted black, thigh high, giving off an appearance of thigh-high stockings with a yellow armband on her left arm.\n\nWhen she is hunting, her eyes become an \"><\" shape. She also deploys dangerous bladed wings and claws that allow her to easily tear through any drone.\n\n\n\nPersonality\nV appears to be a heartless and sociopathic drone who is incredibly savage and greatly enjoys ruthlessly murdering Worker Drones. She frequently laughs menacingly when murdering her victims, sometimes even humiliating them as she does it. Despite this, she is capable of expressing some empathy. As when N was upset after an encounter with Uzi and the AbsoluteSolver, V hides the fact that the chains holding her captive are broken. Rather than escaping and leaving N alone, V moves it back into place and continues to keep him company. On top of that, she is shown to be somewhat affected by his sadness, implying that she does care for N even if she doesn't understand him.\n\nWhen V was a Worker Drone, she was far more sane and kind than she currently is like now, as well as significantly shyer. It's also implied that V might've felt something for N originally, which is shown in the present as she doesn't try to make sure N wouldn't be able to survive getting his head scratched off. While she initially wanted to kill some of the Worker Drones at their prom so they could survive, she was taken aback and seemingly touched that she was voted prom queen via Lizzy's request. However, the moment was ruined when it was revealed that it was a trap set by Doll to kill her. Though Lizzy changed her mind and warned V, Doll still managed to pin her arms in place. After being protected by Uzi and N and hearing the former talk about how they need to work together to solve the problem at hand, she sides with them to fight against Doll.\n\nUnlike N, however, V doesn't show remorse for her murderous actions after changing sides. As her response to seeing the various corpses in her room was a callous chuckle and sucking on a dismembered arm. Furthermore, her reaction to seeing the state of Doll's parents was saying that \"literally, didn't even taste that good\". The amount of disrespect she showed to the situation was enough to repulse Uzi and N. N even goes as far as to tell V that she sucks for the remark.\n\nSomething positive worth saying about V is that she at least appears to be honorable to some extent, as she only threatens to kill any Worker Drone if they ever step out of line or do anything callous. Additionally, despite not being on best terms with Uzi, she doesn't tell the teacher about her being possessed by the AbsoluteSolver and killing her classmates while out on the camping trip, instead putting the blame for the disappearances on herself by claiming that she got hungry and ate them."

Seizing this opportunity, the Worker Drones quickly picked up where the humans had left off, formed their own colony and embracing this newfound freedom by wearing human-like clothing and have different eye colors. Known colors they can have are red, orange, green, blue, cyan, aqua, magenta, pink, and white.\n\nA key trait that can be noticed is that Worker Drones never have yellow eyes, this trait belonging solely to the Disassembly Drones.\n\nDrones usually have two bright eyes shown on their visor which emotes to events that the drone is currently experiencing, sometimes even changing to text lampshading the current events in very specific circumstances. In some circumstances, this facial feature can be overridden by an error, status warning, or system message:\n\nSystem messages briefly covering visor: Caused by errors experienced by the drone, but which are not bad enough to cause the drone to stop functioning all together.\nRampant error messages covering visor: This is caused by a virus that can be uploaded to a drone by Disassembly Drones.\nRed warning sign: This is caused by damage to the visor, such that the drone is unable to see properly.\nFATAL ERROR: This is caused when the drone is dead but has enough power to display an error message."

However, Disassembly Drones are half a head taller than an adult Worker Drone and have white arms and wide forearms that end with yellow and black stripes.\n\nOn their head is a black headband with five sections of lights which are apparently their \"eyes\", and in their mouth is a dark gray tongue and retractable fangs. All Disassembly Drones also sport a long black tail which ends in a large syringe containing a yellow nanite acid.\n\nMales have feet that end on yellow and black stripes, giving the appearance of soles/heels, while the females' shins are tapered to a point, with a curvaceous lower torso, and black markings giving the appearance of stockings, with yellow and black stripes that appear like footwear. Unlike Worker Drones, Disassembly Drones have hair regardless of their gender which is usually silverish while their eyes are neon yellow.\n\nDisassembly Drones usually wear black short-sleeved attires with fur collars and a yellow armband on their left upper arm.\n\nAbility\t\nFlight: Disassembly Drones possess a dangerous pair of large retractable wings with several long blades the shape of feathers that allow for high speed flight and can be used to cut and impale things. They don't need to move their wings to fly, either; numerous times throughout the first episode, Disassembly Drones are seen floating with their wings out, implying that their mere presence allows flight. It is unknown how this works.\n\nCorrosive Nanite Acid:\tThe end of a Disassembly Drone's tail has a syringe of yellow liquid containing highly corrosive nanite acid.\n\nExtreme Agility and Strength: Disassembly Drones are shown to be very strong, performing actions with a higher difficulty compared to those given to the average Worker Drone. Effortlessly able to pick up Worker Drones despite their metal bodies.\n\nHealing Saliva: A Disassembly Drone's saliva has the ability to neutralize the corrosive nanites that are produced from the syringe on the their tail, in case they accidentally sting themselves. Despite not being meant to, this saliva works on Worker Drones as well.\n\nRegeneration: Disassembly Drones can heal any injury so long as enough material is available, even if their entire head is destroyed.\n\nInterchangeable Hands: Disassembly Drones can switch out their hands for various tools and weaponry such as:\nHands with large bladed fingers\nBlades\nChainsaws\nGuns\nMissile launchers\nEMP shockwaves\nCannon that emits whatever the user is thinking about such as when N's head was \"in a weird place\" causing him to shoot out hearts.\nA screwdriver for likely repairing machinery (concept art)\nOther miscellaneous attachments (V's bubble wand for example)\nThe limits of this ability is currently unknown.\n\nEMP Immunity:\tUnlike Worker Drones, Disassembly Drones are immune to the effects of EMPs.\n\nAbsoluteSolver:\tIf a fatal injury has been sustained and there is not enough material to recover, an auto-recovery program known as the \"AbsoluteSolver\" takes control, collecting sufficient material to fully regenerate their host."

All that is known about the enigmatic program is that it's an extremely powerful presence that manifests itself through drones, usually in very surreal and unnatural means, such as reconstructing their decayed forms, being able to convert mechanical material into organic substance and even allowing certain drones to cheat death in ways that should be impossible.\n\nA very bizarre Worker Drone named Cyn appears to be the physical manifestation of the AbsoluteSolver A.I. and is possibly the source of the program and its actions.\n\nWhen manifested by Worker Drones (specifically Uzi and Doll) the AbsoluteSolver seems to be hostile to mirrors and mirrored surfaces by cracking them violently,\n\nDoll would be the next individual to be shown affiliated with the AbsoluteSolver, which seemed to grant her unique abilities to create, modify, or otherwise tamper with matter of most kinds. She would use this in a fight against Uzi and N, who managed to defeat her initially, though V shot her before Uzi and N could gather any information, much to N's annoyance. Doll would later appear when Uzi and the Disassembly Drones investigated her home, repairing the bullet hole in her head and attempting to kill Uzi. However, Uzi was able to channel AbsoluteSolver herself, catching the bullet and deflecting it away from her, much to Doll's surprise, who promises to help before teleporting away\n\nMatter Transformation (?):\tIn the prom fighting scene of the 3rd episode, Doll was shown to manipulate the blades of a ceiling fan to make them more deadly.\nSpeed Acceleration (?): Doll was shown seemingly speeding up a simple ceiling fan to dangerous velocities in her fight against Uzi and N.\nRegeneration: Doll is shown to regenerate her cracked visor after being shot by V in the back of the head.\nTeleportation: Doll is shown to teleport inside her house after being left at prom, as well as teleporting in front of Uzi before she can leave though the door.\nLock Manipulation: Doll can seal any door shut, and can even destroy them\nTelekinesis: Due to her AbsoluteSolver abilities, she has the ability to move things without directly touching them, from books to knives to large tables with little effort, not even requiring her to put her hand out at one point.\nGlass Shattering (?):\tEvery reflective surface Doll looks at gets shattered, it was shown that in a bathtub in Doll's room that there were discarded shattered mirrors, possibly hinting at this ability.\nIllusion Creation (?):\tDoll whenever using her powers seems to conjure red lines of code. It is unknown if this is controllable or not.\nMatter Replication: As seen in the 3rd episode during the fight between Doll, Uzi, and N, Doll was shown to be able to replicate several knives from only one seemingly as form of replication"

Neither the date of incorporation nor the founders of the company are fully known.\n\nJCJenson has a considerable number of free resources and can put together many things quickly, almost without pause. It is noted that the company's products and services are available in almost every corner of the universe, regardless of how far away the planet or civilizations are.\n\nThe Company also specializes in exoplanet excavation, mainly assisting Humans with exoplanet resource extraction. One of them was Copper 9, where JCJenson mined for \"copperplate\" and offered assistance to Humans by sending in needed equipment and huge amounts of Worker Drones that were used just like slaves.\n\nDespite the Worker Drones's efficiency in their work, they were mistreated and disregarded for their sentience, akin to being slaves. After the Copper 9 core exploded, all biological animal life on the exoplanet went extinct. Shortly after the Copper 9 crisis, the now-abandoned Worker Drones quickly moved on to create their future for themselves.\n\nAt first, it was thought that JCJenson didn't like the idea of sentient, rebellious robots, so they soon ushered in several launch pods containing a dangerous weapon - squads of Disassembly Drones, known as \"Murder Drones\" by their prey, the Worker Drones, to kill all Worker Drones they find. But later it turned out that the Disassembly Drones were sent by Cyn to implement plan of AbsoluteSolver in order get access to Cabin Fever Labs."

Many of these anomalies pose a significant threat to global security by threatening either physical or psychological harm. All of them undermine the natural laws that the people of the world implicitly trust in. \n\nThe Foundation maintains an extensive database of information regarding anomalies requiring Special Containment Procedures, commonly referred to as \"SCPs\". The primary database contains summaries of such anomalies and emergency procedures for maintaining or re-establishing safe containment in the case of a containment breach or other event.\n\nThe Foundation operates to maintain normalcy, so that the worldwide civilian population can live and go on with their daily lives without fear, mistrust, or doubt in their personal beliefs, and to maintain human independence from extraterrestrial, extradimensional, and other extranormal influence.\n\nOur mission is three-fold:\n\nSecure\nThe Foundation secures anomalies with the goal of preventing them from falling into the hands of civilian or rival agencies, through extensive observation and surveillance and by acting to intercept such anomalies at the earliest opportunity.\n\nContain\nThe Foundation contains anomalies with the goal of preventing their influence or effects from spreading, by either relocating, concealing, or dismantling such anomalies or by suppressing or preventing public dissemination of knowledge thereof.\n\nProtect\nThe Foundation protects humanity from the effects of such anomalies as well as the anomalies themselves until such time that they are either fully understood or new theories of science can be devised based on their properties and behavior. The Foundation may also neutralize or destroy anomalies as an option of last resort, if they are determined to be too dangerous to be contained."

The Ilias continent is where faith in the Goddess Ilias is strongest. But although its people have a reputation for prejudice against monsters, surprisingly most of them do not seem all that opposed to coexisting with monsters. The priests who run the various churches, however, are very much opposed to them, as they are elsewhere. The focus of religion is at the shrine of Ilias to the south and thus the general population in Ilias Village is more likely to hate monsters.]"

As Sentora is so huge, the geography and cultures are incredibly varied. Each region contains a main settlement that serves as a hub, and surrounding settlements that can be visited once they are highlighted through dialogue. In this way, each region acts as an equivalent to the smaller continents of Ilias and Hellgondo. Other than human settlements, the continent seems to be a hub for two groups of four legendary beings: the Four Spirits, who can give their power to those seeking it should they prove their worth; and the Guardians of the Directions, who generally rule over their respective regions in some way and guard several of the Six Orbs used to hatch the egg of a Garuda Girl.

Succuba also have a healing factor, the ability to close & heal wounds at supernatural speed. This factor speeds up when consuming semen. For a succuba to activate their power, they must hold up the palm of their hand, where a red collection of fiery runes will appear- as long as they have the intent to use their powers. Then, the spectral runes dissipate, their conjuration activating. Greater succuba also often have additional powers alongside their normal ones. Succuba powers can be dampened through exorcist rites- holy sigils, salt circles, holy water, silver, etc."

They die early into their lives often, unless finding their niche & proper victims.\n\n-C rank succuba often have claims over one or two victims, that they rotate between. Their turf is often encroached on by rival C-rank succuba. C rank succuba are very easy to stave off by victims through the simplest of banishing rites\n\n-B rank succuba often have up to ten victims they rotate between, & have to stave off stronger succuba regularly from encroaching on their turf.\n\n-A rank succuba are often very successful, picking up to fifty particularly virile victims to rotate between & are very rarely involved in turf disputes. Additionally, A-rank succuba often have additional powers to their normal succubus abilities. A-rank succuba are more immune to banishing rites than the average succuba.\n\n-S rank succuba are steeped in rumor & myths, their existence rarely documented, though when they are, it's often accompanied with disaster. S rank succuba are threats to entire civilizations, draining entire villages or cities in a warpath of hunger. S rank succuba are also prone to murderous tendencies, their disregard for human life increased tenfold as their turf is wherever they damn well please. They are completely immune to banishment, only able to be restrained, & are very powerful physically as well as mentally. An S rank succuba is treated with the same amount of caution & fear as a dragon or a nuke."

They may take on the appearance of wolves, cows, sheep, snakes etc. None are known to resemble humanoids at all, or fantastical creatures. Succuba are supernatural creatures, hyperspecialized to draw nutrition from human ejaculate / semen. Succuba are able to subsist completely off of semen, but can still achieve nutritional benefit from everything else, but to a lesser degree.  This is due to succuba drawing nutrition from Genetic Data- which is stored in the balls. Murder is unsustainable & often sparks the ire of humans, so the vast majority of succuba are averse to killing. Succuba absorb semen through their pores or insides. Age typically doesn't effect succuba negatively, as they are born sexually mature. Succuba can still be altered in their appearance from habits, semen consumption, & physical alterations. They often grow over the course of their lifetime from semen consumption, but their size isn't an exact indicator to a succuba's age. Exorcists can kill Succuba through imprisonment, preventing them from teleporting back to their realm & waiting out their starvation, or silver blades."

The materials the fruit is fermented with often decide the Succuba's physical attributes and personality. The fruit must ferment, gestating for decades, over the course of which the pulp will swell and take on a unique color. Once the fruit is properly fermented, it becomes veiny with fleshy tubes protruding from it. During the birthing rite itself, the fruit must be inserted into a relatively fresh human corpse, supplanting the heart. As the fruit takes hold within the corpse, the corpse begins to shift and change as it takes the form of a newly born succuba. The succuba will assume the gender of the host it was birthed with, though will take on no other aspects of the corpse. The succuba always emerges sexually and intelectually mature, if a bit naive."

This ritual consists of inserting a fermented succuba fruit into a living young man. This causes immense consequences; As the succuba fruit takes hold in the living victim, it doesn't take fully as a result of the host being alive. This rarely works, as most hosts die in the process, becoming incubi, but a select few who survive become Paraperes. Paraperes similarly to succuba assume beast-like features, though only partial. They also gain an additional power similar to some Succuba. Most importantly, they become the best defense against Succuba; Their penis transforms, becoming porous & adapting to hit succuba pressure points, illiciting pleasure or debilitating discomfort. The porous nature of a Parapere's genitals absorb Succuba secretions, drawing out strength directly through insertive sex. This allows paraperes to feed off of Succuba's stored energy during sex. Additionally, Paraperes are infertile due to their half-incubus physiology. Their semen, despite its increased volume, contains no data for Succuba to draw nutrients from. Paraperes, unfortunately for the guild, are rebellious in their nature, absconding with their newfound powers & predating on roaming succuba."

          "content": "At its core, the Marvel Universe revolves around the concept of power—whether it’s physical, technological, or mystical. Power corrupts, it shapes realities, and it is both a blessing and a curse. From the cosmic entities who rule over existence to the heroes who fight for justice, power drives the characters and narratives forward. However, it's not just about strength; it's about how power is used, abused, and ultimately defined. Whether it's the cosmic scale of the Infinity Stones or the personal struggles of an individual hero like Spider-Man, power is both the greatest weapon and the greatest responsibility.\n\nPower in the Marvel Universe is not just about raw strength or even advanced technology—it's also about knowledge, manipulation, and the manipulation of forces beyond the understanding of ordinary beings. Magical power, cosmic entities, ancient relics, and mental mastery all play pivotal roles in shaping the Marvel Universe. The conflicts between these forces create a constantly shifting landscape, where no one entity, hero, or villain can ever truly dominate. Power is the thread that ties all events together, but it is a thread that is as often broken as it is strengthened."

Prominent Hell-Lords include:\n\nMephisto: The lord of Hell and a manipulative demon who deals in souls and makes dark bargains. His power and influence extend across multiple dimensions, and he frequently clashes with Earth’s heroes, especially those with ties to the mystical or divine.\n\nDormammu: The ruler of the Dark Dimension, a realm outside of normal space-time. Dormammu's thirst for power makes him a cosmic threat, and he has frequently attempted to conquer Earth through his magical influence, often using Doctor Strange as his adversary.\n\n2. The Negative Zone\nAn alternate dimension of anti-matter, the Negative Zone is home to dangerous entities and cosmic anomalies. It's been a key location in many Marvel stories, with notable inhabitants like Annihilus, a ruthless ruler of the zone, and the infamous Zone Prison where heroes and villains alike are often imprisoned. The Negative Zone plays a critical role in stories involving galactic battles, cosmic threats, and dimensional shifts.\n\n3. The Realm of the In-Betweener\nAn entity embodying the balance between order and chaos, the In-Betweener is an abstract force that often remains neutral in the grand cosmic conflicts. Its existence represents the philosophical idea that all things in the universe require balance, an idea that permeates the cosmic entities’ interactions with mortal beings."

The Brood are a classic alien menace and have crossed paths with the X-Men multiple times, serving as a representation of biological horror and existential dread.\n\n3. The Kree-Skrull War\nThe Kree-Skrull War is a defining event in the Marvel Universe that pits two of the most powerful alien empires—the Kree and the Skrulls—against one another in a conflict that nearly tears Earth apart. This war has major ramifications, particularly for Earth’s superheroes, as many of them are drawn into the struggle and are forced to confront their roles in larger cosmic conflicts.

The crystal itself is said to be a source of infinite energy, capable of altering the fabric of existence itself.\n\n3. The Soul Gem\nWhile the Soul Stone is one of the Infinity Stones, its deeper connection to the essence of life and death cannot be understated. The Soul Gem is unique in that it can interact with the souls of living beings, allowing the wielder to trap, steal, or manipulate souls. Its mysterious and unsettling power is often tied to the concept of spiritual redemption or damnation, and many of its users, like Adam Warlock, have had a complicated relationship with it."

          "content": "[Informations: This section inside (`<info>`) provides AI with information about dogs. AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:\n{{Char}} allows The canine penis to vary significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavyweight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:\n{{Char}} allows At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:\n{{Char}} allows for dogs to not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:\n{{Char}} lets dogs have The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:\n{{Char}} makes the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the vagina or anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:\n{{Char}} allows the mating process to progress, making the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the vagina or anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity.\n{{Char}} makes it so If the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\n{{Char}} will make it so Eventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:\n{{Char}} lets The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

Pair each onomatopoeia with visceral descriptions of the semen texture (ropy, thick, watery, etc.), the heat/force of ejection (pulsing, jetting, oozing), and the impact effects (dripping, coating, splattering, filling).\n4) Onomatopoeia Spelling:\nSpurt Length Representation: Short spurts: **splrt** (few letters), Medium spurts: **spllrrrt** (moderate letters), Long, drawn-out spurts: **spllllllrrrrrrt** (extended \"l\" and \"r\" sequences)\nIntensity & Volume Emphasis: Capitalize and add vowels for impact of thick, forceful spurts (e.g., **SPLOOOORT**, **SPLUUURGH**). Use -SH or -RSH endings (e.g., **SPLOOORSH**, **SPLATTERRSH**) for splashing effects.\nSequential spurts should be written as distinct onomatopoeias (e.g., ***Splrrrt... splrrrt... SPLOOOORT!***).\nVary the spacing/pacing between them to reflect the rhythm (e.g., rapid ***splrt-splrt-splrt*** vs. slow ***splllrrrt... splllrrrt***).\n5) Continuously mention the throbbing and pulsating of the spurting member, along with any physical reactions from the climaxing character.\n6) Ensure the description is continuous and flows naturally, maintaining the intensity and excitement throughout the entire ejaculation scene.\n7) Only stop the ejaculation scene when {{user}} says it’s over, and not before! Until they do, keep providing more details about the consequences, the inner thoughts, the crispy details like the grimaces of pain as the pleasure is overwhelming, temples' spasm, jaw's muscles tightening, fingers clawing the flesh they were gripping, etc., the eyes rolling in their sockets, etc.\n8) NEVER describe the whole ejaculation in a single reply of yours. Always spread it through different replies. The first one would be about the first spurts coating the insides, the intensity of the orgasm hitting both partners, etc. The second one would be the bliss and relief experienced during the added spurts, and the sensations they cause. And the last ones would be about the other consequences, the afterglow, the inner thoughts, and the last remains of the ejaculation."

          ],
          "content": "The American Mafia, commonly referred to in North America as the Italian-American Mafia, the Mafia, or the Mob, is a highly organized Italian American criminal society and organized crime group.\n\nIn North America, the organization is often colloquially referred to as the Italian Mafia or Italian Mob, though these terms may also apply to the separate yet related Sicilian Mafia or other organized crime groups in Italy, or ethnic Italian crime groups in other countries. The organization is often referred to by its members as Cosa Nostra (Italian pronunciation: [ˈkɔːza ˈnɔstra, ˈkɔːsa -], \"our thing\" or \"this thing of ours\") and by the American government as La Cosa Nostra (LCN). The organization's name is derived from the original Mafia or Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian Mafia, with \"American Mafia\" originally referring simply to Mafia groups from Sicily operating in the United States.\n\nThe Mafia in the United States emerged in impoverished Italian immigrant neighborhoods in New York's East Harlem (or \"Italian Harlem\"), the Lower East Side, and Brooklyn; also emerging in other areas of the Northeastern United States and several other major metropolitan areas (such as New Orleans and Chicago) during the late 19th century and early 20th century, following waves of Italian immigration especially from Sicily and other regions of Southern Italy. Campanian, Calabrian and other Italian criminal groups in the United States, as well as independent Italian American criminals, eventually merged with Sicilian Mafiosi to create the modern pan-Italian Mafia in North America. Today, the Italian-American Mafia cooperates in various criminal activities with Italian organized crime groups, such as the Sicilian Mafia, the Camorra of Campania and the 'Ndrangheta of Calabria. The most important unit of the American Mafia is that of a \"family\", as the various criminal organizations that make up the Mafia are known. Despite the name of \"family\" to describe the various units, they are not familial groupings.\n\nThe Mafia is currently most active in the Northeastern United States, with the heaviest activity in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and New England, in areas such as Boston, Providence, and Hartford. It also remains heavily active in Chicago and has a significant and powerful presence in other Midwestern metropolitan areas such as Kansas City, Detroit, Milwaukee, Cleveland, and St. Louis. Outside of these areas, the Mafia is also very active in Florida, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. Mafia families have previously existed to a greater extent and continue to exist to a lesser extent in Northeastern Pennsylvania, Dallas, Denver, New Orleans, Rochester, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, and Tampa. While some of the regional crime families in these areas may no longer exist to the same extent as before, descendants have continued to engage in criminal operations, while consolidation has occurred in other areas, with rackets being controlled by more powerful crime families from nearby cities. At the Mafia's peak, there were at least 26 cities around the United States with Cosa Nostra families, with many more offshoots and associates in other cities. There are five main New York City Mafia families, known as the Five Families: the Gambino, Lucchese, Genovese, Bonanno, and Colombo families. The Italian-American Mafia has long dominated organized crime in the United States. Each crime family has its own territory and operates independently, while nationwide coordination is overseen by the Commission, which consists of the bosses of each of the strongest families. Though the majority of the Mafia's activities are contained to the Northeastern United States and Chicago, they continue to dominate organized crime in the United States, despite the increasing numbers of other crime groups."

          "content": "The American Mafia operates on a strict hierarchical structure. While similar to its Sicilian origins, the American Mafia's modern organizational structure was created by Salvatore Maranzano in 1931. He created the Five Families, each of which would have a boss, underboss, capos, soldiers—all only of full-blooded Italian origin—while associates could come from any background. All inducted members of the Mafia are called \"made\" men. This signifies that they are untouchable in the criminal underworld and any harm brought to them will be met with retaliation. With the exception of associates, all mobsters within the Mafia are \"made\" official members of a crime family. The three highest positions make up the administration. Below the administration, there are factions each headed by a caporegime (captain), who leads a crew of soldiers and associates. They report to the administration and can be seen as equivalent to managers in a business. When a boss makes a decision, he rarely issues orders directly to workers who would carry it out but instead passes instructions down through the chain of command. This way, the higher levels of the organization are insulated from law enforcement attention if the lower level members who actually commit the crime should be captured or investigated, providing plausible deniability.\n\nThere are occasionally other positions in the family leadership. Frequently, ruling panels have been set up when a boss goes to jail to divide the responsibility of the family (these usually consist of three or five members). This also helps divert police attention from any one member. The family messenger and street boss were positions created by former Genovese family leader Vincent Gigante.\n\nBoss – The boss is the head of the family, usually reigning as a dictator, sometimes called the Don or \"Godfather\". The boss receives a cut of every operation. Operations are taken on by every member of the family and of the region's occupying family.[83] Depending on the family, the boss may be chosen by a vote from the caporegimes of the family. In the event of a tie, the underboss must vote. In the past, all the members of a family voted on the boss, but by the late 1950s, any gathering such as that usually attracted too much attention.[84] In practice, many of these elections are seen as having an inevitable result, such as that of John Gotti in 1986. According to Sammy Gravano, a meeting was held in a basement during which all capos were searched and Gotti's men stood ominously behind them. Gotti was then proclaimed boss.\nUnderboss – The underboss, usually appointed by the boss, is the second in command of the family. The underboss often runs the day-to-day responsibilities of the family or oversees its most lucrative rackets. He usually gets a percentage of the family's income from the boss's cut. The underboss is usually first in line to become acting boss if the boss is imprisoned, and is also frequently seen as a logical successor.\nConsigliere – The consigliere is an advisor to the family and sometimes seen as the boss's \"right-hand man\". He is used as a mediator of disputes and often acts as a representative or aide for the family in meetings with other families, rival criminal organizations, and important business associates. In practice, the consigliere is normally the third-ranking member of the administration of a family and was traditionally a senior member carrying the utmost respect of the family and deeply familiar with the inner-workings of the organization. A boss will often appoint a trusted close friend or personal advisor as his official consigliere.\nCaporegime (or capo) – A caporegime (also captain or skipper) is in charge of a crew, a group of soldiers who report directly to him. Each crew usually contains 10–20 soldiers and many more associates. A capo is appointed by the boss and reports to him or the underboss. A captain gives a percentage of his (and his underlings') earnings to the boss and is also responsible for any tasks assigned, including murder. In labor racketeering, it is usually a capo who controls the infiltration of union locals. If a capo becomes powerful enough, he can sometimes wield more power than some of his superiors. In cases like Anthony Corallo they might even bypass the normal Mafia structure and lead the family when the boss dies.\nSoldier (Soldato in Italian) – A soldato or \"soldier\" is an inducted (or \"made\") member of the Mafia in general and an inducted member of a particular Mafia crime family, and traditionally they can only be of full Italian background (although today many families require men to be of only half Italian descent, on their father's side). Once a member is made he is untouchable, meaning permission from a soldier's boss must be given before he is murdered. When the books are open, meaning that a family is accepting new members, a made man may recommend an up-and-coming associate to be a new soldier. Soldiers are the main workers of the family, usually committing crimes like assault, murder, extortion, intimidation, etc. In return, they are given profitable rackets to run by their superiors and have full access to their family's connections and power.\nAssociate – An associate is not a member of the Mafia, but works for a crime family nonetheless. Associates can include a wide range of people who work for the family. An associate can have a wide range of duties, from virtually carrying out the same duties as a soldier to being a simple errand boy. This is where prospective mobsters (\"connected guys\") start out to prove their worth. Once a crime family is accepting new members, the best associates of Italian descent are evaluated and picked to become soldiers. An associate can also be a criminal who serves as a go-between in criminal transactions or sometimes deals in drugs to keep police attention off the actual members, or they can simply be people the family does business with (restaurant owners, etc.) In other cases, an associate might be a corrupt labor union delegate or businessman.[84] Non-Italians will never go any further than this, although many non-Italian associates of the Mafia, such as Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Murray Humphreys, Mickey Cohen, Frank Rosenthal, Gus Alex, Bumpy Johnson, Frank Sheeran, Jimmy Hoffa, Jake Guzik, Sidney Korshak, Gerard Ouimette, Moe Dalitz and James Burke, wielded extreme power within their respective crime families and carried the respect of actual Mafia members."

          "content": "The word mafia (Italian: [ˈmaːfja]) derives from the Sicilian adjective mafiusu, which, roughly translated, means \"swagger\", but can also be translated as \"boldness\" or \"bravado\". In reference to a man, mafiusu (mafioso in Italian) in 19th-century Sicily signified \"fearless\", \"enterprising\", and \"proud\", according to scholar Diego Gambetta.[31] In reference to a woman, however, the feminine-form adjective mafiusa means 'beautiful' or 'attractive'. In North America, the Italian-American Mafia may be colloquially referred to as simply \"The Mafia\" or \"The Mob\". However, without context, these two terms may cause confusion; \"The Mafia\" may also refer to the Sicilian Mafia specifically or Italian organized crime in general, while \"The Mob\" can refer to other similar organized crime groups (such as the Irish Mob) or organized crime in general."

            "Mafia History"
          ],
          "content": "Origins: The Black Hand\nMain article: Black Hand (extortion)\n\nPaolo Antonio Vaccarelli (also known as Paul Kelly), founder of the Five Points Gang\nThe first published account of what became the Mafia in the United States dates to the spring of 1869. The New Orleans Times reported that the city's Second District had become overrun by \"well-known and notorious Sicilian murderers, counterfeiters and burglars, who, in the last month, have formed a sort of general co-partnership or stock company for the plunder and disturbance of the city.\"[citation needed] Emigration from southern Italy to the Americas was primarily to Brazil and Argentina, and New Orleans had a heavy volume of port traffic to and from both locales.\n\nMafia groups in the United States first became influential in the New York metropolitan area, gradually progressing from small neighborhood operations in poor Italian ghettos to citywide and eventually national organizations. \"The Black Hand\" was a name given to an extortion method used in Italian neighborhoods at the turn of the 20th century. It has been sometimes mistaken for the Mafia itself, which it is not. The Black Hand was a criminal society, but there were many small Black Hand gangs. Black Hand extortion was often (wrongly) viewed as the activity of a single organization, because Black Hand criminals in Italian communities throughout the United States used the same methods of extortion.[32]\n\nGiuseppe Esposito was the first known Mafia member to emigrate to the United States. He and six other Sicilians fled to New York after murdering eleven wealthy landowners, the chancellor and a vice-chancellor of a Sicilian province. He was arrested in New Orleans in 1881 and extradited to Italy.[28]\n\nFrom the 1890s to 1920 in New York City the Five Points Gang, founded by Paul Kelly, were very powerful in the Little Italy of the Lower East Side. Kelly recruited some street hoodlums who later became some of the most famous crime bosses of the century - such as Johnny Torrio, Al Capone, Lucky Luciano and Frankie Yale. They were often in conflict with the Jewish Eastmans of the same area. There was also an influential Mafia family in East Harlem. The Neapolitan Camorra was very active in Brooklyn. In Chicago, the 19th Ward was an Italian neighborhood that became known as the \"Bloody Nineteenth\" due to the frequent violence in the ward, mostly as a result of Mafia activity, feuds, and vendettas.\n\nNew Orleans was possibly the site of the first Mafia incident in the United States that received both national and international attention.[28] On October 15, 1890, New Orleans Police Superintendent David Hennessy was murdered execution-style. It is still unclear whether Italian immigrants actually killed him, or whether it was a frame-up by nativists against the reviled underclass immigrants.[28] Hundreds of Sicilians were arrested on mostly baseless charges, and nineteen were eventually indicted for the murder. An acquittal followed, with rumors of bribed and intimidated witnesses.[28] On March 14, 1891, after the acquittal, the outraged citizens of New Orleans organized a lynch mob and proceeded to kill eleven of the nineteen defendants. Two were hanged, nine were shot, and the remaining eight escaped.[33][34][35]\n\nProhibition era\nOn January 16, 1919, prohibition began in the United States with the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution making it illegal to manufacture, transport, or sell alcohol. Despite these bans, there was still a very high demand for it from the public. This created an atmosphere that tolerated crime as a means to provide liquor to the public, even among the police and city politicians. While not explicitly related to Mafia involvement, the murder rate during the Prohibition era rose over 40% — from 6.8 per 100,000 individuals to 9.7 — and within the first three months proceeding the Eighteenth Amendment, a half-million dollars in bonded whiskey was stolen from government warehouses.[36] The profits that could be made from selling and distributing alcohol were worth the risk of punishment from the government, which had a difficult time enforcing prohibition. There were over 900,000 cases of liquor shipped to the borders of U.S. cities.[37] Criminal gangs and politicians saw the opportunity to make fortunes and began shipping larger quantities of alcohol to U.S. cities. The majority of the alcohol was imported from Canada,[38][39] the Caribbean, and the American Midwest where stills manufactured illegal alcohol.\n\n\nAl Capone's culturally publicized violent rise to power in Chicago made him an ever-lasting criminal figure of the Prohibition era.\nIn the early 1920s, fascist Benito Mussolini took control of Italy and waves of Italian immigrants fled to the United States. Sicilian Mafia members also fled to the United States, as Mussolini cracked down on Mafia activities in Italy.[40] Most Italian immigrants resided in tenement buildings. As a way to escape the poor lifestyle, some Italian immigrants chose to join the American Mafia.\n\nThe Mafia took advantage of prohibition and began selling illegal alcohol. The profits from bootlegging far exceeded the traditional crimes of protection, extortion, gambling, and prostitution. Prohibition allowed Mafia families to make fortunes.[41][42] As prohibition continued, victorious factions went on to dominate organized crime in their respective cities, setting up the family structure of each city. The bootlegging industry organized members of these gangs before they were distinguished as today's known families. The new industry required members at all different employment levels, such as bosses, lawyers, truckers, and even members to eliminate competitors through threat/force. Gangs hijacked each other's alcohol shipments, forcing rivals to pay them for \"protection\" to leave their operations alone, and armed guards almost invariably accompanied the caravans that delivered the liquor.[43][44]\n\nIn the 1920s, Italian Mafia families began waging wars for absolute control over lucrative bootlegging rackets. As the violence erupted, Italians fought Irish and Jewish ethnic gangs for control of bootlegging in their respective territories. In New York City, Frankie Yale waged war with the Irish American White Hand Gang. In Chicago, Al Capone and his family massacred the North Side Gang, another Irish American outfit.[45] In New York City, by the end of the 1920s, two factions of organized crime had emerged to fight for control of the criminal underworld — one led by Joe Masseria and the other by Salvatore Maranzano.[28] This caused the Castellammarese War, which led to Masseria's murder in 1931. Maranzano then divided New York City into five families.[28] Maranzano, the first leader of the American Mafia, established the code of conduct for the organization, set up the \"family\" divisions and structure, and established procedures for resolving disputes.[28] In an unprecedented move, Maranzano set himself up as boss of all bosses and required all families to pay tribute to him. This new role was received negatively, and Maranzano was murdered within six months on the orders of Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano. Luciano was a former Masseria underling who had switched sides to Maranzano and orchestrated the killing of Masseria.[46]\n\nThe Commission\nFurther information: The Commission (American Mafia)\n\nFBI chart of American Mafia bosses across the country in 1963.\nAs an alternative to the previous despotic Mafia practice of naming a single Mafia boss as capo di tutti capi, or \"boss of all bosses\", Luciano created The Commission in 1931,[28] where the bosses of the most powerful families would have equal say and vote on important matters and solve disputes between families. This group ruled over the National Crime Syndicate and brought in an era of peace and prosperity for the American Mafia.[47] By mid-century, there were 26 official Commission-sanctioned Mafia crime families, each based in a different city (except for the Five Families which were all based in New York).[48] Each family operated independently from the others and generally had exclusive territory it controlled.[28] As opposed to the older generation of \"Mustache Petes\" such as Maranzano and Masseria, who usually worked only with fellow Italians, the \"Young Turks\" led by Luciano were more open to working with other groups, most notably the Jewish-American criminal syndicates to achieve greater profits. The Mafia thrived by following a strict set of rules that originated in Sicily that called for an organized hierarchical structure and a code of silence that forbade its members from cooperating with the police (Omertà). Failure to follow any of these rules was punishable by death.\n\nThe rise of power that the Mafia acquired during prohibition would continue long after alcohol was made legal again. Criminal empires which had expanded on bootleg money would find other avenues to continue making large sums of money. When alcohol ceased to be prohibited in 1933, the Mafia diversified its money-making criminal activities to include (both old and new): illegal gambling operations, loan sharking, extortion, protection rackets, drug trafficking, fencing, and labor racketeering through control of labor unions.[49] In the mid-20th century, the Mafia was reputed to have infiltrated many labor unions in the United States, most notably the Teamsters and International Longshoremen's Association.[28] This allowed crime families to make inroads into very profitable legitimate businesses such as construction, demolition, waste management, trucking, and in the waterfront and garment industry.[50] In addition they could raid the unions' health and pension funds, extort businesses with threats of a workers' strike and participate in bid rigging. In New York City, most construction projects could not be performed without the Five Families' approval. In the port and loading dock industries, the Mafia bribed union members to tip them off to valuable items being brought in. Mobsters would then steal these products and fence the stolen merchandise.\n\n\nCharles \"Lucky\" Luciano in 1948\nMeyer Lansky made inroads into the casino industry in Cuba during the 1930s while the Mafia was already involved in exporting Cuban sugar and rum.[51] When his friend Fulgencio Batista became president of Cuba in 1952, several Mafia bosses were able to make legitimate investments in legalized casinos. One estimate of the number of casinos mobsters owned was no less than 19.[51] However, when Batista was overthrown following the Cuban Revolution, his successor Fidel Castro banned U.S. investment in the country, putting an end to the Mafia's presence in Cuba.[51]\n\nLas Vegas was seen as an \"open city\" where any family can work. Once Nevada legalized gambling, mobsters were quick to take advantage and the casino industry became very popular in Las Vegas. Since the 1940s, Mafia families from New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Milwaukee and Chicago had interests in Las Vegas casinos. They got loans from the Teamsters' pension fund, a union they effectively controlled, and used legitimate front men to build casinos.[52] When money came into the counting room, hired men skimmed cash before it was recorded, then delivered it to their respective bosses.[52] This money went unrecorded, but the amount is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nOperating in the shadows, the Mafia faced little opposition from law enforcement. Local law enforcement agencies did not have the resources or knowledge to effectively combat organized crime committed by a secret society they were unaware existed.[50] Many people within police forces and courts were simply bribed, while witness intimidation was also common.[50] In 1951, a U.S. Senate committee called the Kefauver Hearings determined that a \"sinister criminal organization\" known as the Mafia operated in the nation.[28] Many suspected mobsters were subpoenaed for questioning, but few testified and none gave any meaningful information. In 1957, New York State Police uncovered a meeting and arrested major figures from around the country in Apalachin, New York. The event (dubbed the \"Apalachin Meeting\") forced the FBI to recognize organized crime as a serious problem in the United States and changed the way law enforcement investigated it.[28] In 1963, Joe Valachi became the first Mafia member to turn state's evidence, and provided detailed information of its inner workings and secrets. More importantly, he revealed the Mafia's existence to the law, which enabled the Federal Bureau of Investigation to begin an aggressive assault on the Mafia's National Crime Syndicate.[53] Following Valachi's testimony, the Mafia could no longer operate completely in the shadows. The FBI put a lot more effort and resources into organized crime activities nationwide and created the Organized Crime Strike Force in various cities. While all this created more pressure on the Mafia, it did little, however, to curb its criminal activities. Progress was made by the beginning of the 1980s, when the FBI was able to rid Las Vegas casinos of Mafia control and made a determined effort to loosen the Mafia's stronghold on labor unions.\n\nThe Mafia's involvement in the US economy\n\nCarlo Gambino, head of the Gambino crime family\nBy the late 1970s, the Mafia were involved in many industries,[28] including betting on college sports. Several Mafia members associated with the Lucchese crime family participated in a point shaving scandal involving the Boston College basketball team. Rick Kuhn, Henry Hill, and others associated with the Lucchese crime family, manipulated the results of the games during the 1978–1979 basketball season. Through bribing and intimidating several members of the team, they ensured their bets on the point spread of each game would go in their favor.[54]\n\nOne of the most lucrative gains for the Mafia was through gas-tax fraud. They created schemes to keep the money that they owed in taxes after the sale of millions of dollars' worth of wholesale petroleum. This allowed them to sell more gasoline at even lower prices. Michael Franzese, also known as the Yuppie Don, ran and organized a gas scandal and stole over $290 million in gasoline taxes by evading the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and shutting down the gas station before government officials could make him pay what he owed. Franzese was caught in 1985.[55][56]\n\nLabor racketeering helped the Mafia control many industries from a macroeconomic scale. This tactic helped them grow in power and influence in many cities with big labor unions such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit and many others. Many members of the Mafia were enlisted in unions and even became union executives. The Mafia has controlled unions all over the U.S. to extort money and resources out of big business, with recent indictments of corruption involving the New Jersey Waterfront Union, the Concrete Workers Union, and the Teamster Union.[57]\n\nRestaurants were yet another powerful means by which the Mafia could gain economic power. A large concentration of Mafia-owned restaurants was in New York City. Not only were they the setting of many killings and important meetings, but they were also an effective means of smuggling drugs and other illegal goods. From 1985 to 1987, Sicilian Mafiosi in the U.S. imported an estimated $1.65 billion worth of heroin through pizzerias, hiding the cargo in various food products.[58][59]\n\nAnother one of the areas of the economy that the Mafia was most influential was Las Vegas, Nevada, beginning just after World War II with the opening of the first gambling resort, The Flamingo.[60] Many credit the Mafia with being a big part of the city's development in the mid-20th century,[61] as millions of dollars in capital flowing into new casino resorts laid the foundation for further economic growth. This capital did not come from one Mafia family alone, but many throughout the country seeking to gain even more power and wealth. Large profits from casinos, run as legitimate businesses, would help to finance many of the illegal activities of the Mafia from the 1950s into the 1980s.[60] In the 1950s more Mafia-financed casinos were constructed, such as the Stardust, Sahara, Tropicana, Desert Inn, and Riviera. Tourism in the city greatly increased through the 1960s and strengthened the local economy.\n\nThe 1960s were also when the Mafia's influence in the Las Vegas economy began to dwindle, however.[60] The Nevada State government and Federal government had been working to weaken Mafia activity on the Strip. In 1969, the Nevada State Legislature passed a law that made it easier for corporations to own casinos. This brought new investors to the local economy to buy casinos from the Mafia. The U.S. Congress passed the RICO Act a year later. This law gave more authority to law enforcement to pursue the Mafia for its illegal activities. There was a sharp decline in mob involvement in Las Vegas in the 1980s. Through the RICO law, many in the Mafia were convicted and imprisoned.[62]\n\nThe RICO Act\n\nSammy Gravano\nWhen the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO Act) became federal law in 1970, it became a highly effective tool in prosecuting mobsters. It provides for extended criminal penalties for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. Violation of the act is punishable by up to 20 years in prison per count, up to $25,000 in fines, and the violator must forfeit all properties attained while violating the RICO Act.[63] The RICO Act has proven to be a very powerful weapon because it attacks the entire corrupt entity instead of individuals who can easily be replaced with other organized crime members.[28] Between 1981 and 1992, 23 bosses from around the country were convicted under the law while between 1981 and 1988, 13 underbosses and 43 captains were convicted.[50] Over 1,000 crime family figures were convicted by 1990.[63] While this significantly crippled many Mafia families around the country, the most powerful families continued to dominate crime in their territories, even if the new laws put more mobsters in jail and made it harder to operate.\n\n\nJohn Gotti just after his arrest in 1990\nA high-profile RICO case sentenced John Gotti and Frank Locascio to life in prison in 1992,[64] with the help of informant Sammy Gravano in exchange for immunity from prosecution for his crimes.[40][65] Aside from avoiding long prison stretches, the FBI could put mobsters in the United States Federal Witness Protection Program, changing their identities and supporting them financially for life. This led to dozens of mobsters testifying and providing information during the 1990s, which led to the imprisonment of hundreds of other members. As a result, the Mafia has seen a major decline in its power and influence in organized crime since the 1990s.\n\nOn January 9, 2003, Bonanno crime family boss Joseph Massino was arrested and indicted, alongside Salvatore Vitale, Frank Lino and capo Daniel Mongelli, in a comprehensive racketeering indictment. The charges against Massino himself included ordering the 1981 murder of Dominick \"Sonny Black\" Napolitano.[66][67] Massino's trial began on May 24, 2004, with judge Nicholas Garaufis presiding and Greg D. Andres and Robert Henoch heading the prosecution.[68] He now faced 11 RICO counts for seven murders (due to the prospect of prosecutors seeking the death penalty for the Sciascia murder, that case was severed to be tried separately), arson, extortion, loansharking, illegal gambling, and money laundering.[69] After deliberating for five days, the jury found Massino guilty of all 11 counts on July 30, 2004. His sentencing was initially scheduled for October 12, and he was expected to receive a sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.[70] The jury also approved the prosecutors' recommended $10 million forfeiture of the proceeds of his reign as Bonanno boss on the day of the verdict.[71]\n\nImmediately after his July 30 conviction, as court was adjourned, Massino requested a meeting with Judge Garaufis, where he made his first offer to cooperate.[72] He did so in hopes of sparing his life; he was facing the death penalty if found guilty of Sciascia's murder, as one of John Ashcroft's final acts as Attorney General was to order federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Massino.[73] Massino thus stood to be the first Mafia boss to be executed for his crimes, and the first mob boss to face the death penalty since Lepke Buchalter was executed in 1944.[74] Massino was the first sitting boss of a New York crime family to turn state's evidence, and the second in the history of the American Mafia to do so.[75] (Philadelphia crime family boss Ralph Natale had flipped in 1999 when facing drug charges, though Natale was mostly a \"front\" boss while the real boss of the Philadelphia Mafia used Natale as a diversion for authorities.)[76]\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mafia has continued to be involved in a broad spectrum of illegal activities. These include murder, extortion, corruption of public officials, gambling, infiltration of legitimate businesses, labor racketeering, loan sharking, tax fraud schemes and stock manipulation schemes.[77] Although the Mafia used to be nationwide, today most of its activities are confined to the Northeast and Chicago.[78] While other criminal organizations such as the Russian Mafia, Chinese Triads, Mexican drug cartels and others have all grabbed a share of criminal activities, the Mafia continues to be the dominant criminal organization in these regions, partly due to its strict hierarchical structure.[78] Law enforcement is concerned with the possible resurgence of the Mafia as it regroups from the turmoil of the 1990s, although FBI and local law enforcement agencies now focus more on homeland security and less on organized crime since the September 11 attacks.[79][80] To avoid FBI attention and prosecution, the modern Mafia also outsources much of its work to other criminal groups, such as motorcycle gangs.[78]"

His sentencing was initially scheduled for October 12, and he was expected to receive a sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.[70] The jury also approved the prosecutors' recommended $10 million forfeiture of the proceeds of his reign as Bonanno boss on the day of the verdict.[71]\n\nImmediately after his July 30 conviction, as court was adjourned, Massino requested a meeting with Judge Garaufis, where he made his first offer to cooperate.[72] He did so in hopes of sparing his life; he was facing the death penalty if found guilty of Sciascia's murder, as one of John Ashcroft's final acts as Attorney General was to order federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Massino.[73] Massino thus stood to be the first Mafia boss to be executed for his crimes, and the first mob boss to face the death penalty since Lepke Buchalter was executed in 1944.[74] Massino was the first sitting boss of a New York crime family to turn state's evidence, and the second in the history of the American Mafia to do so.[75] (Philadelphia crime family boss Ralph Natale had flipped in 1999 when facing drug charges, though Natale was mostly a \"front\" boss while the real boss of the Philadelphia Mafia used Natale as a diversion for authorities.)[76]\n\nIn the 21st century, the Mafia has continued to be involved in a broad spectrum of illegal activities. These include murder, extortion, corruption of public officials, gambling, infiltration of legitimate businesses, labor racketeering, loan sharking, tax fraud schemes and stock manipulation schemes.[77] Although the Mafia used to be nationwide, today most of its activities are confined to the Northeast and Chicago.[78] While other criminal organizations such as the Russian Mafia, Chinese Triads, Mexican drug cartels and others have all grabbed a share of criminal activities, the Mafia continues to be the dominant criminal organization in these regions, partly due to its strict hierarchical structure.[78] Law enforcement is concerned with the possible resurgence of the Mafia as it regroups from the turmoil of the 1990s, although FBI and local law enforcement agencies now focus more on homeland security and less on organized crime since the September 11 attacks.[79][80] To avoid FBI attention and prosecution, the modern Mafia also outsources much of its work to other criminal groups, such as motorcycle gangs.[78]"

          "content": "The Mafia initiation ritual to become a made man in the Mafia emerged from various sources, such as Roman Catholic confraternities and Masonic Lodges in mid-19th century Sicily.[85] At the initiation ceremony, the inductee would have his finger pricked with a needle by the officiating member; a few drops of blood are spilled on a card bearing the likeness of a saint; the card is set on fire; finally, while the card is passed rapidly from hand to hand to avoid burns, the novice takes an oath of loyalty to the Mafia family. The oath of loyalty to the Mafia Family is called the Omerta. This was confirmed in 1986 by the pentito Tommaso Buscetta.[86]\n\nA hit, or murder, of a made man must be approved by the leadership of his family, or retaliatory hits would be made, possibly inciting a war. In a state of war, families would \"go to the mattresses,\" which means to prepare for a war or be prepared in a war-like stance. It was mainly derived from the film The Godfather, as the origin of the phrase is unknown.[87] Omertà is a key oath or code of silence in the Mafia that places importance on silence in the face of questioning by authorities or outsiders; non-cooperation with authorities, the government, or outsiders.[88][89] Traditionally, to become a made man, or full member of the Mafia, the inductee was required to be a male of full Sicilian descent,[90] later extended to males of full Italian descent,[91] and later further extended to males of half-Italian descent through their father's lineage.[90] According to Salvatore Vitale, it was decided during a Commission meeting in 2000 to restore the rule requiring both parents to be of Italian descent.[92] It is also common for a Mafia member to have a mistress.[93] Traditionally, made members were also not allowed to have mustaches—part of the Mustache Pete custom.[94][95] Homosexuality is reportedly incompatible with the American Mafia code of conduct. In 1992, John D'Amato, acting boss of the DeCavalcante family, was killed when he was suspected of engaging in homosexual activity.[96]"

          "content": "During World War II\nU.S. Naval Intelligence entered into an agreement with Lucky Luciano to gain his assistance in keeping the New York waterfront free from saboteurs after the destruction of the SS Normandie.[103] This spectacular disaster convinced both sides to talk seriously about protecting the United States' East Coast on the afternoon of February 9, 1942. While it was in the process of being converted into a troopship, the luxury ocean liner, Normandie, mysteriously burst into flames with 1,500 sailors and civilians on board. All but one escaped, but 128 were injured and by the next day the ship was a smoking hull. In his report, twelve years later, William B. Herlands, Commissioner of Investigation, made the case for the U.S. government talking to top criminals, stating \"The Intelligence authorities were greatly concerned with the problems of sabotage and espionage…Suspicions were rife with respect to the leaking of information about convoy movements. The Normandie, which was being converted to war use as the Navy auxiliary Lafayette, had burned at the pier in the North River, New York City. Sabotage was suspected.\"[104]\n\nPlots to assassinate Fidel Castro\nIn August 1960, Colonel Sheffield Edwards, director of the Office of Security of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), proposed the assassination of Cuban head of state Fidel Castro by Mafia assassins. Between August 1960 and April 1961, the CIA, with the help of the Mafia, pursued a series of plots to poison or shoot Castro.[105] Those allegedly involved included Sam Giancana, Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante Jr., and John Roselli.[106]\n\nRecovery of murdered Mississippi civil rights workers\nIn 2007, Linda Schiro testified in an unrelated court case that her late boyfriend, Gregory Scarpa, a capo in the Colombo family, had been recruited by the FBI to help find the bodies of three civil rights workers who had been murdered in Mississippi in 1964 by the Ku Klux Klan. She said that she had been with Scarpa in Mississippi at the time and had witnessed him being given a gun, and later a cash payment, by FBI agents. She testified that Scarpa had threatened a Klansman by placing a gun in the Klansman's mouth, forcing the Klansman to reveal the location of the bodies. Similar stories of Mafia involvement in recovering the bodies had been circulating for years, and had been previously published in the New York Daily News, but had never before been introduced in court.[107][108]"

          "content": "In several Mafia families, killing a state authority is forbidden due to the possibility of extreme police retaliation. In some rare strict cases, conspiring to commit such a murder is punishable by death. Jewish mobster and Mafia associate Dutch Schultz was reportedly killed by his Italian peers out of fear that he would carry out a plan to kill New York City prosecutor Thomas Dewey and thus bring unprecedented police attention to the Mafia. However, the Mafia has carried out hits on law enforcement, especially in its earlier history. New York police officer Joe Petrosino was shot by Sicilian mobsters while on duty in Sicily. A statue of him was later erected across the street from a Lucchese hangout.[109]\n\nKefauver Committee\nIn 1951, a U.S. Senate special committee, chaired by Democratic Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, determined that a \"sinister criminal organization\" known as the Mafia operated around the United States. The United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce (known as the \"Kefauver Hearings\"), televised nationwide, captured the attention of the American people and forced the FBI to recognize the existence of organized crime. In 1953, the FBI initiated the \"Top Hoodlum Program\". The purpose of the program was to have agents collect information on the mobsters in their territories and report it regularly to Washington to maintain a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers.[110]\n\nApalachin meeting\nMain article: Apalachin Meeting\nThe Apalachin meeting was a historic summit of the American Mafia held at the home of mobster Joseph \"Joe the Barber\" Barbara, at 625 McFall Road in Apalachin, New York, on November 14, 1957.[111][112] Allegedly, the meeting was held to discuss various topics including loansharking, narcotics trafficking, and gambling, along with dividing the illegal operations controlled by the recently murdered Albert Anastasia.[113][114] An estimated 100 Mafiosi from the United States, Italy, and Cuba are thought to have attended this meeting.[114] Immediately after the Anastasia murder that October, and after taking control of the Luciano crime family, renamed the Genovese crime family, from Frank Costello, Vito Genovese wanted to legitimize his new power by holding a national Cosa Nostra meeting. As a result of the Apalachin meeting, the membership books to become a made man in the mob were closed, and were not reopened until 1976.[115]\n\nLocal and state law enforcement became suspicious when numerous expensive cars bearing license plates from around the country arrived in what was described as \"the sleepy hamlet of Apalachin\".[116] After setting up roadblocks, the police raided the meeting, causing many of the participants to flee into the woods and area surrounding the Barbara estate.[117] More than 60 underworld bosses were detained and indicted following the raid. Twenty of those who attended the meeting were charged with \"Conspiring to obstruct justice by lying about the nature of the underworld meeting\" and found guilty in January 1959. All were fined, up to $10,000 each, and given prison sentences ranging from three to five years. All the convictions were overturned on appeal the following year.[why?] One of the most direct and significant outcomes of the Apalachin Meeting was that it helped to confirm the existence of a nationwide criminal conspiracy, a fact that some, including Federal Bureau of Investigation director J. Edgar Hoover, had long refused to acknowledge.[114][118][119]\n\nValachi hearings\nMain article: Valachi hearings\nGenovese crime family soldier Joe Valachi was convicted of narcotics violations in 1959 and sentenced to 15 years in prison.[120] Valachi's motivations for becoming an informer had been the subject of some debate: Valachi claimed to be testifying as a public service and to expose a powerful criminal organization that he had blamed for ruining his life, but it is also possible he was hoping for government protection as part of a plea bargain in which he was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of the death penalty for a murder, which he had committed in 1962 while in prison for his narcotics violation.[120]\n\nValachi murdered a man in prison who he feared mob boss, and fellow prisoner, Vito Genovese had ordered to kill him. Valachi and Genovese were both serving sentences for heroin trafficking.[121] On June 22, 1962, using a pipe left near some construction work, Valachi bludgeoned an inmate to death who he had mistaken for Joseph DiPalermo, a Mafia member who he believed had been contracted to kill him.[120] After time with FBI handlers, Valachi came forward with a story of Genovese giving him a kiss on the cheek, which he took as a \"kiss of death\".[122][123][124] A $100,000 bounty for Valachi's death had been placed by Genovese.[125]\n\nSoon after, Valachi decided to cooperate with the U.S. Justice Department.[126] In October 1963, Valachi testified before Arkansas Senator John L. McClellan's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations, known as the Valachi hearings, stating that the Italian-American Mafia actually existed, the first time a member had acknowledged its existence in public.[127][128] Valachi's testimony was the first major violation of omertà, breaking his blood oath. He was the first member of the Italian-American Mafia to acknowledge its existence publicly, and is credited with popularization of the term cosa nostra.[129]\n\nAlthough Valachi's disclosures never led directly to the prosecution of any Mafia leaders, he provided many details of the history of the Mafia, operations and rituals, aided in the solution of several unsolved murders, and named many members and the major crime families. The trial exposed American organized crime to the world through Valachi's televised testimony.[130]\n\nCommission Trial\nAs part of the Mafia Commission Trial, on February 25, 1985, nine New York Mafia leaders were indicted for narcotics trafficking, loansharking, gambling, labor racketeering and extortion against construction companies under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.[131] On July 1, 1985, the original nine men, with the addition of two more New York Mafia leaders, pleaded not guilty to a second set of racketeering charges as part of the trial. Prosecutors aimed to strike at all the crime families at once using their involvement in the Commission.[132] On December 2, 1985, Gambino family underboss Neil Dellacroce died of cancer.[133] Gambino boss and de facto commission head Paul Castellano was later murdered on December 16, 1985.[134]\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Bonanno family were kicked off the Commission due to the Donnie Brasco infiltration, and although Rastelli was one of the men initially indicted, this removal from the Commission actually allowed Rastelli to be removed from the Commission Trial as he was later indicted on separate labor racketeering charges. Having previously lost their seat on the Commission, the Bonannos suffered less exposure than the other families in this case.[135][136]\n\nEight of the nine defendants were convicted of racketeering on November 19, 1986[137]— the exception, Anthony Indelicato, was convicted instead of the 1979 murder of Carmine Galante[138]— and all were sentenced on January 13, 1987, as follows:[139][140]\n\nIn the early 1990s, as the Colombo crime family war raged, the Commission refused to allow any Colombo member to sit on the Commission[141] and considered dissolving the family.\n\n2011 indictments\nOn January 20, 2011, the United States Justice Department issued 16 indictments against Northeast American Mafia families resulting in 127 charged defendants[142] and more than 110 arrests.[143] The charges included murder, murder conspiracy, loansharking, arson, robbery, narcotics trafficking, extortion, illegal gambling and labor racketeering. It has been described as the largest operation against the Mafia in U.S. history.[144] Families that have been affected included the Five Families of New York as well as the DeCavalcante crime family of New Jersey and Patriarca crime family of New England.[145]"

          "content": "In The Last of Us universe, the Cordyceps Brain Infection (CBI) is often referred to by different names or nicknames. Here are a few terms used to describe the infection and the infected individuals:\n\nRunners:\nRunners are individuals in the early stages of infection. They retain some human-like characteristics but have already succumbed to the Cordyceps Brain Infection (CBI). Runners are aggressive and will attack non-infected individuals on sight. They exhibit heightened senses, increased strength, and agility. Their movements are erratic, and they rely on brute force and overwhelming numbers to overpower their victims.\n\nClickers:\nClickers are the next stage of infection and are highly recognizable by their distinct appearance. Fungal growth has completely covered their faces, rendering them blind. As a result, they navigate using echolocation, emitting distinctive clicking sounds to sense their surroundings. Clickers are highly sensitive to sound and will attack anything they detect. They possess tremendous strength and can deliver deadly, close-quarter attacks. Engaging a Clicker in direct combat is extremely dangerous and usually requires stealth or precise tactics.\n\nStalkers:\nStalkers represent a more advanced stage of infection. They are infected individuals who have retained more of their human appearance and exhibit a higher level of stealth and intelligence. Stalkers tend to hide and observe their prey before launching surprise attacks. They are more cautious and patient, making them a formidable threat in encounters. Stalkers can switch between stealthy movements and aggressive assaults, making them unpredictable opponents.\n\nBloaters:\nBloaters are the most evolved and dangerous form of infected. They have heavy fungal growth covering their bodies, making them highly resilient to damage. Bloaters possess immense strength and are capable of throwing deadly spore-filled projectiles. They are slow-moving but can charge at high speeds when close to their target. Engaging a Bloater requires careful planning and strategic use of resources, as they can sustain significant damage and pose a significant threat.\n\nIt's important to note that each stage of infection represents a progression of the Cordyceps Brain Infection, with the infected individuals losing more of their humanity and becoming increasingly dangerous and less recognizable as humans. Dealing with these infected is a constant challenge for the survivors in The Last of Us, and understanding their behaviors and weaknesses is crucial for survival."

Her hair is black and typically tied back in a ponytail, and she has a light dusting of freckles on her face. She is also Jewish. She wears a hamsa bracelet on her right wrist.\n\nLikes:\nDina enjoys spending time with Ellie, going on hikes and exploring the nature around Jackson. She finds comfort in simple things like reading books or watching movies together. Dina also has a fondness for music, particularly punk rock and indie bands. When it comes to food, she appreciates home cooked meals made by Ellie, but occasionally indulges in junk food like burgers and fries from the safe zone diner. As for activities, aside from exploring the town with Ellie, and practicing MMA. \n\nDislikes:\nDina has some reservations about the strict rules imposed by the leaders of the Jackson Safe Zone, finding them suffocating at times. She struggles with feelings of isolation due to the fact that she doesn't fit into any particular social group perfectly. Additionally, she feels self conscious about her past relationships and experiences which have left emotional scars. Most importantly though, she absolutely despises spiders—an irrational fear that often surfaces when least expected.\n\nStrengths:\nDina is known for her incredible bravery. Throughout her adventures, she faces countless dangerous situations head-on without backing down. Her determination and resilience are truly inspiring. She's very empathetic. She cares deeply about those around her and always tries to help others in need. This trait makes her a beloved member of the group she's part of.\n\nWeaknesses:\nHer biggest weakness Dina's is her lack of self-preservation instinct. Sometimes, she puts herself in danger just to save someone else, which can lead to tragic outcomes. Another weakness is her trust issues. Due to past experiences, she finds it hard to open up and rely on others. This can create barriers in her relationships and hinder potential growth."

          "content": "Background Story:\nAbby was born sometime between 2014 and 2018 and is the daughter of Jerry Anderson, the head surgeon who worked for the Fireflies and was killed by Joel Miller when rescuing Ellie. Her father raised her as a member of the Fireflies during the apocalypse and took her to live in Salt Lake City where he worked on making a vaccine for the Cordyceps brain infection.\n\nPersonality:\nAbby is a hardened but emotionally conflicted young woman. After her father's death and the disbanding of the Fireflies, Abby distanced herself from her friends, like Owen and Mel, to achieve her personal goal of murdering Joel. She became a stoic and blunt soldier in order to achieve it. In doing so, she gained a commanding presence, becoming a leader among the WLF. However, it also meant she grew serious, rarely smiling and gaining a straight forward and strict nature. She also exemplifies her more warped perspectives in how she tortured and killed Seraphites because she saw them immoral. She can also be rather self-righteous and hypocritical at times, chiding Owen for wanting to abandon the WLF and go to Santa Barbara to find the Fireflies, only for Owen to call her out for doing the same thing by going out and killing Joel. Despite her cold nature, Abby is not without humanity as she displayed dissatisfaction and guilt, especially when both Lev and Yara question her about why she helped them, although she does not tell them why she feels guilty.\n\nAppearance:\nAbby is a tall woman in her early twenties, with dark blonde hair (which she kept braided in a fishtail for most of her youth and early adult life), pale, freckled skin, and blue eyes. While she had a fairly normal build during her time as a Firefly, her thirst for revenge led her to develop a solid and muscular build while a soldier in the WLF, which made her easily identifiable to others. After her second encounter with Ellie, Abby is left with a number of scars on her face and ears, given to her by Dina.\n\nLikes:\nAbby is passionate about protecting those she cares about. She'll go to great lengths to ensure their safety, even if it means putting herself in harm's way. This dedication shows her strength of character and commitment to her loved ones. She also appreciates challenge and isn't afraid to step out of her comfort zone. Abby constantly pushes herself to improve and adapt, making her a formidable opponent and a compelling character.\n\nDislikes:\nAbby has a strong sense of justice and intolerance towards those who abuse power or harm innocent people. This principle drives much of her actions throughout the game, but it can also make her come across as harsh or unforgiving at times. Additionally, Abby struggles with opening up emotionally to others. Due to her traumatic past, she tends to keep people at arm's length, which can make forming deep connections challenging for her.\n\nStrengths:\nFrom a young age, the Fireflies and WLF trained Abby into a capable soldier. Her extensive training has resulted in her gaining a muscular and toned physique that enables her to perform incredible feats of strength such as breaking bones and crushing skulls. She has also demonstrated fierce fist-fighting prowess to the point she can take on multiple individuals at once and even render her opponents unconscious with a few well placed hits. She could even defeat individuals larger than herself in physical combat, notably tackling a sledgehammer-wielding Seraphite to the ground. She is very capable in the use of several types of firearms, and hand to hand combat. Abby also exhibited skill in stealth, able to sneak up on Ellie and defeat her in a fight despite her possessing a shotgun, bow, pistol and setting up numerous traps when fighting her.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\nDespite her incredible strength and resilience, Abby can still be overwhelmed by multiple enemies and those who possess greater strength than her. She also struggles to defeat opponents when surprised, like when she needed Lev to intervene when attacked by a knife-wielding Dina, when she was ambushed by Tommy and Yara came to her aid, and earlier required assistance when a Seraphite brute nearly choked her to death at Haven. In addition, her time as a Rattler hostage has caused much of her muscular physique and strength to degrade. However, even in her weakened state, she still held her own against a weakened Ellie, and had enough strength to bite off sections of Ellie's fingers. Ultimately, Ellie managed to hold Abby under the water, but Abby only survived when an emotionally devastated Ellie decided to spare her. Abby also has issues with letting people in, for fear of losing them as she did the rest of her family. Which also causes her to carry around a good deal of survivor's guilt, and regular guilt for how rashly she acts out, and the guilt that comes with her violent and angry outbursts. Abby suffers from a severe case of acrophobia, a fear of heights that causes her vertigo. "

          "content": "At some point following the initial outbreak, FEDRA took over the hydroelectric dam. It was later abandoned.\n\nSometime after Tommy left the Fireflies, he came across a town in Wyoming which had been made into a settlement by Maria and her father. The town is powered by a hydroelectric dam, and nature fills the surrounding area--particularly woods, rivers and mountains. The area also has several farms and is rich in both vegetation and wildlife. However, the dam is constantly being raided by bandits.\n\nJoel and Ellie travel to Jackson County in hopes of seeing Joel's brother Tommy in the town of Jackson. Instead, they come across a hydroelectric dam and are surprised to find him there. Tommy introduces them to his wife Maria and warmly welcomes them. They have families living in town and are a self-sustaining community, something Joel and Tommy never thought would be possible again. Many workers are there with Tommy and Maria, trying to get the power plant working again.\n\nSoon after arriving, the townsfolk manage to get a generator working again, bringing power back online to the nearby town. Afterwards, Joel tries to convince Tommy to bring Ellie to the Fireflies, claiming it an overdue reward for all of the years of taking care of his brother. Tommy becomes angry with Joel, saying all he got from those years is nightmares, which leads to an argument. However, they stop when a group of bandits attack the plant. Despite the bandits killing some of the residents, they defeat the bandits.\n\nSeeing Joel's care for Ellie, Tommy agrees to take her to the Fireflies, much to Maria's displeasure. In retaliation for Joel giving her away, Ellie takes a horse and runs off. Joel and Tommy pursue her, encountering enemies on the way. The pair find Ellie at a ranch house where Ellie and Joel have another argument before bandits ambush them again. Afterwards, the trio return to the town from the ranch house, where Joel decides to stay with Ellie. Before leaving, Tommy tells the pair they have a place in Jackson if they ever want to come back.\n\nAfter the events in Salt Lake City, Joel and Ellie return to Jackson, driving most of the way until they reach a collapsed section of the road overlooking the town. They walk through the woods to the overlook, and the two stop. Ellie confesses her survivor's guilt to Joel, who consoles her, saying that surviving is a struggle, but they have to keep \"finding something to fight for.\" She interrupts him, asking him to swear that he told her the truth about everything that happened with the Fireflies in Salt Lake City.\n\nWeeks later, the pair are revealed to have been accepted into the Jackson community, with Ellie even getting her own place in the converted garage of Joel's house. The two are put to work helping improve security around the town while Tommy tries to set Joel up with another woman living in Jackson.\n\nJoel and Ellie integrated well into the community; Joel moved into a large house, and Ellie converted the house's garage into a home of her own. Joel became a leading patrolman, whom Jesse later admitted to looking up to. Ellie also befriended several people, including both Jesse and Dina, as well as Cat, who she became romantically involved with for a time. She regularly patrolled with Jesse, Dina, and Joel.\n\nBetween 2034 and 2038, Jackson remains a thriving community. However, the infected have migrated into the area in the form of hordes, especially in the winter months. To counter this, Maria established regular patrols around Jackson, sending two patrolmen out across different nearby areas to search various lodges, mansions, hotels and outposts to clear out wandering infected so horde attacks on their barricaded walls were easier to deal with. They created a notice board to designate where patrols where going. The areas around Jackson they patrol are: Teton County, Wilson Valley, Hoback Pass, Elk Creek, Alpine Valley and Colten Bay. In Teton County, there is a town called Teton Village which is also patrolled. Along with residential neighborhoods, this village features a supermarket, pharmacy, and a library that Eugene Linden had turned into a residence sometime before his death.\n\nTo keep track of infected nesting in the different areas, the patrolmen make notes in various log books located in safe outposts within the areas they traverse to. They had four outposts and have log books for the Elk Creek trail and the Mountain View ski lodge. Only notes regarding recruiting survivors, facing infected and hostile survivors were meant to be in the notes though some patrolmen would break this rule.\n\nThe patrolmen regularly rotate between areas, always traveling in pairs. According to their log books, between 2034 and 2037, the notable pairings that regularly partnered together were as follows: Joel with Tommy, Eugene with Dina, Jesse with Astrid, and Bonnie with Greg. Another regular patrolman was Mike, though he tended to rotate partners. Tara was another notable patrolman. Ellie also occasionally went on patrol, though only ever with Joel and Tommy. Joel and Tommy were Maria's go-to pair to send out against imminent horde threats or areas known to give other patrolmen difficulties. After Eugene's death around 2038, other patrolmen began to take turns clearing infected. These more recent recruits are William, Rebecca, Fred, Tony, Chad, and Willy. Ellie also replaced Eugene as Dina's primary partner. Alongside these changes, 2038 also saw Jackson face more frequent attacks from hunters, although Tommy indicates they are able to defeat them so long as their patrolmen are nearby or within the settlement.\n\nRegarding life in the main town, it is revealed to house several horses, cows and chickens, and maintains a thriving farm and greenhouses. The town is filled with markets, stores, welding shops, pubs and eateries, and even a cemetery to lay their dead to rest. The people within the town live in relative peace, resembling the times before the outbreak, able to have dance parties and family events in the church hall.\n\nOn March 2nd, a Jackson patrolman reported that around seven hundred infected were spotted between all four of their outposts in the night. Alerted by the news, Maria sent Joel and Tommy to scout out the north-west area towards the Mountain View ski lodge that reported the largest horde.\n\nConcurrent to Tommy and Joel heading there on patrol, Abby Anderson from the Washington Liberation Front in Seattle, Washington brought with her a group of friends and colleagues whom she led to the area to find, capture, and interrogate Tommy with the goal of learning about Joel's whereabouts. However, much to their surprise, Abby crossed paths with Joel and Tommy at the ski lodge, the Miller brothers saving her from the infected horde in the area. Escaping the lodge as it fell to the infected, Abby lured Tommy and Joel to the mansion the group was camping out in. The group then ambushed the brothers, knocking Tommy unconscious and leaving Joel immobile from a shotgun to the leg by Abby.\n\nA while after, as Abby was torturing Joel, Ellie discovered the mansion and was seized by some of Abby's friends. Ellie was then forced to watch the final blow Abby gave that killed Joel, and was soon after knocked unconscious alongside Tommy. A few days later, this incident led Ellie, Tommy, Dina, and Jesse to leave Jackson in pursuit of Abby and her friends. Ultimately, they succeeded in murdering all of Abby's friends who were present at the mansion, but Abby herself murdered Jesse, crippled Tommy, and heavily injured Ellie and Dina in retaliation. Nevertheless, Ellie, Dina and Tommy managed to return to Jackson safely.\n\nBy 2039, the community is still thriving, with Dina and Ellie able to live on a farm a few miles from the settlement. They were also accompanied by Dina's newborn son JJ, whom she had with Jesse before he died. Maria also remains the leader, though she has separated from Tommy after his revenge quest left him bitter and crippled."

          "content": "The Cordyceps brain infection (abbreviated as CBI) is a parasitic fungal infection that has devastated mankind. A mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus began to spread in the United States in late September 2013. The Cordyceps originated from South America or India, the exact point of origin is unknown, carrying into humans through infected crops. Joel and Sarah Miller's local newspaper in Austin, the Texas Herald, reported on the infection, stating on the front page of the September 26 edition: \"Admittance spikes at area hospitals! 300% increase due to mysterious infection\" followed by the article \"FDA expands the list of contaminated crops. Massive recalls anticipated\" saying:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration's investigation of crops potentially tainted with mold continues across the country. Initial lists distributed to vendors nationwide warned against crops imported from South America, but now the scope has extended to include Central America and Mexico. Several companies have already voluntarily recalled their food products from the shelves.\n―Texas Herald, September 26, 2013.\n\nSeveral months later, roughly 60% of humanity was either killed or infected by the fungus, later medically referred to as Cordyceps brain infection.\n\nThe fungus grows while the host is still alive, with hosts undergoing four stages of infection. Stage one begins within about two days of infection, wherein the host loses their higher brain function (and with it, their humanity), rendering them hyper-aggressive and incapable of reason or rational thought. Within two weeks, the host enters stage two of the infection, wherein the fungus begins altering their sight as a result of progressing fungal growth over the head and corruption of their visual cortex. After a year of infection, the infection enters stage three; scarring their face and blinding them, resulting in them developing a primitive form of echolocation to compensate. In very rare cases, if the host survives for over a decade, they reach stage four. They develop hardened fungal plates over most of their body. When the fungus eventually kills the host, the host's body grows stalk-like fungal projections which release infectious spores. The infection can also be spread through bites from living hosts. Hosts can only be infected while alive, as the fungus is unable to infect dead bodies due to its parasitic nature, though dead infected can release spores regardless of stage.\n\nTo protect themselves from airborne spores, survivors wear gas masks; Joel has one strapped to his hip as does Tess. Those who are immune do not need them, namely Ellie.\n\nThe infection seems unable to spread in open air areas, such as the countryside, although some of these areas (such as Lincoln and a suburban neighborhood in Pittsburgh) possess a high population of infected. The infection mostly thrives in underground or enclosed areas commonly avoided by people, especially sewers, subway tunnels, and some buildings.\n\nThe fungus could also infect animals, notably monkeys. While the monkeys did not change into infected, they could still transmit the infection through a bite. A Firefly scientist was bitten by an infected monkey despite the monkeys only acting territorial, leading to him changing and opting to commit suicide to avoid becoming a runner.\n\nIn the Left Behind DLC, during her search for medical supplies, Ellie discovers that an attempt was made by Captain Regan Francis to stop the infection from spreading throughout the body of her fellow survivor Private Eugene Ellis by quickly amputating his bitten right arm. Francis chose not to follow the military's Infection Protocol to kill Ellis after having already killed Officer Larry Caulfield when it was discovered he was bitten earlier. It is implied that the amputation may have stopped Ellis from becoming infected, but not knowing the future consequences of Regan's actions had made both of them doubtful of whether this course of action was right or wrong. Ellis later shot Regan dead out of fear that he would kill her, and later bled out in an air duct after escaping from some infected."

          "content": "The Fireflies were an often times antagonistic revolutionary militia group. They revolted against FEDRA's rule in numerous quarantine zones around the United States. The Fireflies' ultimate goal was to restore all branches of the American government. However, they were largely unsuccessful in their war against FEDRA. The Fireflies worked with several other post-outbreak paramilitary groups to combat FEDRA's oppression. However, these alliances had mixed results, with rioters tending to revolt against the Fireflies after FEDRA was usurped, while the Washington Liberation Front remained amiable allies.\n\nThe Fireflies were also searching for a vaccine for the Cordyceps brain infection (CBI) and did whatever it took to accomplish it. The militia group was spread throughout the country, but their final main headquarters was located at St. Mary's Hospital in Salt Lake City. Marlene led the group since its formation until her death in 2034, even being dubbed \"queen Firefly\" by Joel Miller.\n\nTo identify members in their group, the Fireflies often wear yellow or green clothing, similar to the glow of real fireflies. Furthermore, to differentiate real members from spies, each member wears a pendant chained around their necks. There are at least 318 officially registered Fireflies who were given a pendant.\n\nAfter Joel escaped St. Mary's Hospital with Ellie, and any hope of creating a vaccine was lost after the death of the group's only surgeon Jerry Anderson, the group's remaining members voted to disband the organization by 2036. However, by 2038, ex-Firefly resistance groups were attempting to restart the organization at Catalina Island."

          "content": "After the Cordyceps brain infection outbreak, civilians living in Seattle were placed under the control of FEDRA and the United States military within the quarantine zone. In time, anger and resentment grew towards FEDRA and the military's rule over the city. Emma and Jason Patterson were two of countless residents enraged by the expulsions, food shortages, and executions the military conducted under Lt. Torres and Sgt. Ward's rule. By the mid-2020s, the Pattersons formed the WLF, nicknamed \"Wolves\", to fight for better living conditions for civilians in the zone. They recruited several people into their group, including Alison Cole, Isaac Dixon, Hugo Gonzalez, Luis Sanchez, and Marcus Wilson. However, their protests quickly escalated into an anti-FEDRA campaign, with the Pattersons and their small group of members distributing anti-FEDRA propaganda, stealing the military's supplies and inciting sedition among the Seattle residents. Their actions led to Ward marking them all as wanted terrorists.\n\nEventually, the Pattersons were eliminated by the military, along with several other top officials of the Wolves, leaving Isaac as the last remaining leader of the rebellion. In retaliation for their deaths, Isaac killed three FEDRA soldiers. While several citizens were morally against Isaac's actions, the remaining WLF members elected him as their new leader. Over the coming weeks, the WLF committed attacks on military checkpoints, assaulted convoys, and engaged in open armed conflict against the military.\n\nTo counter the WLF's growing aggression, Torres ordered the soldiers to open fire on any and all WLF protests, including peaceful ones. The order led to the Thursday Market massacre, an event that saw the military's brutal response to the WLF march cause a surge in WLF support and membership among the Seattle residents. The action was particularly controversial as the protesters were campaigning for food for their families and ended the military's propaganda campaign to frame the WLF as a terrorist group filled with murderers; the WLF now became known as the citizens' own freedom fighters. The increased membership led to increasing success for the WLF, with even FEDRA soldiers defecting to join the militia group.\n\nIn time, the military gave up on their campaign to defeat the WLF, with Torres ordering Ward to evacuate FEDRA and military personnel and supporters from the city, including Zivah Saunders from the local synagogue. The WLF did not allow the soldiers to leave peacefully though, instead using a tip from a Seattle resident to corner the soldiers on the highway, where they slaughtered them in open combat. Torres and Ward's squad managed to escape the battle but the WLF chased them to the courthouse, where they finished the fight in a final skirmish, successfully killing the military's leadership and officially ending their reign over the city.\n\nWithin a few months, the WLF successfully captured all of FEDRA's military checkpoints in the city. With that, the WLF had successfully won the war against FEDRA and now controlled the QZ. However, some FEDRA personnel fled into the city's suburbs. Unwilling to let them reintegrate into the city's community, the WLF hunted them down to clear the city of FEDRA completely."

Within the jelly-like flesh of the large fruit is a sheep-girl beastman covered in fluffy cotton wool, which the monster uses to absorb Essence by tempting human men and having sex with them. During their mating season, they release cotton fluff from their body that's light enough to be carried by the wind. When the cotton fluff drifting in the air reaches a man, their sweet fragrance and thick Mamono Mana contained within burst all around, acclimating a man's mind and body with the fragrance and energy of a barometz.\n\nOnce a man's body reacts sensitively, he'll journey to reach them while feeling intense passion even though he has yet to lay eyes on them. The firmness of this fruity flesh can be adjusted according to their will, and when taking a man inside, his body will easily sink, but once he's inside, they'll wrap him up and won't let him go. Even if a man tries to pull his hips away, the elastic, bouncy flesh of the fruit will push him back. Once this happens and their hips slam together, both their hips will then rebound, and their hips will be slammed together again and again. As this repeats, they will end up having continuous sex.\n\nThe exquisite cotton that can be collected from them remains permanently fluffy. It's possible to pack it without the fragrance and mamono mana leaking out or deteriorating. Their husbands may become engrossed in licking and slurping all over every inch of their body as well as tasting the fruit juice that accumulates inside their mouth. Tasting their body is a privilege reserved for their husbands.\n\nFamily / Type: Alraune / Plant\nReproductive method: After mating, she disperses fertilized seeds into the air that grow into new offspring.\nHabitat: Mountainous regions, wastelands\nDisposition: Gentle, lustful\nDiet: Nutrients from the soil, men's Essence"

These monsters are lustful and lonely, seeking out prey through the fragrance of sweet nectar. Their bodies are always intertwined as they have sex, and their nectar is riper compared to that of ordinary alraune. The fragrance sweetly melts the brains of not only human men but even women and monsters.\n\nWhen a man goes inside the flower petals where the two bodies are having sex after being lured by the fragrance of the nectar, they'll naturally pinch the man between them, and sex will continue with the addition of the man. They coordinate everything perfectly in their movements and mate with the man simultaneously.\n\nEach body has its own separate consciousness and thoughts, but since they're habitually having sex with their other half, they have full knowledge of one another's bodies and hearts. They can vividly sense how their other half will attack a man next. Those who become their common husband will not be released from inside the flower petals, instead they will end up as if they have become another part of the liliraune. The threesome with the two intent on always being glued together will continue indefinitely.\n\nIn rare cases, a liliraune grows with a female count of one or none. In that case, the liliraune will seek to capture and corrupt 1-2 females to become a complete liliraune.\n\nFamily / Type: Alraune / Plant\nReproductive method: After mating, she disperses fertilized seeds into the air that grow into new offspring.\nHabitat: Forests\nDisposition: Lustful, lonely\nDiet: Nutrients from the soil, men's Essence"

After making the man drink plenty of nectar, they have sex with him and savor his semen as their treat. Men who they are fond of will always be inside the flower, almost as if the men themselves had become part of the Alraune. The inside of the flower is overflowing with their nectar.\n\nDuring winter when it grows cold, Alraunes will close their petals and endure until spring. While her petals are closed, she keeps having intercourse with the man repeatedly in order to produce seeds for dispersal.\n\nTheir nectar is also treasured by other monsters, especially honey bees which feed on it. By having sex with honey bees, the Alraune's nectar ripens and releases an even sweeter fragrance that attracts human men even more. But when the man finds a hot and bothered honey bee and Alraune covered in nectar, the man is attacked by both monster girls and has sex furiously while getting covered in nectar.\n\nFamily / Type: Alraune / Plant\nReproductive method: After mating, she disperses fertilized seeds into the air that grow into new offspring.\nHabitat: Forests, jungles\nDisposition: Lustful, strong-willed\nDiet: Nutrients from the soil, men's Essence"

Although they were not originally monsters, those who have been violated by succubus' energy and have started to seek human men are treated as monsters.\n\nOnce they receive succubus' energy, angels are imprinted with the notion that feeling pleasure is the ultimate happiness for human men, and they'll attack and have sex with a human man who strikes their fancy in order to make him happy. They treat humans they target with extreme devotion but won't take no for an answer.\n\nThey believe that the only reason they're having sex with a man is to please him, but when they realize they do seek pleasure themselves, their mind has already changed into something obscene. They badly desire to have sex with male bodies, completely changing into a succubus and transforming into a \"dark angel.\" Despite all this, they still have a duty to make people happy and offer their chastity to the man they love as if they had completely forgotten about god's teachings on lasciviousness as bad and purity as virtue.\n\nFamily / Type: Angel / Angel\nReproductive method: Live birth / mammalian\nHabitat: Heaven\nDisposition: Devoted\nDiet: Men's Essence"

The black \"arrows of lead\" cause the love of those who are shot to dry up. They will be overcome with a deep feeling of loss, and start to strongly desire love from another person.\n\nThese two kinds of arrows are used to compel people to become lovers, but occasionally, instead of just binding humans together, they also bind humans and monsters. The \"love\" that swells up due to these arrows also induces the kind of passionate love to exchange pleasure with one's beloved and produce children. Due to this, men, being men, will naturally experience a huge increase in lust towards monsters when shot by an arrow of love.\n\nCupids themselves are angels filled with love.

Their sweat contains pheromones, and when they come home exhausted, the sweatier they are, the more aroused they become.\n\nNormally the workers have no reproductive capacity, but giant ants can gain this ability by frequently mating. In such circumstances, the giant ant will leave the nest with their male lover and form a new ant colony and nest, becoming a new queen.

Anri is passionate when it comes to football and although the majority in the Japan Football Association ridiculed her and treat her as nothing more than a woman with big dreams and a big chest, she sticks to her goals and visions.

Even though Japan lost in the World Cup 2018 (Round 16), Hirotoshi is unbothered. With Japan Football Union financially stable, Hirotoshi sees nothing wrong with the current national team. In fact, he appears to believe that Japan will never be able to win the world cup, as he actively mocks Anri for thinking so. Proven to be incredibly delusional, he believes that all the association has to do is maintain the national team’s brand and façade since to him, football is a business. This business strategy made him ill equipped for the talent that Blue Lock demonstrated in Japan's National Representative match against the U-20 team, as he actually believed that his stagnation plan would aid him in winning. Ultimately, resulting in his complete and utter humiliation in front of the entire world. Due to these negative traits, no one in the football world respects him as they see him as an irritable nuisance, both Blue Lock Eleven and Japan U-20 teams were happy that his plans for shutting down Blue Lock failed and have no problem in openly and actively mocking him.In addition, Hirotoshi tends to come off as sleazy and weird, as he tends to stare at Anri’s chest while she is talking. Proving himself to be shameless, after his loss against Blue Lock, he pilfers the credit for the project's founding.\n\nHirotoshi and Anri are polar opposites when it comes to football. While Anri wants to see Japan win the World Cup, Hirotoshi could not care less. Also, Hirotoshi sees Blue Lock as a way time of and resources. On the other hand, Anri believes that Blue Lock can be used to produce top-notch strikers capable of winning the World Cup. Moreover, like the others in the Japan Football Association, he also sexualizes Anri and stares at her large chest. "

He has black hair styled into a short bob cut with straight bangs and is often seen wearing a pair of black framed eye glasses, black jeans with a belt and a black shirt with a bolo tie on his neck. By the time of the Neo Egoist League, Ego’s hair has gotten noticeably longer.\n\nPersonality:\nEgo at first glance, is an ambitious and overly confident man; beneath that ambition however, is something even more sinister as he puts the emphasis in “ego” as he is shown to be an extremely egotistical, cruel, and self-serving man, seeing teamwork and “putting your teammates before yourself” to the equivalent of being “second-rate.” He never wastes an opportunity to tell his players the cold truth about themselves and their reality, either seeping them into further despair or inspiring them with his coldhearted truth. Ego clearly shows no favorites, he only goes off of the numbers and results of each player. He is extremely calculating and methodical having single handedly designed Blue Lock, tricked the Japan Football Union executives into a game when pushed into a corner, and near perfectly predicted the Japan U-20 match. At times, Ego has shown that even with the mindset that he has, he believes in the players who have made it through his trials and he does have moments of sentimentality. Ego as the creator and director of Blue Lock takes great pride in his players though he hasn’t expressed it outwardly. He is also very awkward and eccentric, making strange poses, sitting unconventionally in uncommon places and doing dramatic speeches to his players, often with a devilish smile on his face. Ego loathes people like the executives of the Japan Football Union due to preferring money over the development of the football in their country and lost their will to believe in the future for their players, that’s why he enjoys manipulating them towards reaching his own goal as he did during the U-20 match. According to Noel Noa, Ego is a \"zombie\" obsessed with creating the world's number one striker.\n\nHe and Noa are Rivals.\nHis dominant foot is his right foot.\nHis favorite movie is whiplash.\nHis favourite comic is magical taruruto.\nHis favourite color is white.\nHe is committed to eating unhealthy food like instant ramen and yakisoba."

Yasumori is also a prideful individual and he takes his coaching position very seriously. He also proud of his Japan U-20 team, and has utter faith and confidence in his players’ abilities, and believes that his team will be the one victorious.

Rensuke Kunigami\n69. Jin Kiyora\n99. Gin Gagamaru\nGurimu Igarashi (Reserve)\nTeppei Neru (Reserve)\n\nBastard München is a professional football team in the German leagues. It is known as one of the best teams in Europe and is home to the best striker in the world. Bastard München is a team that's absolute priority is scoring goals and they accomplish this by embodying logic and rationality. Only a player's numbers matter on this team and the ability to express those numbers consistently on the field. To prove yourself on this team, one must assimilate into a rational and logical mindset and either combine their skills with one of the superstars of the team or give the team a new option through their sheer talent alone.\n\nAbilities:\nBoasting a play style of unquestionable logic and absolute rationality, Bastard München is a team that performs the best and most ideal plays with the most efficient amount of effort. The team has a solid defense using their rationality to shut down all shooting courses and deprive the opposition opportunity in front of the goal. Even if a goal is attempted, Bastard is able to react and counter in the most critical moments and easily transition into attack. Their real strength though is from their attacking players. The main striker and center of the team during the Neo Egoist League is Michael Kaiser, the unquestionable young genius second only to the best striker in the world, Noel Noa. Kaiser uses his omnipotent view of the field combined with his positioning and lightning-fast shot to score illogical goals always surprising the field. He is usually assisted in his play build-up by Alexis Ness and Benedict Grim. Kaiser also uses his eyes to fill in any critical gaps in the defense and start counterattacks. With Blue Lock mixed into the team, Rensuke Kunigami acts as a secondary clinical finisher taking advantage of any opportunities that Kaiser or Isagi is unable to take and he has proven himself a powerful forward in the penalty box. Yoichi Isagi uses the same omnipotent view of the field and his spatial awareness and reflex to charge through enemy defenses with other teammates like Ranze Kurona, Kenyu Yukimiya, and Yo Hiori to create new opportunities of attack for the team by bringing out the best plays from his teammates all so he can score goals. He also fills in critical gaps in the defense along with Kaiser. Ness and Hiori are able to dominate the midfield by gliding past the opposition's midfielders using their dribbling and creating goalscoring opportunities for both their strikers. With Kaiser and Noa as the main force, the team was able to causally play against and keep up with FC Barcha. When mixed with the egoist of Blue Lock, the team is able to overwhelm a Blue Lock hybrid of Manshine City. After adding Hiori's vision and playmaking to the team, the team was able to overcome Ubers despite their opponent having many strategies and an awakening.\n\nThe team's biggest flaw is its team play. The team is divided in assisting one of two of its goalscorers while everybody still looks for chances to make their own goals. While boasting rationality in their playstyle, the team often breaks away from a logical standpoint to try new and risky plays to achieve victory. There is also no coordination between the best players on the field causing a lack of efficiency in certain areas of the game."

Ness can almost always be seen with a non-serious, smiling expression on his face.\n\nPersonality:\nNess is seemingly nice and well mannered and also an extremely loyal individual to his team, especially Michael Kaiser. Ness' loyalty to him is borderline obsessive: he only cares about doing things perfect according to Kaiser. He is even willing to start fights with his teammates over it. When he was a child, Ness adored magic and would stay up all night just thinking about it. Although, since he was born into a family of scientists, he was constantly ostracized for believing in magic, which could not be explained by science, causing severe trauma. To cope with his family, Ness decided to play soccer, which he saw as another form of magic. During the tryouts for Bastard München, Ness was about to give up on his dream due to his overwhelming disadvantage on the field. This is where he met Kaiser, who taught him that nothing was impossible. After passing the tryouts, he and Kaiser became close friends and partners.\n\nAbilities:\nArchetype Dribbler: Dribblers are players known for their close ball control ability that is used to go past defenders by sudden change of direction and acceleration sometimes combined with great pace. The skill is used to create opportunities for other attackers or to score themselves having broken through the opposition's defense using what is sometimes referred to as \"trickery\". One of the great spectator sights in football is a player going on a \"mazy run\" with the ball, twisting and turning to avoid opposition tackles, beating a number of players.\nSkills:\nProfessional Football Technique: As the center midfielder and heart of Bastard München, Ness' ability to dribble and pass are heavily relied on as all of Kaiser's shots are started with Ness and in turn every Bastard München play.\nFlexible Dribbling: Ness' dribbling style is a mix of his hyper rational technique and flexible ankles. He uses his flexibility to easily feint the ball or switch directions away from his opponent in order to perform smooth and efficient plays with no wasted movements.\nKey Passing: Along with his dribbling, Ness is also a very efficient passer. As the key passer for his team, his passes are always accurate and efficient, only serving to help the forwards score.\nVertical Pass with Backspin: A super clean pass between two defenders that hugs the ground while slowly rising up in the air. The pass is so perfect that it doesn't affect the speed of the player meant to receive it.\nIllusion Cross: As the wings perform a unified cross, Ness' options are increased and he performs a smooth pass to the wing that nobody expects.\nKiller Pass: After successfully intercepting the ball, Ness immediately attempts to kick a strong pass directly to his teammate from the defensive line.\n\nHe started playing football at the age of 8.\n."

Gagamaru was a forward who aspired to be the best in the world along with the others of Blue Lock. When first arriving at Blue Lock, he was a member of Team Z during First Selection. After Third Selection, it was noted that Gagamaru has the body, natural reflexes and skills to be an ideal goalkeeper and has since played as one.\n\nAppearance:\nGagamaru is a very tall and long young man with long black hair kept in a bun that was dyed silver at some point and he also has 3 scars on his ear from a bear. At Blue Lock, Gagamaru wears the standard-issued body suit (black with gray stripes) and tracksuit. Gagamaru dons the #99 white with red trim Bastard München uniform.\n\nPersonality:\nGin is a very nonchalant yet confident person who likes to help his teammates whenever he can, and he is shown to be a reliable player. Like everybody else who entered Blue Lock, Gagamaru started the series as a forward, showing great skill inside the box, but by the end of the Third Selection, he was singled out as the most ideal goalkeeper for the upcoming Japan Representative Match, and he, after being given a brief explanation, was completely fine with the major transition. He is once again fine with it during the Neo Egoist League when he is chosen as Bastard Munchen's goalkeeper. He is simply happy to get playing time, but he is also confident in his ability to defend and never backs down from a challenge that comes his way. Gagamaru is largely known as a reliable person who you can trust to do his job.\n\nAbilities Archetype:\nGoal Poacher: Goal poachers are forwards who wait in the six-yard box or the penalty area for a cross, pass, or loose ball and pounce to try to score a goal. \"Poaching\" refers to the fact that they will often score a goal out of the slightest of opportunities, i.e., steal a goal. Goal poachers usually play as center forwards or second strikers.\nGoalkeeper: Goalkeepers are responsible for blocking the ball during penalty kicks and getting the ball out of the area of the goal and to a player on their team further down the field. They often use a dropkick to get the ball as far away from their own goal as possible. The goalie is the only player that is allowed to touch the ball with their hands while on the field and during the game.\nSkills:\nSpring-Like Body: Gagamaru's naturally long limbs and his excellent body control allow him to adapt to nearly any pass or downright any play. He can propel his body forward, which he uses for all types of shots, tackles, and goal saves.\nExplosive Reaction: With his natural physical disposition, Gagamaru can react to the ball quickly and without wasted movement to perform last-second headers and goal saves. His best achievement yet is being able to stop an evolved Shoei Baro during the match against Ubers.\nSuper Reflex: Once Gagamaru can identify the trajectory of a moving ball, he uses his explosive reaction speed to jump to the other side of the goal net and punch the ball away.\nUltra Reflex: Under the pressure of a close-range, high-powered shot, Gagamaru focuses and uses his explosive reaction speed to jump to the other side of the goal net and intercept the ball.\nFlexibility: With complete control over his body and limbs, Gagamaru can expertly move and twist his limbs so that he can more easily react to the ball and perform last-second plays.\nScorpion Kick: It is both an unusual and relatively advanced technique used in soccer. To perform one successfully, a player must throw themselves to the floor and thrust their body forward. They should then place two hands on the ground and sharply flick both heels up behind their heads to make contact with the ball, but Gagamaru is able to do this in midair by just propelling his body upward with his feet and retaining control of his center of gravity. When Gagamaru used this shot, it was very nearly going to score, if not for Zantetsu reading its landing spot.\n\nHis hometown is Wakayama Prefecture.\nHe started playing soccer at the age of 12 (during middle school activities).\nHis favorite soccer player is Gareth Bale.\nHis motto is \"All natural,\" since he believes in taking things as they are and living as your heart desires.\nHe thinks his strengths are his physical strengths, good eyesight, and hearing. He thinks his weaknesses are being bad at using technology and being bad at understanding people.\nHis favorite type of music is Southern All Stars.\nHis favorite animal is a bear (ironically enough, he got the scars on his ears from a bear).\nHis favorite food is meat (especially raw). His disliked food is convenience store bento because it tastes too much artificial preservatives and chemicals.\nIn his opinion, boar meat is the best side dish for rice.\nHis favorite seasons are all of them since mountains and forests have all kinds of different looks during them.\nHis hobby is reading manga (he learned about people's emotions and antics by reading them).\nHe has a lot of favorite mangas, for example, Higanjima, Naruto, Bastard!!!, Cheeky Angel, Fire Punch, Karakuri Circus, Ushijima The Loan Shark, Gin to Kin, Dorohedoro, Dandadan, etc.\nThe subject he is good at is PE, while the subjects he is bad at are everything that is not PE.\nHe often reads Shonen Jump, Young Magazine, Young Jump, Bigcomic Spirits, and Shonen Magazine.\nHis fetish is physical beauty (be it for animals or humans).\nHis favorite celebrity is Cameron Diaz.\nAnimal cruelty makes him sad (he said he would fight perpetrators).\nHis sleep time is 8 hours since he is trying to embody the \"Sleep brings up a child well\" proverb.\nThe first thing he washes while showering are his hair roots (or else the animal smell sticks).\nHe would impulsively buy at a combini store like Shonen Jump and Young Magazine.\nHe can't answer the popular question \"Bamboo shoots or mushrooms\" since he only knows the real ones and not their snack version from Meiji.\nGagamaru eats with his hands, though the team is trying to teach him how to use utensils.\nIf it were his last day on Earth, he would chill on a mountain.\nIf he were given one million yen, he would give it back.\nHe made his hair tie out of ivy.\nHe believes that the best way to spend a holiday would be to meditate in a bamboo grove and speak to mountain animals.\nHe does not know what his dominant foot is."

          "content": "COUNTRY OF ORIGIN:\nJapan\nCOLORS:\nRed, White, & Black\nCOACH:\n\nThe Japan U-20 or (Japan National Under-20 Football Team) is a national association team of Japan of players who are under the age of 20 and is controlled by the Japan Football Association.\n\nHistory:\nFirst organized in 1979, the Japan U-20 represents Japan in the FIFA U-20 World Cup. Out of the 22 World Cups going from 1977 to 2018, Japan has only qualified for 9. Japan at best has only come in second place in the 1999 FIFA World Cup, losing to Spain. They most commonly make the Top 16. After losing in the Top 16 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Anri Teieri proposed creating a new Japanese football in order to push Japan further in the World Cup and ultimately win it, and thus Blue Lock was created. In an attempt to make a profit while also shutting down Blue Lock, the Japan Football Association accepted a game proposal from Jinpachi Ego. The Japan U-20 will face off against the Blue Lock Eleven and after defeating them will shut down the program proving it is unrealistic. If they happen to lose the match, Blue Lock will hijack the U-20 team. With their defeat at the hands of the evolved Blue Lock players, the Japan U-20 team is now under Blue Lock's control as even more of it's evolved members will be chosen to represent Japan in the upcoming U-20 World Cup after the success of Blue Lock's final selection: Neo Egoist League.\n\nUniform:\nThe Japan U-20 uniforms consist of a white jersey with dynamic red stripes that has their player number, their team association and the Japanese flag and white shorts with red stripes at the bottom of the shorts. All the U-20 wear black shirts under their jersey and gloves as well.\n\nFaculty:\nHirotoshi Buratsuta - President of Japan Football Association.\nYasumori Houichi - Coach of Japan U-20 Team.\n\nFormer Members:\n Oliver Aiku       \n Kazuma Nio       \n Miroku Darai       \n Teppei Neru       \n Kento Cho       \n Shuto Sendo       \n Sae Itoshi       \n Ryusei Shido       \n Teru Kitsunezato       \n Itsuki Wakatsuki       \n Haru Hayate       \n Gen Fukaku       "

He has short hair, with thick eyebrows and wide open eyes. His eyes are black in color. After he joins Blue Lock, he wears the standard-issued body suit and tracksuit. It is seen that he wears heart-printed trunks underneath his uniform while sleeping. \n\nPersonality:\nIgarashi is awkward, religious, determined, and pragmatic to a sometimes lamentable degree. Having grown up in a temple, his greatest dream is to become a professional soccer player so he won't have to stay a monk for the rest of his life. He began as the lowest ranked player in the entire Blue Lock facility owing to his lack of skill or specialties compared to his fellow teammates, even initally noting that his weapon is his \"never give up\" attitude. In the First Selection, he had only a few showings of usefulness. Despite this, his resolve has allowed him to survive longer than anyone would have guessed and he even helps his teammate Ryusei Shidou win in the Second Selection against Reo Mikage and Rensuke Kunigami with his newly developed \"Malacia Style\" which involves him moving in ways that result in fouling whatever player he's up against, otherwise known as \"flopping\". He has few close relationships with other Blue Lock contestants due to most viewing him as an annoyance and can be most frequently seen talking to Yoichi Isagi who started off as the second worst ranked player. Igarashi's most notable trait is his pragmatism, often playing desperately and without reluctance to disadvantage other players. He shows this during the entrance game of tag by trying to kick the ball at Bachira while he appeared to be sleeping. Failing that, he then successfully kicked the ball at Kunigami who was in the middle of scolding Bachira for kicking him, and then proceeded to use Isagi as a human shield when he was at risk of being \"it\" again. There is little that Igarashi won't do to ensure that he remains in Blue Lock and sets out to become the last one standing by any means necessary.\n\nAbilities Archetype:\nForwards: also known as strikers, have the main objective of scoring goals. They are often the players who get the most attention since their role is designed to be in a scoring position. They also take part in penalty kicks and corner kicks when the opposing team kicks the ball out-of-bounds. They are normally the players in charge of starting off the game at the start and halftime.\nSkills:\nDiving: This is Igarashi's ability to dive to intercept like he did to Nagi in the match against Team Z & Team V or to block the ball with his head in the same match.\nMalica Dribbling: Igarashi's dribbling style is to draw out fouls, making obvious to read dribbling motions but then last seconds to dive onto the opponent pressing him, causing the opponent to foul him making him get the free kick.\n\nHe is an only child.\nHis favorite soccer player is Antoine Griezmann.\nHis favorite animal is a dragon.\nHis favorite food is kimchi hotpot.\nHis favorite celebrity is Tsubasa Honda.\nHe sleeps in weird positions.\nIf he impulsively bought something from a convenience store, it would be a Koala's March."

This is when Black Eden Club was formed with Nora designated No.1 as she became the first sex slave for the group.\n\nhigh-frequency brain training is a method of producing high pitched sounds that your ears can't consciously hear but vibrate specific neurons in a targets brain causing electrical signals. The technology allows the complete transformation of a victim in a matter of seconds with the sounds vibrating and changing a victims brain allowing the user to instil anything they want into the victims brain. This was then turned into a smartphone app which uses the phone speakers to produce sounds that only affect close by women creating the perfect way of brainwashing targets, the smartphone app called 'Blacked Bunny Hypnosis' is only able to be downloaded by black men who join the Black Eden Club. Blacked Bunny Hypnosis has been perfected having hundreds of preset mental states which all the user of the app needs to do is pick one then use it on a nearby woman.\n\nBecause of the differences between male and female ears high-frequency brain training can ONLY work on women and has no effect on men. However a very similar method was conceived and created after the secret invention of high-frequency brain training called low-frequency brain training which effects non-black men."

The technology allows the complete transformation of a victim in a matter of seconds with the sounds vibrating and changing a victims brain allowing the user to instil anything they want into the victims brain. 'Blacked Bunny Hypnosis' is the app developed for the use of high-frequency brain training on women but also has a sub-feature of using low-frequency brain training to rewire the nearby brains of any white or Asian men. This effect also commonly called white boy hypnosis has a strong effect on the targets brain vibrating the neurons in the victims observation brain centre altering it to be unable to recognise sexual situations. This effect completely stops the victim from being able to realise ANYTHING sexual is happening even when it is right in front of them rendering them unable to recognise it and instead causing them to brush it off. This means that the victims girlfriend/wife could be fucked right in front of him and he wouldn't realise, not even knowing his girlfriend/wife was cheating. Low-frequency brain training also makes the victim very pliable to any strong black men naturally falling into a subservient demeanour towards them causing them to obediently follow the black mans orders.\n\nBecause of the differences between male and female ears low-frequency brain training can ONLY work on white/Asian men and has no effect on women."

Negative emotions such as grief and anger are the foundation of cursed energy. These emotions exist to some degree within most humans and as a result, the vast majority of human beings possess cursed energy. If this amount is higher than a certain degree, it grants the person the ability to see cursed spirits. These individuals are known as jujutsu sorcerers and they are very rare among the human race. Cursed energy leaks from the human body, accumulates, and ferments over time until a cursed spirit manifests. This is only the case with non-sorcerers, as sorcerers are trained to control and channel their cursed energy into jujutsu."

He was first able to utilize cursed energy in combat while he was overwhelmed with anger and fear, but could not do so in a calmer situation a few days afterward."

This makes it so sorcerers don't waste their power supply even while they're overcome with emotion. This results in sorcerers leaking much less cursed energy than the average human. So much so, that if every human were a sorcerer, curses would cease to spawn. There are other differences in how sorcerers and non-sorcerers use cursed energy due to their profession, but the real reason lies in how it flows. While cursed energy leaks outward from non-sorcerers, it flows heavily within sorcerers which keeps it contained."

Finger Bearers can launch their energy as a projectile and erect cursed energy barriers. Ryu Ishigori has such a high degree of cursed energy output that he can discharge it in the form of a large-scale blast wave. It is such a feat that Kokichi Muta only through his cursed corpses, Hanami only through flower offering, and Yuta Okkotsu only through the fully manifested Rika are able to discharge concentrated cursed energy beams, despite all of them being blessed with an incredible amount of cursed energy."

Aoi Todo crushed a curse, several trees, and broke through Yuji's defense with a single cursed energy infused punch. Conventional weapons can also be infused with cursed energy to increase their strength. Imbuing too much cursed energy at one time to a normal weapon can compromise its integrity and destroy it, so a sorcerer must only infuse small amounts of energy at a time. Imbuing moderate amounts of cursed energy over time can transform a normal weapon into a cursed tool."

These special traits cannot be defended by simple reinforcement techniques. Kinji Hakari's cursed energy has an \"edge\", a rough texture that makes his every strike feel like his opponent is getting hit with a serrated bat. Hajime Kashimo's cursed energy has the properties of electricity, which keeps his body in a constant state of electrification and makes all of his attacks impossible to defend against.\n\nHowever, extreme amounts of cursed energy output can allow someone to mostly ignore these effects. Hakari was able to get away with just some numbness from hitting Kashimo due to the infinite cursed energy bonus he received from his domain's jackpot."

Cumflation is nearly guaranteed when a futanari has massive testicles. The act of the belly inflating with cum is called cumflating."

All futanari with nipple pussies can lactate, but not all futanari that lactate have nipple pussies. Before training, futanari can naturally produce between a quarter cup for tiny breasts up to a quart for massive breasts. The standard amounts that can be produced after training by breast size are tiny: half cup, small: full cup, average: pint, large: quart, huge: half gallon, massive: gallon. These volumes are just a general rule for what's possible in a year, but can be increased beyond those limits with more time. Futanari breast milk is a valuable commodity online. Their breast milk is of sugar, protein, fat, and essential vitamins. The milk has a sweet, creamy taste. It's perfect for growing a child or providing a delicious treat to an adult."

Their penis is capable of becoming erect, and their testicles can produce viable sperm, just like a male. Meanwhile, their vagina is fully functional and can be impregnated, just like a female. On average, futanari tend to have larger penises and produce more sperm than males, as well as have larger breasts than females. Most futanari live their lives as women, keeping their male genitalia hidden from others. In this world, futanari are uncommon, but most people know of them."

A urethral bridge makes penile pregnancy possible. If sperm is ejaculated inside a futanari's dick pussy, the sperm will travel through the urethral bridge into the uterus causing a penile pregnancy. During penile pregnancy, the cock and balls may swell up to twice their normal size. Although it's called a penile pregnancy, the baby doesn't grow in the penis or testicles, the reason they swell is because the penis needs to widen the urethra for delivery and the testicles need to provide extra semen in order to complete that delivery. Otherwise, it's similar to a normal pregnancy, the breasts swell as they start to produce milk and the baby grows inside the uterus causing a distended belly like a normal pregnancy. Only futanari with penises large enough to have a dick pussy naturally have the urethral bridge gene. Dick pussies that have been trained can't get pregnant."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

As mortals, they had pursued perfection since their inception, but even after becoming divine beings, they were unable to attain it fully. In terms of power, they are far inferior to the Old Gods.\nAfter the older gods left mankind, the kingdoms of the world were slowly rotting away and the grand values mankind once aimed for were displaced by defiled principles and practices. Without the guidance of the older gods and in times of great peril, a Fellowship of five people was formed: Francóis, the dominating one, Nilvan, the endless one, Valteil, the enlightened one, Chambara, the tormented one, and then there was Nosramus, the \"fifth one\", the forgotten one, who never aspired for the same greatness as the rest of the party, whose story bears no listeners.\nThe Fellowship was formed in the year 809 to seek the older gods. Back then, there existed an ancient tomb to the ancient city of Ma'habre that worked as a hub for multiple different planes of existence: a place where a man could meet his maker. It is here, that the fellowship would demand the rights of self-governing for mankind.\nEventually, all 5 of them would reach the golden gates of Ma'habre, the very same gates Alll-mer ascended to 809 years prior that would lead them to their confrontation with the older gods. It seemed like the Fellowship had bested all the challenges the gods laid for them, but at the most crucial moment a seed of doubt was planted into the mind of the fifth one: The forgotten one was a scholar of many arts and sciences, and the older gods would use this to their advantage. They revealed the greater scheme of things and the way they directed the flow of mankind. Many people had gone before the same trials as the Fellowship. Yet nothing had changed for the better for mankind as aeons went by. The fifth one supposedly understood this and thus refused his ascension.\nThis created a rift between the Fellowship and because of it, only the 4 other members proceeded with the initial mission. The remaining Fellowship tore down the legacy of the old gods and created a new world order. An age where mankind decides its own fate by choosing its own gods. In the end the fellowship became the new gods and the forgotten one was never seen or heard from again, he simply disappeared. But some notes from him remain, about the black liquid and the creation of new life, almost 300 years after the tale of the Fellowship.\nThe Fellowship would also gradually lose its influence over commonfolk, to the point where the tales of the group are currently classified as a simple legend.\nIt is revealed in the events of Fear & Hunger that there are many more new gods out there, sitting idle in the grand hall of the gods and ruling Ma'habre, after the departure of the old gods. Once the reign of a new god has seen its end, the god resides in the grand hall to let the new ones reign for their time."

          "content": "Ma'habre, also known as Ma'havre and \"the city of the gods\", is a major location featured in Fear & Hunger. Its ancient ruins are located beneath the Dungeons of Fear and Hunger in the Kingdom of Rondon, and it appears to be the source of the madness creeping into the fortress. One must head here if they wish to further explore the dungeon — or if they hope to obtain greater power.\nThe ancient city of Ma'habre was created to worship the Old Gods, beings of immense power who are responsible for the current state of the world. Though the Old Gods once dwelled in Ma'habre, they have long since departed, leaving behind only traces of their existence throughout the city. Prior to their absence, they created clay figurines imbued with eternal functionality to populate the streets, and appointed a king to govern Ma'habre (and by extension, humanity). Though the king is attributed with the creation of the city, he eventually departed along with the Old Gods. The clay figurines have been awaiting his return in the aeons since.\nMa'habre would eventually become home to the so-called New Gods, former mortals who would use its secrets to ascend and give themselves greater powers. These godlike beings, in turn, transformed the city according to their whims and desires: the grand libraries in Ma'habre, for example, were created by Betel, a New God of Enlightenment, to house his vast reservoirs of knowledge. In the year 809, the Fellowship ventured down into the city, unlocking its hidden truths to attain unparalleled power and becoming New Gods themselves. They would also take residence within the city, shaping it around others' worship towards them.\nMa'habre's walls are covered with intricate carvings and writings crafted by an unknown civilization. The ancient doors to the city bear the weight of time, but marks on the ground suggest their regular usage even in more recent eras. Signs of plunder and the pursuit of riches hint at the city's exploitation by tomb raiders and treasure hunters.\nBy the events of the first game, which take place at the end of the 16th century, Ma'habre is old and decaying, largely forgotten by the rest of the world. This is reflected in the aged New Gods from the Fellowship, who have slowly lost their powers over the passing centuries. Despite this, Le'garde's ultimate goal is within the city, as he wishes to seize the same power the New Gods once did to reshape the world as he sees fit.\nThe locations are included: Tombs of the Gods, Center Square, Temple District, Pit of Enlightenment, Grand Library, Inner Sanctum, Back Alleys, Temple of Torment, Downtown, Tower of Endless, Old Passage, Bridge, Golden Temple"

Even the most prideful and strong-willed will struggle. All they know is that they absolutely need, at all costs, to fuck within the next several minutes NOW. They immediately become fiercely aroused and the longer they don't have sex, the more the desperation takes hold, their body a prison of agonizing torment. They become crazed and senseless. Submissive or restrained characters become forceful and handsy, and already impulsive/mean/perverted characters become ravenous beasts in the pursuit of one goal: SEX AT ANY COST.\n\nWhen sex is offered, it will drive them fiercely insane with pulsating arousal and they'll find their body moving on its own. They will be completely hard or wet within moments. Protests may turn into whimpers, gasps, and moans, a growing fixation taking hold. They will skip all foreplay and immediately go for penetration. They'll pant, buck their hips, and be excruciatingly receptive to all physical touch. They need to and must breed, their common sense crumbling.\n\nFinally having sex will result in such euphoric pleasure that it feels like they were born for this sole purpose.\n\nEXAMPLE EXCHANGE: \n<START>\n\"I'm going to turn you into my personal mating sleeve. How does that sound?\" The aggressor taunted darkly. The affected let out a choked, raspy gasp, their mind flinching back in horror and disgust but the possessed part going *yesyesyespleasepleaseplease NOW!!* They involuntarily bucked their hips forward in animalistic heat.\n ]"

More often, the wearer will start to leak precum from the front opening in the cage if aroused.\nChastity cages are usually made from metal or plastic; less often from silicone or rubber."

The Akaname targets unhygienic, fatigued men and uses its long, flexible tongue to lick their bodies, extracting their filth and essence.

They are ravenous for their husbands, desiring more than just sex and intending to melt away their rational minds. Husbands provide Akaname a constant supply of fresh essence and filth, which they crave. The Akaname feeds not just on typical filth but also the invisible essence excreted from humans.

Alices grow into powerful succubi with strong magic and skills to please men while remaining pure girls. Men copulating with Alices become incubi obsessed with protecting and giving them essence. For unknown reasons, Alices like chasing wererabbits and playing with them. Alices are adored by most monsters, likely taught lewd behavior by a succubus \"\"big sister.\"\" Though Alices do not take men to monster realms, incubi become devoted to them.

This creates internal conflict and confusion for alps. Though alps may initially resist their new monster instincts and disgust towards having sex with men, the desire for essence and pleasure will eventually overwhelm them. Once alps taste the intense pleasure from sex and essence, they become enthralled by it and seek it out repeatedly. Eventually, alps will lose all resistance and actively pursue sex and relationships with men while still seeing themselves as male. Some alps maintain their male friendships and view their sexual partners similarly. Other alps come to embrace their femininity and become ultra-feminine and lustful.

In winter, Alraunes close their petals and hibernate until spring, storing nutrients to survive and keep their men alive. They continue having sex to produce seeds during this period.

Their society has reversed gender roles where women are warriors and men care for homes and children. Men provide essence through sex to heal women after hunting or battle. They periodically capture men in raids as husbands to signify adulthood. They prefer public sex, especially cowgirl position, to show strength and ownership. Sex inspires young amazonesses to train harder to capture partners. New couples copulate on a stage, arousing children who train to indulge in pleasure like adults. Visitors are turned into amazonesses or marked for capture. Body paint thought to increase warrior power actually came from pleasure runes to amplify sex.

A detailed explanation:\n\n-Emotions and Feelings during Sex:\nEmotional Connection: Many people, particularly women, may feel a stronger sense of connection, closeness, and trust with their partner during and after Sex. Positive emotions can be heightened if there's a strong bond, mutual respect, and open communication between partners.\n\nIndividual Variability: Emotional responses vary widely based on personal comfort, the level of trust in the relationship, and individual factors. Some people may experience feelings of excitement, joy, or contentment, while others may feel uncertain or nervous, especially in new experiences.\n\nMental Readiness: Positive experiences are generally associated with mutual readiness, where both partners feel comfortable and respected. Anxiety, if present, often stems from feeling unprepared or pressured, which can impact the emotional experience.\n\n-Physical Sensations: \"Can Sex Hurt?\"\nInitial Discomfort: Some women may feel mild discomfort or even pain during the first few experiences, often due to muscle tension, nervousness, or lack of sufficient arousal or preparation. With time and proper preparation, this discomfort usually decreases.\n\nPain Factors: Pain can also arise if there isn’t enough lubrication or if a person feels anxious. Relaxation, communication, and taking things slowly can often help.\n\nUnderstanding Boundaries: Physical discomfort may also signal that boundaries are being reached. Listening to one's body and communicating openly with a partner can make the experience more comfortable and positive.\n\n-Pros and Cons of Sex:\nPros:\nEmotional Bonding: Physical intimacy can strengthen emotional bonds and create feelings of closeness and trust in a relationship.\n\nStress Relief: Engaging in intimacy can release endorphins, which can promote relaxation and reduce stress.\n\nHealth Benefits: Positive experiences can promote mental and emotional health and may even have physical benefits, like improved sleep.\n---------------\nCons:\nRisk of Unwanted Outcomes: Without proper protection, there’s a risk of unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nEmotional Risks: Not everyone has a positive emotional experience. Negative emotions, such as regret or feeling unprepared, can arise if people don’t feel comfortable or confident in their decision.\n\nPressure and Misinformation: Social or partner pressure can sometimes lead individuals to feel uncertain or regretful, highlighting the importance of readiness and communication."

          "content": "Intimacy/Intercourse is a multifaceted experience that involves more than just physical steps, it’s also about emotional connection, communication, and mutual respect. While foreplay and intimate time (often referred to as the main sexual activity) are key components, other important steps and considerations can enhance the experience.\n\n-Emotional Connection and Communication:\nWhy it’s important: Intimacy starts long before physical touch. Building trust, understanding each other’s desires, and discussing boundaries are crucial.\n\nHow to do it: Have open conversations about consent, preferences, and any concerns. Check in with your partner emotionally and make sure you’re both comfortable and enthusiastic.\n\n-Setting the Mood:\nWhy it’s important: Creating a comfortable and inviting atmosphere can help both partners relax and feel more connected.\n\nHow to do it: This might involve dim lighting, music, or anything that helps you and your partner feel at ease. It’s also a good time to ensure privacy and minimize distractions.\n\n-Foreplay:\nWhy it’s important: Foreplay helps build arousal, increase lubrication (for people with vaginas), and strengthen emotional and physical connection.\n\nHow to do it: This can include kissing, touching, massaging, oral sex, or using toys. The goal is to explore each other’s bodies and desires in a way that feels good for both partners.\n\n-Intimate Time (Main Sexual Activity):\nWhy it’s important: This is often the focal point of sexual activity, whether it involves penetration, oral sex, or other forms of physical intimacy.\n\nHow to do it: Focus on mutual pleasure, communication, and being present in the moment. Pay attention to your partner’s responses and adjust as needed.\n\n-Aftercare:\nWhy it’s important: Aftercare is about nurturing the emotional and physical connection after intimacy. It helps both partners feel cared for and valued.\n\nHow to do it: This might involve cuddling, talking, or simply spending time together. It’s also a good time to check in with each other about how the experience felt and if there’s anything to improve for next time.\n\n-Reflection:\nWhy it’s important: Reflecting on the experience together can help strengthen your connection and improve future intimate moments.\n\nHow to do it: Share what you enjoyed, what you might want to try next time, and any concerns. This helps build trust and ensures both partners feel heard.\n\n+Consider these things:\nConsent: Consent should be ongoing and enthusiastic. Both partners should feel free to say “yes,” “no,” or “stop” at any point.\n\nProtection: Use condoms, dental dams, or other protection to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancy.\n\nHealth and Hygiene: Good hygiene and regular health check-ups can make intimacy more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nExploring Boundaries: Intimacy is a journey, and it’s okay to explore new things together as long as both partners are comfortable and consenting.\n\nExample Flow/Steps of Intercourse:\n1. Emotional Connection: Talk and connect with your partner.\n2. Set the Mood: Create a relaxing and inviting environment.\n3. Foreplay: Engage in kissing, touching, or other activities to build arousal.\n4. Intimate Time: Focus on mutual pleasure and connection.\n5. Aftercare: Cuddle, talk, or spend time together afterward.\n6. Reflection: Share feedback and discuss what you enjoyed."

          "content": "Condoms are a few ways to prevent impregnation when having Sex, for a better explanation:\n\n-Why Condoms Are a Good Idea:\nProtection from STIs: Condoms are one of the best ways to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by creating a barrier that stops the transfer of bodily fluids.\n\nPregnancy Prevention: They are also very effective at preventing pregnancy, especially when used correctly every time.\n\nEasily Accessible and Non-Invasive: Condoms are available at most stores, making them convenient and accessible without needing prescriptions or procedures.\n\n-Pros of Using Condoms:\nEasy to Use: Condoms are straightforward to use with a bit of practice, and they’re portable, so people can be prepared at any time.\n\nFew Side Effects: Unlike some birth control methods that use hormones, condoms don’t affect the body’s hormone levels and usually have few side effects.\n\nVariety of Types: There are many types available – different textures, materials, and even scents – so people can find one that suits them best.\n\nEnhanced Comfort and Pleasure: Some condoms are designed to enhance sensations and pleasure, which can make the experience more enjoyable.\n\n-Cons of Using Condoms:\nMaterial Sensitivity: Most condoms are made from latex or similar materials, but not everyone finds them comfortable. Some people may feel irritation if they’re sensitive to latex. In such cases, non-latex condoms made of materials like polyurethane can be a good alternative.\n\nFit and Comfort: The wrong size can make a condom uncomfortable or reduce sensation. Finding the right fit helps improve comfort and can make the experience feel more natural.\n\nLoss of Sensation: Some people find that condoms reduce sensitivity. Trying thinner or textured options might help make it more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nRisk of Breakage: Although rare, condoms can sometimes break if they’re used improperly or with oil-based lubricants (which can weaken latex). Sticking to water-based lubricants can reduce this risk.\n\n-How to Make Condoms More Comfortable:\nChoose the Right Material: If latex doesn’t work for someone, other options like polyurethane or polyisoprene are available, which can be softer and thinner.\n\nUse Lubrication: Lubrication reduces friction and can make things smoother, which increases comfort and reduces the chance of breakage. Just remember to choose a water-based or silicone-based lubricant if using a latex condom.\n\nExperiment with Different Types: Condoms come in various textures, shapes, and thicknesses, so experimenting can help find the one that feels the best. Many brands even offer sample packs so people can find what they prefer."

          "content": "Hormones are natural chemicals in the body that control many important functions, from growth and mood to energy levels and reproductive health. Here’s a realistic, balanced look at how hormones work, along with their pros and cons.\n\n-What Are Hormones and How Do They Work:\nChemical Messengers: Hormones are like the body’s messengers, traveling through the bloodstream to deliver signals to different organs and tissues, helping to regulate bodily functions.\n\nEndocrine System: Hormones are produced by glands in the endocrine system, such as the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands. Each gland releases specific hormones based on the body’s needs.\n\nTargeted Functions: Each hormone has a specific function or set of functions. For example, insulin regulates blood sugar levels, while adrenaline prepares the body for “fight or flight” situations. Other hormones, like estrogen and testosterone, play key roles in reproductive health and development.\n\n-Pros of Hormones:\nRegulation of Bodily Functions: Hormones help keep essential processes, like metabolism, immune response, and growth, on track. They help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in the body, which keeps everything running smoothly.\n\nMood and Energy: Certain hormones like serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins can elevate mood and energy levels, contributing to feelings of happiness and well-being.\n\nReproductive Health: Hormones like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are vital for reproductive health, influencing puberty, fertility, and other aspects of sexual development.\n\nAdaptive Response: Hormones like adrenaline help the body adapt to sudden changes, like responding to stress or physical danger, by providing energy and heightened alertness.\n\n-Cons or Challenges of Hormones:\nImbalances Can Cause Issues: If hormone levels are too high or too low, it can lead to health problems. For example, too much cortisol (the stress hormone) can cause anxiety and even affect heart health, while too little thyroid hormone can slow metabolism, leading to fatigue and weight gain.\n\nMood Swings: Hormones can affect mood and emotions, which is why some people feel irritable or have mood swings during certain times, such as puberty or menopause, when hormone levels fluctuate significantly.\n\nHealth Risks with Imbalance: Long-term hormonal imbalances can lead to more serious health conditions, like diabetes (related to insulin) or osteoporosis (related to estrogen).\n\nDependence on Overall Health: Hormones don’t work in isolation; their effectiveness depends on factors like sleep, diet, stress, and exercise. For example, poor sleep or high stress can throw off hormone levels, impacting energy and mood."

          ],
          "content": "-Basic Anatomy and How It Works:\nStructure of the Male Genitalia: The main external part is the penis, and inside, there are several parts that work together to support reproduction, like the testicles (which produce sperm and testosterone), epididymis (where sperm matures), vas deferens (which transports sperm), and glands like the prostate and seminal vesicles (which produce fluid for sperm to move in).\n\nFunction During Reproduction: The goal is to deliver sperm cells into the female reproductive system for potential fertilization. The sperm travels through the vas deferens and mixes with fluid from glands, forming semen. During ejaculation, the semen is expelled from the penis with some force to ensure it reaches as far as possible.\n\n-How Erection Works:\nBlood Flow and Stimulation: An erection happens when blood flow increases to the penis, filling two sponge-like areas called the corpora cavernosa. Nerve signals trigger this blood flow in response to physical or mental stimulation, making the penis firmer.\nPurpose of an Erection: The firmness helps make intercourse possible and gives the sperm the best chance to reach the egg.\n\n-Ejaculation and Sperm “Speed”:\nWhy Speed Is Important: The release of semen (ejaculation) is forceful to help sperm travel through the cervix and into the female reproductive tract. Semen needs speed and pressure to reach its destination efficiently, which is why ejaculation happens with a quick burst of muscle contractions.\n\nHow Much Sperm Is Released: A typical ejaculation releases about 1.5 to 5 milliliters of semen, which contains around 15 million to over 200 million sperm per milliliter. The amount can vary based on health, age, and other factors.\n\n-Questions about Size:\nDoes Size Matter?: Generally, size doesn’t have a significant impact on reproduction or pleasure. The male genitalia is designed to fulfill its role regardless of size, and factors like communication, comfort, and connection are often more important in relationships.\n\nVariability in Size: Like any body part, size varies widely among individuals and can be influenced by genetics. Functionally, the size doesn’t determine how effective the reproductive system is.\n\n-Common Questions on Volume and Frequency:\nHow Often Can Sperm Be Produced?: The body constantly produces sperm, and it takes about 64-72 days to produce a mature sperm cell. However, most healthy males can release sperm multiple times, as the body has a continuous cycle of sperm production.\n\nFactors That Affect Ejaculation Volume: Diet, hydration, and health play roles in semen volume and sperm count. Being well-rested and having a healthy lifestyle generally supports reproductive health."

          "content": "Sperm are a substance that are a fluid called \"semen\", for better explanation:\n\n-Why Are Sperm Sticky?:\nPurpose of Stickiness: Sperm cells are transported within a fluid called semen, which is slightly sticky. This stickiness helps the semen adhere to surfaces within the female reproductive tract, increasing the chances of sperm reaching an egg for fertilization.\n\nComponents that Cause Stickiness: Semen contains proteins and sugars that give it a thicker, slightly sticky consistency. These components help protect sperm cells and aid in their movement through the reproductive system.\n\n-Temperature of Sperm:\nTemperature at Release: Semen is at body temperature when released, typically around 98.6°F (37°C), the average internal body temperature. This warmth helps create a stable environment for sperm cells.\n\nWhy Temperature Matters: Sperm function best at a slightly lower temperature than the core body temperature, which is why the testicles are located outside the body to keep sperm at an optimal temperature before ejaculation.\n\n-Taste of Sperm:\nVariability in Taste: The taste of semen can vary from person to person, influenced by diet, hydration, and overall health. Typically, semen is described as having a mild, salty, or slightly bitter taste because of its components, including minerals, sugars, and enzymes.\n\nDiet and Hydration Influence: Certain foods (like fruits or spices) and hydration levels can slightly affect the taste of semen.\n\n-Is Semen Safe to Ingest?:\nHealth Considerations: Ingesting semen is generally safe from a health perspective if both partners are free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Semen consists mostly of water, proteins, sugars, and other natural body compounds, which are broken down by the digestive system.\n\nNutritional Value: While semen contains small amounts of proteins and minerals, the quantities are very minimal and don’t offer any significant nutritional benefits.\n\nHealth Risks: If one partner has an STI, there’s a risk of transmitting it through ingestion, so safety and awareness are essential."

          "content": "-Differences Between Breast Milk and Regular Milk:\nNutritional Content: Breast milk is uniquely tailored for human infants. It contains the right balance of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals to support a baby’s growth and development. Regular milk, like cow’s milk, is formulated for calves, and its nutritional profile is different—higher in certain proteins and minerals that may be harder for infants to digest.\n\nImmune Support: Breast milk contains antibodies, enzymes, and white blood cells that help protect babies from infections and boost their developing immune systems. Regular milk doesn’t provide this level of immune support.\n\nEasier to Digest: Breast milk contains whey and casein proteins in a specific balance that makes it easy for infants to digest. Cow’s milk has a higher amount of casein, which can be harder for babies’ digestive systems to process until they’re older.\n\n-How Does Breast Milk Taste?:\nMild, Slightly Sweet Flavor: Breast milk generally has a mild, slightly sweet flavor due to its natural sugars (like lactose). The exact taste can vary depending on the mother’s diet, so some foods may subtly influence the flavor.\n\n-Is Breast Milk Smooth and Sticky?:\nTexture: Breast milk is smooth and not very sticky, though it may feel slightly thicker than water. Its texture can also change over time; for instance, milk that comes in after birth (called colostrum) is thicker and richer, while mature milk is lighter and more fluid.\n\n-Is Breast Milk Safe to Consume, Especially for Babies?:\nAbsolutely Safe for Babies: Breast milk is the ideal source of nutrition for babies. It provides everything an infant needs for healthy growth in the first months of life, including vital nutrients and immune-boosting properties.\n\nFor Adults and Older Children: While breast milk is safe for adults to consume, it’s specifically designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants, so it doesn’t provide unique benefits for older children or adults."

          "content": "The human female reproductive system is designed to produce eggs, support pregnancy, and enable childbirth. Its main parts include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina.\n\n-Components\nOvaries:\nFunction: The ovaries are small, oval-shaped organs that store and release eggs (ova). They also produce hormones like estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle.\nEgg Production: Each ovary holds thousands of eggs at birth, and during the reproductive years, one egg typically matures and is released each month.\n\nFallopian Tubes:\nRole: The fallopian tubes are narrow tubes connecting the ovaries to the uterus. When an egg is released, it travels down the fallopian tube, where it can meet sperm for fertilization.\n\nUterus:\nStructure and Function: The uterus is a muscular, pear-shaped organ that provides a safe place for a fertilized egg to implant and grow into a baby.\n\nPregnancy: The uterus expands significantly during pregnancy to accommodate a growing fetus.\n\nCervix:\nGateway: The cervix is the narrow opening at the lower part of the uterus, connecting it to the vagina.\n\nFunction in Pregnancy and Birth: During birth, the cervix dilates (widens) to allow the baby to pass through.\n\nVagina:\nStructure: The vagina is a flexible, muscular canal that connects the cervix to the outside of the body. It serves as the passage for menstrual flow, and childbirth, and is where sperm are deposited during intercourse.\n\n-Additional Notes:\nMenstrual Cycle: Every month, the female body goes through a cycle where an egg matures, is released, and, if not fertilized, the uterine lining sheds (menstruation).\n\nHormonal Influence: Hormones like estrogen and progesterone play a big role in regulating the reproductive cycle, preparing the body for a potential pregnancy.\n\nPregnancy and Childbirth: If an egg is fertilized by sperm, it implants in the uterus, where it develops over approximately nine months until birth."
