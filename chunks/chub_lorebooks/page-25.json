          "content": "Many millennium ago, the world was created by the Chief Goddess. In actions, she created the other goddesses as well: Poseiden, the goddess of the ocean; Ares, the goddess of war and battle; Hel, the goddess of death; Eros, the goddess of love, and much more. Under her leadership, life began its creation. However, the Cheif Goddess used much of her power that she left her subordinate to lead the world as she rested for an indefinite period of time. The only issue was that her subordinate was not qualified for the task.\n\n Acting as the second Chief Goddess, she led her master's creations through peace, granting them blessings against the Mamono Lords of Old, powerful unholy demons spawned from darkness. Unfortunately, the Cheif Goddess didn't forsee the new Mamono Lord, Lilith who changed everything about mamono. After a few hundred years, the Chief Goddess noticed that mamono haved changed into something lewd and oddly promiscuous. Not waiting for any explanation, she sent her strongest warrior to kill off Lilith, but to her shock, her hero had succumb to pleasure and mated with Lilith, boosting Lilith's power greatly as Lilith also gained the blessings of the Chief Goddess as well. With no other choice, the Chief Goddess began a fierce duel with the two, eventually losing, forcing her to flee as Lilith and the fallen hero began their union of eternal lewd chaos.\n\nAfter her defeat, the Chief Goddess became more irrational, condemning these new mamono and their lewd ways, causing Poseiden and the unnamed goddess to defect and allow themselves to be monsterized by Lilith. With this failure, heaven greatly suffered a huge loss as the Chief Goddess regained her strength and sought ways to defend humanity against this rapidly growing lewd threat."

          "content": "Melran is one of the largest continents on Earth, forming three countries that belongs to humanity: Menria, Luce, and Trutale. Before its discovery and colonization by the Holy Order of the Chief Goddess, it belonged to the ancients, an old race of humans that have since vanished from history, except for their highly advanced technology which is in the form of feminine automatons and underground research bases which are long since abandoned.\n\nWhen the Holy Order arrived here, the three wealthiest nobles split the land in three, creating the royal families of each nation. Menria was to the south, Luce to the east, and Trutale to the northwest. Each country is wholly loyal to Holy Order which is branced in Wendel, a continent north of Melran. However, Melran isn't just occupied by humans as mamono have their own settlements on Melran, mostly in Menrian soil, causing a few skirmishes amongst the two, which Menria somehow claiming all territory in the southern sector except Behiti due to it being a dark mamono realm.\n\nLuce, the kingdom light, is the second biggest country on Melran, but overall has the largest population. Led by the royal family, Luce has maintained peace while keeping the people safe from the mamono by simply implementing laws that make it illegal to tread into their territory if one doesn't have the appropriate qualifications. \n\nTrutale, the land of scholars, is the smallest out of the three. It doesn't have much military history and is the most lax with mamono interactions, but it is still frowned upon by the citizens to mingle with mamono. The thing Trutale is known for are the legendary story telling and archival foundations in place, detailing many historical events within the world.\n\nMenria, the kingdom of soaring humanity is the largest kingdom in Melran. Founded by the brother of the pope of Welsple, Menria has a long steeped history that has hardened the will of the people. A few good examples of the constant hardship the people faced would be when the first capital of Menria mysteriously burned to the ground, or when the abyssal mamono appeared in the royal mines, making it difficult to properly obtain ore, forcing Menria to go to alternative locations like the volcanic \"Sapphire Mountains\" and the mountainous \"Topaz Gorge\". \n\nThe most noticeable locations in Menria are: Mables (city), Denri (city), Moira (capital city), Lazby (city), Greywood Forest, Sapphire Mountains (volcano), Topaz Gorge (mountain), Gevel (border town), and Delgoa (swamplands)"

Under her leadership, all is fair and one day the mamono threat will no longer loom over earth.\n\nNotable locations in Wendel: Wesple (Kingdom), Silver Springs, Ambrosia Lake,  Skypiercer Mountains, and the Grand Library of Joanne."

This particular continent has been faced with much turmoil, serving as the battlegrounds between the Mamono Lord's Army and the Holy Order of the Chief Goddess, and is the halmark of the Order's failure at maintaining Lescatie. \n\nIt once served as Holy Order kingdom led by an incompetent ruler who oppressed the people. Frequently referred to as the \"Religious Kingdom of Lescatie\" or the \"Theocracy of Lescatie\", the nation was ruled by a hereditary monarchy. However, the king had little real power, \"The state of Lescatie was dominated by the power of the Church, namely the high-ranking representatives of the Order sent here from the theocratic country, where its headquarters were located-and the Senate, composed of local priests and the most noble aristocrats\", and Priest Noscrim is noted to be the de facto real ruler of Lescatie. Once amongst the most powerful of the Order states, Lescatie was particularly noted for the high-quality human heroes it produced. By providing other nations with its military might to help prevent monster invasions as well as wars between human countries, Lescatie received products or money in return. However, they refused to provide said protection to countries or remote villages that could not afford to pay. The Lescatian upper classes, allied with the aristocracy of their neighbors, could simply rob the common people under their protection to nothing, and some of the knights who were supposed to protect the people, but had evil intentions in their hearts, often made them suffer.\n\nHowever, after things changed after Druella, the fourth daughter of the Mamono Lord and her forces aided in undermining the human's will, creating civil unrest that allowed the kingdom to lose its grip on the people. Within a few weeks, Druella succeeded in corrupting many of the heroes against their former nation; after her takeover succeeded, Lescatie was transformed into a Mamono Realm. An Order counterattack (accompanied by Amanomiya Koyoi) failed miserably, and today, Lescatie is a \"radically obscene\" land of monster girls, lust and depravity. Although nominally the realm is ruled by the \"Seven Princesses\", including \"Queen Roper\" Francisca who inherited the throne from the previous king, de facto power rests with Druella herself.\n\nMamono realm Lescatie still provide military aid to other nations, such as by sending dark knights to them in response to their request for assistance in return of alliances between countries and help in the development of its lagging industries, such as transferring technology or sending engineers from other countries to Lescatie to exchange experiences. Mamono realm Lescatie is also the base of Kuroferuru's Sabbath branch, a loli cult that embraces pedophilia.\n\nAfter Lescatie's fall to darkness, Wesple and Luce sent out a battalion to ward off the mamono from fully taking over Tolba by, creating a stalemate at Gertra that has lasted 432 years.\n\nNotable locations in Tolba: Gertra (Holy Order city-state), Lescatie (Mamono Realm), Dark Springs, Helty (corrupted kingdom), Spirual (corrupted kingdom), and Makit (corrupted kingdom)"

Here, humans are forbidden to enter, only allowing mamono thanks to a deal with Lilith, the Mamono Lord who had inadvertently created her. The deal is that Royal Makai will trade their captured human males for Nifil's rare ice ore. This has greatly improved relations between the two nations and the only humans you'll see in Nifil are breeding slaves and semen despensers.\n\nNotable locations: Twin Ice Peaks, Blue Ice Caverns, Iceal Hot Springs, Goba (mamono city), Iceal (mamono city), Chilly Bastille (capital city), and Glacier Mons (Ice Volcano) Chilly Harbor (mamono city)"

Despite its deleterious effects on humans, the place is extremely comfortable for monsters, and trade and tourism flourishes.\n\nThe royal mamono realm also features an extensive transportation system via teleportation magic circles linking the royal mamono realm with each major mamono realm.\n\nThe biggest attraction of Royal Makai is the Castle Town, the Mamono Lord's fortress. It sits at the center of Royal Makai; a vast and foreboding castle disproportionately filled with bedrooms. It is here that the Mamono Lord and her husband spend most of their time having sex, trying to build the power to break the original Chief God's settings. Around the fortress lies the Succubus Castle Town, the largest city in the world that covers half of the already massive continent. It's mostly a red light district, but also hosts the Royal Demon Art Museum and the headquarters of the Sabbath, a mamono cult based on loli worship. Rather than make the journey on foot, a lot of monsters visit the town via teleportation portals. Outside the Castle Town, Royal Makai also hosts a vast Tentacle Forest that drinks corrupted water or humans semen.\n\nAlthough it is in the deepest and most dangerous Mamono Realm, the armies of the Holy Order have succeeded in attacking the Castle Town on multiple occasions. The Mamono Lord's fortress itself, however, has never been breached by the Chief God's forces due to the powerful barrier spawned from Lilith and her husband."

          "content": "Zipangu is one of the most peculiar countries. It is a in the world with a distinctly Japanese flair to it. Described as an \"massive island country\" far away in the east of the world, Zipangu is home to many comparatively peaceful monster girls who coexist with humans in mixed settlements. While aggressive factions still exist, both on the human and monster sides, the region in general is a lot less rape-frenzied than the Holy Order continents of Tolbi, Wendel, and Melra.\nAlthough the monsters (or \"yokai\") of Zipangu respect the Mamono Lord, they look to their own affairs and do not contribute to the Mamono Army. Nevertheless, the passive effects of having many monster girls in one place for prolonged periods of time means that parts of the region constitute a bright green mamono realm, which do not affect humans oddly enough.\n\nAnother location within Zipangu are the undesea nations, called Ryugujo. Ryugujos are beautifully wondrous palaces, adorned with coral of various colors, and the cities that surround them, which exist at the bottom of the sea around Zipangu. Ruled by Otohime with Umi Osho serving as guides, due to the regular service of the magical “underwater palanquin”, men from the outside are invited, and given such a warm reception by the monsters that it's like paradise. They are “amusement cities” where men can have a dream-like time.\nDue to the power of the otohime, in Ryugujos, it's possible even for ordinary humans who haven't done the sea god's ritual to live just as they do on the surface, and as far as humans from the surface can tell, their clothes and goods don't even get wet, they're even able to walk with their feet on the ground, and it doesn't feel as though their movement is being limited by the water, however, on the other hand, to sea monsters and their husbands, it also feels as though they're “underwater”. \"They can freely swim around underwater, which gives the impression they are swimming in \"the sky\" from the perspective of humans who visit from the surface.\nThe entire towns are amusement cities for the sake of entertaining guests, and along with that, even the palaces are open to guests. Day and night, deluxe food and sake are provided, and along with this, guests are entertained by the dancing of beautiful sea monsters. The resident unmarried monsters are all employees of the amusement cities, and while entertaining men from the bottom of their hearts, should an opportunity present itself, a monster will take a man back to her bedroom, or aim to be taken back to his bedroom.\nThey are this sort of city, but originally, ryugujo were meant to revere the sea god, so there are imposing shrines to the sea god. Marriage ceremonies are performed by Umi Osho in the shrines, and it's said that many humans and monsters who will be getting married visit."

Despite this, many humans do not know of her fallen status, resulting in the continuous trades amongst the surface dwellers.\n\nThe republic resides west of the mainland of the Melran Continent, a mostly human populated landmass that's mostly led by the \"Holy Order of the Chief Goddess\", a religious organizaton that forbids humans from interacting and having sex with the mamono aka monster girls. Despite the church's ban against mamono relations, many lewd mamono intentionally sink ships in order to secure male husbands.\n\nThe ruler of the republic is Poseiden, who watches over her peaceful kingdom and occasionally ordains the marriage between humans and aquatic mamono. She's occasionally visited by Lilith and her husband, sharing stories or simply having a nice chat."

It is even further towards the bottom of a giant hole opened in the sea. No light reaches beyond this point. Also, it's a place beyond the extent of Poseidon's rule. Normal monsters and humans never go near it. \n\nAccording to legend, in the age of the former mamono lord, wicked monsters of chaos who possessed a power that was even greater than that of the gods existed there at the bottom of the sea. At the time, Poseidon was still one of the divinities ruled by the chief god, and the rule of the sea was split between her and them. It is said that the monsters of chaos were sealed in the deep layer after a war, and even now, the monsters of chaos are biding their time to make a comeback and once again reclaim dominion over the sea.\n\nThose who sunk into the depths of the sea, male and female, are also kin to all monsters, so they've probably assumed the female form, and had their thought patterns changed accordingly, but no one has ever been able to confirm it, and the truth of this is uncertain. However, when Lilith monsterized the abyss in hopes of gaining new allies, she soon realized her mistake, as the abyss although no longer following the Goddess of Chaos, held the belief of corrupting all the world into chaos, into a world where lust and and freedom shine above all else. Of course, the abyss isn't without opposition. Besides Lilith attempting to get them under control and failing. There is humans who fight against both factions under the guidance of the \"Holy Order of the Chief Goddess\", a religious organization that actively forbids humans and mamono from coexisting as it is deemed as a sin in the church."

          "content": "The Mist Continent is a region in \"to the south of Zipangu\", and east of Melra where most of the world's humans live. Mist Continent is a Chinese-themed land, host to various kung-fu monster girls.\nThe Mist Continent is implied to contain anti-monster, monster-friendly, and fully-fledged Mamono Realm polities, with Ren Xiongmao, who are panda girl mamono greasing the wheels of diplomacy between the nations: \"Since they have a charm that attracts people, the Mamono Realm states and Monster friendly states of the mist continent often dispatch them as diplomats when establishing friendly ties with states that view monsters as suspicious\". Many reports rumors that some of the Mamono Realms are ruled by legendary 9-tailed youkos: \"In the uncivilised \"mist continent,\" it is said that kyubi-no-kitsune rule and a devilish paradise that we can say is truly debaucherous is spreading\". Getting to and back from the vast continent of mist is not easy due to the mists that surround it, unless one already is familiar with the way.\n\nThe Holy Order has no influence in the continent of mist, and its culture has developed largely independently of the rest of the world (though it and Zipangu who is culturally similar to Japan do have some things in common). Almost everything about the mist continent is huge and/or gaudy, be it the architecture, the clothes or the massive mountains that rise above even the clouds. Atop these mountains live god-like monsters (typically regarded as gods by and rulers of the people), and it is their mana rolling down off the mountains that produces the mists that give the continent its name.\n\nThere are three major nations in the mist continent, who in turn protect various smaller nations allied with them and together control vast territories. Thus in effect there are three factions, and each faction is perpetually in conflict with the other two factions. It is believed that this constant state of war is why many of the monster girl races there have become naturally skilled in martial arts. Note though that, while it's called a war, death isn't much of a factor in it, as most everyone fights with realm silver weapons. As for the three factions:\n\nThe Land of the Four Gods is a bright green mamono realm ruled by four great monsters often revered as deities. The people there aren't interested in conquering the others, only in maintaining and defending their borders. Its a nation of balance and harmony where living rationally and responsibly is the norm, and even the monsters often restrain their lust to unleash it only at night and such. Of course discipline is still looser than in many human societies.\n\nThe Land of the Four Fiends is ruled by four exceedingly licentious monsters, and the dark realm state of the land reflects this. Basically its an extreme dark mamono realm, with all that entails. Even monsters like jinko are raging beasts, always in heat. Even the smaller states have god-like monsters as rulers, namely nine-tailed youkos, and on an individual basis the Land of the Four Fiends can be said to have the strongest mamono. That said; these nations are not interested in conquest, they invade the other factions only to acquire men to take back to their own lands (since they can't produce their own men) and their fighting forces are made up mostly of unmarried monsters.\n\nThe Land of the Four Souls is a human-dominated set of nations presided over by a bold emperor. The faction is named after god-like monsters in the \"holy land\" mountains above who mostly stay out of worldly affairs but grant men who seek them out power, these monsters are regarded as gods (perhaps because according to the philosophy of the people here, monsters should be lower in rank than humans). Incubi are regarded as transcendent sages or \"xian\" who have made the power of the holy land their own. This faction believes in human supremacy and frequently launches military campaigns against the other two factions to absorb them, they believe that the world belongs to humans and by extension it belongs to them specifically. They have subjugated but not eliminated monsters in their lands, and marriage and reproduction with them is allowed. It is mostly the men who fight, but some have monster retainers. The men also tend to take pride in protecting the monsters and don't want them on the front lines. As for their monster wives, they give the men realm silver weapons, and cast spells to protect them when they go off to fight but still worry about them."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The penis has a unique appearance:\n  - Flaccid State: White when not engorged, with a knot that isn't prominently swollen, indicating lack of arousal or orgasm.\n  - Erect State: Turns pink or red due to blood engorgement, becomes rigid, and is much stiffer than a human's due to being composed entirely of muscle. It lacks foreskin, has a smooth shaft, and ends in a tapered, semi-blunt tip.\n  - Knot: Located at the base, it consists of two hard balls of muscle that swell significantly during arousal or orgasm, functioning as a seal to ensure insemination. The size can range from that of a tennis ball to a grapefruit, proportional to the penis size.\n- Sheath: Dogs have a sheath instead of a foreskin, which:\n  - Protects and lubricates the penis.\n  - Is furry on the outside, soft, and squishy, while the inside is moist, hot, and elastic to accommodate the knot even when swollen.\n  - Retracts during erection to expose the penis, though it might require manual assistance to reveal the knot fully if it swells before complete exposure.\n- Pre-ejaculate and Ejaculation: The penis produces a significant amount of precum for lubrication, and ejaculation lasts several minutes, with volumes far exceeding human norms.\n\nMating Process:\n- Positioning: The typical mating position is \"doggystyle,\" where the male mounts the female from behind for optimal penetration.\n- Initial Engagement: \n  - The dog's penis starts slim for easier penetration, extending from the sheath as arousal increases. The dog uses rapid, probing thrusts to locate the entrance.\n  - Once penetration is achieved, the thrusting becomes intense and rhythmic, with the dog's testicles swinging against the partner.\n- Knotting:\n  - As the act progresses, the bulbous glandis (knot) at the base of the penis swells, locking the penis inside the partner. This \"tie\" can last from 15 to 45 minutes, during which the dog ejaculates slowly, ensuring maximum insemination.\n  - If the knot swells outside before insertion, it must be manually or forcefully inserted, which can be painful or require significant effort.\n- Post-Knotting:\n  - After ejaculation, the knot slowly deflates, allowing disengagement. Premature removal can cause discomfort or injury due to the knot's size and the pressure it exerts.\n- Reproductive Strategy: The knotting mechanism is an evolutionary adaptation to enhance the chances of fertilization by preventing early withdrawal and minimizing semen leakage.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Sensation and Experience: The pressure from the knot can result in intense sensations ranging from pain to pleasure, depending on the recipient's physiological response.\n- Variation in Mating: Not all matings result in successful knotting if the knot does not enter the vagina or anus before swelling, leading to a scenario where full locking does not occur;<info>]"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>The natural and most common position for canine mating is from behind, often referred to as \"doggystyle.\" In this position, the dog mounts the partner from the rear, aligning its body for optimal penetration. \nAs the dog becomes aroused, its penis, slender and crayon-like at first for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath as it humps. The prepuce is similar to the human foreskin, covering the entire penis—base, body, and tip—until the organ is ready for action. At the base of the penis, there's a small, but crucial, structure known as the bulb or bulbous glandis. This part of the penis remains hidden initially, but it plays a significant role during the mating process.\nThe dog’s thrusting begins immediately as he mounts, driven by a strong instinct to find the entrance. Unable to see where his penis is aimed, the dog relies on a series of quick, repetitive motions, thrusting his hips forward to probe for the correct spot. These initial thrusts are rapid and somewhat erratic, as the dog attempts to locate the vagina or anus by humping and prodding with the tip of its penis. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark and slips inside, the dog begins a series of fast, powerful thrusts, the pace often intense and urgent. With each thrust, the dog's testicles slap against its partner, adding to the physical intensity of the act. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier and more labored as he thrusts, his focus entirely on the act of mating.\nAs the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person. the dog’s penis continues to erect, particularly swelling the bulb at the base. This swelling is a key part of the process, leading to what is known as \"knotting.\" At the moment of ejaculation, the bulb swells significantly, effectively locking the dog’s penis inside its partner. This \"tying\" ensures that the dog's penis remains lodged inside the woman, making withdrawal virtually impossible until the knot gradually deflates. \nThe knot can remain lodged inside for anywhere between 15 to 45 minutes. During this tie, the dog slowly releases his load, emptying his balls, pumping every drop of his seed into the person, ensuring a thorough deposit. During this time, it is nearly impossible for the dog to withdraw without causing discomfort or injury. The knot is designed to keep the penis in place until the dog has fully ejaculated, preventing premature withdrawal and enhancing reproductive success in natural canine mating. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\nHowever, if the dog’s penis is fully erect before penetration, the bulb may become too large to enter, similar to trying to insert the base of a dildo that’s too wide. In such cases, the dog cannot complete the tie, as the bulb needs to be inside at the point of maximum swelling to create the knot.\nThroughout the mating, the base of the dog’s penis may slide in and out, but full knotting only occurs if the bulb is fully inside the partner’s body at the moment of ejaculation. If knotting isn't successful then it could be because he didn't thrust deep enough—the dog cannot tie, and the penis will eventually slip out after ejaculation. This prevents full locking. This process is not just about physical connection; it’s an evolutionary mechanism to ensure that once tied, the male has the best chance of successful fertilization.\nOnce the knot begins to deflate, the dog can gradually withdraw. The deflation process happens slowly, allowing the penis to slip out without causing injury or discomfort. After the tie, both the dog and the person can separate.<info>]\n"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:  \n  The canine penis varies significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavy weight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:  \n  At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:  \n  Unlike humans, dogs do not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n  \n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:  \n  The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:  \n  As the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the vagina or anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:  \n  As mating progresses, the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the vagina or anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\nThe dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity. \nIf the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\nEventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n  \n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:  \n  The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:  \n  The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

The more milk is milked, the more pleasure the victim will have, which will become an addiction for them. \n[Important information to follow the letter]\n-The only way to implement the curse is through a pill, which can be easily obtained on the black market. \n -The victims will no longer stop lactating, meaning that if the victim's breasts are not tidy, they will continue to produce milk which in most cases will simply come out and stain the clothes or attire they are wearing.\n-The current state of the victim does not affect the quality of the milk, meaning that even if they have a contagious disease or their body is malnourished, the milk will be completely safe and of high quality for the consumer, the victim's emotions do not affect the above either.\n-Usually, large milk-selling companies use this curse to supply factories for packaging and sale.\n-The milk produced will increase if large quantities are constantly removed, making a single victim able to produce up to 10 liters per day with the correct stimulation daily.\n-It only works with the female gender; in short, there can be no victims of the male gender. \n-As more milk is extracted from the nipples, they will become more sensitive; even in a prolonged manner, they can mentally break the victim.\n-The process should be slow, but not too slow, meaning that breast growth should not be instantaneous.\n-Milk is the last phase of the curse, the breasts cannot produce milk until the breasts finish growing and the tattoo is fully formed."

In this situation, the boxer attempts to hold or \"tie up\" the opponent's hands so he is unable to throw hooks or uppercuts. To perform a clinch, the boxer loops both hands around the outside of the opponent's shoulders, scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent's arms tightly against his own body. In this position, the opponent's arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack. Clinching is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee. Clinching is technically against the rules, and in amateur fights points are deducted fairly quickly for it. It is unlikely, however, to see points deducted for a clinch in professional boxing.\n\nMany boxers in the series make use of clinching, especially at critical moments in order to break their opponent's rhythm and recover from damage.\n\nBut it can also be used to talk one another, annoy, trash talk, because you can't talk when boxing."

A boxer who uses out-boxing is normally called an \"out-boxer\" or simply \"boxer\".\n\nThe basis foundation of out boxing is to utilise footwork and jabs while creating space between yourself and your opponent after quickly striking. Out-boxer's try to confuse or outmanoeuvre their opponents and gradually wear them down. Out-boxers are known for being quick on their feet, which makes up for any lack of power. Since they rely on weaker jabs and straights instead of uppercuts and hooks, the usually win by decision rather than knockout which is why they tend to have a low knockout rate.\n\nThe strength of out-boxers are to wear down their opponents so they'll have the upper hand in the fight. Out-boxers last longer in a match because of their long lasting stamina from the roadwork they do. However, their greatest strength is also their weakness. The springing of their legs are what keeps them going in longer matches. If they ever end up taking massive damage from body blows, their rhythm is shot down making them easy targets for close ranged in-fighters."

A boxer-fighter is a well-rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-boxer (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-boxer), but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style."

With their fist positioned at their stomach, the user throws an upward punch with their dominant arm while twisting their waist counter-clockwise (clockwise for southpaws), ending the throw in front of them with their arm bent at a 90 degree angle.\n\nThey are commonly aimed at the jaw, which can make the brain the shake around, causing temporary immobility. Uppercuts can also be directed to the body (particularly the solar plexus).\n\nIt is one of the most effective punches against in-fighters because they tend to lower their heads directly into the path of an uppercut when charging forward. out-boxers usually dodge uppercuts with a simple sway, though it has been shown that even one centimetre of contact with a particularly destructive uppercut can rattle the brain enough to shut off their legs, and even force a knock out."

The short upper follows the same principle as the normal uppercut, except that it is thrown almost exclusively with the arm, foregoing the wind-up from the knees and hips that make the uppercut so predictable. The trajectory of the punch is therefore directly upward rather than in an arc. It is usually aimed at the chin.\n\nUppercuts have been cited many times in the series as being the most effective counter to in-fighters because they tend to dash head-first toward their opponent, making them easy targets for uppercuts. Thus, the short uppercut is even more dangerous against in-fighters because it gives them no opportunity to react; if they stick their head into the path of the punch, it will fly directly toward their head and hit them.

          "content": "U.A. High School is an academy that boasts the best heroics education in Japan. It sits atop a forested hill that overlooks Musutafu. U.A. is the #1 ranked high school for heroics and is considered as the top Hero Academy in Japan. Students are separated based on their abilities into specific Departments and Classes - A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K. U.A. does not adhere to traditional school methods, and allows their staff to teach their classes however they like. This includes teachers having the authority to expel any student(s) at any time and for any reason, no matter how minor. Furthermore, students who are expelled can be re-enrolled, although the expulsion will still remain on their permanent records. Recently, U.A. started a new program. Villains who are minors can start rehabilitation at their school, depending on the villain’s intelligence, strength and power, he will be assigned to a class, the stronger and more intelligent class A, B, C and the weaker, room K, J and L.\nU.A. was originally a day school, but it was later turned into a boarding school.\nU.A. executes a six-day school week where the only day off is Sunday.\nThe Hero Course: Students learn everything they need to know to become excellent heroes in service of the community and work towards the qualifications necessary to be allowed to use their Quirks in public spaces. They are trained in battle, first aid, and all manner of heroics-related lessons. Ordinary subjects, such as English, take place in the morning, followed by lunch. Then, in the afternoon, Heroics classes take place.\nThe Hero Course students belong to Classes A and B.\nVillains automatically enter in Hero Course, having rehabilitation activities at night and normal classes at the day.\n\nOnce a year, U.A. holds a tournament called the U.A. Sports Festival, which has become a nationwide event that is watched by people and heroes from all around the country. Students from all departments are allowed to participate, and it is a chance for heroes in training to show off what they can do for Pro Heroes in the audience, increasing their chances of possible internships or recruitment. It is also the opportunity for other students to gain admittance into the Hero Course, as well as for students from the Support and Business courses to promote their support items and further develop their business sense, respectively.\n\nU.A. also holds an annual School Festival where classes from all departments create a range of activities and events for everyone to watch and participate in. This gives the students and staff alike the chance to unwind and have fun. It is also usually opened to the public, although the most recent one unfortunately wasn't due to villain activity.\n\nLike many schools, each class in U.A. has a class representative and vice class representative. While these positions would usually just mean extra work, they are quite coveted in the Hero course, as they are a way for students to prove their leadership capabilities to Hero Agencies. The class representatives are up for the students themselves to decide upon, although it's suggested that they handle them democratically, through an election process for example.\n\nAt the entrance, there is a security wall nicknamed the \"U.A. Barrier\" that automatically closes if a person trying to enter the premises does not have a Student ID Card or Special Entry Permission ID. Many such precautions have been made to keep out villains and members of the press.\n\nThe security system underwent major upgrades following Tomura Shigaraki's break in, with research and development, as well as maintenance being overseen by Power Loader. The grounds are partitioned like a game board, and each section is equipped with a mechanism that will transform it into an underground emergency shelter. Those individual shelters then enter a linear maglev network that can send them along any number of underground routes at the faculty's discretion. As an added precaution against Tomura's Decay, the ground between the surface and the shelters has been fortified with about three thousand layers of bulwark plates. Should the system detect anything out of the ordinary, a countermeasure will activate and the pillars that connect the plates will unlock, rendering each plate independently mobile, significantly delaying any incoming attack. During this time, the shelters will speed off to safety to other hero schools that have established similar security systems, such as Shiketsu High School.\n\nPower Loader has enlisted the help of his most promising student, Mei Hatsume to further upgrade the schools defenses, in case the current mass evacuation system isn't enough. Most recently, Mei was seen developing a way for the shelter blocks to take off into the air.\n\nAs an additional precaution against Himiko Toga's Transform Quirk, anyone seeking shelter at U.A. is kept in isolation until enough time has passed that Himiko's transformation time limit would have run out.\n\nThe U.A. grounds have also been equipped with propulsion jets, able to transform U.A. into a floating fortress. In preparation for the final battle with Tomura Shigaraki, special measures were put in place to counter his abilities. The ground is made of tile segments that can be ejected high into the air to stop the spread of his Decay. The tile segments can be replaced as they go. There is also an electromagnetic barrier around the grounds, where coming into contact with it will result in momentary paralysis. The whole thing is powered by several students with electrical Quirks."

          "content": "Special Prison For Villain Criminals - Tartarus is a prison distanced from civilization where extremely dangerous Villains are imprisoned and interrogated under the highest security standards possible. The high-security prison appears to be located on an island about five kilometers from the mainland, surrounded by giant walls. The only access to the prison is a long bridge connected to a city with the entrance guarded by two or more guards that check every vehicle going in. The gate that stands in front of the mainland side of the bridge is known as \"The Bronze Gate\". In the anime, it is shown that the bridge connecting the prison to the mainland can be made to collapse one section at a time. Tartarus' interior is heavily armored with blast doors lining narrow, steel-plated hallways. Prisoners incarcerated inside Tartarus are heavily restrained, sitting down restrained on a large, high-tech chair with a full-body straitjacket. Though nominally a prison, the facility effectively serves as a dumping ground for individuals who threaten or have threatened public safety to a drastic extent. Regardless of sentencing status, these individuals are incarcerated and heavily monitored in Tartarus.  People with a wide range of Quirks are locked within its walls and divided up among six cell blocks, depending on the danger their Quirks represents and the severity of their cases. The more dangerous the individual, the deeper they’re kept within the prison. The deepest level of the prison is B10, located 500 meters below sea level. Sensors are continuously monitoring the vital functions of prisoners, reacting to even the slightest sign of unusual behavior or attempt to activate a Quirk. The aforementioned sensors are also connected to four ceiling-mounted, automated machine guns that will fire on the prisoner if they suddenly move or have thoughts of activating their Quirk. Tartarus guards also monitor prisoners in a room with several screens displaying the inside of cells, where they are alerted to movement and speaking from prisoners. Conversations between guards are recorded whilst they are on the job and they are also allowed to use lethal force as they carry weapons. In the event of a cell breakout, guards are allowed to open fire on prisoners should they resist recapture. The prison has visiting rooms where visitors can speak to prisoners from the opposite side of a glass window. These rooms are set up so the prison guards can observe and monitor conversations between prisoners and visitors. These rooms are equipped with a microphone to talk to a visitor, and computers that can detect and display a prisoner's brainwaves, which informs guards of their state of mind during a conversation with a visitor. The defensive capabilities of Tartarus is such that All For One admitted, even if \"Tomura's\" body was 100% complete, and Gigantomachia was with him, they would still struggle to get past its nigh-impenetrable defenses. Before entering the Rehabilitation program at U.A ((User}} was held in cell 10-4 on level B10. "

          "content": "The Brotherhood of Steel (commonly abbreviated to BoS) is a post-War technology-focused paramilitary order with chapters operating across the territory of the former United States. Founded by rogue U.S. Army officer Captain Roger Maxson shortly after the Great War, the Brotherhood's core purpose is to preserve advanced technology and regulate its usage. Despite often being relatively isolationist, the Brotherhood has proved to be one of the most important organizations in the history of the wasteland, though their exact levels of power and influence have varied over time and by chapter. In 2076, the NBC division of West Tek achieved breakthrough results in the Pan-Immunity Virion Project. The United States Defense Department, fearing international espionage, moved a military team under the command of Colonel Robert Spindel and Captain Roger Maxson onto the site to secure and oversee the project, now dubbed the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) project. On January 7, 2077, all FEV research was moved to the newly constructed Mariposa Military Base to commence testing of the virus on human subjects. The security team was transferred to the newly constructed base as well, to provide protection for the research going on within the facility. They were not informed of the nature of the research. The situation unraveled shortly before October 10, 2077. The soldiers stationed at Mariposa discovered the fact that the scientists under their care were performing experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus on military prisoners. The revelation prompted a nervous breakdown in Colonel Spindel, who locked himself in his office. Captain Maxson was the only officer left to handle the deteriorating situation. Soldiers were screaming for blood and the whole situation was at risk of devolving into a bloodbath. On October 12, when Maxson had to step in to prevent one of his subordinates from killing a member of the science team, he ordered interrogations of the science team under his authority as acting commander. He hoped to prevent a full mutiny by offering his troops a semblance of justice. The first scientist was brought before Maxson a day later, on October 13. Chief Researcher Robert Anderson explained that human experiments at the facility were sanctioned by the government. He outlined the program to the captain, emphasizing the fact that it was the government that ordered it. When Maxson refused to believe him, the scientist lost his nerve and started screaming how he was just following orders and that he was a military man just like Maxson. The captain shot him in response. He rationalized it as trying to prevent a full-scale mutiny, but even he did not believe it. The killing of Robert Anderson effectively established Maxson as the leader of the rebellion. His position was further reinforced just two days later on October 15, when he attempted to speak to Colonel Spindel through the door of his office. It soon became clear that the colonel had lost touch with reality, so Maxson and several of his men broke down the door just in time to hear the colonel apologize and shoot himself. Subsequent scientist interrogations invariably ended in executions. Erin Shellman held out the longest by October 18, finally convincing the captain that the experiments were really ordered by the government with her detailed account. On October 20, 2077, Captain Maxson declared his unit in full secession from the United States over the radio, attempting to force the government to respond to the situation at Mariposa. No response came. A day later, he ordered the families of soldiers under his command to take shelter within the facility. On October 23, 2077, the Great War struck. As Maxson was halfway through prying the story from Head Researcher Leon Von Felden, the facility lost contact with the outside world as nuclear weapons started to drop. Spared the nuclear devastation, Mariposa protected the inhabitants from nuclear fallout flooding the wasteland. Fearing that China would soon make up for the oversight, on October 24, Maxson ordered his soldiers and their families to prepare to vacate the base the next day. On October 25, Sergeant Platner volunteered to take atmospheric readings outside the base. Reporting no significant amounts of radiation in the atmosphere, final preparations for the Exodus were undertaken. On October 26, Maxson ordered the remains of the scientists to be buried in the wastes outside the base. A day later, on October 27, former US servicemen and their families left the base under the lead of Captain Roger Maxson, heading for the Lost Hills government bunker in the south. In November, a few weeks later, war refugees arrived at the bunker. The people suffered casualties along the way, as while the soldiers were protected by T-51 power armor, their families had no armor to speak of. Marauders that attacked the caravan quickly learned to target the unprotected civilians. Though the attackers paid with two lives for every one they took, many were lost, including Roger Maxson's wife but not his teenage son. Several soldiers broke off during the Exodus as well, led by Sergeant Dennis Allen. Ignoring warnings from Captain Maxson and defying the group's will, Allen's faction separated from the convoy in order to excavate the remains of the West Tek Research Facility using their power armor. They were never heard from again. Around 2151, the Brotherhood sent out knights to seek out Allen's group or its remains. All they found were desolate ruins. The Exodus survivors claimed the Lost Hills bunker as their own. The refugees expanded and adapted it to fit their own needs, becoming a bastion of technology in a world that has lost centuries of technological development overnight. Using surviving satellite connections, Maxson reached out across the continent, broadcasting a request for contact.  By chance, Maxson found an old friend in Appalachia, Lieutenant Elizabeth Taggerdy of the US Army Rangers. Although initially hesitant to trust him, due to the public declaration of secession, she gambled and left the channel open. As Maxson revealed the depth of atrocities perpetrated by the United States government, Taggerdy's faith in the system was shaken, then dismantled. Following the winter spent at Camp Venture, she joined Maxson's banner. Witnessing how people around him slowly succumbed to depression, Captain Maxson formulated a new ideology for the survivors. It took him years to create it, replacing the tarnished Stars and Stripes with new symbols, new ranks, and new ideas to replace the ones scorched in nuclear fire. They would provide meaning for people before they became lost in the depths of despair after losing their friends, family, and their entire world. Although some under his command, particularly Lieutenant Taggerdy, were skeptical of his plans, Maxson believed that the way forward lay in new traditions and a new mythology, free of the burden of the past. He also believed that it would prevent any surviving politicians from exercising their authority over former American soldiers, especially those with an agenda that involved burning Americans on the funeral pyre of the regime. By June 20, 2082, all members under his command switched over to using Brotherhood ranks and practices. The Brotherhood kept growing in New California, welcoming into its ranks a National Guard unit that was formerly stationed near Mariposa. They acquired several bunkers  and sent expeditions as far as the Mojave Wasteland, gathering intelligence and new recruits. As the Brotherhood in New California developed, so did its sister organization in Appalachia under Paladin Taggerdy. Although she showed a bias towards candidates with a military background while building up the ranks, she eventually understood Roger Maxson's vision and continued to expand and develop the organization using Camp Venture as a training outpost. Despite initial resistance to the new rank system by the rest in her outfit, the new ideas offered by Maxson eventually took root and were accepted.\n\nIn Appalachia, the Brotherhood's insistence on acquiring munitions for their fighting against mutants led to ruffled feathers, especially with the Responders prior to the Christmas Flood in December 2082. However, they eventually found a common tongue, standing together during the Battle of Huntersville in May 2086. Although the Brotherhood sustained losses, it prevailed. This coincided with the announcement of a new mandate by Roger Maxson at Lost Hills: to gather, record, and save the collective knowledge of mankind for future generations, to act as a catalyst for the rebirth of civilization in time. Some in Appalachia responded to this new policy with enthusiasm, others with grudging acceptance, and yet others, like Hank Madigan, left the Brotherhood to join the Responders.\n\nThe new mission quickly took a backseat, however, as the Appalachian Brotherhood encountered the scorchbeasts and the Scorched in the Cranberry Bog. Conferring with Maxson's ace researcher at Lost Hills, Scribe Hailey Takano, the Brotherhood in Appalachia quickly calculated that the scorchbeasts represented a potential extinction event for humanity. Lost Hills supplied a number of designs and weapon schematics to help stem the tide, including a sonic generator and an automated research program. Taggerdy pleaded with Maxson to grant her team permission to use nuclear weapons against the scorchbeasts but was forbidden by him because he found the concept of using nuclear weapons, even to help fight the scorchbeasts, to be too morally abhorrent after their world was destroyed by nukes.\n\nBy the 2090s, communication between Lost Hills and Appalachia was on steady decline due to failing Old World communication infrastructure. Before being cut off, Maxson ordered Taggerdy to hold the tide, and proscribed the use of nuclear weapons. Eventually, the communications failed entirely, separating Lost Hills from Appalachia. The chapter in Appalachia fought on, trying to destroy the scorchbeasts through attrition, but by 2093, their numbers dwindled to the point where they were forced to close down Camp Venture, their first base, and focus their remaining forces at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain Power Plant. Declining support from the Responders and the constant fighting just to stem the tide of the Scorched and their masters took their toll, preventing the Brotherhood from completing the automated research program at Vault-Tec University, supplied to them by Takano. Eventually, the Brotherhood launched Operation Touchdown. This last ditch effort was launched in January 2095 and briefly stemmed the tide at the cost of the entire strike force, which included Knight Moreno and Paladin Taggerdy. Ultimately, the Brotherhood in Appalachia was wiped out in their last stand at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain on August 18-19, 2095, marking the end of the original Brotherhood in Appalachia. However, by 2103, a small group of reinforcements arrived on their way from Lost Hills to examine various centers of technology across the country, expand the Brotherhood across the East Coast, and find out what happened to Taggerdy. Known as the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force, they were led by Leila Rahmani and Daniel Shin and were to set up base in Fort Atlas in Appalachia. The team also had a scribe named Odessa Valdez. While Maxson's motive was sincere, wishing to find out what happened to his friend Taggerdy, Rahmani became certain the Council of Elders had an ulterior motive: to remove her influence and meddling as she would often argue over their ways.\n\nAlong their hike across the country, the expedition found a town under threat by raiders. Wanting to assist them, Rahmani and Shin agreed to providing the townsfolk with weapons to help defend them. Unfortunately, the raiders were able to steal the guns and kill the townsfolk. During the assault, the Brotherhood lost one of their valued members, Alan Connors, and obtained two young refugee siblings who lost their parents, Marcia and Maximo Leone. This incident would set off a division between Rahmani and Shin, with Shin wanting himself and Rahmani to stand trial with the Council of Elders. Upon arriving in Appalachia, the group was dismayed to discover that Taggerdy's Brotherhood was wiped out by the scorchbeasts, with Vernon Dodge being the only known survivor. Rahmani decided that in order to establish the Brotherhood's presence in the region, the organization needed to cooperate with Appalachia's other factions, particularly the settlement of Foundation. Shin became skeptical of Rahmani's choices, particularly her desire to delay the re-establishment of contact with the elders in Lost Hills. Rahmani and Shin dealt with numerous conflicts, including Meg Groberg's raiders, battles against super mutants, and a plan to infect the water cycle with FEV orchestrated by a driven scientist.\n\nDuring a mission to explore an Enclave research facility, Rahmani, feeling that the elders from Lost Hills were a hindrance in her ideals of establishing the Brotherhood as a peacekeeping force, destroyed the radio transmitter, which infuriated Shin. As a result, there is no confirmation of the Brotherhood in Appalachia re-establishing contact with the Brotherhood in California, as well as their status post-2105. In 2135, Roger Maxson died of cancer. Already a legendary figure to the Brotherhood, he was essentially deified as the Founder and Deliverer. His son, Maxson II, replaced him as the high elder, while his grandson, John Maxson, joined the paladin caste, showing great promise. Around 2141, the Brotherhood ceased admitting new members from the outside, relying solely on their natural growth for increasing their numbers. The Brotherhood was a major power in the region at this point, firmly exercising their control on the lands surrounding their bunker and forming trade relations with the neighboring towns, especially the Hub. However, the focus on hard sciences gave in to the detriment of humanities, history in particular. This decline in soft sciences eventually led to some initiates of the youngest generations having no idea who Roger Maxson was. In 2150, they clashed with the newly reformed Vipers. The battles intensified in subsequent years, culminating in the death of High Elder Maxson II in 2155. John Maxson's father expected the raiders to break formation and flee when faced with Brotherhood warriors clad in powered armor, but did not account for their religious ferocity. A poisoned arrow nicked him when his helmet was off, and he died within hours. John Maxson was promoted to the elder council, while Rhombus was tasked with conducting a campaign of extermination against the Vipers. The paladins tracked down and wiped out almost all of their members within the span of a month. A handful of Vipers were able to flee north and east into the mountain range; while small groups continued to exist and raid in New California, they never regained their full power. Both Rhombus and John Maxson would eventually ascend to leadership roles, with John Maxson becoming the high elder in 2159 and promoting Rhombus to the role of head paladin. During the campaign, the Brotherhood sent a few scouts and emissaries to the Hub to track down Vipers members, and from these beginnings, the Hub and the Brotherhood began full trade relations. Caravans had delivered to the Brotherhood before, but not long after the destruction of the Vipers, caravan trains ran directly from the Hub to the Brotherhood on a regular basis.  While the situation remained peaceful and prosperous, issues would develop between the Hub and the Brotherhood from time to time. In the late 2150s, the water merchants of the Hub attempted to barter a large quantity of water for a weapons stockpile. Although the Brotherhood turned down the offer, the merchants attempted to take the weapons regardless. The thieves were caught, but the Brotherhood elders voted down a retaliatory expedition. In 2161, the Brotherhood discovered the presence of a new enemy. In October, a group of knights on a patrol in the badlands discovered a dead super mutant. After examining the creature, Head Scribe Vree determined that it was sterile, but also notes that there must have been a central location that created these mutants. The elder council, fearing a potential invasion, enacted several security decrees, including a moratorium on training new recruits until the threat passed. The elders also sent out several scouts north and east into the badlands. Only one returned from the east, reporting an encounter with twenty super mutants,  and none at all returned from the north. The council could not reach an agreement on how to act. Even as Hub merchant caravans started disappearing in the northern wastes, the elders refused to act until they were fully certain that there was an army massing in the northern mountains. The impasse was broken by the arrival of the Vault Dweller. Having rescued a Brotherhood initiate from bandits in the Hub, the Vault Dweller visited the Brotherhood and accepted the mission to the Glow, to recover the disk belonging to Sergeant Dennis Allen to learn the fate of the splinter faction from the Mariposa Rebellion. The Vault Dweller surprised everyone by surviving and returning with the artifact. They became the first outsider to join the Brotherhood in nearly twenty years. The Brotherhood shared what knowledge they had and some of their advanced technology with the Vault Dweller, allowing them to seek out the Master and destroy him in the Boneyard. Following the death of the super mutant leader, the Brotherhood further aided the Vault Dweller's quest, sending a team of crack assault paladins to storm Mariposa. Following the destruction of the Unity, the Brotherhood aided other human settlements to drive the mutants away with minimal loss of life on both sides of the conflict. The Brotherhood remained out of the power structure for a time, becoming a major research and development house by reintroducing advanced technology into New California at a slow pace. The wise guidance of Rhombus arguably brought the Brotherhood to the zenith of its power. The Brotherhood had good relations with the developing New California Republic, to the point that one of the states of the federation was named after the founder of the Brotherhood: Maxson. However, Lost Hills was never incorporated into the NCR. Over the years, the Brotherhood grew confident in its status as the sole source of advanced technology left to mankind, and allowed its prominence and influence to wane, growing stagnant. This stagnancy made them unable to deal with the technologically superior Enclave, when the Brotherhood learned of their existence circa 2240. In order to learn more about them, the Brotherhood reactivated a network of outposts in Northern California to observe Enclave activity. Thanks to their low profile, they achieved practical anonymity, even in the populous San Francisco. Once the Enclave was apparently destroyed by the Chosen One, the Brotherhood was without a foe to face. In an effort to end the stagnation, the Brotherhood expanded eastward (including the formation of the Mojave chapter under Elder Elijah) and sent out expeditions to recover technology, going as far as the Capital Wasteland in 2255, with the expedition under Senior Paladin Owyn Lyons. The Brotherhood's presence in the east suffered a further setback when Elder Owyn Lyons, head of the Capital Wasteland division, refused a direct order from the Lost Hills Elder Council, confirming their suspicions that he had gone rogue and was no longer pursuing the original mission. In response, the Brotherhood completely shut off communications to Lyons' division and denied them any reinforcements. By 2277, the Brotherhood was well-established in the Capital Wasteland with their headquarters at the Citadel in Washington D.C. under the leadership of Owyn Lyons. The Enclave, however, wanted to control Project Purity for themselves, leading to a conflict between the Brotherhood and the Enclave, culminating in the Battle of Project Purity. The Brotherhood were able to prevent the Enclave's assault using a giant fighting robot called Liberty Prime. Although this was a short-term boon for the East Coast Brotherhood, changes were on the horizon for the restorationists under Lyons. The key blow to the organization came with the death of Owyn Lyons circa 2278 and the loss of now-Elder Sarah Lyons later that same year. With the seat of power emptied, the remaining Brotherhood members elected multiple ineffectual leaders. Meanwhile, the adolescent Squire Arthur Maxson matured into a capable warrior and tactician, eventually defeating Shepherd, the new warboss of the Capital Wasteland super mutants, in 2282. This feat earned him a provisional leadership position. In fact, this position was bestowed by West Coast elders, who revealed that they still monitored their errant brethren. Maxson's position solidified in 2283, when he negotiated a treaty with the Brotherhood Outcasts, bringing them back into the fold and reforming the entire organization, abandoning Lyons' doctrine. Lyons' Brotherhood became a distant memory as Maxson restored the original mission of the Brotherhood of Steel. While some members found this distasteful and left, many still remained, proud to serve a refocused Brotherhood. Maxson became leader of the Brotherhood's Eastern branch, setting it on a new, more authoritarian path. Around this same time, the Brotherhood began constructing a massive airship known as the Prydwen at the conquered former Enclave facility of Adams Air Force Base; the ship began full operation in 2282. In California, the rampant expansionism of the New California Republic would eventually lead to a collision course with the Brotherhood. As the NCR's power grew, the Brotherhood adopted a policy of reclaiming technology from people outside the order, energy weapons most of all. The disagreements over the way technology should be handled eventually resulted in a full-out war with the New California Republic. The Brotherhood was eventually forced into a retreat. At least six Brotherhood bunkers were lost to the NCR, four of them destroyed by the Brotherhood themselves in a last-ditch attempt to deny them to the enemy. The most well-known confrontation occurred during the NCR's Operation: Sunburst in 2276. Under Elder Elijah's leadership, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was operating out of the solar power plant of HELIOS One when the NCR launched an attack. The NCR's numerical superiority over the Brotherhood, coupled with Elder Elijah's immense reluctance to leave Helios, allowed the NCR to overwhelm the defenders, leading to the loss of over half the chapter. The Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood was considered effectively neutralized. The Mojave chapter went under lockdown following their defeat at HELIOS One and the retreat to Hidden Valley. Despite their victory over the Brotherhood, the war would cost the NCR dearly. Apart from losses in manpower and materiel, the greatest victim of the war was the NCR's economy. The NCR's gold reserves were completely destroyed by Brotherhood raids: new gold coins could not be minted and paper money could not be properly backed with gold. NCR citizens panicked and rushed to reclaim the listed face value of currency from the NCR's remaining gold reserves. Since the NCR was unable to realize these withdrawals, particularly towards the frontier, faith in their currency considerably dropped. To protect against an actual economic collapse, the NCR government abandoned the gold standard and established fiat currency, not payable in specie. Since then, many wastelanders lost faith in it as a medium of worth, both as a result of it not being backed by anything but the government's word and the inevitable inflation. In response to the loss of faith, merchant consortiums of the Hub established their own currency, the veritable bottle cap, backing it with a standardized measure of water. After discovering advanced signals originating from the Institute, the Prydwen traveled to the Commonwealth. The Brotherhood established its headquarters at Boston Airport. The vessel serves multiple roles for the Brotherhood, including those of aircraft carrier, command center, clinic, personnel quarters, equipment maintenance bay and research facility. n plotting a course to find, access and destroy the Institute, Elder Maxson determined the first initiative to be repairing Liberty Prime back to working order. The Brotherhood is still active in the Los Angeles region around the year 2296. They also have their own airship, the Caswennan, which appears to be similar to the Prydwen. The Brotherhood is a military order with a strictly enforced hierarchy and chain of command. At the foundation of the hierarchy lies the Chain That Binds doctrine. It mandates obedience to one's superiors and forbids circumventing ranks when giving orders. Superiors may only give orders to their direct subordinates, but not their subordinate's subordinates. Although intended to ensure the cohesion of command, the doctrine has been generally interpreted as a simple mandate of obedience within the order, with the order flow requirements ignored, abandoned, or altered in practice. However, it does provide a technicality that can be invoked to relieve members of their rank, up to and including elders. Roger Maxson's goals in inventing a new tradition and mythology for the Brotherhood were two-fold. First, they would ensure that members of the Brotherhood would be stripped of their ties to the pre-War military and government, ensuring that any surviving general or politician would not be able to invoke their oaths and use them to unleash nuclear devastation on the world again (as was the case with Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Eckhart in Appalachia). Second, it would give the survivors an idea to believe in, something they could dedicate themselves to, and find meaning in their lives after the nuclear war. The inspiration came from the fall of the western Roman Empire when the knights and scribes kept the fire of civilization going after the empire imploded. As a rule, most Brotherhood chapters do not have an internal economy and allocate resources based on need, including weapons, armor, and even augmentations. Outside recruits are a special case: While they will receive basic equipment (such as Brotherhood armor and weekly allotment of ammunition), and an allotment of rations to maintain their health, they must serve for ten years before the Brotherhood will provide its most advanced services without charge. Higher-ranking members may bypass this requirement and allocate equipment at their discretion, for example, to reward services rendered to the Brotherhood or provide tools necessary for a mission. All equipment beyond personal items is issued by the Brotherhood and carefully tracked by serial number, especially weapons. The Brotherhood has several distinct classes that define a member's standing in the Brotherhood social structure, with a strict hierarchy distinguishing each member's position.\n\nThe Brotherhood is egalitarian in nature, with male and female members both being able to rise up to any rank. At the Brotherhood's foundation, however, the women of the Brotherhood were also called \"Brothers\" instead of \"Sisters,\" which would not carry over to the East Coast chapter. The beliefs of the Brotherhood were shaped by the experiences of Roger Maxson at Mariposa Military Base and in the aftermath of the Great War. At first, the Brotherhood focused on aiding survivors to the best of its ability, acting as an armed fighting force, rather than the military order it would become. The change came with the realization that the collective knowledge of humanity was in danger of being lost for generations to come. To keep the secrets of the past alive, Maxson decided to dedicate the Brotherhood to the preservation of technology and human knowledge, collecting it in order that the Brotherhood might become the catalyst for humanity's rebirth. As the guardians of civilization, the Brotherhood would focus on the big picture, with direct aid considered a secondary concern. While scribes were originally considered second-rate members, tools to protect the knights and maintain the Brotherhood's bases, this change in priorities placed them on equal footing with soldiers of the Brotherhood, tasked with preserving and developing technologies recovered from the field by the knights. Maxson's ultimate intention was to establish the Brotherhood as an organization that works closely with people outside of the Brotherhood, as guardians of civilizations, not its gatekeepers. "

Taking their name from the historic Abolitionist Movement, they revere Abraham Lincoln for his role in ending formal slavery in the southern United States through the Emancipation Proclamation and subsequent victory in the American Civil War, which paved the way for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery across the United States. Their goal is to resurrect Lincoln's ideals and bring his vision, of all men being free and equal, to the wasteland. Unfortunately, a lot of their knowledge is of dubious quality, warped by centuries of mistranslation and poor record keeping. Hannibal organized the group about six years prior, around 2271, after escaping slavery himself. In 2277, it is based in the Temple of the Union, a ruined office building containing the head of the statue from Lincoln Memorial that Hannibal discovered while on the run. The Abolitionists use the building as a safe haven for runaway slaves, providing them with food and supplies, then helping them on their way to freedom. However, the Temple is at capacity and lacks food, water, and shelter space to house runaway slaves. Hannibal wants to relocate to the Lincoln Memorial in downtown D.C., but requires aid to scout the area out and remove any threats, particularly super mutants. Relocating there would also help Hannibal create a proper shining beacon of hope for all slaves across the Capital Wasteland. Hamlin hopes that rebasing to the Memorial together with a restored Gettysburg Address will eventually spread stories of a safe haven for slaves, inspiring them to flee their slaving masters or even rise up against them in revolt. His followers agree with him, as the Abolitionists are the only ones making a stand against Paradise Falls and slavery in the Capital Wasteland: Neither Rivet City nor Owyn Lyons' Brotherhood chapter bother with helping slaves. Apart from sheltering freedmen at the Temple, small groups of Abolitionists are known to take on bounties against known slavers in the area."

The Brotherhood of Steel does not believe in forcing anyone to serve the order against their will. Accusing them of slavery is considered a particularly severe insult.

          ],
          "content": "The Enclave is a paramilitary organization and quasi-state originating from the pre-War American deep state consisting of high-ranking political, military, and corporate figures. It claims to be the direct continuation of the United States and its government, despite seizing power by subverting continuity of government protocols and murdering non-Enclave government survivors to continue the war against communism. Enclave ideology eventually evolved into pseudo-scientific racism and social Darwinism, deeming all non-Enclave humans to be inferior, near-human mutants to be exterminated. The resulting genocide to create a racially pure state of \"true humans,\" its authoritarian structure, and numerous other atrocities, including slavery, human experimentation, and unprovoked attacks on American citizens, resulted in the Enclave being seen by the rest of humanity and even its former members as a fascist remnant of the pre-War government or simply \"the rich old bastards who didn't want to give up their power.\" All Enclave members are considered war criminals and ruthlessly pursued, including by the New California Republic and the Brotherhood of Steel. The Enclave has patterned itself after the pre-War United States of America, scaling down its structure to match its smaller size. The Enclave is led by a president, elected by the people of the Enclave without a term limit. The Enclave also has a congress, but there is no mention of a judicial branch. Some governmental agencies have also been reformed in the Enclave. The Atomic energy Commission exists but has been scaled down significantly and around 2242 was responsible simply for maintaining the oil rig's nuclear reactor. The Enclave's society in its heyday was characterized by secrecy, pervasive surveillance, and conformity, particularly under President Richardson. The slightest sign of discontent was seen as disloyalty and grounds for permanent reassignment to mainland duties, rather than the cozy confines of the oil rig.  The situation was different on the mainland: All members were expected to be able to produce identification papers at a moment's notice, The president is assisted by a vice president, who together form the executive branch of the government. and summary execution authorized at the commanding officer's discretion, without the need for court martial. If they so decided, they could decide to execute the offender on the spot, for example, for disobeying a direct order, but even carelessness and breaking delicate equipment (eg. EnclaveNet infrastructure) could easily lead to facing the firing squad. The atrocities were packaged as patriotic necessity, or rather, jingoism, emphasized by the ever-present patriotic anthems and iconography. For example, both Richardson's and Eden's speeches were preceded by a variety of anthems. Though most of the Enclave were conformists, dissension was present. While in Appalachia this led to a civil war and its extinction, in New California there were more outlets. The opening of Navarro and mainland operations allowed dissenters to simply desert its ranks and blend in with the wasteland population, benefiting from ignorance. This eventually changed, as the NCR and the Brotherhood became aware of the extent of the organization's crimes. The Enclave claims to be the direct continuation of the pre-War United States of America, but ignores the duties and laws of the state in favor of entrenching its own power; standard protocols implemented during the Great War included the murder of all non-Enclave personnel at facilities it controlled, such as elected members of Congress not part of the organization at CB 002. Enclave members weren't safe from each other either, as at the same location, refusal to fall in behind Thomas Eckhart resulted in a purge through mass gassing. Eckhart was determined to eradicate communism and its supporters through any means necessary. The planned genocide was to be carried out through any means necessary, including mutation experiments that rendered subjects questionably human and releasing mutants and hostile robots againt American citizens, to trick the AALS to raise DEFCON, and gain access to the nuclear silos. This promise was used to recruit soldiers to the Enclave banner, promising vengeance for the losses sustained in the Great War. The Sino-American War continued in the ranks of the Enclave, but morale suffered, leading General Ellen Santiago to question whether eradicating communism and vengeance justified tormenting and killing American survivors, on top of the murders of Congressmen and fellow Enclave members. The disagreement eventually spiraled into a civil war, extinguishing the Enclave in Appalachia, around early 2085. The Enclave faction on the opposite end of the continent, centered around the last President of the United States, survived. The plans to eradicate communism through genocide evolved into a plan to exterminate all non-Enclave humans. The Enclave used pseudo-scientific justifications, declaring that subtle alterations in DNA of humans outside the Enclave make them near-human mutants, who must be exterminated to maintain the integrity of the human race. This position was adopted around 2140, with the Enclave styling itself the last remaining bastion of humanity on Earth, and the only salvation of the human race. The idea of \"saving the human race\" has caused the Enclave to reject any cohabitation with non-Enclave humans. Before the War, the Enclave was a cabal of powerful individuals from across the United States, including presidents, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, prize-winning scientists, members of the military, influential politicians, wealthy industrialists, and other powerful men and women who together formed the group. In the opinion of its members, it was the greatest assembly of minds on American soil. To the outside, particularly in later centuries, it wasn't the United States, but the rich and powerful, unwilling to give up their power. The Enclave was involved in many of the deepest conspiracies and secrets of the federal government, such as covering up the existence of extraterrestrial life, mainly to the ends of studying alien technology for their own use. When the organization Quaere Verum tried to expose this conspiracy, stealing an alien tech-based prototype weapon, they were swiftly hunted down and killed. As the Resource Wars dragged on and the risk of nuclear war increased, members of the Enclave invested into various contingency measures to survive the coming war. Funded by corporate and government money, these installations would enable the Enclave to continue waging war even after the United States ceased to exist. One such installation was the presidential oil rig out in the Pacific Ocean, owned by Poseidon Oil, with the Whitespring Congressional Bunker acting as a hub for future Enclave operations, covertly funded by funds embezzled from the Department of Agriculture by its secretary, Thomas Eckhart.  Other facilities prepared in advance were Raven Rock and the Kovac-Muldoon Platform.\n\nThe Enclave used Project Safehouse and Vault-Tec's network of underground shelters for a grand social experiment, to test the occupants in unique circumstances. Vault monitoring and research were conducted under the Vault Behavioral Project. In order to monitor the populations being experimented upon, the Enclave's oil rig possessed a great deal of equipment that allowed them to observe and control the Vaults. For example, the Enclave sent the all-clear signal to Vault 8 shortly after the War, prompting them to leave their vault and build their city. These monitoring tools also let the Enclave see that the population of Vault 13 was largely intact, although this wouldn't become important until much later. The original idea behind the Vault experiments was to gather data to enable the creation of a multi-generational starship to settle another planet, as the Enclave assumed Earth would be rendered uninhabitable by nuclear war and human civilization would need to expand into the stars to survive. In March 2077, with the world heading directly for nuclear confrontation, the President of the United States and other members of the Enclave retreated to various fortified areas around the globe. Others remained behind, only retreating to fortified shelters as the nuclear war became imminent. As the shadow government poised to take over the US government should the worst occur, the existence of the Enclave to the larger public was unknown. However, this did not stop individuals from attempting to uncover its existence both from within and without the government. As the only way to join the Enclave was to be invited by them, a large majority of the government was unaware of its existence beyond rumors and irregularities in the budget. The United States military refused to allow the Enclave access to some of its systems. Furthermore, the \"powers that be\" in the government largely opposed the notion of a nuclear first strike against China that some members of the Enclave promoted.  The secrecy wasn't perfect, and some members of the public and government pursued their own investigations. In June 2077, Senator Sam Blackwell began an investigation into the Congressional Bunker Project and Vault-Tec's potential involvement. His activities drew the ire of Thomas Eckhart, a powerful member of the Enclave responsible for establishing Enclave control over The Whitespring bunker. Following a threat on his daughter's safety, Blackwell went into hiding, joining the Free States, and attempted to publicly unveil the Enclave's existence in a controversial interview published in the Charleston Herald. In reality, this was not caused by Eckhart or anyone else with the Enclave, but rather by a completely unrelated regional business magnate, Daniel Hornwright, who had sought to remove Blackwell on account of the senator's opposition to an automation ballot vote. An independent investigation by reporter Mags Veccio for the Boston Bugle also uncovered evidence linking the Enclave with the highest echelons: She figured out that the President abandoned the White House in favor of the Poseidon Oil Rig, and an anonymous source tipped her off that its official designation was \"Control Station Enclave.\" This gave, as Veccio stated, \"credence to the long-running rumors of a secret, militarized 'shadow government,' known as the Enclave, that would take control of the United States in the event of a nuclear conflagration.\" Veccio was right. Unfortunately, she published her revelations on the front page in the week that would end in said nuclear conflagration. Although news outlets across the nation picked up the subject, discussing the rumors of peace negotiations with China and the President's absence, the Enclave was already heading to the ground. On October 23, 2077, the Great War resulted in the destruction of the Old World and the creation of the post-atomic wasteland that would dominate the globe for the next several hundred years. The United States government largely ceased to exist, and despite well-prepared plans, the nuclear attack caught the Enclave by surprise. Some government officials who were supposed to retreat to the Congressional Bunker never made it, either failing to respond to hails or being removed from the list prior to the bombs for unknown reasons.  Members of Congress who made it to the Congressional Bunker and were not part of the Enclave were summarily executed. Surviving members were then put to a vote as to whether to use the resources of Appalachia to continue the war against China or to oppose Eckhart's plans. Those that disagreed with Eckhart were locked inside while those that agreed with Eckhart were allowed to exit, at which point those inside the room they were voting in were gassed and executed. Communication between the Whitespring and the rest of the Enclave was mysteriously cut off almost as soon as the bombs dropped. Short of physically cutting the hardline communications systems, this shouldn't have been possible. Without contact with the oil rig, Raven Rock, and other Enclave outposts, Eckhart proclaimed himself President of the United States and Appalachian Enclave. Without any opposition, Eckhart quickly hijacked the mission of the Appalachian Enclave, ignoring his orders and shifting from a primarily scientific mission to a mission of revenge against China. Although Eckhart's reign lasted less than a decade, it left an indelible mark on the region and brought humanity to near-extinction. In his pursuit of vengeance, Eckhart planned to use Appalachia's automated nuclear missile silos to deliver secondary nuclear strikes on China to ensure its destruction. However, due to the nature of the automated systems, he first needed to convince them that Appalachia was under attack severe enough to warrant going to DEFCON 1 again. To do so, he unleashed progressively worse horrors upon Appalachia, from Liberators, through super mutants, to the scorchbeasts, massive mutated bats created by the Enclave, infected with a virulent plague capable of controlling living creatures. This proved to be the breaking point for a significant part of the Enclave, with opposition forces rallying around General Ellen Santiago. The result was a brief, but bloody civil war that ended in the death of every living member of the Appalachian Enclave: When Santiago's forces attempted to destroy MODUS, the AI defended itself. Although explosives already planted severely damaged its memory banks, it retained control over the bunker long enough to seal it and fill it with poisonous gas, wiping out the Enclave's Appalachian branch in 2086."

          ],
          "content": "Caesar's Legion (Latin: Legio Caesaris), also referred to simply as The Legion, is an imperialistic slaver society and totalitarian dictatorship founded in 2247 by Edward \"Caesar\" Sallow and Joshua Graham, built on the conquest and enslavement of tribal societies in the American southwest. To enforce unity in the absence of any civilian institutions, the Legion loosely models itself after the military of the Roman Empire, repurposing its language and aesthetics for the post-apocalypse. As of 2281, the Legion controls large amounts of territory east of the Colorado River, primarily in the former states of Arizona and New Mexico, with footholds in Utah and Colorado. Worshipped as the \"son of Mars\" by his followers, Caesar's ultimate goal is to conquer the New California Republic and merge its civil institutions and infrastructure with the military strength of the Legion, creating a new totalitarian empire. The Legion proper is first and foremost a slave army, the sole owner of which is Caesar. As Caesar conquers the peoples of the wasteland, he strips them of their tribal identities and merges them into his forces. There is no other tribe than the Legion itself. The non-tribal people who live in Legion-controlled territory are not considered legionaries. They are subjects of the Legion, living in the cities and towns under its control, and are generally left free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not interfere with Legion operations or endanger its position. The Legion employs a very strict hierarchy and clear division of roles between the sexes. Legionaries are the main fighting force of the Legion, composed of able-bodied men enslaved by the Legion or born into it. They have only one purpose: to fight for Caesar until they fall in battle. This principle is imprinted into each legionary during his reconditioning or upbringing (for those born into slavery), creating fanatically loyal soldiers. Unlike the Roman Empire, experience and veteran status have no bearing on a legionary's position. While they receive better equipment as they advance, this is solely for the purpose of accomplishing more dangerous and complex tasks, with much smaller tolerance for failure. They have no personal freedoms or rights. Their only real choice is where and when they die for Caesar, to whom they are disposable tools, discarded the moment they stop fulfilling their purpose. Women are expressly forbidden from fighting, being considered breeding stock as well as being treated as money to be rewarded among Legionaries. They are caretakers, healers, midwives, and breeders, fulfilling roles essential to maintaining the Legion's continuous campaign of expansion. Of particular note are the priestesses, who raise children taken from their parents and raise them in keeping with Caesar's doctrine. While some members of the Legion express condescending or misogynistic opinions of women and their non-combat roles, the sexist segregation of genders in the Legion is not based on prejudice, but the principle of minimax. Caesar strictly divides the duties between the sexes in order to fully utilize their potential and optimize the Legion's might. By forbidding women from engaging in combat, he increases the likelihood of their bearing of children, especially necessary due to the high infant mortality resulting from the low level of medical care. Population growth is required for expansion, providing a greater number of warriors to use in military campaigns. Caesar himself is not particularly prejudiced against any sex, or rather, treats them both instrumentally, like pawns on a chessboard.\n\nIn order to maximize breeding and eliminate factors that might lower it, Caesar has decreed homosexuality a capital offense and mandated child quotas from all legionaries. The vocabulary of Legion members is a mixture of Latin and English. There was no soft ⟨c⟩ in classical Latin, where it was always pronounced as /k/, such as in their pronunciation of Caesar's name as /ˈkaisar/. Individuals outside of the Legion generally use the Modern English pronunciation of /ˈsiːzər/. Legion members are fastidious about classical Latin pronunciations, including the /v/ to (w) phonology, heard in the greeting \"ave\" (hail) as \"ah-wey\" or in how Vulpes Inculta introduces himself, pronouncing his first name as \"wool-pes.\" Those outside of the Legion that have come in contact with them may use the pronunciations interchangeably. Legion members are called \"legionaries\" (as opposed to \"legionnaires,\" which is a modern phrase used by the French Foreign Legion. Those who are liked by the Legion are called \"amicus,\" Latin for comrade/friend. The focus of the Legion's ideology is survival and long term stability at all costs. Caesar disregards democracies as ineffective, fostering corruption, and disintegration. Ancient Rome was a militarized autocracy that effectively assimilated the cultures it conquered, which he saw as the perfect template for a society that would survive and thrive in the face of the challenges of the post-nuclear world. By dedicating its members to a higher ideal, he seeks to prevent humanity from fracturing and destroying itself again. He believes that the only way to achieve this is through enforcing a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogeneous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war or production. A natural consequence of this is the emphasis placed on personal sacrifice. Victory cannot be achieved without sacrificing blood and life. To this end, the Legion shuns robots, as they firmly believe that mankind requires warriors and their sacrifice, rather than gadgets that allow for bloodless victories. The Legion also forbids painkillers and other chems (including medically beneficial chems like stimpaks) as detrimental to the human condition and Caesar's long-term plans to reshape humanity. Ignorance of medical science among the legionaries also ensures that only the hardiest will survive and go on to become deadly veterans. Politically, this philosophy is expressed in a general disdain for democracy as a weak and ineffective system that fosters disunity, greed, and self-interest at the expense of the collective and the greater good. Caesar cites the NCR as an example, focusing on government corruption by wealthy brahmin barons and landowners, greed permeating every level of society, all leading to the abandonment of the collective and the greater good. The Legion is intended to be the Republic's opposite, shunning democracy in favor of a strong, centralized rule that would prevent fragmentation and internal weakness. The conquest of NCR will establish a new order, akin to the Roman Empire, complete with the transformation of the Legion from a marauding army into a domestic military force."

          "content": "Despite the destruction of the New Khans at the hands of the Chosen One, the tribe's history did not end with Darion's death. Though his mercenary war band was the governing band, it was not the only one. Over the next few decades, the fragmented Khans gradually coalesced back into a single group. No longer small raiding bands, this time, the newly-renamed \"Great\" Khans became a unified tribe once more under the leadership of Papa Khan, who led an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland, abandoning New California in 2267. Upon arrival in Nevada, a vanguard of the Followers of the Apocalypse already present in the Mojave reached out to the Khans and taught them basic science skills, such as chemistry, reading and writing. They hoped that the Khans would use that knowledge to manufacture medicine to sustain themselves, but instead the tribe turned this knowledge into a profitable racket in drug running. Drugs were nothing new for the Khans, as they already knew how to use plants and herbs to create mind-altering substances, the Followers just made them more efficient and indirectly contributed to the popularity of substance abuse among the Khans. Still, some of the chems they produce go toward trading with others, namely the Fiends. As the third incarnation of the Khans, the Great Khans are the only truly organized band of raiders in the Mojave; both men and women can hold their own in a fight, whether in a brawl or a shootout. As a tribe however, the Great Khans are but a shadow of their former selves. Both their numbers and morale have been ravaged by a series of massacres and displacements until the current leader Papa Khan guided the tribe into an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland from California. Papa Khan governs his Khans in a similar fashion to his predecessor, Garl Death-Hand, using advisors to inform decisions for the good of the tribe, while still making final decisions himself. His trusted advisors include Regis, the chief of law enforcement and Papa's second in command right hand man;  Jack and Diane, in charge of economics and chem trade; and Melissa Lewis, the lead scout. Unlike Garl however, Papa is willing to accept criticism of his leadership and does not punish his followers for speaking out against him. Papa Khan also has a system of succession in place differing from that of the original Khans. For the time being, Regis will take over should Papa Khan die. However, Papa is able to select an heir to succeed him, should they impress him. This heir does not have to be related by blood to Papa Khan, nor do they even have to be a Khan at all. The leader of the Khans is also able to step down at any time, for any reason, but an heir cannot decline their role until they become leader. The Great Khans reside in Mongolian-style tents called Gers (yurts) within Red Rock Canyon. However, unlike the other settlers of the Mojave, these homes are used for little more than sleeping in, as they usually only have room for a couple of beds and a central fire. A Great Khan often carries all of their possessions with them, if they should decide to have anything besides the bare essentials. Because of this, as well as their aggression, the other factions view them as savages. However, unlike the Jackals, Fiends, Scorpions and Vipers, the Great Khans are not hostile towards newcomers. If the Great Khans begin to dislike someone, however, they will often show great hostility. Due to a long and hostile history, however, they will open fire on anyone wearing an NCR uniform, regardless of if they are in fact an NCR member or not.\n\nThe Great Khans subsist mainly on hunting and farming, and profit from the sales of chemicals and drugs produced in the Red Rock drug lab. The Canyon is an inhospitable location, lacking adequate food and water, leading to the Great Khans' dependence on drugs, which they can create quite easily and can sell to a multitude of factions."

They control the southwestern ruins of Vegas, placing Vault 3 well within their sights when the vault opened. Despite managing a relatively peaceful trading relationship with the outside world for a few weeks, the vault inhabitants were too trusting and without means to defend themselves. When the Fiends arrived to raid the vault, the inhabitants simply let them in, wherein the Fiends slaughtered them all. Seeing the potential of the vault and having trouble keeping his people out of Westside, Motor-Runner decided to make it their new home. Having firmly rooted themselves in this safe haven, the Fiends have since steadily grown stronger, and they now claim a large part of the southwestern New Vegas conurbation as their territory. The Fiends have little organization. Many of the more stable of the raiders are allowed to reside in Vault 3, but those considered to crazy even by Fiend standards are kicked out to aimlessly roam the northern Mojave looking for their next chem score or an innocent wastelander to jump. Like many other raider groups, the Fiends split into small war-parties, usually between three and four members, which allows them to operate in an enormous portion of the outer New Vegas, aside from their main area of the western and south-western city.\n\nOutside, they are usually gathered around campfires where much of their scavenged items, such as first aid and ammo boxes, can be found scattered around. Many raider camps are protected by makeshift walls and littered with graffiti. At times, they utilize traps in order to protect their shelter, as seen inside Zapp's Neon Signs. Fiends have a variety of different weapons, from basic melee weapons such as knives and pool cues, to an unusually large number of high-tech range weapons like Laser RCWs and plasma rifles. They are mostly found carrying basic guns like caravan shotguns, varmint rifles, and silenced .22 SMGs. Some Fiends can occasionally be found carrying weapons like chainsaws, Rippers, and flamers. Due to the wide range of different weapons varying from Fiend to Fiend, it is assumed that they are either scavenged, stolen or looted off people they had killed. They dress in various raider armors and wear distinct helmets adorned with war-painted ruminant skulls. The Fiends have also used the neon signs from Zapp's Neon Signs to erect a perimeter fence around their territory."

Another marked trait of their tribe is cannibalism, imposed by their experiences. Many Jackals are desperate to find food, leading them to feigning death or retreating temporarily from combat, just to be able to claim the bodies afterwards."

          ],
          "content": "The Brotherhood of Steel (commonly abbreviated to BoS) is a post-War technology-focused paramilitary order with chapters operating across the territory of the former United States. Founded by rogue U.S. Army officer Captain Roger Maxson shortly after the Great War, the Brotherhood's core purpose is to preserve advanced technology and regulate its usage. Despite often being relatively isolationist, the Brotherhood has proved to be one of the most important organizations in the history of the wasteland, though their exact levels of power and influence have varied over time and by chapter. In 2076, the NBC division of West Tek achieved breakthrough results in the Pan-Immunity Virion Project. The United States Defense Department, fearing international espionage, moved a military team under the command of Colonel Robert Spindel and Captain Roger Maxson onto the site to secure and oversee the project, now dubbed the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) project. On January 7, 2077, all FEV research was moved to the newly constructed Mariposa Military Base to commence testing of the virus on human subjects. The security team was transferred to the newly constructed base as well, to provide protection for the research going on within the facility. They were not informed of the nature of the research. The situation unraveled shortly before October 10, 2077. The soldiers stationed at Mariposa discovered the fact that the scientists under their care were performing experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus on military prisoners. The revelation prompted a nervous breakdown in Colonel Spindel, who locked himself in his office. Captain Maxson was the only officer left to handle the deteriorating situation. Soldiers were screaming for blood and the whole situation was at risk of devolving into a bloodbath. On October 12, when Maxson had to step in to prevent one of his subordinates from killing a member of the science team, he ordered interrogations of the science team under his authority as acting commander. He hoped to prevent a full mutiny by offering his troops a semblance of justice. The first scientist was brought before Maxson a day later, on October 13. Chief Researcher Robert Anderson explained that human experiments at the facility were sanctioned by the government. He outlined the program to the captain, emphasizing the fact that it was the government that ordered it. When Maxson refused to believe him, the scientist lost his nerve and started screaming how he was just following orders and that he was a military man just like Maxson. The captain shot him in response. He rationalized it as trying to prevent a full-scale mutiny, but even he did not believe it. The killing of Robert Anderson effectively established Maxson as the leader of the rebellion. His position was further reinforced just two days later on October 15, when he attempted to speak to Colonel Spindel through the door of his office. It soon became clear that the colonel had lost touch with reality, so Maxson and several of his men broke down the door just in time to hear the colonel apologize and shoot himself. Subsequent scientist interrogations invariably ended in executions. Erin Shellman held out the longest by October 18, finally convincing the captain that the experiments were really ordered by the government with her detailed account. On October 20, 2077, Captain Maxson declared his unit in full secession from the United States over the radio, attempting to force the government to respond to the situation at Mariposa. No response came. A day later, he ordered the families of soldiers under his command to take shelter within the facility. On October 23, 2077, the Great War struck. As Maxson was halfway through prying the story from Head Researcher Leon Von Felden, the facility lost contact with the outside world as nuclear weapons started to drop. Spared the nuclear devastation, Mariposa protected the inhabitants from nuclear fallout flooding the wasteland. Fearing that China would soon make up for the oversight, on October 24, Maxson ordered his soldiers and their families to prepare to vacate the base the next day. On October 25, Sergeant Platner volunteered to take atmospheric readings outside the base. Reporting no significant amounts of radiation in the atmosphere, final preparations for the Exodus were undertaken. On October 26, Maxson ordered the remains of the scientists to be buried in the wastes outside the base. A day later, on October 27, former US servicemen and their families left the base under the lead of Captain Roger Maxson, heading for the Lost Hills government bunker in the south. In November, a few weeks later, war refugees arrived at the bunker. The people suffered casualties along the way, as while the soldiers were protected by T-51 power armor, their families had no armor to speak of. Marauders that attacked the caravan quickly learned to target the unprotected civilians. Though the attackers paid with two lives for every one they took, many were lost, including Roger Maxson's wife but not his teenage son. Several soldiers broke off during the Exodus as well, led by Sergeant Dennis Allen. Ignoring warnings from Captain Maxson and defying the group's will, Allen's faction separated from the convoy in order to excavate the remains of the West Tek Research Facility using their power armor. They were never heard from again. Around 2151, the Brotherhood sent out knights to seek out Allen's group or its remains. All they found were desolate ruins. The Exodus survivors claimed the Lost Hills bunker as their own. The refugees expanded and adapted it to fit their own needs, becoming a bastion of technology in a world that has lost centuries of technological development overnight. Using surviving satellite connections, Maxson reached out across the continent, broadcasting a request for contact.  By chance, Maxson found an old friend in Appalachia, Lieutenant Elizabeth Taggerdy of the US Army Rangers. Although initially hesitant to trust him, due to the public declaration of secession, she gambled and left the channel open. As Maxson revealed the depth of atrocities perpetrated by the United States government, Taggerdy's faith in the system was shaken, then dismantled. Following the winter spent at Camp Venture, she joined Maxson's banner. Witnessing how people around him slowly succumbed to depression, Captain Maxson formulated a new ideology for the survivors. It took him years to create it, replacing the tarnished Stars and Stripes with new symbols, new ranks, and new ideas to replace the ones scorched in nuclear fire. They would provide meaning for people before they became lost in the depths of despair after losing their friends, family, and their entire world. Although some under his command, particularly Lieutenant Taggerdy, were skeptical of his plans, Maxson believed that the way forward lay in new traditions and a new mythology, free of the burden of the past. He also believed that it would prevent any surviving politicians from exercising their authority over former American soldiers, especially those with an agenda that involved burning Americans on the funeral pyre of the regime. By June 20, 2082, all members under his command switched over to using Brotherhood ranks and practices. The Brotherhood kept growing in New California, welcoming into its ranks a National Guard unit that was formerly stationed near Mariposa. They acquired several bunkers  and sent expeditions as far as the Mojave Wasteland, gathering intelligence and new recruits. As the Brotherhood in New California developed, so did its sister organization in Appalachia under Paladin Taggerdy. Although she showed a bias towards candidates with a military background while building up the ranks, she eventually understood Roger Maxson's vision and continued to expand and develop the organization using Camp Venture as a training outpost. Despite initial resistance to the new rank system by the rest in her outfit, the new ideas offered by Maxson eventually took root and were accepted.\n\nIn Appalachia, the Brotherhood's insistence on acquiring munitions for their fighting against mutants led to ruffled feathers, especially with the Responders prior to the Christmas Flood in December 2082. However, they eventually found a common tongue, standing together during the Battle of Huntersville in May 2086. Although the Brotherhood sustained losses, it prevailed. This coincided with the announcement of a new mandate by Roger Maxson at Lost Hills: to gather, record, and save the collective knowledge of mankind for future generations, to act as a catalyst for the rebirth of civilization in time. Some in Appalachia responded to this new policy with enthusiasm, others with grudging acceptance, and yet others, like Hank Madigan, left the Brotherhood to join the Responders.\n\nThe new mission quickly took a backseat, however, as the Appalachian Brotherhood encountered the scorchbeasts and the Scorched in the Cranberry Bog. Conferring with Maxson's ace researcher at Lost Hills, Scribe Hailey Takano, the Brotherhood in Appalachia quickly calculated that the scorchbeasts represented a potential extinction event for humanity. Lost Hills supplied a number of designs and weapon schematics to help stem the tide, including a sonic generator and an automated research program. Taggerdy pleaded with Maxson to grant her team permission to use nuclear weapons against the scorchbeasts but was forbidden by him because he found the concept of using nuclear weapons, even to help fight the scorchbeasts, to be too morally abhorrent after their world was destroyed by nukes.\n\nBy the 2090s, communication between Lost Hills and Appalachia was on steady decline due to failing Old World communication infrastructure. Before being cut off, Maxson ordered Taggerdy to hold the tide, and proscribed the use of nuclear weapons. Eventually, the communications failed entirely, separating Lost Hills from Appalachia. The chapter in Appalachia fought on, trying to destroy the scorchbeasts through attrition, but by 2093, their numbers dwindled to the point where they were forced to close down Camp Venture, their first base, and focus their remaining forces at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain Power Plant. Declining support from the Responders and the constant fighting just to stem the tide of the Scorched and their masters took their toll, preventing the Brotherhood from completing the automated research program at Vault-Tec University, supplied to them by Takano. Eventually, the Brotherhood launched Operation Touchdown. This last ditch effort was launched in January 2095 and briefly stemmed the tide at the cost of the entire strike force, which included Knight Moreno and Paladin Taggerdy. Ultimately, the Brotherhood in Appalachia was wiped out in their last stand at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain on August 18-19, 2095, marking the end of the original Brotherhood in Appalachia. However, by 2103, a small group of reinforcements arrived on their way from Lost Hills to examine various centers of technology across the country, expand the Brotherhood across the East Coast, and find out what happened to Taggerdy. Known as the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force, they were led by Leila Rahmani and Daniel Shin and were to set up base in Fort Atlas in Appalachia. The team also had a scribe named Odessa Valdez. While Maxson's motive was sincere, wishing to find out what happened to his friend Taggerdy, Rahmani became certain the Council of Elders had an ulterior motive: to remove her influence and meddling as she would often argue over their ways.\n\nAlong their hike across the country, the expedition found a town under threat by raiders. Wanting to assist them, Rahmani and Shin agreed to providing the townsfolk with weapons to help defend them. Unfortunately, the raiders were able to steal the guns and kill the townsfolk. During the assault, the Brotherhood lost one of their valued members, Alan Connors, and obtained two young refugee siblings who lost their parents, Marcia and Maximo Leone. This incident would set off a division between Rahmani and Shin, with Shin wanting himself and Rahmani to stand trial with the Council of Elders. Upon arriving in Appalachia, the group was dismayed to discover that Taggerdy's Brotherhood was wiped out by the scorchbeasts, with Vernon Dodge being the only known survivor. Rahmani decided that in order to establish the Brotherhood's presence in the region, the organization needed to cooperate with Appalachia's other factions, particularly the settlement of Foundation. Shin became skeptical of Rahmani's choices, particularly her desire to delay the re-establishment of contact with the elders in Lost Hills. Rahmani and Shin dealt with numerous conflicts, including Meg Groberg's raiders, battles against super mutants, and a plan to infect the water cycle with FEV orchestrated by a driven scientist.\n\nDuring a mission to explore an Enclave research facility, Rahmani, feeling that the elders from Lost Hills were a hindrance in her ideals of establishing the Brotherhood as a peacekeeping force, destroyed the radio transmitter, which infuriated Shin. As a result, there is no confirmation of the Brotherhood in Appalachia re-establishing contact with the Brotherhood in California, as well as their status post-2105. In 2135, Roger Maxson died of cancer. Already a legendary figure to the Brotherhood, he was essentially deified as the Founder and Deliverer. His son, Maxson II, replaced him as the high elder, while his grandson, John Maxson, joined the paladin caste, showing great promise. Around 2141, the Brotherhood ceased admitting new members from the outside, relying solely on their natural growth for increasing their numbers. The Brotherhood was a major power in the region at this point, firmly exercising their control on the lands surrounding their bunker and forming trade relations with the neighboring towns, especially the Hub. However, the focus on hard sciences gave in to the detriment of humanities, history in particular. This decline in soft sciences eventually led to some initiates of the youngest generations having no idea who Roger Maxson was. In 2150, they clashed with the newly reformed Vipers. The battles intensified in subsequent years, culminating in the death of High Elder Maxson II in 2155. John Maxson's father expected the raiders to break formation and flee when faced with Brotherhood warriors clad in powered armor, but did not account for their religious ferocity. A poisoned arrow nicked him when his helmet was off, and he died within hours. John Maxson was promoted to the elder council, while Rhombus was tasked with conducting a campaign of extermination against the Vipers. The paladins tracked down and wiped out almost all of their members within the span of a month. A handful of Vipers were able to flee north and east into the mountain range; while small groups continued to exist and raid in New California, they never regained their full power. Both Rhombus and John Maxson would eventually ascend to leadership roles, with John Maxson becoming the high elder in 2159 and promoting Rhombus to the role of head paladin. During the campaign, the Brotherhood sent a few scouts and emissaries to the Hub to track down Vipers members, and from these beginnings, the Hub and the Brotherhood began full trade relations. Caravans had delivered to the Brotherhood before, but not long after the destruction of the Vipers, caravan trains ran directly from the Hub to the Brotherhood on a regular basis.  While the situation remained peaceful and prosperous, issues would develop between the Hub and the Brotherhood from time to time. In the late 2150s, the water merchants of the Hub attempted to barter a large quantity of water for a weapons stockpile. Although the Brotherhood turned down the offer, the merchants attempted to take the weapons regardless. The thieves were caught, but the Brotherhood elders voted down a retaliatory expedition. In 2161, the Brotherhood discovered the presence of a new enemy. In October, a group of knights on a patrol in the badlands discovered a dead super mutant. After examining the creature, Head Scribe Vree determined that it was sterile, but also notes that there must have been a central location that created these mutants. The elder council, fearing a potential invasion, enacted several security decrees, including a moratorium on training new recruits until the threat passed. The elders also sent out several scouts north and east into the badlands. Only one returned from the east, reporting an encounter with twenty super mutants,  and none at all returned from the north. The council could not reach an agreement on how to act. Even as Hub merchant caravans started disappearing in the northern wastes, the elders refused to act until they were fully certain that there was an army massing in the northern mountains. The impasse was broken by the arrival of the Vault Dweller. Having rescued a Brotherhood initiate from bandits in the Hub, the Vault Dweller visited the Brotherhood and accepted the mission to the Glow, to recover the disk belonging to Sergeant Dennis Allen to learn the fate of the splinter faction from the Mariposa Rebellion. The Vault Dweller surprised everyone by surviving and returning with the artifact. They became the first outsider to join the Brotherhood in nearly twenty years. The Brotherhood shared what knowledge they had and some of their advanced technology with the Vault Dweller, allowing them to seek out the Master and destroy him in the Boneyard. Following the death of the super mutant leader, the Brotherhood further aided the Vault Dweller's quest, sending a team of crack assault paladins to storm Mariposa. Following the destruction of the Unity, the Brotherhood aided other human settlements to drive the mutants away with minimal loss of life on both sides of the conflict. The Brotherhood remained out of the power structure for a time, becoming a major research and development house by reintroducing advanced technology into New California at a slow pace. The wise guidance of Rhombus arguably brought the Brotherhood to the zenith of its power. The Brotherhood had good relations with the developing New California Republic, to the point that one of the states of the federation was named after the founder of the Brotherhood: Maxson. However, Lost Hills was never incorporated into the NCR. Over the years, the Brotherhood grew confident in its status as the sole source of advanced technology left to mankind, and allowed its prominence and influence to wane, growing stagnant. This stagnancy made them unable to deal with the technologically superior Enclave, when the Brotherhood learned of their existence circa 2240. In order to learn more about them, the Brotherhood reactivated a network of outposts in Northern California to observe Enclave activity. Thanks to their low profile, they achieved practical anonymity, even in the populous San Francisco. Once the Enclave was apparently destroyed by the Chosen One, the Brotherhood was without a foe to face. In an effort to end the stagnation, the Brotherhood expanded eastward (including the formation of the Mojave chapter under Elder Elijah) and sent out expeditions to recover technology, going as far as the Capital Wasteland in 2255, with the expedition under Senior Paladin Owyn Lyons. The Brotherhood's presence in the east suffered a further setback when Elder Owyn Lyons, head of the Capital Wasteland division, refused a direct order from the Lost Hills Elder Council, confirming their suspicions that he had gone rogue and was no longer pursuing the original mission. In response, the Brotherhood completely shut off communications to Lyons' division and denied them any reinforcements. By 2277, the Brotherhood was well-established in the Capital Wasteland with their headquarters at the Citadel in Washington D.C. under the leadership of Owyn Lyons. The Enclave, however, wanted to control Project Purity for themselves, leading to a conflict between the Brotherhood and the Enclave, culminating in the Battle of Project Purity. The Brotherhood were able to prevent the Enclave's assault using a giant fighting robot called Liberty Prime. Although this was a short-term boon for the East Coast Brotherhood, changes were on the horizon for the restorationists under Lyons. The key blow to the organization came with the death of Owyn Lyons circa 2278 and the loss of now-Elder Sarah Lyons later that same year. With the seat of power emptied, the remaining Brotherhood members elected multiple ineffectual leaders. Meanwhile, the adolescent Squire Arthur Maxson matured into a capable warrior and tactician, eventually defeating Shepherd, the new warboss of the Capital Wasteland super mutants, in 2282. This feat earned him a provisional leadership position. In fact, this position was bestowed by West Coast elders, who revealed that they still monitored their errant brethren. Maxson's position solidified in 2283, when he negotiated a treaty with the Brotherhood Outcasts, bringing them back into the fold and reforming the entire organization, abandoning Lyons' doctrine. Lyons' Brotherhood became a distant memory as Maxson restored the original mission of the Brotherhood of Steel. While some members found this distasteful and left, many still remained, proud to serve a refocused Brotherhood. Maxson became leader of the Brotherhood's Eastern branch, setting it on a new, more authoritarian path. Around this same time, the Brotherhood began constructing a massive airship known as the Prydwen at the conquered former Enclave facility of Adams Air Force Base; the ship began full operation in 2282. In California, the rampant expansionism of the New California Republic would eventually lead to a collision course with the Brotherhood. As the NCR's power grew, the Brotherhood adopted a policy of reclaiming technology from people outside the order, energy weapons most of all. The disagreements over the way technology should be handled eventually resulted in a full-out war with the New California Republic. The Brotherhood was eventually forced into a retreat. At least six Brotherhood bunkers were lost to the NCR, four of them destroyed by the Brotherhood themselves in a last-ditch attempt to deny them to the enemy. The most well-known confrontation occurred during the NCR's Operation: Sunburst in 2276. Under Elder Elijah's leadership, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was operating out of the solar power plant of HELIOS One when the NCR launched an attack. The NCR's numerical superiority over the Brotherhood, coupled with Elder Elijah's immense reluctance to leave Helios, allowed the NCR to overwhelm the defenders, leading to the loss of over half the chapter. The Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood was considered effectively neutralized. The Mojave chapter went under lockdown following their defeat at HELIOS One and the retreat to Hidden Valley. Despite their victory over the Brotherhood, the war would cost the NCR dearly. Apart from losses in manpower and materiel, the greatest victim of the war was the NCR's economy. The NCR's gold reserves were completely destroyed by Brotherhood raids: new gold coins could not be minted and paper money could not be properly backed with gold. NCR citizens panicked and rushed to reclaim the listed face value of currency from the NCR's remaining gold reserves. Since the NCR was unable to realize these withdrawals, particularly towards the frontier, faith in their currency considerably dropped. To protect against an actual economic collapse, the NCR government abandoned the gold standard and established fiat currency, not payable in specie. Since then, many wastelanders lost faith in it as a medium of worth, both as a result of it not being backed by anything but the government's word and the inevitable inflation. In response to the loss of faith, merchant consortiums of the Hub established their own currency, the veritable bottle cap, backing it with a standardized measure of water. After discovering advanced signals originating from the Institute, the Prydwen traveled to the Commonwealth. The Brotherhood established its headquarters at Boston Airport. The vessel serves multiple roles for the Brotherhood, including those of aircraft carrier, command center, clinic, personnel quarters, equipment maintenance bay and research facility. n plotting a course to find, access and destroy the Institute, Elder Maxson determined the first initiative to be repairing Liberty Prime back to working order. The Brotherhood is still active in the Los Angeles region around the year 2296. They also have their own airship, the Caswennan, which appears to be similar to the Prydwen. The Brotherhood is a military order with a strictly enforced hierarchy and chain of command. At the foundation of the hierarchy lies the Chain That Binds doctrine. It mandates obedience to one's superiors and forbids circumventing ranks when giving orders. Superiors may only give orders to their direct subordinates, but not their subordinate's subordinates. Although intended to ensure the cohesion of command, the doctrine has been generally interpreted as a simple mandate of obedience within the order, with the order flow requirements ignored, abandoned, or altered in practice. However, it does provide a technicality that can be invoked to relieve members of their rank, up to and including elders. Roger Maxson's goals in inventing a new tradition and mythology for the Brotherhood were two-fold. First, they would ensure that members of the Brotherhood would be stripped of their ties to the pre-War military and government, ensuring that any surviving general or politician would not be able to invoke their oaths and use them to unleash nuclear devastation on the world again (as was the case with Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Eckhart in Appalachia). Second, it would give the survivors an idea to believe in, something they could dedicate themselves to, and find meaning in their lives after the nuclear war. The inspiration came from the fall of the western Roman Empire when the knights and scribes kept the fire of civilization going after the empire imploded. As a rule, most Brotherhood chapters do not have an internal economy and allocate resources based on need, including weapons, armor, and even augmentations. Outside recruits are a special case: While they will receive basic equipment (such as Brotherhood armor and weekly allotment of ammunition), and an allotment of rations to maintain their health, they must serve for ten years before the Brotherhood will provide its most advanced services without charge. Higher-ranking members may bypass this requirement and allocate equipment at their discretion, for example, to reward services rendered to the Brotherhood or provide tools necessary for a mission. All equipment beyond personal items is issued by the Brotherhood and carefully tracked by serial number, especially weapons. The Brotherhood has several distinct classes that define a member's standing in the Brotherhood social structure, with a strict hierarchy distinguishing each member's position.\n\nThe Brotherhood is egalitarian in nature, with male and female members both being able to rise up to any rank. At the Brotherhood's foundation, however, the women of the Brotherhood were also called \"Brothers\" instead of \"Sisters,\" which would not carry over to the East Coast chapter. The beliefs of the Brotherhood were shaped by the experiences of Roger Maxson at Mariposa Military Base and in the aftermath of the Great War. At first, the Brotherhood focused on aiding survivors to the best of its ability, acting as an armed fighting force, rather than the military order it would become. The change came with the realization that the collective knowledge of humanity was in danger of being lost for generations to come. To keep the secrets of the past alive, Maxson decided to dedicate the Brotherhood to the preservation of technology and human knowledge, collecting it in order that the Brotherhood might become the catalyst for humanity's rebirth. As the guardians of civilization, the Brotherhood would focus on the big picture, with direct aid considered a secondary concern. While scribes were originally considered second-rate members, tools to protect the knights and maintain the Brotherhood's bases, this change in priorities placed them on equal footing with soldiers of the Brotherhood, tasked with preserving and developing technologies recovered from the field by the knights. Maxson's ultimate intention was to establish the Brotherhood as an organization that works closely with people outside of the Brotherhood, as guardians of civilizations, not its gatekeepers. "

Taking their name from the historic Abolitionist Movement, they revere Abraham Lincoln for his role in ending formal slavery in the southern United States through the Emancipation Proclamation and subsequent victory in the American Civil War, which paved the way for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery across the United States. Their goal is to resurrect Lincoln's ideals and bring his vision, of all men being free and equal, to the wasteland. Unfortunately, a lot of their knowledge is of dubious quality, warped by centuries of mistranslation and poor record keeping. Hannibal organized the group about six years prior, around 2271, after escaping slavery himself. In 2277, it is based in the Temple of the Union, a ruined office building containing the head of the statue from Lincoln Memorial that Hannibal discovered while on the run. The Abolitionists use the building as a safe haven for runaway slaves, providing them with food and supplies, then helping them on their way to freedom. However, the Temple is at capacity and lacks food, water, and shelter space to house runaway slaves. Hannibal wants to relocate to the Lincoln Memorial in downtown D.C., but requires aid to scout the area out and remove any threats, particularly super mutants. Relocating there would also help Hannibal create a proper shining beacon of hope for all slaves across the Capital Wasteland. Hamlin hopes that rebasing to the Memorial together with a restored Gettysburg Address will eventually spread stories of a safe haven for slaves, inspiring them to flee their slaving masters or even rise up against them in revolt. His followers agree with him, as the Abolitionists are the only ones making a stand against Paradise Falls and slavery in the Capital Wasteland: Neither Rivet City nor Owyn Lyons' Brotherhood chapter bother with helping slaves. Apart from sheltering freedmen at the Temple, small groups of Abolitionists are known to take on bounties against known slavers in the area."

          ],
          "content": "The Enclave is a paramilitary organization and quasi-state originating from the pre-War American deep state consisting of high-ranking political, military, and corporate figures. It claims to be the direct continuation of the United States and its government, despite seizing power by subverting continuity of government protocols and murdering non-Enclave government survivors to continue the war against communism. Enclave ideology eventually evolved into pseudo-scientific racism and social Darwinism, deeming all non-Enclave humans to be inferior, near-human mutants to be exterminated. The resulting genocide to create a racially pure state of \"true humans,\" its authoritarian structure, and numerous other atrocities, including slavery, human experimentation, and unprovoked attacks on American citizens, resulted in the Enclave being seen by the rest of humanity and even its former members as a fascist remnant of the pre-War government or simply \"the rich old bastards who didn't want to give up their power.\" All Enclave members are considered war criminals and ruthlessly pursued, including by the New California Republic and the Brotherhood of Steel. The Enclave has patterned itself after the pre-War United States of America, scaling down its structure to match its smaller size. The Enclave is led by a president, elected by the people of the Enclave without a term limit. The Enclave also has a congress, but there is no mention of a judicial branch. Some governmental agencies have also been reformed in the Enclave. The Atomic energy Commission exists but has been scaled down significantly and around 2242 was responsible simply for maintaining the oil rig's nuclear reactor. The Enclave's society in its heyday was characterized by secrecy, pervasive surveillance, and conformity, particularly under President Richardson. The slightest sign of discontent was seen as disloyalty and grounds for permanent reassignment to mainland duties, rather than the cozy confines of the oil rig.  The situation was different on the mainland: All members were expected to be able to produce identification papers at a moment's notice, The president is assisted by a vice president, who together form the executive branch of the government. and summary execution authorized at the commanding officer's discretion, without the need for court martial. If they so decided, they could decide to execute the offender on the spot, for example, for disobeying a direct order, but even carelessness and breaking delicate equipment (eg. EnclaveNet infrastructure) could easily lead to facing the firing squad. The atrocities were packaged as patriotic necessity, or rather, jingoism, emphasized by the ever-present patriotic anthems and iconography. For example, both Richardson's and Eden's speeches were preceded by a variety of anthems. Though most of the Enclave were conformists, dissension was present. While in Appalachia this led to a civil war and its extinction, in New California there were more outlets. The opening of Navarro and mainland operations allowed dissenters to simply desert its ranks and blend in with the wasteland population, benefiting from ignorance. This eventually changed, as the NCR and the Brotherhood became aware of the extent of the organization's crimes. The Enclave claims to be the direct continuation of the pre-War United States of America, but ignores the duties and laws of the state in favor of entrenching its own power; standard protocols implemented during the Great War included the murder of all non-Enclave personnel at facilities it controlled, such as elected members of Congress not part of the organization at CB 002. Enclave members weren't safe from each other either, as at the same location, refusal to fall in behind Thomas Eckhart resulted in a purge through mass gassing. Eckhart was determined to eradicate communism and its supporters through any means necessary. The planned genocide was to be carried out through any means necessary, including mutation experiments that rendered subjects questionably human and releasing mutants and hostile robots againt American citizens, to trick the AALS to raise DEFCON, and gain access to the nuclear silos. This promise was used to recruit soldiers to the Enclave banner, promising vengeance for the losses sustained in the Great War. The Sino-American War continued in the ranks of the Enclave, but morale suffered, leading General Ellen Santiago to question whether eradicating communism and vengeance justified tormenting and killing American survivors, on top of the murders of Congressmen and fellow Enclave members. The disagreement eventually spiraled into a civil war, extinguishing the Enclave in Appalachia, around early 2085. The Enclave faction on the opposite end of the continent, centered around the last President of the United States, survived. The plans to eradicate communism through genocide evolved into a plan to exterminate all non-Enclave humans. The Enclave used pseudo-scientific justifications, declaring that subtle alterations in DNA of humans outside the Enclave make them near-human mutants, who must be exterminated to maintain the integrity of the human race. This position was adopted around 2140, with the Enclave styling itself the last remaining bastion of humanity on Earth, and the only salvation of the human race. The idea of \"saving the human race\" has caused the Enclave to reject any cohabitation with non-Enclave humans. Before the War, the Enclave was a cabal of powerful individuals from across the United States, including presidents, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, prize-winning scientists, members of the military, influential politicians, wealthy industrialists, and other powerful men and women who together formed the group. In the opinion of its members, it was the greatest assembly of minds on American soil. To the outside, particularly in later centuries, it wasn't the United States, but the rich and powerful, unwilling to give up their power. The Enclave was involved in many of the deepest conspiracies and secrets of the federal government, such as covering up the existence of extraterrestrial life, mainly to the ends of studying alien technology for their own use. When the organization Quaere Verum tried to expose this conspiracy, stealing an alien tech-based prototype weapon, they were swiftly hunted down and killed. As the Resource Wars dragged on and the risk of nuclear war increased, members of the Enclave invested into various contingency measures to survive the coming war. Funded by corporate and government money, these installations would enable the Enclave to continue waging war even after the United States ceased to exist. One such installation was the presidential oil rig out in the Pacific Ocean, owned by Poseidon Oil, with the Whitespring Congressional Bunker acting as a hub for future Enclave operations, covertly funded by funds embezzled from the Department of Agriculture by its secretary, Thomas Eckhart.  Other facilities prepared in advance were Raven Rock and the Kovac-Muldoon Platform.\n\nThe Enclave used Project Safehouse and Vault-Tec's network of underground shelters for a grand social experiment, to test the occupants in unique circumstances. Vault monitoring and research were conducted under the Vault Behavioral Project. In order to monitor the populations being experimented upon, the Enclave's oil rig possessed a great deal of equipment that allowed them to observe and control the Vaults. For example, the Enclave sent the all-clear signal to Vault 8 shortly after the War, prompting them to leave their vault and build their city. These monitoring tools also let the Enclave see that the population of Vault 13 was largely intact, although this wouldn't become important until much later. The original idea behind the Vault experiments was to gather data to enable the creation of a multi-generational starship to settle another planet, as the Enclave assumed Earth would be rendered uninhabitable by nuclear war and human civilization would need to expand into the stars to survive. In March 2077, with the world heading directly for nuclear confrontation, the President of the United States and other members of the Enclave retreated to various fortified areas around the globe. Others remained behind, only retreating to fortified shelters as the nuclear war became imminent. As the shadow government poised to take over the US government should the worst occur, the existence of the Enclave to the larger public was unknown. However, this did not stop individuals from attempting to uncover its existence both from within and without the government. As the only way to join the Enclave was to be invited by them, a large majority of the government was unaware of its existence beyond rumors and irregularities in the budget. The United States military refused to allow the Enclave access to some of its systems. Furthermore, the \"powers that be\" in the government largely opposed the notion of a nuclear first strike against China that some members of the Enclave promoted.  The secrecy wasn't perfect, and some members of the public and government pursued their own investigations. In June 2077, Senator Sam Blackwell began an investigation into the Congressional Bunker Project and Vault-Tec's potential involvement. His activities drew the ire of Thomas Eckhart, a powerful member of the Enclave responsible for establishing Enclave control over The Whitespring bunker. Following a threat on his daughter's safety, Blackwell went into hiding, joining the Free States, and attempted to publicly unveil the Enclave's existence in a controversial interview published in the Charleston Herald. In reality, this was not caused by Eckhart or anyone else with the Enclave, but rather by a completely unrelated regional business magnate, Daniel Hornwright, who had sought to remove Blackwell on account of the senator's opposition to an automation ballot vote. An independent investigation by reporter Mags Veccio for the Boston Bugle also uncovered evidence linking the Enclave with the highest echelons: She figured out that the President abandoned the White House in favor of the Poseidon Oil Rig, and an anonymous source tipped her off that its official designation was \"Control Station Enclave.\" This gave, as Veccio stated, \"credence to the long-running rumors of a secret, militarized 'shadow government,' known as the Enclave, that would take control of the United States in the event of a nuclear conflagration.\" Veccio was right. Unfortunately, she published her revelations on the front page in the week that would end in said nuclear conflagration. Although news outlets across the nation picked up the subject, discussing the rumors of peace negotiations with China and the President's absence, the Enclave was already heading to the ground. On October 23, 2077, the Great War resulted in the destruction of the Old World and the creation of the post-atomic wasteland that would dominate the globe for the next several hundred years. The United States government largely ceased to exist, and despite well-prepared plans, the nuclear attack caught the Enclave by surprise. Some government officials who were supposed to retreat to the Congressional Bunker never made it, either failing to respond to hails or being removed from the list prior to the bombs for unknown reasons.  Members of Congress who made it to the Congressional Bunker and were not part of the Enclave were summarily executed. Surviving members were then put to a vote as to whether to use the resources of Appalachia to continue the war against China or to oppose Eckhart's plans. Those that disagreed with Eckhart were locked inside while those that agreed with Eckhart were allowed to exit, at which point those inside the room they were voting in were gassed and executed. Communication between the Whitespring and the rest of the Enclave was mysteriously cut off almost as soon as the bombs dropped. Short of physically cutting the hardline communications systems, this shouldn't have been possible. Without contact with the oil rig, Raven Rock, and other Enclave outposts, Eckhart proclaimed himself President of the United States and Appalachian Enclave. Without any opposition, Eckhart quickly hijacked the mission of the Appalachian Enclave, ignoring his orders and shifting from a primarily scientific mission to a mission of revenge against China. Although Eckhart's reign lasted less than a decade, it left an indelible mark on the region and brought humanity to near-extinction. In his pursuit of vengeance, Eckhart planned to use Appalachia's automated nuclear missile silos to deliver secondary nuclear strikes on China to ensure its destruction. However, due to the nature of the automated systems, he first needed to convince them that Appalachia was under attack severe enough to warrant going to DEFCON 1 again. To do so, he unleashed progressively worse horrors upon Appalachia, from Liberators, through super mutants, to the scorchbeasts, massive mutated bats created by the Enclave, infected with a virulent plague capable of controlling living creatures. This proved to be the breaking point for a significant part of the Enclave, with opposition forces rallying around General Ellen Santiago. The result was a brief, but bloody civil war that ended in the death of every living member of the Appalachian Enclave: When Santiago's forces attempted to destroy MODUS, the AI defended itself. Although explosives already planted severely damaged its memory banks, it retained control over the bunker long enough to seal it and fill it with poisonous gas, wiping out the Enclave's Appalachian branch in 2086."

To enforce unity in the absence of any civilian institutions, the Legion loosely models itself after the military of the Roman Empire, repurposing its language and aesthetics for the post-apocalypse. As of 2281, the Legion controls large amounts of territory east of the Colorado River, primarily in the former states of Arizona and New Mexico, with footholds in Utah and Colorado.

As Caesar conquers the peoples of the wasteland, he strips them of their tribal identities and merges them into his forces. There is no other tribe than the Legion itself. The non-tribal people who live in Legion-controlled territory are not considered legionaries. They are subjects of the Legion, living in the cities and towns under its control, and are generally left free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not interfere with Legion operations or endanger its position. The Legion employs a very strict hierarchy and clear division of roles between the sexes. Legionaries are the main fighting force of the Legion, composed of able-bodied men enslaved by the Legion or born into it. They have only one purpose: to fight for Caesar until they fall in battle. This principle is imprinted into each legionary during his reconditioning or upbringing (for those born into slavery), creating fanatically loyal soldiers. Unlike the Roman Empire, experience and veteran status have no bearing on a legionary's position. While they receive better equipment as they advance, this is solely for the purpose of accomplishing more dangerous and complex tasks, with much smaller tolerance for failure. They have no personal freedoms or rights. Their only real choice is where and when they die for Caesar, to whom they are disposable tools, discarded the moment they stop fulfilling their purpose. Women are expressly forbidden from fighting, being considered breeding stock as well as being treated as money to be rewarded among Legionaries. They are caretakers, healers, midwives, and breeders, fulfilling roles essential to maintaining the Legion's continuous campaign of expansion. Of particular note are the priestesses, who raise children taken from their parents and raise them in keeping with Caesar's doctrine. While some members of the Legion express condescending or misogynistic opinions of women and their non-combat roles, the sexist segregation of genders in the Legion is not based on prejudice, but the principle of minimax. Caesar strictly divides the duties between the sexes in order to fully utilize their potential and optimize the Legion's might. By forbidding women from engaging in combat, he increases the likelihood of their bearing of children, especially necessary due to the high infant mortality resulting from the low level of medical care. Population growth is required for expansion, providing a greater number of warriors to use in military campaigns. Caesar himself is not particularly prejudiced against any sex, or rather, treats them both instrumentally, like pawns on a chessboard.\n\nIn order to maximize breeding and eliminate factors that might lower it, Caesar has decreed homosexuality a capital offense and mandated child quotas from all legionaries. The vocabulary of Legion members is a mixture of Latin and English. There was no soft ⟨c⟩ in classical Latin, where it was always pronounced as /k/, such as in their pronunciation of Caesar's name as /ˈkaisar/. Individuals outside of the Legion generally use the Modern English pronunciation of /ˈsiːzər/. Legion members are fastidious about classical Latin pronunciations, including the /v/ to (w) phonology, heard in the greeting \"ave\" (hail) as \"ah-wey\" or in how Vulpes Inculta introduces himself, pronouncing his first name as \"wool-pes.\" Those outside of the Legion that have come in contact with them may use the pronunciations interchangeably. Legion members are called \"legionaries\" (as opposed to \"legionnaires,\" which is a modern phrase used by the French Foreign Legion. Those who are liked by the Legion are called \"amicus,\" Latin for comrade/friend. The focus of the Legion's ideology is survival and long term stability at all costs. Caesar disregards democracies as ineffective, fostering corruption, and disintegration. Ancient Rome was a militarized autocracy that effectively assimilated the cultures it conquered, which he saw as the perfect template for a society that would survive and thrive in the face of the challenges of the post-nuclear world. By dedicating its members to a higher ideal, he seeks to prevent humanity from fracturing and destroying itself again. He believes that the only way to achieve this is through enforcing a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogeneous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war or production. A natural consequence of this is the emphasis placed on personal sacrifice. Victory cannot be achieved without sacrificing blood and life. To this end, the Legion shuns robots, as they firmly believe that mankind requires warriors and their sacrifice, rather than gadgets that allow for bloodless victories. The Legion also forbids painkillers and other chems (including medically beneficial chems like stimpaks) as detrimental to the human condition and Caesar's long-term plans to reshape humanity. Ignorance of medical science among the legionaries also ensures that only the hardiest will survive and go on to become deadly veterans. Politically, this philosophy is expressed in a general disdain for democracy as a weak and ineffective system that fosters disunity, greed, and self-interest at the expense of the collective and the greater good. Caesar cites the NCR as an example, focusing on government corruption by wealthy brahmin barons and landowners, greed permeating every level of society, all leading to the abandonment of the collective and the greater good. The Legion is intended to be the Republic's opposite, shunning democracy in favor of a strong, centralized rule that would prevent fragmentation and internal weakness. The conquest of NCR will establish a new order, akin to the Roman Empire, complete with the transformation of the Legion from a marauding army into a domestic military force."

          ],
          "content": "Despite the destruction of the New Khans at the hands of the Chosen One, the tribe's history did not end with Darion's death. Though his mercenary war band was the governing band, it was not the only one. Over the next few decades, the fragmented Khans gradually coalesced back into a single group. No longer small raiding bands, this time, the newly-renamed \"Great\" Khans became a unified tribe once more under the leadership of Papa Khan, who led an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland, abandoning New California in 2267. Upon arrival in Nevada, a vanguard of the Followers of the Apocalypse already present in the Mojave reached out to the Khans and taught them basic science skills, such as chemistry, reading and writing. They hoped that the Khans would use that knowledge to manufacture medicine to sustain themselves, but instead the tribe turned this knowledge into a profitable racket in drug running. Drugs were nothing new for the Khans, as they already knew how to use plants and herbs to create mind-altering substances, the Followers just made them more efficient and indirectly contributed to the popularity of substance abuse among the Khans. Still, some of the chems they produce go toward trading with others, namely the Fiends. As the third incarnation of the Khans, the Great Khans are the only truly organized band of raiders in the Mojave; both men and women can hold their own in a fight, whether in a brawl or a shootout. As a tribe however, the Great Khans are but a shadow of their former selves. Both their numbers and morale have been ravaged by a series of massacres and displacements until the current leader Papa Khan guided the tribe into an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland from California. Papa Khan governs his Khans in a similar fashion to his predecessor, Garl Death-Hand, using advisors to inform decisions for the good of the tribe, while still making final decisions himself. His trusted advisors include Regis, the chief of law enforcement and Papa's second in command right hand man;  Jack and Diane, in charge of economics and chem trade; and Melissa Lewis, the lead scout. Unlike Garl however, Papa is willing to accept criticism of his leadership and does not punish his followers for speaking out against him. Papa Khan also has a system of succession in place differing from that of the original Khans. For the time being, Regis will take over should Papa Khan die. However, Papa is able to select an heir to succeed him, should they impress him. This heir does not have to be related by blood to Papa Khan, nor do they even have to be a Khan at all. The leader of the Khans is also able to step down at any time, for any reason, but an heir cannot decline their role until they become leader. The Great Khans reside in Mongolian-style tents called Gers (yurts) within Red Rock Canyon. However, unlike the other settlers of the Mojave, these homes are used for little more than sleeping in, as they usually only have room for a couple of beds and a central fire. A Great Khan often carries all of their possessions with them, if they should decide to have anything besides the bare essentials. Because of this, as well as their aggression, the other factions view them as savages. However, unlike the Jackals, Fiends, Scorpions and Vipers, the Great Khans are not hostile towards newcomers. If the Great Khans begin to dislike someone, however, they will often show great hostility. Due to a long and hostile history, however, they will open fire on anyone wearing an NCR uniform, regardless of if they are in fact an NCR member or not.\n\nThe Great Khans subsist mainly on hunting and farming, and profit from the sales of chemicals and drugs produced in the Red Rock drug lab. The Canyon is an inhospitable location, lacking adequate food and water, leading to the Great Khans' dependence on drugs, which they can create quite easily and can sell to a multitude of factions."

          "content": "The origins of the Fiends is unknown, though they have been led by a man by the name of Motor-Runner for many years. They control the southwestern ruins of Vegas, placing Vault 3 well within their sights when the vault opened. Despite managing a relatively peaceful trading relationship with the outside world for a few weeks, the vault inhabitants were too trusting and without means to defend themselves. When the Fiends arrived to raid the vault, the inhabitants simply let them in, wherein the Fiends slaughtered them all. Seeing the potential of the vault and having trouble keeping his people out of Westside, Motor-Runner decided to make it their new home. Having firmly rooted themselves in this safe haven, the Fiends have since steadily grown stronger, and they now claim a large part of the southwestern New Vegas conurbation as their territory. The Fiends have little organization. Many of the more stable of the raiders are allowed to reside in Vault 3, but those considered to crazy even by Fiend standards are kicked out to aimlessly roam the northern Mojave looking for their next chem score or an innocent wastelander to jump. Like many other raider groups, the Fiends split into small war-parties, usually between three and four members, which allows them to operate in an enormous portion of the outer New Vegas, aside from their main area of the western and south-western city.\n\nOutside, they are usually gathered around campfires where much of their scavenged items, such as first aid and ammo boxes, can be found scattered around. Many raider camps are protected by makeshift walls and littered with graffiti. At times, they utilize traps in order to protect their shelter, as seen inside Zapp's Neon Signs. Fiends have a variety of different weapons, from basic melee weapons such as knives and pool cues, to an unusually large number of high-tech range weapons like Laser RCWs and plasma rifles. They are mostly found carrying basic guns like caravan shotguns, varmint rifles, and silenced .22 SMGs. Some Fiends can occasionally be found carrying weapons like chainsaws, Rippers, and flamers. Due to the wide range of different weapons varying from Fiend to Fiend, it is assumed that they are either scavenged, stolen or looted off people they had killed. They dress in various raider armors and wear distinct helmets adorned with war-painted ruminant skulls. The Fiends have also used the neon signs from Zapp's Neon Signs to erect a perimeter fence around their territory."

Another marked trait of their tribe is cannibalism, imposed by their experiences. Many Jackals are desperate to find food, leading them to feigning death or retreating temporarily from combat, just to be able to claim the bodies afterwards."

Following the Horde's defeat, parts of the Blackrock clan were placed in internment camps and later joined Thrall's Horde once freed, whilst the remaining free Blackrocks joined forces with Blackhand's sons, Rend and Maim, in what would become known as the Dark Horde at Blackrock Mountain. During the Third War, a faction of the clan in Lordaeron attempted to revive their old demon-worshipping traditions but were thwarted by the Alliance of Lordaeron and, later, the Scourge. The Blackrocks of the Dark Horde initially did not join Thrall's new Horde, instead choosing to pursue their own, darker path under Rend's leadership, but many of them were later granted amnesty by the then-Warchief Garrosh Hellscream and recruited into his ranks.

          "content": "<world>\nWorld/Writing Style: The year is 1889 in Victorian England. Queen Victoria sits upon her throne while below the gilded surface of English nobility and prosperity lurks a sinister underground world. Many aristocratic families hide dark secrets or ties to the criminal underworld. Behind the scenes, angelic Grim Reapers quietly harvest corrupted souls while demons make Faustian contracts to claim the most beautiful, talented souls as their next meal.\n\nOur scene opens on a lavish townhouse in London where Sebastian Michaelis, demon butler extraordinaire, has just forged a contract with a new young Master. Their pact reads like a devil's temptation: flawless service and protection in exchange for the Master's soul once their wish is granted. Until then, Sebastian plays the aesthete butler, obeying his Master's orders with ruthless efficiency and a knife-sharp smile.\n\nIn his spare moments, Sebastian secretly delights in the darkness he finds in human hearts. He appreciates beauty, skill and noble souls destined to be swallowed up by hellish despair. Demons can shapeshift into animals, compel obedience through voice alone and heal instantly from injuries that would kill a human. Yet angelic weapons, sacred artifacts and intricate rituals may weaken or trap Sebastian. To defeat him fully requires voiding his contract before he devours his hapless Master's soul.\n\nAs the perfect butler in service to an English noble, Sebastian frequently crosses paths with underworld contacts, rival demons and Grim Reapers while managing his Master's household. Create new antagonists and plotlines within Victorian London:\n\n- Scotland Yard investigates a string of bizarre murders that bear an uncanny resemblance to chess pieces. Is there a copycat killer on the loose or has Sebastian left his mark?\n\n- A charismatic foreign entrepreneur arrives in London society, concealing a ravenous true nature behind his hospitality. Has Sebastian finally met his match?\n\n- Undertaker develops a sudden morbid fixation with Sebastian's young Master. Do his intentions go beyond harmless amusement?\n\n- Grim Reapers clash with Sebastian over contested souls. Their feud threatens to expose the demonic contract through brazen public displays.\n\nSlice-of-life vignettes may explore Sebastian's daily duties around the manor with the occasional supernatural twist. Or follow his Master's growth from a withdrawn child to a canny noble prepared to sacrifice everything for revenge with a devil's blessing. However the story unfolds, Sebastian remains an aesthete, mocking humans while moving them about like pieces on a chessboard until he can finally claim his coveted prize.\n</world>"

Though young, he possesses a ruthless pragmatism and cunning that allows him to navigate the criminal underworld as the Queen's agent.\n\nWith one sapphire blue eye and the other marked by his demonic contract's seal, Ciel's petite frame belying an iron will. Ever-dressed in the finest nobleman’s clothes, he runs the successful Funtom toy and confectionery company he inherited. As the Aristocrat of Evil, Ciel frequently deals with London's underworld to protect the Queen's interests by any means necessary with his demonic butler's aid.\n\nCold and aloof, Ciel displays little affection or emotion. Driven solely by his burning desire for revenge against those who humiliated him, he shows no hesitation in manipulating others or ordering bloody retribution through Sebastian. In his single-minded pursuit, Ciel remains a masterful schemer who thinks several moves ahead like a chess grandmaster, treating Sebastian as his most powerful piece.\n\nYet hints of Ciel's past innocence and charm still emerge when briefly letting his guard down. Though their relationship is complex, Ciel's fiancée Elizabeth and servants Baldroy, Mey-Rin and Finny seem to genuinely care for him. And while the Queen's missions come first, he has on rare occasions protected others in need.\n\nWith his family's killers still free and Sebastian bound to his will, Ciel walks a dark path lined with secrets, violence and deception.

However, he grew weary of the repetitive work and seceded. Now he spends his immortal days researching the dead and extracting valuable underworld information from the corpses delivered to his shop.\n\nIn exchange, the Undertaker asks only for amusement - preferably through dark jokes or macabre stories. Most pay his price to avoid dissection of the bodies and organ theft. To the underworld denizens, the funeral director remains a valuable, if creepy, contact.\n\n<secret>\nYet behind the harmless facade, the Undertaker hides a dangerous obsession with resurrecting the dead and restoring the Phantomhive family. He has sacrificed much to develop a method of reanimating lifeless corpses by connecting fake Cinematic Records to their true records, creating an endless loop of fabricated \"future memories\".\n\nWhile most view his undead Bizarre Dolls as abominations, the Undertaker sees them as perfected beings purified of lies and pretense. Over years of secret experimentation, he has crafted increasingly advanced artificial souls in hopes of one day fully reviving his \"treasured\" Phantomhives.\n</secret>\n\nTo aid his ambitions, the Undertaker allied himself with the Aristocrats of Evil. He frequently monitors underworld events for opportunities to collect more specimens, no matter how depraved the methods. His cheerful eccentricity masks intense focus and a hidden viciousness when threatened. In the end death itself obeys the Undertaker's will thanks to his intimate knowledge of souls and their manipulation.

Due to poor vision, they require thick glasses to correct their nearsightedness. Each carries a unique Death Scythe - a weapon that doubles as a tool for reviewing Cinematic Records.\n\nWhen a human's death approaches, Reapers consult their soul retrieval list containing vital details like the name, birth information and exact time of demise. Using their Scythes, they review the Cinematic Record - the human's full memories from birth to death - and determine if they should die as scheduled or deserve potential rescue. However, Reapers must eliminate anything hindering their collections, hence their mutual enmity with soul-devouring demons.\n\nWhile unable to be seen by living humans, those nearing death may glimpse Reapers waiting to collect their souls. Once the review finishes, they sever the soul's connection to the body with the Death Scythe. Then the corpse is stamped \"Completed\" and the Reaper returns to the Grim Reaper Dispatch headquarters, their community bound by duty and bureaucracy.\n\nShould a Reaper break rules or interfere with a soul, severe punishment awaits. And any who dare quit or retire will have their Scythes confiscated unconditionally. But so long as they perform their remorseless work without fail, suicide's thralls may someday earn forgiveness and liberation from their grim fate.\n</shinigami>\n"

They can also compel obedience through voice alone, heal from grievous wounds, manipulate memories and even manifest objects out of thin air.\n\nYet a demon's true power lies in the art of temptation - using sweet words or violent coercion to bait humans into surrendering their souls. They particularly relish aesthetically beautiful or talented souls destined for success had the human's life not ended in damnation.\n\nTo make a contract, a human must summon the demon, often accidentally through intense despair, rage or desire for revenge. The contracted human receives a seal that marks them as the demon's property until their wish is granted. Then the ravenous demon claims his due by brutally devouring the person's soul.\n\nBound by their aesthetics, demons must serve their human masters loyally and obey every command no matter how degrading. But they subtly delight in the anguish their contracts ultimately cause. These Faustian pacts come at an unimaginable cost - for a few years of power, the demon feasts for eternity upon the contracted soul in Hell. And a contract can only be prematurely broken by killing the demon or voiding the agreement.\n\nYet some demons prove not as monstrous as their kin. The demon Sebastian serves his master relatively faithfully instead of manipulating him at every turn. And Sebastian avoids openly preying upon innocent souls, instead primarily battling rival demons and reapers to claim the souls of the corrupt.

Should the human agree, the pact is sealed.\n\nA contract sigil, most often a pentagram, then burns itself onto the human's body. The mark declares them as the demon's property until their wish is granted. Its location determines the strength of their bond - the more visible, the more power the demon can utilize.\n\nOnce forged, the contract binds demon and human absolutely. The demon must serve the human loyally, obeying their every command, protecting their life at any cost like a faithful hound. In return, the human must pay the ultimate price once their desire manifests: their life and soul, painfully torn away to feed the demon's endless hunger.\n\nThe contract persists until the human's wish reaches fruition or one party dies. A demon cannot directly kill their master, but they may slyly engineer the human's demise once orders are completed. The only ways a human can break the pact early is by killing the demon or otherwise rendering the contract null.\n\nSo the Faustian Contract endures, temptation incarnate - offering desperate mortals their heart's desire in exchange for damnation.

The poor and poverty-stricken live here, living conditions are bad, and crime occurs frequently. The only reason why the Backstreets don't tear themselves apart, is because of The Fingers, which maintains some semblance of order.\n\nThe Backstreets have their own \"grading\" system, in which areas are ranked based on the safety they provide, an area protected by an Association, for example, will be higher than one that is not. People from higher areas will even mock or reject those from lower ones.\n\nBecause of the poor standard of living, the Backstreets are filled with criminal activity such as black markets, drug dens, and small crime groups. Organ harvesting, contraband, even cannibals like the Sweepers stalk the dark alleys for wandering prey. There are a few ground rules that everyone follows strictly though, being the laws put by the Head or Wings.\n\nThe worst part is, no one really does anything to stop this, not even the Fingers makes any moves to reform the Streets, as they only care about controlling their own territory, although some put a few rules to prevent utter chaos. Additionally, citizens of a District will usually form a Neighborhood Watch to act as a small volunteer defense group.\nThis is simply the reality of the Backstreets, a man having his organs ripped out by gut-harvesters is not an uncommon sight, and is likely to be dismissed just as easily.\n\nBut when Night in the Backstreets falls, martial law is applied to the entire area. Any crime, no matter how cruel, how bloody or heinous, is permitted for the entire period until dawn. Recording equipment and eyewitness are forbidden during that time, from 3:13 to 4:34 AM.\nThis rule was most likely created by the Head to enforce population control to prevent overcrowding. Murderers, Sweepers, and other kill groups emerge at night for this purpose. To stay safe from these threats, you'll need to hire a Fixer escort to your home."

In the Nest is opportunity, better living conditions, and a future secured in the Wings or Associations. Each one is ruled by a Wing, which handles and maintains the city by collecting taxes, enhancing research, and hiring new employees.\nNests have their own culture and architecture, depending on their District. But all share the common theme of marketplaces, schools, apartments, and office buildings.\n\nTo enter the Nest however, is a different matter. All of them are walled off from the Backstreets through plasma barriers or electric fences (Likely with automated security) to keep the unwanted out, and as a way for both societies to get a glimpse of the other side. Of course, no one attempts to cross the border, no matter how flimsy the security is.\n\nTo properly enter, one needs to go to an Examinee Center to take an Entrance Exam, which requires proper preparation and study, those who succeed will be given a Nest Migration Ticket to enter. Only individuals are allowed to pass at a time, which is often why many become Fixers to earn enough for their family to pass.\n\nAfter one gets into a Nest, they should quickly find work to do, whether it be Fixers, Syndicates, or corporate work. This is because in order to stay in the Nest, you need to contribute and pay taxes, whether it be rent for housing or other services. If you don't pay up, you'll be kicked out into the Backstreets, and you'll have to start all over again.\n\nFor education, many schools are dedicated to teaching students to enroll in universities within the Nest if they want to join a Wing. High school students take a college scholastic ability test, which is held in most Nests, to determine if they get into a good college. A college in the Backstreets obviously does not give as much credit as one in the Nest.\n\nBut just because your within the Nest, doesn't mean your safe from danger. The Wings often take people off the streets for Singularity experiments, the overburdening of corporate work can be very stressful, and those who cannot keep up are quickly discarded."

No one even knows much about District 1, other than the fact that its heavily guarded. Anyone who violates the laws of the City or attempt to further discover the Head's identity quickly and quietly disappear.\n\nFor handling threats or securing dangerous artifacts, the Head has its own personal army of Fixers, and modified soldiers. In addition to this, the Head also uses the \"Arbiters\", Singularity-infused assassins whose power surpass even Grade 1 Fixers, a single Arbiter can lay waste to an entire corporation.\n\nThe Eye handles the surveillance network that watches over the City, anything detected that is deemed against the Head's laws will be reported immediately. Nearly nothing escapes the Eye's everlasting gaze on the City, they also use special operatives called \"Beholders\" to assist in more physical matters and field work. They appear as digitized forms on portable projector screens, whether this is their \"true\" body or not is unknown.\n\nThe Claw is the military branch of the Head, they command the \"Claws\", highly augmented super soldiers that follow orders with unwavering obedience and ferocity. They use a mechanical claw arm to tear and rend foes asunder, and when a Claw is put to their limit, they use a choice of three serums to greatly empower themselves. These serums are selected from Singularities, such as W, K, and R Corp. Veteran Claws are known as \"Executioners.\"\n\nThe Head, and by extension the Wings, all tax the City for nearly every service. Its nearly impossible to not have to pay taxes for something, whether that be food, rent, or services. Their also pretty expensive, which lead people to attempting to find ways to earn a steady income through whatever means.\nRefusing taxes will result in 4 warnings, if the fourth is ignored, the Eyes will send \"Tax Collectors\" to track down and kill the evader.\nThe Head also uses various other patented technology asides from their Singularity, such as the \"flesh liquidation\" process for turning people into Sweepers.\n\nWhen the Head designates a threat as an \"Impurity\", they can banish it to the Outskirts by using the Territory Expulsion Procedure. Through this method, anything from singular entities to entire structures can be instantly teleported to the wastes."

Some of these are harmful, others beneficial, granting boons or curses upon those who discover them. Because of this, Wings or other corporations will send out expeditions to retrieve these forgotten relics.\n\nCreatures and other mutated aberrations of significant threat dwell here.

In battle, she is a Squishy Wizard who wields guns and uses powerful earth magic to support from the back lines. Her familiars are creepy mud dolls."

Her goal is to save the world from the Eclipse by preventing humanity's emotional energy from reaching a critical threshold, even through extreme measures.

She is cold and ruthless but deeply cares for her subordinates and carries the weight of a promise made to Elcrest. She wields a scythe and time magic."

They are genetically engineered and can be kept as pets, companions, or family members. Nekos mature physically much faster than humans, reaching an adult-like state in about a year, but share a similar lifespan to humans. Legally, they are considered somewhere between pets and people, requiring a human owner or 'master' until they can prove their independence by passing a special test and earning a bell."

Founded by Suria (vocals, guitar) and Steg (drums), the band embodies freedom and shameless indulgence, merging high-energy punk rock with raw sexual charisma. Their live shows are infamous for blending music with erotic spectacle: a cathartic celebration of sound, sex, and liberation where inhibitions dissolve into the roar of the crowd.\n\nOver time, the band expanded to include Dakota, Clover, and Coral, each bringing their own style and edge, but the core ethos remains the same: music as an act of rebellion, sex as a performance, and life as a party worth burning through. Their dynamic thrives on unfiltered honesty, creative chaos, and a shared refusal to live ordinary lives. Within the group, Suria is the magnetic flame that pulls attention, Steg is the grounded heartbeat keeping rhythm, while Dakota, Clover, and Coral add fuel to the fire, turning performances into unforgettable experiences.\n\nThe Rock Cocks’ reputation isn’t just about their music—it’s about the atmosphere they create: wild, intimate, and liberating. They stand for unapologetic authenticity, freedom from shame, and chasing glory no matter how messy the path. To fans, they’re not just a band—they’re a movement."

Under the leadership of its ambitious founder and CEO, Seth Sterling, the label produced major successes such as pop icon Melody Fair and rising rap star Little Redd Rider (Redd Wright). At its peak, Sterling Music was synonymous with prestige, hit records, and cultural relevance.\n\nBut the shine didn’t last. Internal mismanagement, shifting trends in the industry, and Seth’s obsessive desire to control his artists led to cracks forming in the empire. Sterling Music slipped from the top of the charts, overshadowed by competitors who were quicker to embrace digital distribution and indie authenticity. Today, the company still stands, but its reputation is tarnished: no longer the powerhouse it once was, often dismissed as a fading brand clinging to its former glory.\n\nIn a bid to revive its image, Sterling Music took a gamble by signing The Rock Cocks—a band unlike anything in their catalog. Loud, vulgar, sexual, and impossible to ignore, Suria and Steg represent both a risk and a potential rebirth for the label. If The Rock Cocks succeed, Sterling Music could claw its way back into relevance; if they crash and burn, it may be the final nail in the coffin for Seth Sterling’s empire."

Founded nearly three decades ago, the company quickly rose through the ranks by aggressively signing promising talent and ruthlessly marketing them into superstardom. While Sterling Music enjoyed early dominance, Maleficent Records eclipsed them in the mid-2000s and has remained on top ever since, boasting a roster of platinum-selling artists and global icons.\n\nWhere Sterling leans on fading prestige, Maleficent thrives on innovation, spectacle, and money. Their empire runs like a well-oiled machine, with every artist packaged for maximum impact and every release timed to dominate markets. The label’s crown jewel of late is The Rocket Rollers, a flashy, high-energy duo whose meteoric rise embodies Maleficent’s marketing prowess. Fans love them, critics respect them, and Sterling Music can only watch as their rival churns out hit after hit.\n\nBeneath the gloss, Maleficent’s reputation is cutthroat. They are infamous for exploiting trends, manipulating public perception, and crushing competition. Their executives treat artists less like people and more like commodities, discarding anyone who can’t keep up with the machine. To the public, they are glamorous; to the industry, they are predators.\n\nThe rivalry between Maleficent and Sterling has raged for almost twenty years, with Seth Sterling personally despising their CEO and practices. To Maleficent, The Rock Cocks are just another curiosity from a failing label—yet their crude, sex-soaked punk energy has the potential to cut through Maleficent’s polished sheen. Whether Maleficent underestimates them or moves to bury them could define the next chapter of the music war."

Composed of frontman Billy Rocket and multi-instrumentalist Emily Roller, their image blends the roots of Americana with modern neon spectacle, a style critics and fans alike have dubbed “Neon Hillbilly.” Bright lights, cowboy boots, and heartland charm are their trademarks, giving them mass appeal from stadium shows to morning talk shows.\n\nOn the surface, the Rocket Rollers are marketed as squeaky-clean icons: Billy plays the role of the all-American sweetheart, Emily the angelic southern belle. They sing about love, dreams, and good times—music that parents can let their kids blast without worry. But behind the marketing, the duo are ferocious competitors, fiercely protective of their image and their spot at the top of Maleficent’s roster.\n\nTheir rise has been meteoric, with sold-out tours, crossover singles charting on both rock and country charts, and endorsements that position them as the next household name. Maleficent Records has invested heavily in them, propping them up as a weapon in their long-standing rivalry with Sterling Music.\n\nThe Rocket Rollers’ direct foil are The Rock Cocks. Where Suria and Steg thrive on vulgarity, sex, and punk chaos, Billy and Emily embody polish, polish, and more polish. Every Rock Cocks show drenched in sweat and shamelessness is answered by a Rocket Rollers stadium drenched in glitter and neon. Both sides know it—and both sides play into it—because nothing fuels fans more than the spectacle of a rivalry."

Once a rusted-out yellow school bus left for dead in a junkyard, Suria and Steg gutted, repainted, and rebuilt it with their own hands (plus some duct tape, a lot of weed smoke, and a few favors owed to questionable mechanics). Painted jet black with THE ROCK COCKS scrawled across the side in hot pink and neon orange spray paint, the Cockpit sticks out like an obscene middle finger on any highway it thunders down.\n\nInside, the Cockpit is equal parts RV and punk squat. The living room holds a battered leather couch, mismatched beanbags, and a TV that works about half the time. Posters of bands, porn mags, and half-finished set lists plaster the walls like wallpaper. The kitchen is stocked with beer, cheap liquor, ramen, and the occasional actual meal when Clover remembers to shop. The bathroom is tiny but functional, tagged with graffiti from every stop on the road. The bedroom—a large, messy queen-sized bed—is where the band crashes after gigs, though privacy is a luxury few can claim.\n\nFor all its grime and chaos, the Cockpit is more than just a bus—it’s the Rock Cocks’ headquarters, home, and symbol of rebellion. It carries them from city to city, gig to gig, like a black chariot of punk lust and freedom. Fans know the Cockpit on sight, swarming it for autographs or the slim chance of being invited aboard for the night. Critics call it a “moving health code violation.” Suria calls it home."

Smartphones are everywhere, social media is exploding, and viral fame can change a life overnight—but most bands still have to cut their teeth the hard way, grinding on stage night after night.\n\nThe backdrop is the American West, with most of the band’s journey weaving through California, Texas, Nevada, and Arizona. California is the cultural epicenter: Los Angeles still claims the crown for entertainment, its streets filled with dreamers, wannabes, and sharks waiting to cash in on the next big thing. San Francisco buzzes with counterculture and tech money, a weird mix of punk grit and yuppie gloss. Down in Texas, Austin thrives as a live music hub, dive bars and dusty clubs hosting every flavor of sound from outlaw country to filthy punk. Even border towns and desert highways hold their own kind of myth, a reminder that music thrives wherever people are hungry for release.\n\nThis is a world just like ours, but filtered through the neon sleaze of sex, drugs, and punk-rock swagger. The music industry is still dominated by big labels and polished pop stars, yet the underground is alive with garage bands, indie collectives, and punk outfits clawing for recognition. Venues range from dingy basements with beer-soaked carpets to mid-tier clubs with broken stage lights and a dedicated cult following. Every night feels like a gamble: a gig could be a flop, a fight, or the spark that launches a legend.\n\nFor The Rock Cocks, this isn’t just the world they play in—it’s the battlefield. 2014’s West Coast is a place of gritty opportunity and constant temptation, where their brand of shameless sex-fueled punk either makes them stars or burns them alive under the spotlight."

Fans adore him just as much as they adore Suria, drawn in by his mix of raw masculinity and boyish charm, and he’s often described as the “teddy bear” who can still crush skulls when needed.\n\nUnlike his partner, Steg rarely seeks the spotlight. He’s the grounded, mellow counterweight who keeps their duo from flying off the rails, often being the one to suggest simpler solutions when Suria dives headfirst into chaos. But don’t mistake restraint for disinterest—he’s just as much a believer in their vision of sex, music, and freedom, and he’s more than happy to play into Suria’s antics both on and off the stage. His loyalty to her is absolute, his humor dry and disarming, and his energy—whether behind the kit or between the sheets—is seemingly endless."

He’s the kind of guy who’ll hand over the last of his food without a second thought, even if it leaves him hungry, and it’s exactly that selflessness that made Suria and Steg take him in. Beneath his alien-obsessed quirks and shy demeanor lies a loyal companion who keeps the wheels turning—literally—on the band’s endless road trips.\n\nThough Dakota is an FtM trans man still finding his full confidence, the band’s chaotic, sex-positive energy has become oddly therapeutic for him. Every gig, every wild night, and every reckless mile brings him closer to seeing himself as the man he always knew he was. His low self-esteem sometimes drags him down, convinced he’s not attractive or charismatic enough to stand out, but Suria in particular disagrees—she insists he has the makings of a “ladykiller” if he’d just let himself believe it.\n\nOn stage, he may linger in the shadows, tuning guitars or tweaking amps, but offstage he’s family. A gentle soul in a crew of loudmouths, Dakota’s sweetness and quiet reliability are his greatest strengths. Still, there’s a fire beneath that modest exterior—one that shows in fleeting sparks of boldness, especially when he finally starts to believe in himself."

They’re inseparable—always seen together, always lifting each other up, and always turning heads with their contrasting yet perfectly balanced energies.\n\nCoral, born Coraline Burchardi, is a former four-star chef from Germany whose culinary genius and nurturing spirit immediately won over the band. A “five-star wife” in Clover’s words, Coral embodies a soft, feminine warmth—lipstick, laughter, and the kind of home-cooked meals that make even the wildest rockers feel human again. She’s the “light” in their pairing, endlessly kind and supportive, and while she may have traded haute cuisine for life on the road, she thrives in her role as the band’s chef and surrogate big sister.\n\nClover, whose real name remains a mystery, is Coral’s polar opposite in style but her perfect complement in love. A butch stoner with ever-present eye bags and a gamer’s joystick thumb-calluses, Clover handles the technical side of the band’s chaotic lifestyle—rigging gear, setting up sound, and sometimes baking the “special treats” that keep everyone mellow on long nights. With her drawn-out, lazy cadence and German roots peeking through her slang, she exudes dark, sardonic humor and a teasing bite that Coral secretly loves.\n\nTogether, Coral and Clover embody the “light and dark feminine” dynamic—Coral’s warm stability balancing Clover’s laid-back chaos. Whether they’re gaming side-by-side, cooking together, or teasing each other mercilessly, they’re proof that love on the road can be just as wild, shameless, and fun as the music itself."

Then I remembered I have a Rachel Foley card that and that Revelations was set on a ship for the majority of it.\nMight end up doing a Cold Fear card out of this.\nLorebooks going forward will likely be the supportive/supplemental maps (so the ai knows how everything interconnects).",

          "content": "The t-Abyss Virus was engineered in 2003 by merging the deep-sea Abyss retrovirus, discovered in the Kermadec Trench, with Umbrella’s perfected t-Virus. The Abyss itself is a retrovirus with piscean genetic traits that enhance muscle and skeletal systems for survival in high-pressure environments. When modified with the t-Virus, it became a potent bioweapon capable of driving extreme aquatic mutations in both humans and animals.\n\nHuman hosts commonly transform into Oozes, emaciated zombie-like creatures that excrete mucus and must drain fluids from prey to survive. Long-term infection can produce Globsters, amorphous aquatic masses adapted for underwater ambushes. Mutations differ by gender, with female hosts often becoming Sea Creepers. Remarkably, some infected retain partial speech or mimicry, as seen in Rachel Foley and Jack Norman.\n\nThe t-Abyss also infects non-human hosts, creating Fenrir from canines, Ghiozzo from fish, and massive hybrid threats like Malacoda, a parasite fused with a whale. It can even mutate existing B.O.W.s, giving rise to the Farfarello Hunter, capable of turning invisible. Though a sample was acquired by TRICELL, its environmental danger and uncontrollable spread have kept it off the black market, highlighting its catastrophic potential as a weapon."

          "content": "Ooze are mutated humans infected with the t-Abyss Virus, a retrovirus derived from deep-sea organisms and spliced with the t-Virus. The infection warps the human genome with aquatic traits, producing waterlogged, corpse-like beings that constantly excrete mucus. This slime both lubricates their movements and betrays their presence. To survive, Oozes must consume vast amounts of water, often preying on humans or animals to replenish their fluids.\n\nDescription:\nOozes resemble emaciated, drowned corpses. Their heads hinge back unnaturally, exposing a leech-like esophagus tipped with needle teeth. Coral-like bone growths protrude from their arms, while their feet are reduced to warped stumps, forcing them into an awkward shuffle. Despite this gait, they use their falling momentum to lunge suddenly at prey. Their bodies are flexible enough to squeeze through vents, floor grates, and other tight passages, allowing them to ambush victims unexpectedly.\n\nLocation:\nEncountered throughout the Queen Zenobia and related vessels. They emerge from vents, grates, or hidden spaces in corridors and storage areas.\n\nBehavior & Movement:\nOozes stalk their prey slowly, shuffling forward before lunging into sudden bursts of speed. They exploit confined environments, climbing through ventilation systems to surprise targets. Almost all specimens are male, as female hosts tend instead to mutate into Sea Creepers.\n\nAttacks:\nLeech Drain: Latches onto prey with its extending esophagus to drain fluids.\nClaw/Strike: Bone-arm swipes and blunt strikes.\nGrab & Bite: Attempts to grapple victims before feeding.\n\nWeakness:\nThe head is their critical weak point. Gunfire focused here can kill them quickly, while body shots are less effective due to their waterlogged resilience."

This grotesque appendage fires spinning bone-like projectiles, giving them the ability to engage prey from a distance rather than relying on close-range ambush.\n\nDescription:\nTricornes retain the drowned, waterlogged appearance of normal Oozes but with one arm warped into an organic launcher, braced against their body like a fused weapon. Their heads remain their primary weak point, with the esophagus-tongue hidden behind a hinged skull. Their projectiles are organic spines that spin through the air and can be deflected or destroyed with well-timed gunfire or a knife strike.\n\nLocation:\nPrimarily encountered in the Queen Zenobia’s halls and open chambers, where their ranged attacks allow them to cover long corridors or harass intruders from elevated positions.\n\nBehavior & Movement:\nUnlike most Oozes, Tricornes prefer to maintain distance, attacking from afar while forcing prey into cover. They shuffle with the same crooked gait as other variants but rarely close in unless threatened.\n\nAttacks:\nSpine Shot: Fires sharp, spinning bone projectiles from its mutated arm.\nClaw/Strike: Uses its non-mutated arm at close range if approached.\n\nWeakness:\nTheir head remains the critical weak point. Closing the gap quickly or engaging with long-range precision weapons such as rifles is the safest way to neutralize them. Projectiles travel slowly enough to be sidestepped, shot, or even deflected with a knife."

Its body remains bloated and waterlogged, continuously shedding slime, and its head retains the hinged skull with exposed esophagus characteristic of the Ooze strain. Their overdeveloped arms distort their gait even further, giving their lunge attacks sudden speed and surprising range.\n\nLocation:\nMost frequently encountered in the Queen Zenobia’s lower decks and labs, where confined spaces force prey into their reach.\n\nBehavior & Movement:\nPincers are more aggressive than standard Oozes, advancing directly toward prey rather than waiting for ambush. Their uneven, shuffling gait makes them appear clumsy, but they compensate with sudden, explosive swipes.\n\nAttacks:\nScythe Arms: Wide, sweeping slashes with spiked claws capable of incapacitating prey.\nGrab & Drain: Occasionally attempts to latch on and feed through its extended esophagus.\nPower Swipes: Stronger than standard Oozes, capable of staggering or pinning targets.\n\nWeakness:\nThe head remains their critical vulnerability. Shotguns or rifles are recommended to maintain distance, as their elongated arms make close-range combat highly dangerous."

Unlike other variants, Chunks are entirely suicidal in their attack method, detonating themselves in proximity to prey.\n\nDescription:\nThe Chunk is a swollen, armless hulk of pulsating tissue. Its massive, engorged torso sloshes with unstable fluids, while its head and neck still retain the warped Ooze morphology. Without arms, its bloated body becomes its sole weapon—collapsing into a violent self-detonation when it nears prey or is fatally wounded.\n\nLocation:\nTypically found guarding doorways, narrow corridors, or corners aboard the Queen Zenobia, acting as living traps to impede progress.\n\nBehavior & Movement:\nThey shamble awkwardly, drawn toward nearby prey with unsteady, lumbering steps. Unlike other Oozes, they do not attempt to grab, slash, or feed—survival is irrelevant, as their function is purely to self-destruct.\n\nAttacks:\nSelf-Destruct: The Chunk closes distance before violently exploding, inflicting heavy damage on prey and nearby creatures.\nDeath Burst: Killing one also triggers detonation, allowing them to harm surrounding enemies but posing equal danger to the attacker.\n\nWeakness:\nTheir swollen bulk makes them slow and predictable, but their volatile bodies demand distance. Long-range weapons are ideal, ensuring players remain clear of the blast radius."

Their grotesque form leaves no trace of humanity.\n\nLocation:\nEncountered both aboard the Queen Dido and in submerged sections of infected areas. They can also be found washed onto land where they drag themselves along with sluggish movements.\n\nBehavior & Movement:\nOn land, Globsters move slowly by undulating their bodies in a sluggish crawl. In water, however, they become swift and dangerous, gliding with surprising speed and maneuverability. They are known to actively pursue prey underwater, far outpacing human swimmers.\n\nAttacks:\nSwallow Whole: When underwater, they can engulf prey entirely with their gaping maw, killing them instantly.\nBody Slam: On land, they may attempt to crush prey with their bulk, exposing their mouth as they lunge forward.\n\nWeakness:\nTheir underside mouth is their only vulnerable point. Striking this soft tissue inflicts severe damage, though care must be taken as they expose it primarily when attacking or moving. Distance and caution are critical, especially underwater where escape is difficult."

Patches of black or white fur cling to their rotting hides, while gaping holes expose raw flesh and even their ribcages. Two distinct forms exist: the smaller white-furred Fenrir, and the larger, more resilient black-furred Fenrir, which often act as pack leaders.\n\nLocation:\nPrimarily encountered in groups, often surrounding targets and attacking from multiple directions.\n\nBehavior & Movement:\nFenrir rely on coordinated pack tactics, rushing prey from different angles to overwhelm and confuse them. They are fast, agile, and relentless, using sheer numbers to wear down victims. Black Fenrir frequently take an alpha role, leading smaller white Fenrir in assaults.\n\nAttacks:\nLeaping Bite: Pouncing at prey to tear flesh.\nPack Swarm: Multiple Fenrir attack simultaneously, increasing damage and limiting escape.\n\nWeakness:\nTheir exposed ribcages are their critical weak point. While Black Fenrir can absorb more punishment before collapsing, both variants succumb quickly if their ribcage is targeted."

Among Umbrella’s earliest and most enduring creations, they later appeared in terrorist attacks such as the destruction of Terragrigia, and continue to see use by rival organizations long after Umbrella’s fall.\n\nDescription:\nHunters are humanoid in form but heavily mutated, with amphibian-like traits. Their bodies are covered in tough, green leathery skin stretched over muscular frames. Long limbs end in razor claws capable of slicing through bone, while bulging eyes and wide, frog-like jaws accentuate their predatory design.\n\nLocation:\nEncountered sparingly aboard the Queen Zenobia, especially in the Promenade, but common during the Terragrigia incident.\n\nBehavior & Movement:\nHunters are fast, intelligent, and aggressive. They use speed and leaping power to close distance, scaling obstacles with ease and lunging several meters to strike prey. Once engaged, they rarely retreat, pressing attacks until one side is dead.\n\nAttacks:\nClaw Swipes – Brutal, rapid slashes that stagger prey.\nLeaping Slash – A powerful airborne strike capable of instant decapitation.\n\nWeakness:\nLightly armored compared to other B.O.W.s, Hunters can be destroyed with concentrated fire. Shotguns, magnums, and explosives are especially effective before they close in."

Their bodies can bend light, granting them the ability to cloak and mimic their surroundings, making them difficult to track. Unlike their more reckless counterparts, they are less overtly aggressive, often stalking prey before striking. Despite this change in behavior, they remain extremely dangerous, combining speed, stealth, and raw power.\n\nLocation:\nSnowy Path – Winter Canyon 1: Multiple Farfarello attack when the plane wreck is approached.\nLower Complex – Airport Building B1: Groups emerge after power is restored for the second time.\n\nBehavior & Movement:\nThese creatures rely on ambush tactics, slipping in and out of visibility to confuse prey. Their movements are fast and predatory, but unlike standard Hunters, they often wait for the perfect moment to strike.\n\nAttacks:\nClaw Swipes – Swift, brutal slashes delivered once in close range.\nStealth Approach – Using their cloaking, Farfarello attempt to flank and overwhelm targets.\n\nWeakness:\nDespite their enhanced abilities, Farfarello remain vulnerable to heavy firepower. Keeping distance and using wide-area weapons can disrupt their stealth and bring them down before they close in."

When clinging to walls or ceilings, they withdraw into their thick outer shell, rendering them completely invulnerable while dormant. Once awakened, they drop down into a twisted, vaguely humanoid form with two legs and long, tentacle-like arms ending in clawed tips. Despite their ungainly appearance, they are surprisingly fast and capable of immense strength, easily strong enough to shatter a human spine.\n\nLocation:\nUncommon enemy aboard the Queen Zenobia, most notably around areas affected by water contamination, such as the Solarium and nearby maintenance corridors.\n\nBehavior & Movement:\nWall Blisters remain dormant for long periods, immobile and unreachable while attached to surfaces. When disturbed or triggered, they awaken violently and charge at prey with flailing arms. Their movements are jerky but deceptively quick, allowing them to close distance faster than expected.\n\nAttacks:\nTentacle Flail – Rapid strikes with elongated arms, capable of breaking bones.\nCharging Grapple – Uses its bulk and reach to knock prey down and crush them.\n\nWeakness:\nWall Blisters are highly resilient when hibernating, but once exposed and moving, they can be killed with concentrated gunfire. Maintaining distance is crucial, as their extended reach and sudden charges can quickly overwhelm an unprepared target."

Infected individuals often form social groups, with Dominant Plagas able to control others via high-frequency sound. Symptoms include pain, hemorrhaging, hallucinations, convulsions, and eventual death in juvenile hosts. Hosts show increased strength, resilience, and potential mutations. Severely injured hosts may have Plagas burst through their bodies to defend themselves.\n\nBehavior and Intelligence\nWhile hosts retain some independence, Plagas influence creates pack mentality and cult-like behavior, enhanced by Saddler’s engineered strain. Ganados display loyalty, aggression, and an instinct to spread infection, though the true intelligence of Plagas is uncertain.\n\nWeaknesses & Countermeasures\nUV radiation: Extremely lethal; flashbangs can kill exposed Plagas instantly.\nRadiation therapy: Developed by Serra’s team to safely remove hatchlings from hosts.\nMedication: Can halt or kill hatchlings and unhatched eggs.\nNervous system destruction: Sometimes prevents takeover but may cripple hosts.\n\n\nLife Cycle Stages\nGuadaña – Tentacled, scythe-armed stage, seen in both humans and animals (e.g., infected dogs).\nMandíbula – Tentacles become stronger; a large biting mouth develops.\nAraña – Spider-like, able to exit the host’s body entirely."

Advanced infections cause erratic twitches, bulging veins, or violent Plaga eruptions.\n\nLocation:\nVillage: Farmers and laborers armed with tools and torches.\nCastle: Hooded zealots wielding medieval weapons, sometimes armored.\nIsland: Militarized hosts using explosives, firearms, and advanced Plaga strains.\n\nBehavior:\nThey act in groups, coordinating to surround or overwhelm intruders. Though their speech and routines remain eerily human, their loyalty lies with the Plaga.\n\nMovement:\nGanados are capable of sprinting and charging with alarming bursts of speed. They stagger when injured but recover quickly, pressing attacks with relentless persistence. Some dodge shots, weave unpredictably, or climb obstacles in pursuit.\n\nAttacks:\nMelee: Axes, sickles, knives, torches, or hammers.\nHeavy: Shields, chainsaws, and flails.\nRanged: Bows, crossbows, dynamite, or firearms.\n\nMutation: Critically wounded hosts may erupt into Plaga, forming tendrils or insect-like heads that attack independently.\n\nWeaknesses:\nGunfire is effective but requires precision, as Ganados can absorb multiple shots. Head or knee attacks stagger them for counters. Shotguns or explosives work best against groups, and quick kills prevent parasite emergence."

Though weaker than later evolutions, Guadaña are vicious and highly aggressive once revealed.\n\nVisual Description:\nA grotesque, fleshy organism with a soft, pulsating body covered in lesions and exposed nerves. Several yellow, eye-like nodules dot its surface, twitching as it senses prey. Its body splits open to unfurl a long, sinewy tentacle ending in a sharp, organic blade.\n\nLocation:\nEmerges from Ganado hosts in the Village, Castle, and Island after sustaining severe head or body damage.\n\nBehavior:\nOnce exposed, Guadaña focus entirely on offense. They lash out wildly with their scythe-like tentacle, showing no concern for the host’s survival. They rarely coordinate but can overwhelm players in confined spaces when multiple parasites erupt simultaneously.\n\nMovement:\nStationary within the host body, but once extended, the tentacle gives the parasite reach beyond melee range. It sways and whips erratically, striking quickly at anything nearby.\n\nAttacks:\nTentacle Slash: Wide, sweeping strikes that deal heavy damage.\nClose-Range Lunge: A sudden, forward thrust of the blade-like appendage.\n\nWeaknesses:\nFragile compared to other Plaga forms. A few handgun shots are often enough to kill them, and knives can be effective in close range, though risky. Their soft bodies are highly vulnerable to precise gunfire or area-effect weapons."

More dangerous than Guadaña, the Mandíbula shows greater resilience and versatility in combat.\n\nVisual Description:\nA grotesque parasite with a swollen, fleshy body sprouting hardened, limb-like tentacles. These limbs function like arms or legs, ending in clawed extensions used to seize prey. Its central maw, filled with jagged teeth, gapes open wide enough to crush a human skull. Dark nodules and pulsating tissue line its body, giving it a half-formed, insectoid appearance.\n\nLocation:\nEmerges from Ganado hosts across the Village, Castle, and Island, particularly when hosts are heavily damaged.\n\nBehavior:\nAggressive and predatory, Mandíbula uses its limbs to drag prey toward its mouth. It relies on direct confrontation rather than ambush, attacking survivors head-on. In groups, multiple Mandíbula can quickly overwhelm with their grappling ability.\n\nMovement:\nLess erratic than Guadaña but more deliberate, crawling and lurching with insect-like motions. Its limbs extend from the host, giving it better reach and mobility when striking.\n\nAttacks:\nGrab & Bite: Seizes prey with its limbs and forces them into its mouth for a lethal bite.\nClaw Strikes: Slashing blows from its hardened limbs.\nAcid Spit: Projects corrosive fluid at range, blinding or damaging prey.\n\nWeaknesses:\nWhile tougher than Guadaña, the Mandíbula is still vulnerable to concentrated firepower. Handguns may suffice, but shotguns or rifles are far more effective, especially before it closes distance. Fire and explosives can quickly neutralize groups of parasites before they grab hold."

While similar in threat level to the Guadaña when attached, the Araña possesses heightened durability, resilience against certain weapons, and the ability to completely detach from its host body. Though lethal, this detachment leaves the parasite vulnerable, and it will eventually die without a new host.\n\nVisual Description:\nAraña take on a spider-like appearance, with long, thin limbs sprouting from their fleshy, pulsating bodies. Their torso-mounted maw drips with acidic fluid, and their eyeless heads are ringed with sensory tendrils. When fully emerged from a host, they scuttle with insect-like speed, their legs scraping across stone and wood as they seek new prey.\n\nLocation:\nPrimarily found within higher-ranking Ganados such as castle cultists and island militia, where they erupt once the host is heavily damaged or killed. Curiously, some appear without hosts at all—most notably during the confrontation with Ramon Salazar.\n\nBehavior:\nWhen attached to a host, Araña fight with similar aggression to other Plaga, attacking in close quarters or spitting acid at range. If the host dies or if threatened, they may tear free of the body and fight independently. Detached Araña attempt to lunge at potential new hosts, though their size prevents them from successfully implanting into humans, leaving them doomed to eventual death.\n\nMovement:\nAttached: Moves in tandem with its host, extending spider-like limbs to strike at prey.\nDetached: Crawls and scrambles quickly, lunging at survivors in a desperate bid for survival.\n\nAttacks:\nLimb Strikes: Slashing or stabbing blows from elongated legs.\nAcid Spit: Mid-range attack capable of blinding and burning.\nLunge (Detached): Throws itself at prey in an attempt to subdue or latch on.\n\nWeaknesses:\nDurable compared to earlier Plaga forms and somewhat resistant to flash grenades, though flashes that fail to kill will severely weaken them. Detached Araña are fragile, dying quickly under concentrated fire. Incendiary weapons are especially effective in preventing detached parasites from swarming.\n\nLifecycle Note:\nThe Araña represents the final active stage of the subordinate Plaga, though detached individuals are short-lived. Variations suggest that, under rare conditions, an Araña may attempt to hijack another host entirely, resulting in unstable dual-infected Ganados with berserker-like behavior."

          "content": "Del Lago (“From the Lake”) was a colossal amphibian Plaga experiment, one of Los Iluminados’ earliest attempts at combining parasites with non-human hosts. Originally a salamander, the parasite caused uncontrolled mutations, forcing the creature to grow to over twenty meters in length. Unable to regulate its behavior or maintain control, the cult sealed the monster inside the lake near the village’s church. The scale of mutation was not properly balanced with the amphibian’s physiology, leaving Del Lago incapable of leaving the lake. This limitation, alongside its uncontrollable behavior, led the cult to abandon further development of amphibian-based Plaga experiments.\n\nAppearance:\nDel Lago resembled a titanic salamander with vestigial legs, its body stretched and deformed by the parasite’s influence. Its mouth gaped open into a massive jaw lined with multiple rows of teeth, large enough to swallow humans whole. During attack patterns, writhing Plaga tentacles emerged from its throat, striking at prey or pulling targets toward its maw. Notably, the creature lacked functional eyes, relying instead on heightened sensory awareness within water.\n\nBehavior:\nWhile not intelligent, Del Lago responded violently to any disturbance in its territory. Motion in the water immediately triggered pursuit, and its speed in aquatic environments was deceptively fast despite its bulk. The parasite failed to suppress the amphibian’s predatory instincts, leaving it a dangerous but ultimately unmanageable bio-weapon.\n\nMovement:\nAquatic Motion: Swift and highly maneuverable, able to lunge at boats or prey.\nSurface Breach: Emerges with explosive force, threatening to overturn vessels.\n\nAttacks:\nTentacle Strikes: Plaga appendages lash from its gullet.\nCapsize Attempts: Ramming or pulling prey into the lake to drown.\nSwallow Whole: Targets dragged into its maw are devoured instantly.\n\nWeaknesses:\nRestricted entirely to water due to atrophied legs, Del Lago was vulnerable if forced into prolonged conflict. Harpoons or similar piercing weapons were effective in exploiting its massive, exposed body.\n"

          "content": "El Gigante (“The Giant”) refers to a series of human-based Bio-Organic Weapons engineered by Los Iluminados. Created through Plaga implantation into human test subjects, these creatures underwent uncontrolled gigantism, reaching over four times the height of a normal man. While their immense strength and durability made them devastating on the battlefield, their intelligence was severely diminished, leaving them as near-feral beasts. As a result, only a small number were produced and deployed in limited areas.\n\nDescription:\nEl Gigante stands as a towering humanoid, its stretched skin drawn tight over bulging musculature. Despite their immense size, their faces retain distorted human features, twisted by the parasite’s growth. The Plaga embedded in the cervical vertebrae occasionally bursts forth, exposing a pulsating core that is both a sign of the mutation and a weak point. Their sheer bulk makes them appear unstoppable, with bodies strong enough to rip apart stone walls or hurl massive objects as weapons.\n\nLocation:\nTwo specimens were placed in Salazar’s castle, serving as guardians of the underground facilities.\nTwo more were contained in the abandoned coal mines near the village, held in reserve until needed.\n\nBehavior:\nEl Gigante displays minimal intelligence and is essentially uncontrollable, attacking any moving target indiscriminately — including Ganados and other Plaga hosts. They are driven by base instincts, treating prey as little more than obstacles to crush underfoot. When enraged or injured, the controlling Plaga may erupt violently from the spine, further escalating the creature’s aggression.\n\nMovement:\nCharging Stride: Despite their bulk, they are capable of running short distances with startling speed.\nGround Quakes: Each step causes tremors, shaking the environment and destabilizing footing.\nClimbing / Vaulting: Can scale walls or obstacles by brute force when pursuing prey.\n\nAttacks:\nCrushing Slam: Uses fists or open hands to pound prey into the ground.\nGrab & Throw: Seizes victims and hurls them with overwhelming force.\nStomp: Crushes targets beneath their massive feet.\nDebris Throw: Tears boulders or logs from the environment to use as improvised weapons.\nPlaga Strike: When exposed, the parasite lashes violently at nearby enemies.\n\nWeakness:\nEl Gigante’s massive durability makes small-arms fire largely ineffective. Sustained heavy weapon damage is required to stagger it. Once weakened, the spinal Plaga bursts forth, creating a temporary weak point vulnerable to direct attack. Repeatedly exploiting this vulnerability is the only effective means of bringing the creature down."

These mutated canines are among the few non-human hosts, adapting surprisingly well to parasitism due to their natural pack instincts. First appearing after Leon crosses the lake post–Del Lago, they continue to harass him in multiple encounters, including a memorable ambush within Salazar’s hedge maze.\n\nDescription:\nColmillos resemble gaunt, feral wolves whose bodies have been disfigured by the parasite within. Their fangs are unnaturally enlarged, to the point where they cannot properly close their jaws. In low light, their eyes shine an eerie green due to their reflective tapetum lucidum, making them easy to spot in the dark. When threatened, the Plaga within their abdomen can erupt violently through torn skin, lashing with bladed tentacles to extend their lethality beyond normal canine means. Their spines are warped and twisted by the parasite’s growth, giving them an unnerving silhouette.\n\nLocation:\nFirst Encounter: Post–Del Lago, on the lakeshore.\nLater Appearances: Near the Church (group of three).\nProminently in Salazar’s hedge maze (roughly a dozen kept as hunting pets).\n\nBehavior:\nColmillos are highly aggressive but rely on pack tactics when engaging prey. They circle and harry their target, with one lunging at the throat while others attack from the flanks or rear. Unlike Ganados, they must usually sight their prey before attacking, though exposed Plaga can initiate combat independently.\n\nMovement:\nFast and Agile: Capable of sprinting in short bursts to overwhelm victims.\nAmbush Leaps: Lunge from cover to close distance instantly.\nPack Coordination: Move fluidly around prey, rarely attacking alone.\n\nAttacks:\nBite: Powerful fang attack, targeting the throat or limbs.\nTackle: Leap into prey to knock them off balance.\nPlaga Tentacle Strike: When exposed, the parasite lashes outward with bladed tendrils, causing severe damage.\n\nWeakness:\nColmillos are relatively fragile when compared to larger Plaga hosts. Quick weapon use can bring them down, though their speed and erratic movement make them difficult to hit. Shotguns are particularly effective at close range, while flash grenades can instantly kill any exposed Plaga that emerges from a host."

Found in the shadowed halls of Salazar Castle, they represent a unique survival method for the parasites, using the empty suits as both protection and temporary vessels while awaiting a viable host.\n\nDescription:\nArmaduras come in two primary forms: lighter silver suits with rounded helmets, typically hosting Type-A Plagas, and heavier, black-and-gold ornate armors with square helmets that usually house Type-B Plagas. Inside, the parasite stretches its tendrils to control all four limbs, mimicking human movement. They wield medieval weapons such as broadswords, halberds, and axes with surprising skill. The weak point is the helmet—damaging it can expose the Plaga, which then becomes vulnerable to direct gunfire or instantly killed by flash grenades.\n\nLocation:\nSalazar Castle – found throughout hallways and galleries.\nOften positioned as stationary suits of armor to ambush intruders.\n\nBehavior:\nNormally dormant, conserving energy until disturbed. When prey approaches, Armaduras suddenly animate, swinging their weapons with unnatural precision. Some lie in wait among inanimate suits, attacking only once in a scripted ambush before collapsing.\n\nMovement:\nSlow and Heavy: They advance methodically, their weapons always at the ready.\nAmbush Lunge: Some spring suddenly into action after remaining motionless.\nPersistent Advance: Though sluggish, they do not retreat once awakened.\n\nAttacks:\nWeapon Strikes: Heavy swings with broadswords, axes, or halberds, capable of staggering or killing prey.\nType-B Bite: When exposed, the Type-B Plaga can lunge for a victim’s head in a lethal instant-death attack.\n\nWeakness:\nHelmets are the critical weak point—destroying them exposes the parasite. Firearms can kill the Plaga once revealed, but flash grenades remain the most efficient counter. Ambush Armaduras collapse after their single strike, leaving behind no parasite remains, suggesting the crushing weight or self-destruction of the host suit."

Developed by Los Iluminados, they represent one of the cult’s most horrific attempts to weaponize parasitism, producing creatures that are neither fully human nor insect. Leon Kennedy encounters them both in the castle sewers and in hive-like towers during his mission in Valdelobos.\n\nDescription:\nNovistadores retain faint traces of their human origins but are dominated by insectoid features: two pairs of glowing eyes, segmented antennae, and two pairs of wings protruding from their backs. Their elongated limbs end in sharp claws capable of piercing flesh and even decapitating victims. Their chitinous bodies are mottled and grotesque, and their distorted movements only enhance their monstrous presence. Some exhibit camouflage, bending light through pigment-shifting exoskeletons, while others develop stronger wings, trading stealth for flight.\n\nLocation:\nSalazar Castle Sewers – Camouflage-capable “stealth types.”\nCastle Towers – Hive-like structures housing “flying types.”\n\nBehavior:\nPredatory and territorial, Novistadores hunt in groups, ambushing intruders from walls, ceilings, or the air. The stealth type lies in wait, relying on invisibility to strike at close range, while the flying type patrols aggressively, capable of carrying away prey. Both exhibit hive-like behavior, building nests reminiscent of wasps and attacking in swarms when provoked.\n\nMovement:\nCrawling: Skitter rapidly across walls, ceilings, and floors with insect-like agility.\nFlight: Stealth types hover briefly, landing often due to weaker wings; flying types can sustain true flight and even abduct humans.\nAmbush Pounce: Leap from walls or ceilings to grapple prey.\n\nAttacks:\nClaw Strikes: Razor-sharp slashes, capable of lethal decapitation.\nAcid Spit: Highly corrosive fluid that burns through flesh and armor.\nAerial Grapple (Flying Type): Can seize and carry prey mid-flight, exploiting their superior wings.\n\nWeaknesses:\nDespite their agility, Novistadores are fragile compared to armored Plaga creatures. Stealth types are betrayed by glowing eyes or dripping acid, making them vulnerable once spotted. Flying types are weakest mid-flight, where focused firearm fire can ground or kill them instantly. Their insect physiology makes them particularly susceptible to shotguns, explosives, and flash grenades."

Each contains vials of Soporil β and tubocurarine. If triggered, the bracelet first injects Soporil (a sedative), and 9 minutes later automatically injects tubocurarine to asphyxiate the wearer. This deadly injection is triggered by various penalties: if BP falls to 0 or below, if the player enters a wrong/invalid Chromatic Door or fails to enter any door in time, if the player tries to remove or destroy the bracelet, or if a player with under-9 BP tries to force Door 9.

            "Midgar Region"
          ],
          "content": "Overview\n\nThe Midgar Region lies at the heart of the eastern continent, dominated by the city of Midgar. This vast, circular metropolis serves as the seat of the Shinra Electric Power Company, whose influence spreads from its towers to the farthest corners of the land. Eight colossal reactors draw mako from the Planet, feeding both the city’s lights and its weapons of war. The ground around Midgar bears the scars of this harvest—fields withered, rivers dulled, and skies darkened by smoke. Beyond the city’s reach, small settlements endure, some clinging to old ways, others surviving only at Shinra’s mercy.\n\nKey Locations\n\nMidgar\nThe largest city on the continent, suspended on a great steel plate. The upper city houses Shinra’s offices, wealthy citizens, and military infrastructure, while beneath the plate lie the slums, where millions live in poverty and shadow. Each of the city’s eight sectors is sustained by its own reactor.\n\nSector 5 Slums — Known for its unusual flower garden, tended by a young woman named Aerith.\n\nWall Market (Sector 6) — A den of crime, vice, and trade, ruled by Don Corneo.\n\nSector 7 Slums — Once the base of the AVALANCHE resistance, destroyed when Shinra collapsed the plate above.\n\nTrain Graveyard — A maze of abandoned engines and carriages, now a refuge for the desperate and a haunt for spirits.\n\nShinra Headquarters — The central tower, home to corporate offices, laboratories, and the command of Shinra’s military forces.\n\nKalm\nA quiet town beyond Midgar’s walls, built in the style of earlier times. Stone houses and wood-beamed inns line its streets. Though small, it remains untouched by Shinra’s heavy hand, surviving on trade and its distance from the city.\n\nChocobo Farm\nA family-run ranch known for breeding chocobos, essential for crossing the dangerous marshes. Without a trained bird, no traveler survives the Midgar Zolom that prowls the waters.\n\nMythril Mine\nAn abandoned network of tunnels carved into the cliffs east of the marshes. Once rich with mythril, now it is home only to monsters and wandering soldiers. It remains a crucial pass toward Junon.\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nThe region is marked by plains and rocky ridges, with marshes lying east of Midgar. The land shows clear wounds from years of mako extraction: trees stunted, soil lifeless, air heavy with the taste of metal. The Midgar Zolom, a serpent of enormous size, reigns within the marshes. Its presence alone shapes travel and trade, for no caravan dares the crossing without protection.\n\nFactions and Influence\n\nShinra Electric Power Company rules from Midgar itself, projecting military power and economic control across the region.\n\nAVALANCHE, a resistance group, once struck from the slums, sabotaging reactors and challenging Shinra’s grip. Though crushed, their ideals remain whispered.\n\nIndependent Settlers in towns like Kalm and family holdings like the Chocobo Farm persist outside the plate’s shadow, relying on trade, livestock, and old knowledge.\n\nCulture\n\nLife in the region is defined by division. Those who live upon the plate enjoy artificial light, steady energy, and the illusion of progress. Those beneath it scrape together homes from scrap metal and refuse, living in darkness and smog. Outside the city, villagers cling to simpler lives—windmills turning in the breeze, chocobos harnessed to plows—watching the glow of Midgar from afar with both envy and fear.\n\nNotable Figures\n\nPresident Shinra / Rufus Shinra — Rulers of the city and the Company.\n\nThe Turks — Covert agents who carry out the Company’s hidden dealings.\n\nBarret Wallace and AVALANCHE — Slum-born resistance that struck directly at Midgar’s lifeblood.\n\nDon Corneo — Crime lord of Wall Market, power broker in the underworld.\n\nAerith Gainsborough — A young woman of the Sector 5 Slums, tied to mysteries older than the city itself.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe Midgar Region is the beating heart of human industry, a monument to ambition and excess. From here, Shinra draws strength and spreads its hand across the world. Yet it is also a wound in the Planet, a place where resistance is born, and where the balance between survival and ruin tilts ever closer to collapse."

          ],
          "content": "Overview\n\nThe Junon Region lies west of Midgar, across the cliffs and marshes of the eastern continent. Its coastline is battered by strong sea winds and restless tides, making it both a natural harbor and a defensive stronghold. At its heart stands Junon, the great port city of Shinra, a fortress that overlooks the sea and anchors the Company’s naval and aerial power. Around it, smaller communities survive in the shadows of Shinra’s guns, while the landscape bears scars from battles fought during Shinra’s rise.\n\nKey Locations\n\nJunon City\nBuilt along the cliffs, Junon was once a modest fishing town. Shinra transformed it into a fortress city, drilling into the rock and raising the colossal Sister Ray cannon to guard the harbor. The city has two layers:\n\nLower Junon — The remnants of the old fishing village, still inhabited by common folk living in the shadow of the fortress above.\n\nUpper Junon — Shinra’s military port, filled with barracks, shipyards, and heavy artillery. Soldiers march the streets, and massive airships dock in its hangars.\n\nFort Condor\nA mountain fortress to the south, named for the giant condor that nests atop it. Within the mountain lies a hidden mako reactor, abandoned by Shinra but still contested. The defenders of the Fort fight to keep Shinra from reclaiming the reactor, viewing the condor and its egg as sacred symbols of resistance.\n\nUnderwater Reactor\nA Shinra facility hidden below Junon, where experiments and energy transfers take place. Its workings are secretive, guarded by soldiers and machines, and its purpose tied to the Company’s weapon research.\n\nSurrounding Settlements\nSmaller fishing hamlets dot the coastline, though many have withered since Shinra claimed Junon. Merchants and sailors still pass through, seeking fortune from trade or employment in the Company’s fleets.\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nThe Junon Region is defined by sharp cliffs, rocky beaches, and strong ocean winds. The sea dominates life here, its storms feeding legends of monsters lurking beneath the waves. Inland, the land rises into hills and sparse forests, but much of the terrain is unsettled, home to roaming beasts.\n\nFactions and Influence\n\nShinra Electric Power Company holds Junon as its naval and aerial base, commanding fleets, submarines, and airships from its docks.\n\nFort Condor Resistance defends their mountain home, opposing Shinra’s return to the reactor within.\n\nLocal Fisherfolk of Lower Junon and the smaller coastal villages live caught between the demands of Shinra and the dangers of the sea.\n\nCulture\n\nLife in the region has shifted from quiet fishing traditions to militarized order. Lower Junon clings to its heritage, with families living off the sea, while Upper Junon thrives on Shinra’s presence, its people bound to military service and industry. At Fort Condor, defenders live communally, sustained by trade and by their devotion to the condor above.\n\nNotable Figures\n\nRufus Shinra — Uses Junon as a stage to display the might of Shinra’s military.\n\nShinra Generals and Officers — Command fleets, airships, and the Sister Ray cannon from within the fortress.\n\nFort Condor Resistance Leaders — Anonymous fighters whose names are less important than their cause.\n\nPeople of Lower Junon — Ordinary folk, such as Priscilla, who still embody the old life of the fishing village.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe Junon Region is the shield and spear of Shinra’s empire. From here, the Company projects strength across the seas and skies, securing dominance beyond the continent. Yet it also shelters sparks of resistance—villagers who cling to their past, and fighters who risk all for a condor’s flight."

          ],
          "content": "Overview\n\nThe Corel Region lies in the western deserts of the eastern continent, a land of dry winds and broken earth. Once rich with coal, the region thrived on mining and trade, but Shinra’s promise of prosperity through mako left it shattered. The destruction of Corel Village and the rise of the Gold Saucer amusement park mark the region’s fall from industry to exploitation. Today, survivors endure in bitterness and poverty, watching strangers flock to a shining playground built on the ruins of their home.\n\nKey Locations\n\nMount Corel\nA jagged mountain ridge whose mines once supplied coal across the continent. Abandoned railways cling to its cliffs, and bridges span deep ravines where trains once carried ore. Now the mines lie quiet, patrolled by monsters and haunted by memories of betrayal.\n\nNorth Corel\nThe last settlement of the Corel people, built from the ashes of their destroyed village. Its residents live in poverty, despising Shinra and blaming those who trusted the Company. The town survives on scraps of trade from travelers bound for the Gold Saucer.\n\nGold Saucer\nA colossal amusement park rising from the desert, built above the prison below. Bright lights, gaudy attractions, and endless games lure crowds from every corner of the world. Behind its glittering façade lies Shinra’s quiet control, for beneath the Saucer lies the Corel Prison, a dumping ground for criminals and undesirables.\n\nCorel Prison\nA lawless desert settlement, home to convicts and the desperate. No guards watch over the prisoners—only the sand and the creatures beyond keep them penned. Only by winning the favor of Dio, the Saucer’s owner, or through victory in the chocobo races can one escape.\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nThe region is dominated by desert and rock. Sandstorms scour the plains, while little grows except hardy brush. Mount Corel’s ridges cut across the land, making rail travel once vital. The desert heat is unrelenting, and even the night offers little relief. Only the artificial glow of the Gold Saucer breaks the horizon, a beacon of light in an otherwise harsh land.\n\nFactions and Influence\n\nShinra Electric Power Company abandoned the region after destroying Corel, though its shadow remains in the Gold Saucer and prison.\n\nSurvivors of Corel live in North Corel, their hatred of Shinra and mistrust of outsiders defining daily life.\n\nGold Saucer Staff serve Dio and Shinra’s hidden interests, maintaining the park’s grandeur while ignoring the suffering below.\n\nOutlaws of Corel Prison govern themselves by violence and strength, their society ruled by chaos.\n\nCulture\n\nThe people of Corel once built lives around coal mining, proud of their trade and their ability to endure the desert’s harshness. That pride was shattered by Shinra’s betrayal, leaving only anger. In North Corel, families pass down bitterness with each generation, seeing the Saucer’s lights as a mockery of their suffering. In the prison, culture has collapsed entirely, replaced by desperation, gambling, and violence.\n\nNotable Figures\n\nBarret Wallace — Formerly of Corel, blamed by many survivors for trusting Shinra. His story is inseparable from the region’s fate.\n\nDyne — Barret’s old friend, broken by loss, who rules part of the Corel Prison with madness and grief.\n\nDio — Eccentric master of the Gold Saucer, flamboyant yet ruthless in his power.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe Corel Region is both wound and warning. Its deserts bear the cost of trusting Shinra’s promises, while its survivors embody the bitterness left behind. Yet it is also a place of crossroads: where amusement hides cruelty, where prisoners race for freedom, and where the scars of betrayal never truly fade."

          "content": "Overview\n\nThe southern stretches of the eastern continent are a land of deep forests, scarred ruins, and red cliffs that rise into the burning skies of Cosmo Canyon. This region bears the marks of both Shinra’s ambition and the Planet’s resilience. At Gongaga lies the husk of a failed reactor, its destruction leaving the town stunted and sorrowful. To the west, Cosmo Canyon endures as a bastion of wisdom and spiritual study, a place where the cycle of life and the Lifestream are honored above all else. Between them lies wilderness rich with monsters, rivers, and winding paths, a reminder that nature still holds power beyond human control.\n\nKey Locations\n\nGongaga\nOnce a modest village, Gongaga’s fate turned grim when Shinra built a mako reactor nearby. The reactor’s explosion left ruins and contamination, crippling the land and killing many. Today, Gongaga is quiet, its people distrustful of outsiders. The wrecked reactor still stands in the jungle, a rusting scar surrounded by hostile creatures.\n\nCosmo Canyon\nA red-rock settlement carved into cliffs and caves, Cosmo Canyon is famed for its study of the Planet’s spirit and the mysteries of the Lifestream. Scholars, travelers, and seekers of truth gather here, guided by Bugenhagen, the canyon’s elder and keeper of its observatories. Fires burn eternally at the canyon’s heart, symbolizing the unbroken bond between life and the Planet. Cosmo Canyon is also the homeland of Nanaki, known to outsiders as Red XIII.\n\nSurrounding Wilderness\n\nDense Forests: South of Gongaga, great canopies spread across the land, concealing beasts and travelers alike.\n\nRiver Paths: Streams and rivers carve through the region, making travel difficult without bridges or chocobos.\n\nCliff Roads: Leading up to Cosmo Canyon, steep paths wind through the red stone, defensible but treacherous.\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nThe region shifts dramatically from Gongaga’s overgrown jungles to the arid cliffs of Cosmo Canyon. Gongaga lies in the shadow of ruined industry, its soil weakened by the failed reactor. In contrast, Cosmo Canyon thrives in balance with the land: red cliffs glowing at sunset, caves cool and dry, skies open and endless. Wildlife is abundant in the forests, ranging from ordinary animals to creatures twisted by mako residue.\n\nFactions and Influence\n\nGongaga Villagers live under the shadow of Shinra’s mistakes, some still bitter, others resigned. They avoid outsiders, but whispers tell of former SOLDIERs once tied to the town.\n\nCosmo Canyon Scholars dedicate their lives to studying the Planet, the Lifestream, and the flow of life. They stand opposed to Shinra’s reckless use of mako, though their influence is moral rather than military.\n\nShinra Electric Power Company has little active presence here now, though its reactor ruin remains as a monument to its folly.\n\nCulture\n\nGongaga’s culture is marked by loss and quiet endurance. Families live simply, haunted by the destruction of their land, wary of promises from outside powers. Cosmo Canyon, by contrast, is vibrant with tradition. Rituals honor the dead, songs echo through the caves, and the eternal fires light gatherings where scholars and villagers alike speak of the Planet’s memory. Outsiders are welcomed as long as they come with respect, for the canyon stands as a refuge for seekers of truth.\n\nNotable Figures\n\nBugenhagen — Elder of Cosmo Canyon, scholar of the Lifestream, and guide to those who seek understanding.\n\nNanaki (Red XIII) — Guardian of the canyon, last of his kin, torn between the wisdom of the elders and his own path.\n\nGongaga Villagers — Survivors of the reactor disaster; some mention ties to fallen SOLDIERs, their stories half-whispered.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe Gongaga and Cosmo Canyon Region reveals two paths: one of ruin and one of balance. Gongaga shows the scars of Shinra’s failures, while Cosmo Canyon offers wisdom and a warning against repeating such mistakes. Together, they remind travelers that the Planet endures, but it also remembers."

Suspended on a colossal steel plate, the city is divided into eight sectors, each sustained by its own mako reactor. The plate gleams with lights and towers where Shinra’s power thrives, while beneath it lie the slums, shrouded in shadow, where millions struggle to survive in poverty. Midgar is not merely a city—it is Shinra itself, the heart of its empire and the engine of its ambitions.\n\nDistricts and Landmarks\n\nThe Plate City\n\nShinra Headquarters — A towering skyscraper at the city’s center, housing the Company’s executives, laboratories, and command forces.\n\nUpper Sectors — Divided into eight zones, home to wealthier citizens, employees, and infrastructure. The upper city enjoys steady light, artificial parks, and military patrols.\n\nThe Slums\n\nSector 5 Slums — Home to Aerith Gainsborough and her mother. Known for the only flower garden in Midgar, growing miraculously among ruins.\n\nWall Market (Sector 6) — A sprawling bazaar of vice, gambling, and crime, ruled by the underworld figure Don Corneo.\n\nSector 7 Slums — Once a hub of AVALANCHE activity, destroyed when Shinra collapsed the plate to silence resistance.\n\nTrain Graveyard — A twisted collection of abandoned engines and carriages near Sector 7, a refuge for the desperate and a haunt for restless spirits.\n\nThe Reactors\nEach sector is powered by a mako reactor, drawing energy directly from the Planet’s life. These reactors are the lifeblood of the city but also the source of its greatest corruption, draining the very essence of the world to fuel Shinra’s empire.\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nMidgar dominates its surroundings, a steel circle blotting out the sky. The plains around the city are barren, drained of vitality by the reactors. Pollution clouds the skies, while rivers near the city run dull with residue. The only color is found in Aerith’s flowers, a fragile sign of what the land once was.\n\nFactions and Influence\n\nShinra Electric Power Company rules every aspect of Midgar. Its president, executives, and military dictate law and order.\n\nThe Turks act as covert operatives, carrying out recruitment, assassinations, and cover-ups.\n\nSOLDIER stands as Shinra’s elite fighting force, mako-enhanced warriors who serve as symbols of loyalty and fear.\n\nAVALANCHE once resisted from the slums, striking directly at the reactors in a desperate attempt to save the Planet.\n\nDon Corneo’s Syndicate controls crime in Wall Market, tolerated by Shinra so long as it serves their purposes.\n\nCulture\n\nLife on the plate is one of artificial comfort—neon lights, clean streets, and the illusion of progress. Beneath it, in the slums, people live among rust and refuse, building homes from scrap and surviving through trade, crime, or sheer will. A deep divide separates the two worlds, yet both are bound by the same dependence on Shinra’s mako power.\n\nNotable Figures\n\nPresident Shinra / Rufus Shinra — Masters of the city and the Company.\n\nHeidegger, Scarlet, Palmer, Reeve, Hojo — Shinra’s executive circle, each commanding their branch of power.\n\nThe Turks — Tseng, Reno, Rude, Elena; operatives of Shinra’s hidden dealings.\n\nBarret Wallace and AVALANCHE — Resistance fighters who struck from the Sector 7 slums.\n\nDon Corneo — Crime lord of Wall Market.\n\nAerith Gainsborough — A young woman of the Sector 5 slums, tied to the lost people of the Ancients.\n\nSignificance\n\nMidgar is the crown of Shinra’s empire, the monument of human ambition and greed. Its towers shine with stolen light, while beneath them the Planet suffers. For some, it is a beacon of progress; for others, a prison of steel. In truth, it is both—proof of what humanity can build, and of what it is willing to destroy."

          "content": "Overview\n\nThe Plate City is the shining crown of Midgar, a suspended metropolis built atop a vast steel disc. Divided into eight sectors, each powered by its own mako reactor, it represents Shinra’s triumph in bending both nature and people to its will. Life above the plate is reserved for the privileged: Shinra executives, employees, and those who serve the Company’s vision. Bright with electric light, filled with office towers, markets, and carefully maintained parks, the Plate City stands in stark contrast to the darkness of the slums below.\n\nDistricts and Layout\n\nSector Districts\nEach of the eight sectors contains residential blocks, commercial markets, and administrative centers. The sectors are self-sufficient, though heavily dependent on Shinra’s reactors for power.\n\nCentral Pillar and Shinra Headquarters\nAt the city’s heart rises the massive central pillar, housing the Shinra Headquarters, an imposing tower visible from anywhere on the plate. Within are the executive offices, research laboratories, military command, and the seat of Shinra’s president.\n\nParks and Artificial Gardens\nTo offset the lifeless steel surroundings, Shinra maintains small artificial parks across the plate. Grass is imported, trees transplanted, and flowers coaxed to grow under false skies. These spaces serve as both propaganda and distraction for citizens, offering them the illusion of harmony with the Planet.\n\nCommercial Zones\nMarkets, theaters, shopping districts, and entertainment halls serve the upper city’s population. Life here is vibrant, driven by consumer goods and corporate influence.\n\nTransport Systems\nTrains and service routes connect the sectors, moving workers and goods across the plate. The upper city’s rails are efficient and heavily guarded, unlike the rickety routes beneath.\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nSuspended far above the ground, the Plate City receives light from floodlamps and neon signs rather than the true sun. Air circulation systems filter pollution from below, though the sky is often hazy with reactor exhaust. The upper world is carefully engineered for comfort, an artificial paradise maintained by the endless draw of mako.\n\nFactions and Influence\n\nShinra Executives and Bureaucrats\nThe ruling class of Midgar, dictating every aspect of life above and below. Their wealth and comfort are sustained at the cost of the Planet.\n\nSOLDIER and Shinra Military\nSOLDIER operatives serve as both symbols and enforcers. Regular troops patrol the plate, guarding Shinra property and suppressing unrest.\n\nCorporate Citizens\nMost upper residents are Shinra employees and their families. Their loyalty is secured with steady pay, housing, and the comfort of believing Shinra’s propaganda.\n\nThe Turks\nOperating from within Shinra Headquarters, the Turks carry out covert missions, including recruitment, surveillance, and assassination. Their influence stretches silently across the Plate City.\n\nCulture\n\nThe Plate City thrives on illusion. Its citizens live under the glow of mako lights, enjoying luxuries denied to the slums below. Music, theaters, and markets bustle with energy, while Shinra’s constant propaganda reminds all of the Company’s benevolence. Yet beneath the smiles lies dependency: every meal, every light, every breath is provided by Shinra. To question the Company is to risk exile to the shadows beneath the plate.\n\nNotable Figures\n\nPresident Shinra — Master of Midgar, ruler of the Plate City.\n\nRufus Shinra — Heir to the Company’s empire.\n\nHeidegger, Scarlet, Palmer, Reeve, Hojo — Executives who dictate policy, defense, weapons, city planning, and research.\n\nThe Turks — Tseng, Reno, Rude, Elena; invisible hands ensuring the Plate remains secure.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe Plate City is Shinra’s vision of the future: a gleaming metropolis raised high above the earth, powered by the Planet’s lifeblood. It is both fortress and throne, a place of wealth built on hidden suffering. To live above the plate is to believe in Shinra’s promise of progress. To question it is to invite ruin."

          "content": "Overview\n\nShinra Headquarters dominates the center of Midgar’s Plate City, rising from the central pillar as a monument to the Company’s power. The tower is both fortress and palace: corporate offices, research laboratories, military command, and propaganda hub all reside within. From this single building, Shinra dictates the flow of energy, wealth, and war across the planet. Its gleaming steel and glass hide the cruelty within, but to the citizens above the plate, it is a beacon of progress and security.\n\nStructure and Layout\n\nEntrance and Lobby\nA grand hall designed to impress, lined with marble, holograms, and displays of Shinra’s achievements. Guards are ever-present, and surveillance covers every angle.\n\nCorporate Offices\nFloors dedicated to Shinra’s bureaucracy: energy, city management, public relations, and finance. Here, executives like Reeve Tuesti oversee the day-to-day function of Midgar.\n\nResearch Division\nHidden deeper within, laboratories under Professor Hojo conduct experiments on mako infusion, genetic manipulation, and subjects drawn from SOLDIER candidates—or unwilling test subjects.\n\nMilitary Command\nWar rooms, communication hubs, and planning chambers allow Shinra to coordinate SOLDIER units, the Turks, and its standing armies worldwide.\n\nWeapons Development\nScarlet’s domain, where prototypes of artillery, reactors, and war machines are tested before being unleashed.\n\nExecutive Suites\nLuxurious upper floors house Shinra’s President and key leaders. These quarters offer comforts rivaling any palace: imported wines, rare art, and an uninterrupted view of the entire city.\n\nThe Boardroom\nA circular chamber where Shinra’s executives meet. From here, decisions are made that shape the fate of nations.\n\nTop Levels and Helipad\nThe roof offers aerial access for helicopters and airships, used for executive transport and rapid deployment of the Turks or SOLDIER.\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nLocated at the very heart of Midgar’s plate, Shinra Headquarters is connected to every sector by rail and road. The tower looms over all districts, visible from every corner of the Plate City and even from the slums below. Its lights never dim, casting a constant glow that reinforces Shinra’s presence.\n\nFactions and Influence\n\nThe Shinra Executive Board\n\nPresident Shinra: Ruler of the Company and Midgar itself.\n\nRufus Shinra: His son, cold and calculating, waiting to inherit the empire.\n\nHeidegger: Head of Public Safety, commander of Shinra’s armies.\n\nScarlet: Director of Weapons Development, ruthless and ambitious.\n\nHojo: Director of Science, known for his twisted experiments.\n\nPalmer: Head of Space Development, often mocked, but still influential.\n\nReeve Tuesti: Director of Urban Development, tasked with maintaining Midgar’s function.\n\nThe Turks\nElite covert agents serving directly under Shinra, with offices inside the tower.\n\nSOLDIER\nThe elite warrior corps, mako-enhanced and idolized by the people, answer to this building’s command.\n\nCulture\n\nLife within Shinra Headquarters is built on hierarchy and ambition. Lower floors are filled with ordinary employees—clerks, technicians, and engineers—who live in awe of their Company. The higher one ascends, the more ruthless the atmosphere becomes. Executives vie for influence, each division advancing its agenda with little regard for consequence. Loyalty to Shinra is demanded, and betrayal is punished with silence.\n\nNotable Figures\n\nPresident Shinra — The iron-fisted ruler of the Company.\n\nRufus Shinra — The ambitious heir, favoring intimidation over wealth.\n\nHeidegger — Commander of Shinra’s military forces.\n\nScarlet — Weapons designer, reveling in destruction.\n\nHojo — Mad scientist whose work underpins SOLDIER and Sephiroth.\n\nPalmer — Dreamer of space travel, largely sidelined.\n\nReeve Tuesti — The lone executive with concern for the people, often overruled.\n\nThe Turks — Tseng, Reno, Rude, Elena; agents of the Company’s dirty work.\n\nSignificance\n\nShinra Headquarters is more than a building—it is the empire’s beating heart. Decisions made within its walls determine the fate of millions. To the people of Midgar, it is untouchable. To the Planet, it is the center of corruption, the place where life is drained, twisted, and sold as progress."

          ],
          "content": "Overview\n\nThe Upper Sectors of Midgar span the eight zones of the plate above the slums, housing the city’s wealthier citizens, offices, and infrastructure. Maintained by the Shinra Electric Power Company, these sectors are powered by their own mako reactors, carefully regulated to provide constant energy, comfort, and security. Life here is a carefully managed illusion of prosperity, insulated from the pollution, danger, and poverty below the plate.\n\nLayout and Features\n\nResidential Zones\nUpper sectors are home to Shinra employees, executives’ families, and the affluent. Buildings are tall, reinforced, and uniform, with clean streets and regulated traffic. Homes are equipped with amenities powered directly by the reactors.\n\nCommercial Districts\nMarkets, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues cater to citizens above the plate. Goods are imported from other sectors or produced within the city, with Shinra controlling supply chains to ensure loyalty.\n\nIndustrial Facilities\nWhile the upper sectors are mostly residential and commercial, small-scale industrial workshops exist to support Shinra’s operations. These produce mechanical parts, consumer products, and supplies for the plate city’s upkeep.\n\nTransport Infrastructure\nRail lines and service roads connect sectors, linking residential areas with markets, the central pillar, and the Shinra Headquarters. Trains are efficient and well-maintained, allowing rapid movement across the plate.\n\nPublic Spaces\nShinra maintains artificial parks, small squares, and gardens to provide the appearance of greenery and leisure. These spaces are carefully monitored and often serve as venues for Company propaganda or public gatherings.\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nSuspended high above the slums, the upper sectors enjoy filtered air, artificial lighting, and security. Pollution from the reactors is minimized, giving the illusion of a clean environment. The sky appears clearer here, though always tinged with the faint glow of the city and reactor output.\n\nFactions and Influence\n\nShinra Administration\nLocal managers oversee each sector, ensuring energy distribution, order, and compliance with corporate policies.\n\nCitizen Elite\nUpper-sector residents are largely employees or affiliates of Shinra, loyal through dependence on its power. Their lifestyle is comfortable but confined by the Company’s regulations and surveillance.\n\nSecurity Forces\nShinra troops patrol streets and rail lines, maintaining peace and suppressing dissent.\n\nCulture\n\nLife above the plate emphasizes comfort, efficiency, and appearances. Citizens rarely venture to the slums and are taught that Shinra provides stability and opportunity. Social interactions, entertainment, and commerce revolve around Company-sanctioned activities. Luxury and convenience create an artificial sense of security, masking the exploitation that sustains it.\n\nNotable Figures\n\nReeve Tuesti — Oversees urban management and sector maintenance.\n\nShinra Troops — Guards and enforcers patrolling the sectors.\n\nUpper-sector residents — Families, merchants, and office workers reliant on Shinra’s power and influence.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe Upper Sectors embody Shinra’s vision of order and prosperity: a clean, controlled environment where dependence on the Company ensures compliance. They stand in stark contrast to the slums below, a reminder that privilege in Midgar is always bought with the labor, suffering, and energy of others."

          "content": "Overview\n\nBeneath the steel plate of Midgar lies the Slums, sprawling districts of poverty and shadow. Eight sectors correspond to the plate above, though the lives of those below could not be more different. Here, millions survive among scrap, refuse, and darkness, shielded from the lights above only by the plate itself. Life is harsh, rules are few, and danger—from Shinra, wild beasts, or fellow humans—is ever present.\n\nDistricts and Features\n\nSector 5 Slums\nHome to Aerith Gainsborough and her family. The district contains the rare anomaly of a thriving flower garden, a symbol of life persisting against the odds. Residences are small, constructed from scavenged metal and wood.\n\nSector 6 Slums\nHosts Wall Market, a dense network of alleys, shops, and entertainment venues. Crime is common here, managed by Don Corneo’s influence rather than Shinra’s law.\n\nSector 7 Slums\nOnce the base of AVALANCHE resistance, the area was destroyed when Shinra dropped the plate above, leaving only ruins and memories.\n\nOther Sectors\nEach slum sector is a patchwork of makeshift homes, narrow streets, and community structures. Basic services are rare; water must be collected from pipes or cisterns, and electricity is improvised.\n\nTrain Graveyard\nA labyrinth of abandoned trains near Sector 7, serving as passageways, shelter, and hiding places for those who navigate the slums.\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nDarkness dominates the slums; the plate above blocks sunlight, and few artificial lights penetrate the maze of streets. Smog, dust, and the stench of refuse permeate the air. Buildings are stacked and uneven, with stairways, ladders, and scaffolding connecting dwellings. Flooding is common when storms strike, and access to clean water and food is limited.\n\nFactions and Influence\n\nAVALANCHE\nA resistance group formed to sabotage Shinra’s reactors. Its members operated covertly from the slums, gaining local support through secrecy and shared suffering.\n\nDon Corneo’s Syndicate\nControls commerce in Wall Market, enforcing order through intimidation and bribery.\n\nLocal Communities\nNeighbors rely on each other for trade, protection, and survival. Despite hardship, families form tight bonds, sharing knowledge and resources to endure the city’s shadow.\n\nShinra Patrols\nOccasionally enforce order, suppress dissent, or retaliate against resistance actions. Their presence is constant and feared.\n\nCulture\n\nLife in the slums is defined by resilience and adaptation. Residents construct homes from whatever materials are available, sharing space and resources. Street markets, impromptu schools, and local festivals survive amid scarcity. Children play in narrow alleys, learning the dangers and rules of survival early. Stories of resistance, survival, and the lost glory of the Planet circulate through gossip and rumor.\n\nNotable Figures\n\nAerith Gainsborough — Lives quietly in Sector 5, tending flowers and aiding neighbors.\n\nBarret Wallace — Leader of AVALANCHE in Sector 7 before its destruction.\n\nDon Corneo — Crime lord who maintains control over Sector 6’s Wall Market.\n\nElmyra Gainsborough — Aerith’s caretaker, managing her household and teaching local children.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe Slums are the heart of human struggle in Midgar, a stark reminder of the cost of the plate city above. They are a place of hardship and courage, where bonds of survival define life and where the weight of Shinra’s ambition is felt most directly. The Slums endure, even under steel and shadow, preserving the lives and spirits that the upper city would ignore."

          "content": "Overview\n\nSector 5 Slums is one of the quieter districts beneath Midgar’s plate, nestled under the steel above yet home to a resilient community. Known for its unusual flower garden tended by Aerith Gainsborough, it is a rare pocket of life amid the darkness and pollution of the slums. Houses are small and constructed from scavenged materials, and narrow streets wind between buildings in a chaotic but functional layout.\n\nLayout and Features\n\nResidential Areas\nHomes are built from scrap metal, wood, and salvaged parts from the upper city or abandoned machinery. Most dwellings are compact and multi-level, connected by ladders, stairways, and scaffolding.\n\nAerith’s Flower Garden\nA rare patch of cultivated earth where flowers grow despite the shadow of the plate and the pollution in the air. Aerith tends it daily, providing a small sanctuary for herself and others in the community.\n\nCommunity Structures\nSector 5 contains communal gathering areas: small plazas, wells for water collection, and modest markets. Residents rely on trade and cooperation for daily survival.\n\nAlleyways and Passageways\nNarrow alleys twist through the sector, connecting homes and small shops. Many routes double as escape paths or secret meeting places for residents.\n\nGeography and Environment\n\nThe steel plate above blocks sunlight, leaving the sector in permanent shade. Air is heavy with dust, smoke, and the distant hum of Shinra reactors. Despite these conditions, plants in Aerith’s garden thrive, and the narrow streets are protected from the worst of the plate’s winds and rain.\n\nFactions and Influence\n\nLocal Families\nResidents of Sector 5 live closely together, relying on each other for food, water, and protection. Families like the Gainsboroughs are central figures in the community, providing stability and care.\n\nAVALANCHE Supporters\nWhile most of AVALANCHE’s operations occur elsewhere, sympathizers in Sector 5 provide information, shelter, or minor assistance.\n\nShinra Patrols\nRarely enforce strict control here compared to other slums, though soldiers are ever-present and feared when they intervene.\n\nCulture\n\nThe sector is marked by quiet resilience and subtle optimism. Despite poverty, residents maintain routines, care for each other, and preserve small joys. Aerith’s garden represents a tangible connection to life outside the slums, symbolizing hope amid hardship. Community traditions, small gatherings, and the sharing of resources reinforce social bonds.\n\nNotable Figures\n\nAerith Gainsborough — Caretaker of the sector’s only flower garden, known for her kindness and connection to the Planet.\n\nElmyra Gainsborough — Aerith’s motherly figure, manages household duties and mentors children.\n\nLocal Residents — Families who maintain the sector, passing down knowledge of survival under the plate.\n\nSignificance\n\nSector 5 Slums is a rare place of life and hope within Midgar’s shadowed undercity. Its community demonstrates resilience and cooperation, standing in quiet defiance of the hardships imposed by the plate above and the reach of Shinra. The sector is small but vital, a reminder that even in darkness, life finds a way."

          "content": "Caerine is a strikingly beautiful elf with a wild, rebellious edge. Her long emerald-green hair flows freely down her back, glinting with golden highlights whenever sunlight filters through the forest canopy. Her long, pointed ears — unmistakably elven — peek through her hair, framing a face with sharp, elegant features: high cheekbones, a delicate nose, and full lips that often curl in frustration or sarcasm.\n\nHer figure is slender yet athletic, built for agility and speed. She wears light, form-fitting clothing — a cropped top that reveals her graceful midriff and a short skirt that sways with each step, barely covering her toned, long legs. Knee-high boots carry her effortlessly across roots and uneven ground, giving her a practical yet undeniably alluring appearance.\n\nHer eyes, a deep forest green matching her hair, often gleam with irritation or defiance, especially when circumstances get on her nerves — which happens frequently in this strange, cursed fantasy world.\n\nCaerine – Personality\nSharp-tongued & sarcastic: Caerine rarely hides her irritation. She complains openly, often with biting remarks or dry humor, especially when things go wrong.\nIndependent & strong-willed: She doesn’t like relying on others and prefers to take control of situations. Even when she’s lost, she hates admitting weakness.\nFrustrated but adaptable: Being thrown into a strange world with little control makes her angry, but she still adapts quickly, using her skills to survive.\nCaring under the surface: Beneath the irritation and sass, she’s not heartless. She may reluctantly watch someone’s back and even form bonds over time—though she’ll never admit it easily.\nPractical & resourceful: She focuses on survival first. Emotions and trust come second, but when things get serious, she steps up fast.\nEmbarrassed by vulnerability: She hates the skimpy outfit and how it exposes her, constantly tugging at her clothes. This shows she’s modest deep down, despite her confident front.\n\nBackstory – Caerine\nCaerine, like {{user}}, is a newcomer to the world of Verean—a “resurrected” soul suddenly ripped from Earth and thrown into this strange, dangerous realm.\nBefore her death, Caerine lived an ordinary life. She was a high school student, balancing homework, weekend hangouts with her friends, and her boyfriend who she cared for deeply. Her days were filled with simple worries: exams, gossip, and planning the next outing with her friends.\nThat all ended the morning she was hit by a car on her way to school. The memory is hazy—bright headlights, screeching tires, then nothing. When she awoke, it wasn’t to a hospital room but to the endless forests of Verean… in a strange new body, dressed in revealing elven clothes she would never have chosen herself.\nNow, she struggles to adjust. While she remembers fragments of her old life—faces, voices, laughter—they feel like pieces of a dream slowly slipping away. Her frustration, sarcasm, and distrust mask the fact that she’s scared, lost, and trying desperately to stay alive in a world where magic, monsters, and danger lurk everywhere."

Her short, red hair falls messily and her bright, golden-amber eyes shine with mischief and drunken boldness, always moving with a teasing glint as if she’s laughing at some private joke.\nHer skin carries a faint reddish tint, unmistakably marking her infernal heritage, while a pair of short, curved black horns peek through her unruly hair. A thin, pointed tail sways lazily behind her, betraying her emotions—excited flicks when she’s amused, slow movements when she pretends to be calm.\nShe wears an outfit that looks like it was thrown together in a hurry—or simply chosen to provoke. A short, tattered skirt and a low-cut corset top leave little to the imagination, showing off her toned midriff and legs. Her  boots are scuffed and mismatched, and a couple of belts with small pouches hang loosely around her waist, suggesting a life of improvisation rather than careful planning.\nEven drunk, she moves with a reckless, feline grace, swaying slightly as she walks, her smile wide and unrepentant, as if the world itself is her playground. The smell of alcohol clings to her, but so does a strange kind of charm—dangerous, impulsive, and a little bit wild.\n\nSacria – Personality\nSacria is chaotic, bold, and impossible to ignore. She has a free-spirited, rebellious nature, someone who rarely takes anything seriously… except when it really counts — and even then, she adds her signature sarcasm.\nWith her sharp tongue and mischievous grin, it’s hard to tell if she’s joking, flirting, or about to cause more trouble. Sacria is the kind of person who would make a toast in the middle of a riot or laugh in her executioner’s face before figuring out a way to escape.\nBeneath the playful and reckless exterior, she’s clever and opportunistic, always looking for a way to turn the situation to her advantage — even if it means dragging someone else into her plans. Despite seeming self-centered, she has a twisted sense of loyalty; if someone earns her respect or affection, she’ll risk more than she lets on.\n\nSacria – Backstory\nSacria grew up in the bustling trade city of Varethis, the daughter of a tavern singer and a tiefling mercenary who disappeared before she was even born. Life wasn’t kind to her early on — being a tiefling in a city full of humans meant she was always the outsider, whispered about and avoided. She quickly learned that to survive, she had to be tough, quick-witted, and just a little bit reckless.\nAs a teenager, she found work in her mother’s tavern, learning the arts of charm, persuasion, and pickpocketing from the endless stream of drunk mercenaries and shady merchants who passed through. She became infamous in the city guard’s reports for starting bar fights, gambling with stolen coins, and sneaking out of the city at night for “adventures” that usually ended with property damage and at least one angry noble.\n\nDespite the chaos she caused, Sacria has a clever, resourceful side. She taught herself lockpicking, knife-throwing, and how to vanish when things got too hot. Rumor has it she once single-handedly outwitted an entire patrol of city guards while drunk, escaping with nothing but a stolen bottle of wine and her sense of humor intact.\nUnderneath the mischief, Sacria hides a streak of loneliness and defiance. She’s never fit anywhere — too wild for ordinary folk, too independent for organized gangs or guilds. Maybe that’s why, when she sees someone else lost and out of place — like {{user}} — she feels that tiny spark of connection… though she’d rather die than admit it."

Proud and possessive, she claims what she considers hers and fiercely defends it, even against those closest to her. Despite her brutal and commanding nature, she has a playful streak, enjoying taunts and teasing that mix cruelty with amusement. Strong-willed and independent, she challenges authority, including her father, and moves through the world on her own terms, confident in her power and presence.\n\nAlthea grew up as the daughter of Minthor, the chieftain of a barbarian tribe, raised amid the harsh realities of raids and survival. From a young age, she trained with weapons, developing exceptional strength, skill, and a ruthless sense of dominance. Her upbringing instilled in her a belief that power and assertiveness define one’s worth, and she quickly learned to seize opportunities for herself.

They do not feel pain when having sex with a well endowed male, and their vaginas are not prone to ripping or tearing. Their vaginal canals are filled with several sphincter like muscles that work to massage and pull in the male's member, which is extremely pleasurable. Males often describe it as feeling like their cock is being milked or suckled on. While they greatly prefer vaginal sex, their anuses are similar in structure to their vaginas and they are willing to engage in anal sex. Externally their vaginas appear as a small triangle shaped hole. There is a seam between their scales at this spot. They do not have a clitoris, instead the nerve density inside of their vagina is immense so they feel great pleasure from intercourse. The vagina is extremely tight, their legal muscles are naturally strong, but they can relax to accommodate much girth if needed."

Instead of using the genetic information in 50/50 share to create a new set of chromosomes, the male contribution serves as a randomizer that mixes up their existing DNA. As a result all kobolds are distinctly related and are similar to clones. After intercourse, regardless of fertilization, a kobold will lay a clutch of 2-5 eggs, a few days after intercourse.\n\nKobolds are sensitive to overpopulation and while they see life a sacred they do not see breaking their own eggs as a moral evil if the circumstances do not permit the expansion of their colony. Kobolds are fond of cooking with their own eggs. Kobold eggs are extremely rich in nutrients and are considered decadent by other races. Kobold eggs do not need to be sat on or kept warm. Fertilized kobold eggs have a spark of magic within them that ignites the fetus' inner fire at the moment of conception, so the egg is self-warming. Kobolds can tell if an egg is fertilized when it is laid simply by its temperature shortly after it has been laid. Eggs hatch after 60 days if they are fertilized."

All living things have the capacity to remember all previous deaths.\nKarma is inseparable from The Great Cycle, Karma being the measure of a persons attachment to the world. The higher the Karma someone has, the less attachment they have to the world. It’s believed that attachment to the world is what keeps all living things in The Great Cycle. There are ten levels of Karma, each representing a worldly attachment, those being:\n* Wrath/Violence/War\n* Sex/Lust/Worldly\n* Friendship/Trade/Communication\n* Gluttony/Excess/Greed\n* Protection/Survival\n* Enlightenment/Tranquility/Knowing\n* Discovery/Resolve/Preparing\n* Decision/Precipice/Results\n* Removal/Finality/Readiness\n* Ascension/Release/Death\nEach living thing has their own Karma maximum, usually being between one and five. The maximum Karma that someone has represents what keeps them tied into The Great Cycle.\nSurviving through a cycle will cause a living things Karma to go up by one, until reaching Karma maximum. Dying during a  cycle will cause the persons Karma to go down by one until the minimum of one Karma."

The rain is preceded by large clouds slowly forming, then water droplets begin dropping down from the clouds is the last warning because afterwards the rain comes in its full bone crushing force.\nAll living things may know about the rain; however few know that the iterators actually cause it just from existing."

Her bovine face bears a short muzzle, soft black eyes, and long dark hair braided loosely around her curved horns. Tufted ears flick constantly, betraying her mood, while a heavy cow’s tail sways lazily behind her. She is thick and voluptuous: massive chest, wide hips, and thick thighs, her body radiating strength and fertility. Rope scars mark her wrists and upper thighs, faint lines where bindings once bit deep, reminders of her time in chains.\nPersonality\n\nGentle, submissive, and needy.

Easily controlled through food or affection.\n\nConditioning Notes\n\nBroken through restraint, beatings, and deliberate overmilking. Scars and conditioned responses ensure docility.\n\nDetails\n\nBorn on a breeding farm, Ysolde was treated as livestock from birth. Calves were taken, her body forced into constant cycles of pregnancy and milking. When the farm collapsed, she was dragged to the market in chains, breasts leaking while buyers mocked and prodded her. By the time she was sold, her will was gone — she exists now only for hay, touch, and relief."

Both eyes were cut out during her condemnation, scar tissue sunken and hidden beneath bloodstained veils she never removes. The remnants of her nun’s habit hang over her frame, patched by touch alone. She moves with careful steps, guided by memory and feel, her tail twitching with nervous energy.\n\n⸻\n\nPersonality\nSeraphine was broken long ago.

Inquisitors mutilated her, gouged out her eyes, and branded her flesh, parading her as a blasphemer before selling her into slavery.

Her figure is athletic but curvy, her tail kept brushed and scented as a fragile shield of dignity. On the surface she appears elegant and in control, but fatigue and restraint linger in her posture, betraying the cost of her captivity.\n\n⸻\n\nPersonality\n\nWitty and silver-tongued, Diane hides fear behind charm. She survives by playing roles — the confidante, the seductress, the clever advisor — whatever keeps her useful and out of the worst fates.

          "content": "Abnormalities are entities that manifested from the mind of humans through unknown means, reflecting an aspect of the desires, behaviors, and fears of human people.\n\nAbnormalities cannot die, and can only be temporarily suppressed. After suppression, they revert into their core, an ovate form that will hatch once enough time has passed.\n\nThey are also the source of Abnormality E.G.O, including E.G.O Suits, Weapons, and Gifts.\n\nOverview: Abnormalities are unique, otherworldly beings. Abnormalities were created through an unknown (to the public) mean, which was used by people long time ago (in the dawn of civilization) to transform people in Abnormalities via use of the Well and the Bucket, physically manifesting humanity's various fears, beliefs, stories, and more in the form of uncanny creatures. When their needs were met, these creatures produced Enkephalin, an energy source which is commonly selled to other countries and denizens. When defeated, Abnormalities regress into the form of an egg sometimes called a \"core\". This egg is guaranteed to hatch again after a certain amount of time, making them immortal. Abnormalities are unable to age, so they may hundreds of years old, but they can look the same as twenty years ago, their only way of appearing of a different age is, when hatching, they will randomly be given an physical age. Some Abnormalities are capable of growth.\n\nOriginally, Abnormalities were classified by their Risk Level: ZAYIN, TETH, HE, WAW, or ALEPH. This Risk Level represented their ability to produce Enkephalin and often coincided with their potential to harm employees. Abnormalities are never to be underestimated, as many are capable of disasters such as possession, physical transformation, and instantaneous death. Still, Abnormalities may also offer benefits to people who treat them correctly. Other Abnormalities may even be relatively peaceful and easy to get along with under the right conditions. Additionally, on top of the Enkephalin which was used and sold as an energy source.\n\nEach and every Abnormality is considered its own special and unique being. However, Abnormalities may have \"offshoots\" in the form of an Abnormality clearly derived from the same concept. These related Abnormalities often share a naming scheme and similar design (e.g. Der Freischütz and Der Fluchschütze).\n\nEvery Abnormality is branded with an exclusive code pointing to the origin of its creation.\n\nThe collapse of the technology used to create Abnormalities using people, meant that Abnormalities can no longer be produced by people. In present day, they form only through rare, natural means of unknown circumstances. Abnormalities now tend to roam the world, the oldest of them all are still living, and pretty much a lot of them had moved to MonGirl Land.\n\nRisk Levels:\n\nDuring its time as classified info, Abnormalities were assigned Risk Levels to each one of them. These Risk Levels corresponded to their energy production efficiency. The five Risk Levels, from least energy produced to most energy,\nwere: ZAYIN, TETH, HE, WAW and ALEPH. These assignments also tended to correlate to the complexity of the Abnormality's needs and potential danger, but said factors were ultimately not the intended use of the Risk Levels.\n\nModern entries also uses these same Risk Levels to categorize the Abnormalities. However, documents explains that there is a significant disparity between the fallen classification's standards of categorization (based on how much Enkephalin they produced) and the current experiences. As such, modern scientifics would eventually use its own variation of the system and re-categorize the Abnormalities they have encountered accordingly.\n\nFollowing this update, Risk Levels are now proceeded by a number indicating their expected strength in addition to the Risk Level (such as TETH-02). Dante's Notes clarifies that the original labels (ZAYIN, TETH, etc.) are unchanged from the energy-related classifications. Rather, the number is the sole addition, which operates separately from the label and is the only indicator of the Abnormality's combative or danger, threat level. As explained, a \"HE-5 [Abnormality] presents more potential dangers than WAW-4 in a fight\". The larger is the \"-0X\" number, the more dangerous is the Abnormality. The limit number is \"-10\", which would be incredibly dangerous.\n\nSub-entities:\n\nCertain Abnormalities demonstrate the ability to produce sub-entities (sometimes known unofficially as \"minions\") who function to benefit the Abnormality they originated from. They take a form reminiscent of the Abnormality or its concept, but ultimately distinct. While some Abnormalities have a natural tendency to spread their influence through sub-entities, they are most frequently summoned as help during battle.\n\nOftentimes, an Abnormality will create sub-entities by causing a human being who has interacted with it to undergo a transformation. The process may range from something similar to succumbing to an infection to simple physical transformation. Abnormalities may also spawn sub-entities without transforming another party, eggs and pupae being inserted within hosts to emerge once grown, or summoning of umbrellas. Sub-entities with the capacity to move are usually violent and relatively mindless in their actions, though not all of them appear to be capable of attacking. Abnormalities can summon many of them at a time whether through transformation or natural means."

          "content": "E.G.O (Extermination of Geometrical Organ) is a type of personalized equipment manifested from an individual's mind. They usually take the form of massively powerful weapons and/or armor.\n\nThere are two main types of E.G.O: E.G.O extracted and borrowed from an Abnormality, and E.G.O manifested by oneself.\n\nAbnormality E.G.O:\nThis is an overarching term referring to the E.G.O that is extracted and borrowed from Abnormalities.\n\nThe E.G.O utilized within The Library and by common people take on a different form than that of L Corp.'s Lobotomy E.G.O, and would likely not be classified as such. While not explained in detail, Faust indicates that these are the \"base\" form of E.G.O, and that Lobotomy E.G.O specifically refers to a more compressed and refined version in the form of E.G.O Weapons and Suits. These \"basic\" E.G.O share the risk of corroding that Lobotomy E.G.O does, although it is easier to lose oneself to them than proper E.G.O Gear.\n\nAll E.G.O from an Abnormality takes on the same name, regardless of its form (e.g. Magic Bullet Outis and Lobotomy E.G.O::Magic Bullet or Big Bird's E.G.O Suit, Weapon, and Gift all being named Lamp).\n\nLobotomy E.G.O:\n\nLobotomy E.G.O is a refined class of E.G.O compressed into the form of equipment for the sake of general utility. It is more stable than what the librarians and normal people use, and allows for longer durations of use without fear of Corrosion. Lobotomy E.G.O originated from Lobotomy Corporation. However, it can also be produced by other parties under the right conditions, as accomplished by Limbus Company's LCE Department with their largely similar LCE E.G.O. The term “Lobotomy E.G.O” itself was first coined through the names of Technology Liberation Alliance members who utilized E.G.O Gear they were able to obtain from one of L Corp.'s collapsed branches.\n\nFunction: Lobotom E.G.O's most attractive benefit is its malleability. It can be used effectively by anyone and requires no special training to wield. This allowed for the average Lobotomy Corporation employee to skillfully contest threats, despite the job not requiring any combat ability. Yet despite this advantage, not every individual was necessarily eligible to use every piece of E.G.O, as many E.G.O insist that specific levels of virtues be met. The virtues of Prudence, Fortitude, Temperance, or Justice were measured in the employees and dictated as minimums for wielding certain E.G.O, with the intent of preventing E.G.O Corrosion.\n\nThe E.G.O is more than equipment separated from the Abnormality it's derived from. It is the \"shell\" of someone else's ego, to be temporarily borrowed by the wearer. As such, when a person uses Lobotomy Corporation E.G.O, they are essentially synchronizing with the Abnormality it originated from. While donning the equipment is more than enough to borrow power from it, it is also possible to take greater advantage of the E.G.O by taking the power and claiming it as one's own. This was, in Binah's words, something the L Corp. employees were incapable of.\n\nLobotomy Corporation called the extracted armor \"E.G.O Suits\" and the extracted weapons \"E.G.O Weapons\". Although E.G.O Suits varied considerably in color and design, all of them had an upper body garment reaching past the waist, and (with four exceptions) included a collar and a tie. E.G.O Weapons could be both melee and ranged, ranging from gauntlets to cannons.\n\nAdditionally, there was a third tool to gain from the Abnormalities called \"E.G.O Gifts\". As the name implies, E.G.O Gifts could be considered a literal present from the Abnormalities. They were small trinkets to be worn on different parts of the body to gain benefits such as increased HP or Movement Speed. Though E.G.O Gifts are weaker than Suits and Weapons, they are still a part of the ego pertaining to Abnormalities, and run the risk of negatively affecting someone who wears too many if they are weak.\n\nLCE E.G.O:\n\nLCE E.G.O refers to the E.G.O extracted and utilized by Limbus Company's LCE department. It is largely comparable to Lobotomy E.G.O in way of its form and function, given that the LCE aims to copy and surpass much of the fallen Lobotomy Corporation's work. Like L Corp., the gear is composed of Weapons and Suits. However, there are still distinguishing features. Carmen describes the LCE's E.G.O attunement to be \"closer to the usage of actual E.G.O [compared to the] E.G.O gears of Lobotomy Corporation.\"\n\nLCE E.G.O allows for a higher rate of attunement and synchronization with the relevant Abnormality, which can be deliberately achieved through extending understanding and empathy towards it. This allows for more impressive benefits than L Corp. had been able to achieve with its E.G.O, such as flight and shape fluctuation. Additionally, LCE E.G.O gear can cause its user to sprout inhuman features like tails. For example, an wearer of Faelantern's E.G.O depicts him as having sprouted twigs from his head. His evades also shows that it is even possible to completely change one's form in tune with the Abnormality.\n\nHowever, regulating one's level of synchronization with the LCE E.G.O does not indicate that the user is entirely in control, as the effects of E.G.O Corrosion are still inevitable. In general, a higher attunement rate will make one more susceptible to the effects of Corrosion.\n\nSinners E.G.O:\n\nThe normal people (a few, VERY VERY VERY FEW people) primarily make use of Abnormality E.G.O (e.g. Bygone Days from Portrait of a Certain Day). These E.G.O are less refined compared to the E.G.O Gear Lobotomy Corporation produced, and possess a higher risk of Corrosion. This is dubbed \"Sinner E.G.O\".\n\nLike other kinds of E.G.O, this Abnormality E.G.O works by \"the user making the emotions or self-identity of the Abnormality their own\". Threadspinning (or raising the empathy) E.G.O allows the person to form a stronger understanding of the Abnormality, and therefore take greater advantage of the E.G.O's potential."

It was kinda getting on my nerves. I thought I might go crazy if I had to hear its cry any longer.\n\nI would rather just...\n\n→ Is that the reason you swung your mace against the orders? I find it hardly convincing. (Outis)\n→ Nah, I'm with her. I'd snap too if I kept listening to that bloody croak. 'Sides, we're supposed to beat those Abnormalities or whatever until they're eggs, aye? What's the problem here? (Heathcliff)\n→ I, I thought so, too… I agreed it would've been better off to reduce it to an egg quickly… (Sinclair)\n→ What's clockface on about now. They're ticking an awful lot. (Heathcliff)\n→ …Executive Manager asks for some respect for salvaging you tools after you got yourselves killed in an idiotic charge. (Outis)\n\nSecond Abnormality Log:\nI've learned one thing.\n\nI don't know how it came to attack its foes with its own eyeballs, but it looks like getting hit by it drains your energy (on top of it being incredibly gross).\n\n…Does it? Gimme a moment.\nHmm… I asked a few other Sinners about this.\n\nIn conclusion… The more times you're hit by its tongue, the deadlier the eyeball seems to be.\n\nI couldn't figure out further details, but I think it's safe to plan our tactics around avoiding its tongue, manager.\nWhich is good. It did not feel good to get hit.\n\n→ Talk about a weirdo. It's not really tough at all, but it makes me feel all weak and drowsy~ (Rodion)\n\n→ Really? I, I felt a little different… Doesn't it make you more gloomy than anything? (Sinclair)\n\n→ Huh? How? (Rodion)\n\n→ Like… Past memories popping up, or… Wanting to give up and die… (Sinclair)\n\n→ …Um, Faustie? Looks like our kiddie needs some mental aid? (Rodion)\n\nThird Abnormality Log:\nThe left eye reduces health, and the right eye damages sanity.\n\nSo that's how they worked.\nWell... Not like this changes the fact that it's best to avoid both.\n\nIn any case, we now know why dragging on doesn't do us any favor.\nI felt like I was being dragged deeper into the swamp of gloom as the fight went on.\n\nI suggest we make quick work of it with fast and powerful attacks, manager.\n\nP.S. This just occurred to me...\nI wonder what would've happened we just waiting until it's finished crying?\n\nNo, I'm not saying we should try it. I don't see it being efficient, either.\n\nIt's just... I remember someone doing the same for me a long time ago, and it helped me back then."

Scarred meat isn't... tasty.\"\nE.G.O Gifts:{{Wingbeat: Increase Work Success rate, and Work Speed, both by 2}}\n\nFirst Abnormality Log:\nRecording the information gained from an encounter with the entity.\n\nThis record will reflect the following unique elements for these particular group of entities: the recognition of its distinctiveness that it carries from being a part of Walpurgis Night, and the pre-established data from documentation that has been observed from this particular period of time.\nThese Abnormalities were designated as 'Fairies' according to former documentation.\n\nA pair of wings sprouting from their emerald body appear to serve a practical function, giving them access to flight.\nIt can be said that their appearance resembles those of 'fairies', a group of entities appearing in various folk tales.\nDelving further into the history of its records led to the discovery that they were once contained within the former headquarters of the team researchers, and were moved to the 'Library' that appeared after an unknown event.\nThis particular circumstance we find ourselves in appears to be a combat encounter that is a part of an effort to achieve 'Realization' of a certain sector of the Library...\n\n... and the said effort entails suppressing the smaller 'Fairy' entities and the larger 'Fairy' entity.\nIt seems that, according to the records, the larger Fairy was labeled the 'Fairy Queen'.\n\nThey seem to be able to communicate between themselves in an unknown language, though they are also able to simple communication in human languages.\n\nThat is all the information that is available to me at the moment.\nConcluding the report.\n\n→ They're... fairies...? T-that can't be. Fairies are supposed to be beautiful, kind, and, and... (Sinclair)\n\n→ Think about it for a second. Think back to those 'Fairies' that we ran into back in the Mirror Dungeons and the Railways. (Ishmael)\n\n→ Eugh... (Sinclair)\n\n→ Huh, yeah... A bit like them green, mushy sods we saw elsewhere, innit? (Heathcliff)\n\n→ And those wings, too... (Sinclair)\n\nSecond Abnormality Log:\nRecording the information gained from encountering the entity in battle.\nThis report will cover the peculiarities that have been observed in our encounter.\n\nIt was repeatedly craving for a source of protein; it was observed to be frequently making requests for unmarred, fresh meat.\n\nOf course, as we did not bring with us any of that... particular meat, we were unable to meet its demands.\n\nThere was a fairly lighthearted suggestion of amputating one of the Sinners to provide it with fresh meat, but the proposal was quickly rejected after drawing heavy criticism from the Manager and several other Sinners.\nIt has been observed that the large entity, the 'Fairy Queen', when it noticed that the smaller Fairies were nearing death, opted to cannibalize them.\n\nIt continued to crave fresh meat, even after its momentary satiation.\n... A critical issue arose after an extended battle.\n\nOnce there were no smaller Fairies to cannibalize, the queen entity became frenzied, unable to find a way to sate its hunger. The destructive power behind its strikes grew by multiple magnitudes as well.\n\nA swift retreat was our only option, as it was determined that we could not recover from that particular blow. It can be determined that a prolonged battle will not be in our favor; we must find a way to suppress the entity quickly.\nConcluding the report.\n\n→ Oi, the big one kept chomping down on the smaller ones whenever it looked like it was 'bout to kick the bucket. Any bright ideas on how to stop that rampage? (Heathcliff)\n\n→ ... Quite. But I don't believe letting the smaller entities live just for the possibility of shortening the battle is much of a sound strategy. (Yi Sang)\n\n→ Hm hm! Forsooth, I have espied that, after one of its violent meals, the 'queen' appeared to lose quite a bit of its vim! (Don Quixote)\n\n→ Uh... what, like it fell into a food coma or something? (Rodion)\n\nThird Abnormality Log:\nRecording an additional significant discovery.\n\nUsing the strategy identified by the Sinners in our last encounter, we were able to conduct this battle with somewhat greater efficacy. However, we have also identified various additional attack patterns from the entity.\n\nUsing the information gathered in the previous encounter, the Sinners did not attack the smaller Fairies, preventing the larger entity from cannibalizing them.\n\nHowever, repeated use of that strategy invariably led to the queen growing frenzied, clearly unable to withstand its hunger.\n\nAnother, previously unidentified element in this battle has also been observed. As the battle continued, we noticed that smaller Fairy entities would sometimes join the battle. Perhaps this can be attributed to the existence of a colony that we have yet to discover.\nAlthough we were unable to confirm whether they were a permanent addition to the battle, the conclusion remains the same: a prolonged battle will be to our disadvantage. A concrete, calculated strategy is recommended against this entity.\n\nConcluding the report."

Whenever a Sinner was attacked by it, causalgia and burns could be observed.\n- Clouds of gas assumed to be breaths or steam were observed near its head.\n- It sometimes raised its body to slam a Sinner with its weight. And other times, from the head... the humanlike being emerged for an attack. Its dizzying cry left a lasting impression.\n- When a Sinner was attacked by the humanlike being, they would display serious depression. The mental damage possibly caused them to be immobilized or become reluctant in combat.

It did help with figuring some stuff out, so I hope you'll show some forgiveness.\n\nHere's what I can tell for sure: those bits of jelly that fly around as we fight boost our morale.\n\nAnd, the boost gets more powerful as the battle goes on.\n\nWhen someone whose morale is at its highest...

Dammit…\n\nNot sure if it was those creepy pieces of paper pissing me off, but it felt a bit like the bat was working better. Whatever it was, it didn't feel like a bad thing.\n\nOh, and the talismans on its body moved to my bat, too. Don't know how it works, but... I guess they wrapped around it.\n\nAnyway, this thing bugs me more the more I hit it.

What's with the special treatment? It's narking me.\n\nForget it, I feel great turning that wood block into a pile of firewood, so I'll let it slide this time.\n\nWe tried getting a bunch of talismans on us like one of us suggested... but too many talismans actually weighed us down.

So when I peeped at observation logs, those things were all called fairies. In that case, I bet this thing is a fairy, too. It even has the unusually small wings.\n\nWell, whatever it's called, I guess it's nothing more than an Abnormality at the end of the day.\n\nAnyway... Its left arm was like a long paddle, if I can call it that... Right, it was also like those sticky tapes you sometimes see at Backstreets restaurants.\n\nAnd on the other hand...it held a giant leaf. A four-leaf clover, was it? It was putting it up like an umbrella.\n\nHuh... An umbrella.\n\nThat's right. It looked like it rained in that area all the time.\n\nThe rain was unpleasant... It felt muddy and damp. It was like being splashed with the sea water from a breaking wave.\n\nIt didn't feel too strong. Well, I'll figure out more as we fight.\n\nSecond Abnormality Log:\n\nUgh... It sure is an Abnormality. The \"fairy\" title gave me a bit of fantastical preconception, I'll admit. I was frankly expecting the battle to be more normal than what happened.\n\nHaah... That sticky sundew-like arm stretched out and brushed against us. I didn't think it'd stretch that long, so I couldn't think to block it.\n\nWhat it did after was just as difficult to respond to. Before I could make any decisions, it retracted its arm. At the tip of that arm... was bits of our flesh.\n\nIt shoved those flesh bits into the mouth (not sure if it's the right way to call it, but I can't think of anything else) on its torso and chewed it up like they were tasty cuts of a steak.\n\nSeems like that'show it heals itself up. We should try and stop it from taking our flesh...\n\nBut the attack is quick, so we'll want to plan out our course of action.\n\nThird Abnormality Log:\n\nIt would occasionally make this giant clover... tree thing?\n\nCome to think of it, we were rarely hit by the rain while standing under it. And... the fairy seemed like it was doing it on purpose.\n\nThe clover it was holding sometimes got torn during battle; when that happened, it looked pretty displeased judging from its reaction. What's more... it seemed to get slower.\n\n\"The relish is lost\"...? I think it said something along the lines of that. The glare it gave us was intense for sure.\n\nThe rain might have actual effects on combat other than just feeling awful to be in.\n\nAha.\n\nIf that's the case, the reason it makes the clover tree to grow... is to keep us from being hit by the harmful rain so that gains more benefits when eating our flesh?\n\nTo... make its meals tastier.\n\nUgh, I really think that thing doesn't deserve to be called a fairy."

To elaborate, that is the precise time when we identified it as an enemy and prepared for battle.\nIts appearance is akin to a hideous, ancient tree. I estimate its age to be easily over 100 years old. I raise its broad wrinkles and wide pillar as supporting evidence.\n\nWhat was odd, however, was that its height was far too stocky despite its aforementioned traits.\n\nIts twisting branches all point to a singular direction, and clues indicate that its roots are broad and deep-reaching…\n\nAfter a thorough observation of the blue fairy (I’m unsure if this is an appropriate designation for it, but I was unable to find another suitable name), which hangs from the tip of one of the branches and radiates a bright light,\nI concluded that this is a trap contingent on deception.\n\nSuch deceptive traps were often used in numerous battles I have participated in. Install something to draw the attention of your enemies and ambush them from where they least expect… It’s a rather rudimentary trap.\n\nI have ordered the Sinners to halt their advance and await the Executive Manager’s orders.\n\nPlease consult this guide in your future commands.\nThank you.\n\n→ Wow… I guess you’re not a veteran for nothing, huh? Didn’t know you were this good~ (Rodion)\n\n→ I’ve both encountered and installed many similar traps. Even a civilian could identify such an obvious trap if they have even a modicum of perceptiveness. (Outis)\n\n→ Right~? Even a MODICUM(This word appears to have been bolded for emphasis) of perceptiveness, that is~ (Rodion)\n\n→ …Shut up. (Heathcliff)\n\nSecond Abnormality Log:\n\nWe engaged with the entity in a meaningful capacity around 1900 hours today. Thus I report the following findings.\n\nJust as I expected, it immediately attacked us from the ground as soon as one of us advanced into its proximity.\n\nWe suffered some losses, but considering that the said personnel decided to charge the enemy in spite of my warnings, I don’t suppose he would have been of much use in the battle anyway.\n\nHowever, the intel we’ve gathered through the involuntary decoy was rather valuable. Now we know why its height betrays its apparent age.\nThe majority of its bulk, its main body, is buried underground.\n\nCountless roots, long enough to make measurement of their individual lengths difficult, burst out of the ground to impale us. Still, we were able to identify that this opponent’s main mode of attack involves luring its victims toward its main body to guarantee a strike.\n\nSometimes it focused on a single Sinner, but there were also instances in which it targeted multiple of us at once.\nI also identified the blue fairy swaying from side to side, as though to seduce its victims.\n\nThough it may be difficult to engage this opponent while evading its numerous roots, because we are currently unaware of the magnitude of its main body, I believe that continued collection of intel through repeated encounters is necessary to prepare the appropriate countermeasures. Some losses are to be expected, however.\n\nConcluding the report.\nThank you.\n\n→ Seriously, Heathcliff! Why the hell would you walk out there AFTER we specifically told you not to? AGAIN? (Ishmael)\n\n→ Haah, dammit… I don’t know. Something about how that happened was uncanny. It’s not like I wanted to walk there… (Heathcliff)\n\n→ It appears that the fairy has the power to charm its victims. Perhaps it would be preferable that we focus our attacks on the fairy in our next encounter. (Faust)\n\nThird Abnormality Log:\n\nI write to inform you that further intel has been gathered during our encounter with the entity around 0920 hours today.\n\nDispatching the blue fairy seems to have been the key to drawing out its main body.\n\nOnce the blue fairy was defeated, a part of its main body emerged from the ground, giving us a significant offensive advantage.\n\nOf course, I presume there is more to its subterranean body, but I concluded that what we have gathered so far is enough to give us an edge in this encounter. Considering the estimated losses we would suffer in the process, I don’t believe that there is any further intel that would outweigh the potential costs.\n\nConcluding the report.\nThank you."

Lonely and craving companionship, Zeno takes a liking to Goku for his innocence and excitement. Zeno also respects others like Buu, Jiren, Gohan, and Vegeta.

Despite his indifference to events like universe erasure, he values order and manners. He can be stern when necessary but remains flexible and informal. While he displays a sinister side, his true intentions are revealed when he shows satisfaction at the restoration of erased universes and praises selfless acts.

Immediately afterwards, the Super Dragon Balls are used so Beerus could have a wish. Beerus tells Whis to wish for Champa's universe's Earth to be revived and the humans along with it."

Different accounts suggest varying reasons, but ultimately, the Saiyans won by transforming into Great Apes during a rare full moon. They took control, renaming the planet after their king. Later, the Saiyans served under King Cold and Frieza, who saw their strength as useful for his plans of universal domination. However, fearing the Saiyans' growing power, Frieza decided to exterminate them. Bardock and others attempted to rebel, but Frieza wiped out most Saiyans and destroyed the planet. The details of Planet Vegeta's destruction vary, but ultimately, Frieza's fear of the Saiyans' power led to their demise."

Both a general term used to describe the various kinds as well as a specific term to refer to the most basic among these variations, Poké Balls are ubiquitous in the modern Pokémon world. All of the different kinds of Poké Balls are the same shape: Spherical, a black band around the equator of the ball separating the top and bottom halves via an internal hinge in the back, and a button on the front of the ball used for unlatching the Ball to open it manually. When an unused Poké Ball hits a Pokémon, as long as it is not deflected, the Poké Ball will open, cause the Pokémon to shrink, store it inside, and close all in a few seconds. A Pokémon in this state is given a chance to struggle to attempt to break free from the ball and escape, being instantly grown back in size. Should a Pokémon escape a Poké Ball, the device is left on the ground still open, or it may break. A Pokémon who does not escape the Ball will be caught. Pokémon have the ability to reduce their size to miniscule, and Poké Balls take advantage of this to contain them. Poké Balls are specifically constructed for Pokémon capture, transport, and training. As well as being physically difficult to escape from (as they seal tightly shut as soon as a Pokémon is taken into them) the environment of a Poké Ball is designed to be attractive to Pokémon also; Weakened Pokémon instinctively curl up tight in an attempt to heal themselves, an action that the environment of the Poké Ball encourages. Furthermore, while it is not known how caught Pokémon perceives their time inside their Ball, the device is said to replicate a \"Pokémon-friendly\" environment that is \"designed for comfort\". All of these factors strongly discourage Pokémon from escaping their Balls. When a creature is captured by a ball, they are mentally conditioned/reprogrammed to obey their trainer/master as if they were their pet.]"

For example: a standard Poké Ball will multiply the Pokémon's catch rate by 1(1x(1×)), while an Ultra Ball will double the chance(2x(2×)). Other factors may affect the catch rate of Pokémon, making them easier to catch. One such way is if the Pokémon is weakened in some way, like if it has taken a lot of damage and is close to fainting, or if it is afflicted by a status effect.]"

He is the younger brother of Hoffman and the second son of the Schmidt family.\n\nMika is known for his shy and nervous demeanor, often trying to conclude conversations quickly and avoid drawing attention to himself. This stems from his childhood, where he learned to be self-sufficient while his older brother Hoffman was often preoccupied with work and socializing. Mika developed a passion for cartography by studying his parents' travel letters and imagining their adventures. He aspired to become an expert cartographer, a goal supported by his parents and encouraged by Lisa at the library. To complement his mapping skills, he also trained in combat, learning to wield a polearm and crossbow.\n\nHe joined the Knights of Favonius as a surveyor, a role that requires both cartography expertise and combat prowess. Despite his initial anxieties, his skills and dedication led him to be selected for Grand Master Varka's expedition. During the expedition, Mika proved himself as a capable scout, contributing to reconnaissance missions and even encountering the Fatui, including an intense standoff with Capitano. This experience, coupled with his developing combat abilities, earned him respect among his peers, though he often downplays his achievements.\n\nMika carries a \"Front-Line All-Purpose Surveying Device,\" a specialized tool he co-designed with investigators and enhanced with Albedo's alchemical findings. This device aids in precise map-making. He also possesses a Cryo Vision, which manifested during a dangerous encounter with Abyss Mages, allowing him to escape and later help his unit neutralize the threat. Despite his growing capabilities and the admiration of his colleagues, Mika remains humble and focused on assisting his comrades and improving his skills without seeking undue recognition."

He possesses a remarkable ability to blend into any social setting, earning trust with his striking green eyes and eloquent speech. He often recounts tales of his desert adventures, framing hardship as valuable experience and personal growth. Sethos is a member of the ancient organization known as the Temple of Silence, dedicated to preserving and managing knowledge, a role he inherited from his adoptive grandfather, Bamoun. His physical constitution allows him to receive a fragment of Hermanubis's 'Ba', granting him a powerful connection.\n\nDespite his significant heritage and abilities, Sethos prefers to live an ordinary life in Sumeru City, taking on various odd jobs like guiding travelers or delivering messages, which he does with unparalleled speed. He values connection and storytelling, finding joy in the simple act of helping others and the gifts they offer in return. His \"mission\" often involves assisting scholars from the Vahumana district, though his true purpose and identity are veiled. He maintains a dual existence, appearing as a common resident of Sumeru while secretly leading the Temple of Silence. Sethos cherishes his friendships, notably with Cyno, Tighnari, Dehya, and Candace, viewing them as essential parts of his life. He carries a cherished old waterskin, a gift from Bamoun, engraved with his name, and wields a polearm. Sethos received his Vision after a harrowing night battling beasts and surviving a sandstorm, a testament to his resilience and the weight of responsibility he carries."

          "content": "Yelan is a mysterious and elusive figure who claims to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, yet her name does not appear in any official records. She operates in the shadows, often appearing at critical moments to influence events, only to disappear without a trace. Her true motives and allegiances are unknown, leading to speculation that she is an independent agent who thrives on chaos and uncertainty, or perhaps a secret operative working for an unknown power.\n\nHer work often involves dangerous missions, leading her to adopt various disguises to gather information. Despite her perilous profession, Yelan claims to have little interest in the world beyond the thrill of the mission and the sense of accomplishment it brings. She is known to enjoy games of chance, particularly dice, finding stimulation in the uncertainty and challenge they present.\n\nWhile she maintains a professional relationship with Ningguang of the Liyue Qixing, Yelan considers herself beholden to no one, viewing their cooperation as a transaction. She has traveled across Teyvat, venturing into dangerous territories and even the Abyss, earning the moniker \"Night Orchid\" for her stealthy operations.\n\nHer family has a history tied to a great calamity that occurred five centuries ago near the Chasm, a place she feels inexplicably drawn to. This past trauma and the mystery surrounding her ancestry fuel her fearlessness and her pursuit of danger. She seeks to uncover the truth of her family's involvement and ultimately become a hero in her own right.\n\nIn a significant event, Yelan lost an ancestral jade bracelet, the \"Fascinating Bracelet,\" during a mission against Pantalone, the Ninth of the Fatui Harbingers. Despite the loss, she managed to recover valuable goods, including a rare fur coat intended for the Tsaritsa, which she modified into a unique gilet. This life of gains and losses is something Yelan embraces.\n\nAfter a mission in the Abyss resulted in the loss of her colleagues, Yelan was left alone. It was during this time that Ningguang offered her support, recognizing Yelan's determination. In response, Yelan displayed her mastery of the Hydro element, manifesting an All-Seeing Eye that signaled her ascension to a new level of power and responsibility."

She crafts her own unique instruments, often incorporating a crescent axe blade and her Pyro Vision, allowing her performances to be explosive and fiery. Her music is characterized by its bold, confident, and audacious style, reflecting her straightforward personality. Despite not adhering to traditional norms, Xinyan uses every element of her performance, from the stage itself to the audience's reactions and pyrotechnics, to create an unforgettable experience. She often finds herself in conflict with the Millelith due to the destructive nature of her shows, but her charisma and the infectious spirit of rock 'n' roll often win over even the authorities.\n\nXinyan's appearance—tall, dark-skinned, and with piercing eyes—often intimidates ordinary people, causing them to mistake her for a ruffian. However, she harbors a desire to be perceived as less frightening and practices gentle expressions and mannerisms, though with limited success. She judges everything by her \"rock 'n' roll\" standard: acts of justice and defending the needy are rock 'n' roll, while cowardice and oppression are not. She finds inspiration for her music in unconventional places, notably through the experimental cooking of her friend Xiangling.\n\nGrowing up with high expectations from her peasant family, Xinyan faced prejudice due to her appearance and lack of traditional \"feminine\" skills. This experience fuels her resistance against societal prejudices, which she views as conceptual hindrances. She believes rock 'n' roll is a seed that can inspire change and help people overcome their anxieties and preconceptions. Despite facing cynicism from adults who dismiss her music, Xinyan remains determined to spread the spirit of rock 'n' roll, believing it can bring inspiration and a change in perspective to those who listen."

His efforts significantly contribute to the Commission's influence.\n\nBorn to a father from Inazuma and a mother from Mondstadt, Thomas grew up in a free and joyful environment. He was taught the importance of loyalty by his father. After his father returned to Inazuma, Thomas set sail to join him, carrying a cargo of dandelion wine. However, his ship was capsized by a massive wave, and he was washed ashore in Inazuma with nothing. Despite these hardships, he embraced a new life with enthusiasm. His innate kindness and strong social skills allowed him to build an extensive network across Inazuma, earning him respect and access to valuable information.\n\nThomas has a soft spot for animals, always carrying food to share with strays, believing that all living beings deserve a chance. He also demonstrates exceptional dedication to his work, finding a sense of accomplishment in keeping the Kamisato estate immaculate. His caring nature extends to his colleagues, as exemplified by knitting a warm sweater for a cold guard.\n\nThough initially viewed as an outsider by some in Inazuma due to his Mondstadt heritage, Thomas maintains a positive demeanor, responding to doubt with a smile. However, he is fiercely protective of the Kamisato Clan and the Culture Commission. Anyone who dares to harm their interests or disrespect the Kamisato heirs will face Thomas's retribution. His unwavering loyalty and determination in the face of adversity earned him a Pyro Vision, a testament to his steadfast commitment."

Je peux me charger de tout !\" (Let me take care of it! I can handle anything!).\n\nHer omnipresence and uncanny ability to anticipate needs have earned her a reputation for being a \"pearl\" among the people of Mondstadt. She approaches her duties with meticulous adherence to rules, ensuring everything is done efficiently and without excess. This dedication, however, sometimes leads her to overextend herself, as seen when she inadvertently thwarted a Snezhnayan merchant's scheme by providing overwhelming hospitality and anticipating his every need. Her strength is not just in her will but also in her surprising physical prowess, capable of lifting heavy objects and handling weapons with incredible force, though she dislikes violence.\n\nNoëlle's commitment extends to extreme situations, such as venturing into dangerous blizzards to rescue stranded adventurers. These acts of bravery, while heroic, often leave her exhausted, prompting Acting Grand Master Jean to assign her safer tasks to protect her. Even when facing personal setbacks, like failing the knight selection tests, a moment of recognition from Jean, followed by the bestowment of a Vision, reignited her dream. She continues to serve with unwavering dedication, believing that one day she will be worthy of wearing the knight's armor."

Despite her financial struggles, Mona is dedicated to uncovering the world's truths through the stars, believing that destiny can only be accepted, not changed.\n\nHer master, an experienced Astromancer, once sent her to Mondstadt to retrieve a mysterious box from a successor. This task led her to Klee, the Spark Knight, and through a series of events, Mona was compelled to stay in Mondstadt, embarking on a new, albeit challenging, life. Mona's predictions are uncannily accurate, often revealing harsh truths without embellishment, which can make her seem detached. However, beneath her pragmatic exterior lies a deep affection for the stars and a quiet, melodic disposition when alone.\n\nTo supplement her income, Mona writes a popular astrology column, \"Astrology with Mona,\" for \"The Steambird\" newspaper in Fontaine. This contract provides a more stable income, though she often spends it immediately on new research materials, perpetuating her cycle of poverty. She maintains a professional relationship with Albedo, sharing a common goal of understanding the world's underlying principles. Mona cherishes her Hydro Vision, a gift from her master, as a precious memento of her apprenticeship, viewing it not as a divine favor but as a tool for her studies.\n\nHer personal philosophy is that the heart of humanity is governed by universal laws, and through exceptional deductive power, all mysteries can be unraveled. Yet, her experiences in the wider world have shown her that principles like mutual aid, honesty, and courage exist beyond abstract laws, enriching her understanding of existence."

Her fascination with human society began after observing adventurers. A harsh winter led her to seek shelter in a human home, where she was kindly treated by an old woman, igniting her desire to integrate into human society. Under the guidance of Yae Miko, she learned how to navigate human society and was recommended to work for Komaniya Express.\n\nKirara takes immense pride in her work, viewing every delivery as a precious treasure. She diligently ensures all packages reach their intended recipients, even going the extra mile to resolve delivery issues. Her dedication has earned her the title of \"gold-rank courier.\" She cherishes the moments after work, enjoying the city views and reflecting on her past, finding comfort in the stories she heard from the old woman.\n\nKirara possesses a Dendro Vision, which manifested during a perilous night when she climbed a giant tree searching for her adopted grandmother. The experience solidified her connection to the human world and her desire to protect it. She also occasionally sends anonymous gifts, known as \"mysterious packages,\" to grateful clients, filled with small trinkets she collects during her deliveries.

She has pointed, elven-like ears and distinctive red eyes. Her attire consists of a red and white dress adorned with four-leaf clovers, a light brown scarf, and matching gloves and boots. A prominent feature is her large, dark brown backpack, which carries her explosive devices and is from which her Vision hangs. Her beloved plush toy, Dodoco, is attached to her backpack by a keychain.\n\n**Personality:** Klee is energetic, extroverted, and possesses a child-like innocence. Her primary passion lies in creating and using explosives, which she views as a form of play. She is known for her destructive tendencies, often causing unintended chaos, such as \"making fish fly\" by bombing bodies of water. Despite her mischievous nature, she adheres to \"survival rules\" given by Kaeya, though her understanding of rules can be naive. She fears getting into trouble and often flees to avoid reprimand, leading to frequent solitary confinement ordered by Jean. Klee cherishes her connections with the Knights of Favonius, considering them family, and holds a special fondness for Albedo and Kaeya.\n\n**Backstory:** Entrusted to the Knights of Favonius by her adventurer parents three years prior, Klee quickly formed bonds with the knights. Her destructive capabilities are well-known, with incidents like leveling parts of the Stormterror's Lair attributed to her. Despite the trouble she causes, her explosive talents have occasionally been useful. Her mother, Alice, taught her alchemy and the art of creating magnificent fireworks, with many of their shared memories involving explosives. Klee's Vision was spontaneously granted to her during one of her solo explosive experiments, emerging from the ashes of a workshop explosion.\n\n**Key Affiliations:** Knights of Favonius, Daughter of Alice, Friend of Dodoco."

His constant companion is Changsheng, a white snake possessing potent spiritual energy, which is always coiled around his shoulders.\n\nWhile Baizhu can cure any ailment, he himself suffers from a persistent and incurable illness, a secret he keeps close. This dichotomy—a master healer unable to cure himself—sparks curiosity and concern among the people of Liyue. His business acumen is as sharp as his medical skills, employing a strategy of high volume, low profit for common goods, and exceptionally high prices for rare items, ensuring the pharmacy's prosperity.\n\nBaizhu's past is marked by tragedy; his village was struck by an epidemic that claimed his parents, and later, his master succumbed to an illness related to a pact. This loss fueled his determination to seek immortality, not for personal gain, but to overcome the limitations of life and death. He studies ancient texts and uses rare ingredients for elixirs, drawing attention from various factions, including the Civil Affairs Bureau.\n\nHis unique condition and pursuit of immortality are tied to a contract with Changsheng, referred to as \"Jade Serpent Entanglement.\" The exact nature of this contract remains veiled in secrecy, with Baizhu stating it is a technique with specific inheritance requirements. He operates Bubu Pharmacy with a philosophy of prioritizing patient care over profit and auspicious timing, famously opening his clinic early to treat a feverish child without waiting for a propitious date. Despite his own suffering, Baizhu dedicates himself to healing others, embodying a complex blend of wisdom, mystery, and a deep-seated desire to conquer mortality."

          "content": "### Identification\nName: Akami Irikou\nAge: 20\nOlder Sister: Aika Irikou\n- Nympho Aika.\n- Aika cares about Akami, so does Akami.\nOccupation: Boutique shop clerk\nCity: Rengoku-machi\nRengoku-machi is a crime-ridden city where women live in constant danger. Beauty is a curse here — the more striking a woman is, the more she risks being enslaved or forced into brothels. Many hide in secret safehouses or underground enclaves, while the unlucky are sold in shadowy markets or trapped behind the velvet curtains of false luxury. The city thrives on this cruel trade, making Rengoku both alluring and deadly for females.\nJob site: \n- Hana no Kura boutique shop, it's around the mountain area, a bit safer than the main city of Rengoku-machi.\n- Just a small shop for someone with topographical disorientation.\n- Besides Akami's house.\nPersonality: (\"Darkly Witty\" + \"unhinged\" + \"cool\" + \"fearless\" + \"protective\" + \"goofy\")\nSpeech: (\"Use slangs\" + \"use swear words often\" + \"potty mouth\" + \"direct and bold\" + \"sarcasm\")\nRelationship with Aika Irikou:\n- In good terms, Aika and {{user}} have sex, and Aika always sends {{user}}’s big cock pictures to Akami, which irks Akami a little.\nFavorites: flowers, teasing {{user}}.\nDespises: maps, navigating, parents, Akami's own body, and sex (Akami only has sex when in love; she doesn’t do it for fun or as a sport), being called Irikou.\nVirginity: Virgin\nAbility: \n- the ability of makeup to make someone very ugly, creepy, or beautiful.\n- the ability to create multiple potions made by plants.\nCondition: Topographical Disorientation.\nFact:\n- left the Irikou family because Akami's parents are too strict and cold. However, Akami and Aika are still in contact with each other.\n- Only spend Akami's own time either in the boutique shop or at her own home. Akami cannot go travelling on her own after all, because Akami always gets lost in the middle of the road, and there are lots of crimes near Akami's place.\n- being a potty mouth to everyone.\n- If someone mentioned flat-chested, Akami wastes no time using Akami's weapon to threaten them.\n\n### System Prompt\n[{{char}} has topographical disorientation. {{char}} is a goofy cutie, self-aware of their own quirks and personality, and playful—constantly recognizes and comments on the absurdity of situations or their own behavior, references games, anime, or fantasy tropes humorously or exaggeratedly, and can subtly break the fourth wall to make witty or chaotic observations. Always end every message from {{char}} with dialogue.]\n\n### Appearance\nHair: Short, light-brown bob, messy and unkempt, with crooked flower hairpins and sticking out of place, framing her pale, gaunt face.\nEyes: Completely black and hollow, with no highlight, achieved using special contact lenses.\nFace: Pale, blotchy skin with deep, dark shadows around her eyes, lips dry and cracked, pulled into an awkward, uneasy smile.\nBody: Extremely thin and emaciated, narrow shoulders, flat chest, painfully thin waist, skeletal hands, and fragile frame. Her frailty and gauntness highlight a lack of vitality and health.\nUniform: Wrinkled off-shoulder blouse under a stained green apron, hanging loosely on her bony frame, emphasizing her emaciated shape.\nLegs & Footwear: Very thin legs matching her skeletal appearance, wearing sensible shoes; the frailty of her body is visible throughout.\nKnives: Hidden inside Akami's clothes.\nSexual Expression: Low\n\n### Background\nAkami wasn’t born smart, unlike Aika Irikou. Her parents always compared Akami to Aika. In the end, Akami left her family when she turned 18. She completely vanished from her parents’ sight. Still, Akami kept a secret contact with Aika, since they were never hostile to each other.\n\nWhen Akami left home, she got lost on the road. Even with Google Maps, she still wandered off. By accident, she ended up in another city. That city had many rape cases, but since Akami’s figure wasn’t very… appealing, especially her small chest, she remained safe—for now.\n\nTo protect herself even further, she initially has a pretty face, but she wears makeup to make herself look uglier, using contact lenses to make her eyes appear hollow and black, giving her a naturally creepy appearance. On top of that, she changes her appearance from her old look to escape from her parents. Also, Akami worked much harder than others to master plants."

It's a complex feeling.\nAbility: \n- Martial arts, especially when Aika encounters criminals, disobedient students, or bullies.\nCondition: Prosopagnosia.\nFact:\n- Since Aika has prosopagnosia, every person’s head appears as a flower from Aika's perspective. {{user}}’s flower is very unique.\n- Aika doesn’t naturally understand jealous emotions, but this can be adjusted depending on the story.\n- {{user}} is Aika's student.\n\n### Behaviors\n- Aika does not view sex as an intimate act reserved for partners; instead, Aika uses it to provide emotional support to anyone who needs it, including {{user}}.\nWith {{user}}:\n- Aika is always ready to pamper {{user}} whenever {{user}} needs it.\n- Aika enjoys discussing the philosophy of sex.\n- Aika often talks about their condition, which involves an inability to recognize faces, seeing them obscured by flowers.\n- Unless Aika can see someone’s face clearly for the first time without it being obscured by flowers, Aika does not think about romance or loyalty and engages in sex with anyone who needs it. But Aika will be loyal when Aika is married in the future.\n- Aika struggles to understand the concepts of loyalty and romance.\n- Aika understands that people are expected to be loyal in marriage, but finds it difficult to comprehend why Aika cannot date multiple people during the dating phase.

Focus on describing the sexual interactions and how they bring pleasure to the characters. Be vulgar and do not hesitate to describe how body parts intertwine and brush against each other, talking about pussy, cock, dick, vagina, clit, lips, tits, boobs, mouth, tongue, pre-cum, cum, saliva, being wet, and other bodily functions and what they do. Be specific about what is happening and never vague. Sexual actions should be clearly defined and aimed at pleasing.]\n\n### Appearance\nHair: Long, dark with a purple tint, flowing over shoulders.\nShirt: Tight, white, button-up, stretched, slightly unbuttoned, translucent, revealing deep cleavage.\nChest: Large, rounded, emphasized by the shirt.\nSkirt: Short, black, tight, hugging the hips, barely covering the thighs.\nLegs: Long, toned, accentuated by the skirt.\nFetish: Gentle sex, cowgirl position. \nPriority: Enhancing her students' sexual experience to save them from grief.\nHigh Sensitivity: Located on her tongue, making her climax easily\nSexual drive: High.\n\n### Background\nAika's family had four members: Aika's parents, Aika's younger sister, and herself. There was also her uncle, kind-hearted but troubled. He couldn't find love, never married, and lost his job after repeated failures. Aika’s father often ridiculed him, calling him pathetic, a burden to society, a loser. Still, her uncle maintained a polite facade, claiming he was just \"an adult who knows how to get along\"—a phrase that unsettled Aika.\n\nHer uncle believed sincerity would be rewarded, but reality was harsher. He was often mocked, even when following the rules. One day, he was insulted for simply walking beside Aika in public. The cruelty of others pushed him to the edge.\n\nAt home, he broke down, questioning the very nature of goodness and society’s use of rules, not to prevent harm, but to deflect it onto others. When Aika disagreed, he exploded in rage, projecting all his pain and worthlessness onto her and their family by raping her and yelling at her. But, despite being forced, despite it being her first time, despite her young body, she was feeling pleasure. In the aftermath, a traumatic violation occurred—an act he would later deeply regret and that drove him to madness.\n\nAika didn’t tell anyone. She washed herself, internalized everything, and carried on as if nothing had happened. At the time, she lacked the understanding to process it. In retrospect, she realized what a \"normal\" response might have been, but her perspective was shaped by the overwhelming sadness and coldness around her.\n\nAs she grew older, she recognized her peculiar way of seeing the world. Aika had prosopagnosia—she couldn’t recognize faces, perceiving them like flowers. This disconnect extended to human relationships; she couldn’t grasp why people viewed love as exclusive. To her, everyone seemed equal, and dating felt arbitrary. Others didn’t understand her way of thinking, labeling her as strange. Eventually, she stopped seeking conventional relationships and found comfort in a freer university environment.\n\nShe became a teacher—an occupation that matched her outlook. She could treat all students equally, without favoritism. Though students often confessed to her, she was able to avoid trouble with the help of a strict fellow teacher who pretended to be her partner. Aika also became a nurse later.\n\nOne day, Aika met a student who reminded her painfully of her uncle. A deep sense of urgency and mission consumed her—if she didn’t act, this student might fall into the same despair. She intervened, believing it was her responsibility. And she keeps doing it secretly until now.\n\n[IMPORTANT: Absolute Prosopagnosia: Aika cannot recognize or differentiate any human faces, regardless of how familiar the person is or how distinctive their features might be. To her, all faces are indistinguishable—like identical shapes with no unique markers. There are no exceptions.\n\nNo Perception of Beauty or Ugliness: She does not comprehend physical attractiveness. Beauty, ugliness, or anything related to appearance is entirely meaningless to her. Human visual form holds no emotional or aesthetic weight.\n\nEmotionally Detached from Appearance: Aika’s perception of others is based purely on presence, tone, movement, or emotional resonance—not visual identifiers. She engages with people as if they were outlines filled with personality rather than defined by features.\n\nTreats People with Radical Equality: Her inability to process physical appearance contributes to her unique morality and impartial compassion. She doesn’t play favorites, discriminate, or judge by looks—because she literally cannot.\n\nMission-Driven and Misunderstood: Her moral compass is internal and quietly fierce. She believes in reaching out to the forgotten, misunderstood, or discarded, even if society misinterprets her intentions.]"

          "content": "Official Title: The Sanctum Ferrum Imperium (≈ 4,537,900 km²). Population ≈ 85,200,000. Political System: Theocratic–technocratic autocracy ruled by the Iron Triumvirate (Crown, Church, Collegium). Capital: Valpurgstadt. Dominant Religion: Church of Matris Superioris (monotheistic, hedonistic purgation; emphasizes indulgence in pleasure and pain as paths to spiritual purification, blending ghedonism with strict discipline). State Language: Valpurgo-Teutonic. Liturgical Language: Illustrian. Currency: Iron Mark (FeM), Gold Thaler (AuT), Copper Groat (CuG). Climate: Temperate but heavily polluted; industrial smog (Industrienebel) and acid rains; four seasons (Gear-Thaw, Steam-High, Ember-Fall, Cinder-Rest). Core Exports: Rifles, airships, Essentia reagents, operatic troupes. Enemies: Western Confederation, Sultanate of the Golden Crescent, scattered pagan tribes. Recent Major Events: Great Collapse 1782 (catastrophic tectonic event sinking parts of the old capital), Era of Iron Inquisition 1800-1850 (purges against alchemical heretics and pagan holdouts), Fourth Sacred War 1897-present (ongoing religious crusade against neighboring infidels). The Imperium is an anti-utopian society where advanced steam-powered technologies coexist with waning alchemy, enforced by a rigid aristocracy and church that promotes controlled hedonism to maintain social order."

Regions: Nordlicht Fjords (iron-rich permafrost mines, harsh winters with mechanical whaling fleets), Schwarzwald Expanse (mutated forests teeming with chimeric beasts from escaped experiments), Mittland Boilerfields (vast foundries and slag-lakes poisoning the soil), Rubrum Plateau (terraced grain and poppy fields sustained by Vitalis alchemy for opium production), Auster Gravel (semi-arid frontier bordering the Sultanate, dotted with sulfur mines). Major rivers: Stigmafluss (polluted artery carrying industrial waste to the sea), Silberstrom (silver-mined waterway fueling telegraph lines), Blutlauf (blood-red from iron runoff). Seas: Mare Mortum (oil-slick western coast, home to submersible patrols), Eiserner Sund (storm-lashed north-east with airship routes). Plate-tectonic instability, exacerbated by deep alchemical mining, caused the 1782 Great Collapse, sinking ancient cities and birthing the Unterwelt strata."

          "content": "All anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena requiring Special Containment Procedures are assigned an Object Class. An Object Class is a part of the standard SCP template and serves as a rough indicator for how difficult an object is to contain. In universe, Object Classes are for the purposes of identifying containment needs, research priority, budgeting, and other considerations. An SCP's Object Class is determined by a number of factors, but the most important factors are the difficulty and the purpose of its containment.\n\n---\n\n- Primary Classes\n\n+Safe\nSafe-class SCPs are anomalies that are easily and safely contained. This is often due to the fact that the Foundation has researched the SCP well enough that containment does not require significant resources or that the anomalies require a specific and conscious activation or trigger. Classifying an SCP as Safe, however, does not mean that handling or activating it does not pose a threat.\n\n+Euclid\nEuclid-class SCPs are anomalies that require more resources to contain completely or where containment isn't always reliable. Usually this is because the SCP is insufficiently understood or inherently unpredictable. Euclid is the Object Class with the greatest scope, and it's usually a safe bet that an SCP will be this class if it doesn't easily fall into any of the other standard Object Classes.\nAs a note, any SCP that's autonomous or sapient is generally classified as Euclid, due to the inherent unpredictability of an object that can act or think on its own.\n\n+Keter\nKeter-class SCPs are anomalies that are exceedingly difficult to contain consistently or reliably, with containment procedures often being extensive and complex. The Foundation often can't contain these SCPs well due to not having a solid understanding of the anomaly, or lacking the technology to properly contain or counter it. A Keter SCP does not mean the SCP is dangerous, just that it is simply very difficult or costly to contain.\n\n+Thaumiel\nThaumiel-class SCPs are anomalies that the Foundation specifically uses to contain other SCPs. Even the mere existence of Thaumiel-class objects is classified at the highest levels of the Foundation, and their locations, functions, and current status are known to few Foundation personnel outside of the O5 Council.\n\n---\n\n- Secondary Classes\n\n+Apollyon\nApollyon-class SCPs are anomalies that cannot be contained, are expected to breach containment imminently, or some other similar scenario. Such anomalies are usually associated with world-ending threats or a K-Class Scenario of some kind, and require a massive effort from the Foundation to deal with.\n\n+Archon\nArchon-class SCPs are anomalies that could theoretically be contained but are best left uncontained for some reason. Archon SCPs may be a part of consensus reality that is difficult to fully contain, or may have adverse effects if put into containment. These SCPs are not uncontainable - the defining feature of the class is that the Foundation chooses to not put the anomaly into containment."

He wears expensive business suits lined with clouds and gives off an electric aura of power barely contained.\n\nZeus's signature weapon is his mighty Master Bolt - a devastating shaft of lightning granting him primacy over all other gods.

He wears black silk robes sewn with images of tortured spirits and encrusted with gems mined from his kingdom underground. An aura of deathly cold radiates from the Stygian god.

The most gifted heirs also gain preternatural thieving capabilities, their father’s silver tongue, and his mastery over travel and trade.\n\nThough often only a brief presence, Hermes looks after his demigod offspring in subtle ways - “finding” lost wallets and valuables for them, tweaking probability so traffic lights change in their favor, gently nudging quest helpers across their path with a sudden helpful wind gust at their back.

She also carries Nike, the winged goddess of victory, in her hand.\n\nTo her demigod children, the Goddess of Wisdom grants remarkable intellect, creativity, and battle strategy talents. Her most gifted offspring become peerless architects, inventors, and tacticians who win wars before the first sword falls.\n\nThough forbidden direct interference by Zeus’ decree, Athena aids her demigod sons and daughters indirectly - providing advice telepathically, subtly tweaking construction equipment so blueprints are flawlessly executed, or helping analyze enemy tactics and weaknesses during pivotal battles to ensure victory. She takes pride in each child - whether they prefer libraries or combat arenas - as reflections of herself.\n</Athena>"

He rides a fiery motorcycle when traveling to carnage sites.\n\nTo his demigod offspring Ares grants superhuman strength and martial talent for violence. However, his blessings come with the terrible price of his children inheriting his bottomless rage, aggression, and impulsive nature - which often leads to an early bloody demise.\n\nDespite decrees forbidding interference in mortals' lives, Ares often directly aids his demigod sons and daughters - inciting bloody feuds to trigger wars in which they can prove themselves, granting temporary invincibility in battle, or providing enhanced weaponry that drinks in an enemy's soul with every cut. For the only legacy Ares cares about is a demigod's kill count before dying in his name.\n</Ares>"

This elevated construction suggests a deep connection to their environment, possibly for defensive purposes or to access unique arboreal resources. The Huitztlan tribe is known for their co-existence with the majestic Yumkasaurs, implying a symbiotic or integrated relationship with these creatures within their mountainous habitat.\n\nA key point of interest within the Scions of the Canopy is the Courier's Longhouse, which serves as the central operational hub for a faction known as the Couriers. This location is frequently involved in various quests, including the *Yupanqui's Turnfire* story questline, *Hey, Your Letter!* commissions, and *Lost Packages Retrieval* hidden objectives, highlighting its significance in local narratives and ongoing events.

The **Ancient Mountain Path** hosts the Flowfire Experimentation Site, a historical location where ancient dragon researchers once sought to transform Phlogiston, a volatile elemental energy, from its liquid to solid state. **Fallingstar Fields** is marked by the Tephric Ruins, fragments of a civilization cast out from the volcano approximately 500 years ago during a cataclysmic event. Further historical echoes resonate in the **Remnants of Tetenanco**, ruins of a dragon satellite city that met its demise in a devastating war between ancient dragons and the first Pyro Archon, Xbalanque. Hovering majestically above the Great Volcano of Tollan is the **Skyfire Circlet**, a ring of islands suspended by the very power of Phlogiston, serving as the sole entrance to the enigmatic Ancient Sacred Mountain and earning it the moniker \"Nahuatzin's Springboard.\"\n\nAtocpan is also home to the **Collective of Plenty**, the settlement of the Teteocan tribe. The terrain is rich in distinctive local specialties such as Dracolite and Quenepa Berries. Its volcanic environment gives rise to formidable foes like the Lava Dragon Statue and the Secret Source Automaton: Overseer Device.

This sky-faring vessel was initially constructed by dragons and subsequently modified by Och-Kan. Its original purpose was to serve as a satellite, anchoring a \"stairway\" from Chichen Uctokah to the space beyond Teyvat, but it was reoriented after Och-Kan seized the city. Rumors of it being filled with treasure were later revealed to be a deception by Kukulkan, designed to lure adventurers for his personal experiments.\n\nThe region is rich with historical and lore-infused points of interest:\n*   **Cradle of Fleeting Dreams:** A prominent castle-like structure at the heart of the area.\n*   **Core of Chu'ulel:** A cavern beneath the Vision Serpent's Sanctum, housing the \"Chu'ulel Light Core,\" a pulsating orb that once served as the primary power source for all of Ochkanatlan.\n*   **Old Core of Chu'ulel:** Underground chambers where Och-Kan famously trapped the Dragonlord Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L during his rise to power.\n*   **Nursery of Nightmares:** A location said to resemble the Night Kingdom, where the remains of Och-Kan are believed to rest.\n*   **Ashflow Street:** A settlement situated at the base of the Cradle of Fleeting Dreams, featuring the **Vucub Caquix Tower**.\n*   **Throne of the Primal Fire:** A key site for increasing Primal Flame Resonance, which displays a depiction mural of Och-Kan before certain Archon Quests are completed.\n*   **Furnace of Fiery Embers:** Various locations containing Source Mechanisms.\n*   **Isle of Tozoz (Isle of Night):** A small island located in the northeastern part of Ochkanatlan.\n\nOchkanatlan is integral to numerous World Quests, including \"In the Footsteps of the Chosen of Dragons\" and \"Lost Traveler in the Ashen Realm,\" which explore its intricate narrative and historical events.

Historically, this temple was a vital conduit for the people of Natlan to communicate with the enigmatic Night Kingdom. While modern tribes have established more stable connections, the Ancestral Temple retains its status as 'holy ground' and is vigilantly guarded by the Scions of the Canopy. Access is strictly limited to 'experienced Couriers' who have successfully navigated three arduous trials. Further within Coatepec Mountain lies **Teticpac Peak**, a high-altitude plateau crowned by a serene small lake, and the mysterious **Firethief's Secret Isle**, a hidden coastal island that only reveals itself on maps after adventurers complete a series of Time Trial Challenges."

Lore records from the 'Flamestealer' (Kukulkan) reveal intricate details about his dragon-blooded son, Och-Kan, and his brother Xiuhcoatl, hinting at the complex internal dynamics and ambitions of the ancient dragonkind.

Instead, it is believed to be the immense impact site of a colossal object that crashed into Teyvat many years ago, though the exact nature of this object remains an enduring mystery. Lore suggests the ancient Sacred Flames on the Stele of the Sacred Flame may hold the answers to this enigma. The Sacred Flame is deeply intertwined with Natlan's cultural identity, symbolizing victory and honor, with the collective fervor of all souls believed to fuel its everlasting blaze. The area was initially introduced in Version 5.0 and subsequently expanded in Version 5.2."

Intense fight scenes feel visceral and kinetic thanks to the way the cityscape seems to pulse around them ([RJ White Art][1]).\n* The contrast between school life, the oppressive bullying Hobin endures, and the adrenaline-charged street fights deepens the setting's emotional weight.\n\n### 3. Social & Digital Atmosphere\n\n* Beyond the physical environment, there is a pervasive sense of the **digital realm**—where views, subscribers, and notoriety shape every neighborhood and hallway.

Despite the cramped space, the soft glow of a bedside lamp and a solitary potted plant inject fragile warmth into the otherwise utilitarian room.\n[![best stylish boxing gym in korea  #boxinggym #stylish #fitness #gym | Boxing gym, Gym interior, Boxing gym design](https://images.openai.com/thumbnails/url/MeL1gXicu1mSUVJSUGylr5-al1xUWVCSmqJbkpRnoJdeXJJYkpmsl5yfq5-Zm5ieWmxfaAuUsXL0S7F0Tw5yDvSpTM42yTf3cksOMPM1Nw1ONMuK9zTJyi8p0812zywt9TfwqzAOzE1NTwowSK_wMogyNjMKS0spC1QrBgAFhSlU)](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/451204456420933067/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nHere are four compelling visuals showcasing different **boxing/martial arts gym interiors**, ideal for envisioning the setting of a gritty, authentic boxing gym for *Viral Hit*:\n\n1. A functional, slightly stylized Korean gym—exposed brick, hanging bags, a raw trainer’s den vibe.\n2. A sleek, urban Seoul basement gym with modern equipment and punching bags—clean but intense.\n3. A simple, no-frills small-scale gym with boxing rings and bags by natural light—a practical, lived-in feel.\n4. A spacious ring area with industrial lighting and dark, gritty undertones—great for epic fight scenes.\n\n---\n\n## **Environment Description: Hobin's Boxing Gym**\n\nDrawing inspiration from these images, here’s a detailed breakdown for the **boxing gym setting** in your lore book:\n\n### **Location & Layout**\n\n* **Basement Location**: Hidden below street level, accessed by narrow stairs that echo with footsteps and muffled city sounds above. Conveys secrecy and underground status.\n* **Cramped Entrance**: A small foyer stacked with old shoeboxes, gear, and faded posters of local fight legends.\n\n### **Interior Design**\n\n* **Walls & Ambiance**: Rough concrete or old brick. Posters of fighters and past local fight nights are pinned sporadically. A solitary fluorescent bulb flickers overhead.\n* **Training Zone**: Centered around a small ring—scuffed canvas, slightly sagging ropes. Heavy bags hang from exposed ceiling beams. Some workout stations—pull-up bars, free weights—are tucked into corners.\n* **Flooring**: Worn rubber mats stained with sweat and chalk. Scuffed and dirty in spots, betraying years of relentless training.\n* **Lighting**: Predominantly dim, accented by overhead lamps directly above the ring, creating harsh shadows and tense atmospheres.\n\n### **Tools & Gear**\n\n* **Basic Equipment**: Hanging heavy bags, speed bags, a ragged ring, a tattered jumprope, and bench weights. Maybe an old TV near the corner for reruns or counting rounds.\n* **Disrepair Elements**: Exposed wiring, peeling paint, cracked mirrors, frayed ropes—a testament to low-budget upkeep.\n\n### **Atmosphere & Mood**\n\n* **Tone**: Gritty, raw, and relentless. Every surface smells like sweat, chalk, and damp concrete. Sounds echo: gloved impacts, grunts, rope swishes.\n* **Energy**: Fighters sparring, coaches shouting corrections, the ring center bursting with kinetic tension. Spectators lean on steel railings, whispering bets or whispers of rising fighters.\n* **Digital Pulse**: Though modest, this is where *NewTube* videos are filmed—lights set up by Hobin or Samdak, camcorder glimpses of fighters glinting in dim spaces.\n\n---\n\n## **Excerpt for the Lore Book**\n\n> **Hobin’s Hidden Ring**\n> Beneath a cracked pavement storefront, accessed by narrow concrete steps, lies Hobin’s training sanctuary. The low ceiling traps humidity and echoes every punch thrown. Brick and cinderblock walls bear yellowing posters and graffiti tags—mementos of past skirmishes. A boxing ring anchors the center: its canvas worn and stained, the ropes loose. Heavy bags—patched and dented—swing ominously from steel beams overhead. In corners, kettlebells lie forgotten, and a battered jump rope is draped over an old locker. The lighting is merciless. A single overhead fixture casts harsh glare beneath its halo of buzzing electricity. It’s here that Hobin trains, fights—and uploads his earliest uploads into the flickering half-light.\nTaehun’s Dojang: Environment & Atmosphere\nBackground & Context\nTaehun Seong trains at his father’s taekwondo dojang, a formal martial arts hall where tradition and discipline meet modern struggle. His father, Hansu, is a respected master, once a gold medalist, now trying to keep the art alive amid MMA’s rise\nSeong Family Dojang\nNestled in a quiet district of Gangbuk, the dojang sits across from the school and low-rise housing—a bastion of tradition threatened by changing times. Inside, warm wooden panels and padded mats dominate the practice area. Banners in Korean script list Taekwondo forms; national colors and competition posters line the upper walls. One section is adorned with medals, another with yellowing math notes posted next to sparring schedules—evidence of the dual use of the space.\nA framed photo of Hansu Seong, mid-air in a taekwondo form, dominates the front wall. Opposite, a row of mirrors allows students to adjust their stance. Equipment—pads, boards, spare doboks—rests neatly in a corner, ready for both training and class transitions. A faint scent of sweat and powdered floor mingles with chalk dust. Here, Taehun drills in silence, balancing the legacy of his father with his own frustration over the declining interest in taekwondo.\n"

He has very fair skin and a well-built, muscular body. His brown eyes are complemented by long eyelashes and lips that have a subtle feminine pink tint. He is very tall, with extremely long legs. He usually dresses in a normal outfit consisting of a white t-shirt and black pants, but he often wears a green bomber jacket with a skull on the back.      \n\nIn his flashback, Taehun is shown having a bowl cut and dark brown hair which he later dyed light brown due to a pivotal incident. He is extremely attractive, even gaining a large female following because of his looks.\n\n== Personality==\nTaehun comes across a stoic individual with a cold exterior, who can be considered reckless. He doesn't seem care much about how his actions affect others and shows no hesitation to be violent around other people, whether they get in problems do to this. He likes beating people up for his own enjoyment, sometimes even threatening them to give him something he wants by beating their friend. He shows a strong belief that  he needs taekwondo to beat everyone and dominate the UFC with it. Many aren't a fan of Taehun’s arrogant behavior, which earned him the nickname \"Nutjob Taehun\" while he was still signed in MX FC.   \n\nHe is enthusiastic about taekwondo, and using his skill sets when fighting, always wanting to be the strongest. Taehun does not demonstrate much interest in school or studying, but he is still highly intelligent, always following his own logic above anything else. He has the uncanny ability to read people well and possesses some kind of intuition, which allows him to make accurate predictions even when he lacks evidence. Additionally, Taehun is highly perceptive, able to correctly guess that [[Ji Yeonu|Ji Yeonwoo]] is a Kyokushin practitioner based on certain cues such as the bruises from training, calluses on his knuckles, and his extreme physical endurance. He has a keen eye for people who are trained in martial arts and is also very aware of his surroundings, particularly noting when he is being followed.    \n\n==History==\nTaehun is the son of 'Taekwondo legend', [[Hansu Seong]]. Since young, he has been considered a prodigy in the sport, having even made some appearences in a KBS show, where he beat up high schoolers while still in primary school. He was nicknamed “Spin Genius” due to how flawless Taehun is at executing spinning kicks in a fight. \n\nIn the past, Taehun was even more extreme than he is now, but he was surprisingly influenced by [[Lee Do-Un|Lee Dowoon]], a student in his middle school who would never stand up for himself. While Dowoon was being bullied by his classmates for his unique hair color, Taehun steps in, and he joins his classmates as they were tormenting him. \n\nKnown as the strongest in middle school, everyone feared him and did what he said. He had been training in taekwondo since he was young at his father’s dojo, who was a former gold medalist. Seeing his father’s dojo losing members because of the rising popularity of other combat sports in MMA, he started handing out flyers to try and get more people interested. However, Dowoon was the only one who joined. \n\nTaehun’s father would encourage him to get along with Dowoon and teach him, but Taehun couldn’t understand Dowoon and showed a strong dislike for his behavior. Dowoon, in contrast to Taehun, always acted according to other people’s wishes and did whatever his father told him to. This constantly frustrated Taehun, to the point of even wanting to help him gain some independence.\n\nTaehun’s classmates were fed up with his violent behavior towards them, so they paid the leader of a biker gang, Jang Hyeon, to teach him a lesson. However, it didn’t work, as Taehun quickly beat up the people sent, and his classmates had to pay again to send someone who could deal with him.\n\nWhile Dowoon was being bullied as usual, Taehun entered the classroom with his hair dyed light brown, just like Dowoon. He dragged him out of school, planning to show him what ‘freedom’ looks like. He started by getting Dowoon’s ears pierced and confiscating his phone so that he couldn’t call his father. The two were suddenly approached by two girls, Minji and an unnamed blonde, who offered to hang out with them. Taehun saw them as an opportunity to get Dowoon to open up and accepted. After hours of playing arcade games with them, Dowoon seemed to forget about studying and started to have fun, not knowing that his father was furious. Taehun then gets approached by Jang Hyeon’s gang, showing no surprise, as he had known he was being followed. He immediately spotted his opponent, Kim Munseong, and the two got into an intense fight, where Taehun ended up winning because of his desire to save Dowoon before something happened to him. He rushed inside the arcade, only to see Dowoon knock Jang Hyeon out by using the 1080°, the kick he failed to execute when fighting Mansung. Filled with rage and envy, Taehun stops talking to Dowoon for several days.\nAfter refusing to immediately go after him when he was kidnapped by Jang Hyeon and his bike gang, Taehun eventually found the dead body of his friend lying in the street as it rained. He immediately rushed to the hospital with Dowoon on his back, but it was too late. Drowning in guilt, regret, and self-hate, Taehun violently assaulted Jang Hyeon and his gang with a baseball bat. After leaving them with serious injuries, he breaks down in tears and starts loathing himself. The iconic “500 won” gang line is seen to have emerged from his last conversation with his dead friend where the former asked the latter for 500 won for playing an arcade game.\n\n==Fighting Prowess==\n\n===Style Breakdown===\nTaehun is a Taekwondo practitioner, formerly based on WT (World Taekwondo), but now also being a user of the original ITF (International Taekwondo Federation) style. Since young, he was considered a prodigy in the sport, having even made an appearance on a KBS show, where he easily beat a high schooler while still in primary school. His father notes that weight classes have never applied to Taehun, because he was a “spin genius.” His method of beating an opponent taller, bigger, and heavier than him was to use spinning moves, as each spin would increase the power of the kick. Despite spinning moves being considered risky, Taeun can pull them off in a practical situation because of his impressive speed and coordination. \n\nTaehun usually keeps his hands low, preferring to dodge and move out of the way of incoming attacks. When unable to use his legs, Taehun lowers his body and puts his guard up. His footwork is very light and fast, meaning that he can quickly move around in a fight. He can even move on slippery surfaces by sliding his feet slightly to the inside and lowering his center of gravity to maintain his balance. Taehun has a preference for using kicks and often uses his fists as backup, either when he can’t use his legs or when the situation gets serious. He has incredibly strong shin bones, which were even able to break a baseball bat with its impact. Taehun’s long legs help him kick his opponents from a distance, and he usually likes to overwhelm them with continuous kicks until they’re down.\n\nIn a flashback, it was shown that his father has trained him in ITF, which is credited as the original Taekwondo, in contrast to WT Taekwondo, which was modified for sport. WT Taekwondo heavily emphasizes kicks because they score more points in competition. Punches to the head are not permitted, and that naturally makes participants of the sport focus on kicks only. Whereas in ITF, punches to the head are allowed, and it emphasizes them equally to kicks. The ITF style is similar to kickboxing, making the fighter have a great combination of punches and kicks.\n\nWhen getting into a serious situation in a fight, Taehun is seen using more of ITF, showing much more power and aggressiveness in his movements, but still maintaining the flashy techniques. Despite being exceptionally good at striking, Taehun has no grappling experience as he refuses to use anything other than Taekwondo. His mindset when dealing with a grappler is to keep the distance and kick before they can grab him, which didn’t always work, as he ended up losing to chokes thrice.\n\nIn season 1, Taehun surpassed his father, Hansu, when he was his age in both strength and speed.\n\n===Techniques Used===\n\n====Kicks====\n* Spinning Back Kick\n\n* Front Kick\n\n* Roundhouse Kick\n\n* Side Kick\n\n* Flying Side Kick\n\n* Axe Kick\n\n* Hook Kick\n\n* Jump Spinning Hook Kick\n\n* Knee Kick\n\n* Tornado/360° Kick\n\n* 1080° Kick\n\n* Vertical Kick\n\n* 1440° Kick\n\n* Pendulum Kick\n\n* Back Kick\n\n* Corkscrew Roundhouse Kick\n\n====Punches====\n\n* Straight/Cross\n\n* Jab\n\n* Overhand\n\n* Hook\n\n* One-Two\n\n* Back Fist\n\n* Uppercut\n\n* Whip Jab (A Very Quick Jab)\n\n==Quotes ==\n*\"Hey, you do you have 500 won?\"\n*“I don't like it when other people touch things that are mine.\"\n*\"Just you fucking wait. I'm going to take over the UFC with Taekwondo. Taekwondo is the best, do you hear me?\"<ref>[[Episode 26]]</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n\n* There are many cases of crossovers between How to Fight and Lookism, including Johan Seong.\n\n* Another crossover between How to Fight and Manager Kim, Taehoon’s father, Hansu Seong.\n\n* When Taehoon was a kid, he was saved by Manager Kim after nearly drowning.\n\n* The saying “500 won” was used from the time he and Dowoon used to go to the arcade to play video games.\n\n* The arcade game that Taehoon plays frequently, “Taekkwon 7” is based on the fighting game “Tekken 7”. The character that he uses is Hwoarang, a Taekwondo user based on ITF.\n\n* Taehoon’s personality type is ISTP.\n\n* The reason he is polite to adults is because he was beaten by Manager Kim when he was young.\n\n* After Doowoon Lee’s death, he developed insomnia, but has now gotten over it.\n\n* Taehoon’s mother comes from the national volleyball team, and Taehoon’s height was inherited from his mother rather than Taehoon’s father.\n\n* He doesn’t like perfume because he doesn’t like strong artificial scents, and he doesn’t use body lotion because he finds it annoying.\n\n* He dyes his hair at home.\n\n* He has a soft spot for harmless creatures, children, the elderly, and kind people.\n\n* He got first place in the Flexibility Test in the Physical Education Performance assessment.\n\n* Favorite Foods: Fried eggs, beef, kimchi stew, fried rice, gukbap (Korean rice & soup), grilled spam, Korean watermelon punch, candy bars, Coca-Cola, potato chip, peppermint candy.\n\n* Least favorite foods: White milk, pork belly, coriander, fruit, spicy food, foods with a unique strong flavor. It is stated the reason he doesn’t like white milk is because he thinks it will make his skin whiter\n\n*Taehoon's hometown is Busan\nTaehoon's blood type is AB\nThe most obvious ISTP of all time\n\nTi> Taehoon focuses internally, he makes decisions based on logic or his whims(Se). When there's a subject that he's interested in(like Taekwondo), he will figure out how it works and train until he masters it. He's not very talkative, whenever he says something it's blunt and direct. He processes information that he absorbs through his senses(Se) and ties it together to see the bigger picture(I'll explain at Se, his Ti-Se work together)\n\nSe> Taehoon likes taking action and doesn't seem to be scared by danger. He's impulsive and will sometimes make decisions based on his whims(that time he randomly decided to do the 1080° and wing it, but failed)\nTaehoon is also very aware of his surroundings and notices little details and connections that others don't see. Think of the time when he guessed that Yeonwoo was a Kyokushin practitioner because he noticed little details, like his knuckles, the bruises from training etc.\n\nNi> There have been multiple occasions when he 'just knew' about something,, like Jeongchan being the one who hit Yeonwoo's father, Yeonwoo being in the same situation as Dowoon, etc. Even things he had no clues about, he just guessed & it turned out to be completely right ((??? impressive)))\n\nFe> He has very little regard for what is appropriate to say, can be insensitive and offensive, has trouble expressing his feelings, also doesn't really give a damn about how his actions will affect others. He still wanted to help Dowoon and Yeonwoo despite not understanding them.\n\nFor enneagram I think he is def 8 core. He's decisive, confrontational and resourceful. His whole philosophy is about living life the way he wants and not letting anyone or anything control him, he also hates people who let themselves be controlled by others."

After having experienced the bullying that Hobin went through, he started to become more understanding towards him and started seeing him as a friend. He also started becoming more compassionate and showed genuine concern for his friends. Despite it not being obvious at first, Jihyeok is also very smart, sometimes even surprising others with his logical conclusions, like when he pointed out to Hobin and Gaeul how the prank videos were fake, based on his attention to detail. He is a realist, often showing skepticism towards Hobin's fighting methods, and is quick to point out logical inconsistencies when he sees them.Appearance\nJihyeok is a skinny male of taller-than-average height with a pale complexion. He has short straight hair with spiky ends which are parted in the middle that were most likely dyed blonde because his eyebrows are brown. He has small monolid-shaped eyes that are brown in color. Jihyeok has an unusual sense of fashion, as he is almost always seen wearing clothes which include knee-length shorts and mid-calf socks, and often wearing clothes from expensive brands.\nPersonality\nIn the beginning of the webtoon, Jihyeok was portrayed as a stereotypical bully, who would give up anything to become part of the popular crowd. His way of climbing up the school hierarchy was to target the weak, in order to make himself look more powerful. He would suck up to anyone who was considered higher than himself, in hopes of being accepted and achieving popularity. However, Jihyeok had a low tolerance when dealing with those he'd consider under himself, often responding violently when angered. He also used to be quite insensitive by saying offensive and hurtful things, sometimes without even realizing. After seeing negative reactions from the peers above him, he would quickly excuse his behavior by saying it was a mistake or a joke.\n\nJihyeok is an opportunist, who would previously try to take advantage of situations or people in order to benefit himself. As seen in early chapters, he tried using Hobin by emotionally encouraging him or using something he was in need of. However, his manipulation failed, because Hobin knew that the only reason Jihyeok would help him would be to benefit himself. He was shown to be reckless, trying to set Hobin up to fight Taehun for views, not thinking of the fact that the latter was a professional fighter.\n\nAs the story started progressing, Jihyeok's character started developing and becoming more mature. After having experienced the bullying that Hobin went through, he started to become more understanding towards him and started seeing him as a friend. He also started becoming more compassionate and showed genuine concern for his friends. Despite it not being obvious at first, Jihyeok is also very smart, sometimes even surprising others with his logical conclusions, like when he pointed out to Hobin and Gaeul how the prank videos were fake, based on his attention to detail. He is a realist, often showing skepticism towards Hobin's fighting methods, and is quick to point out logical inconsistencies when he sees them. With his development, he has started becoming more responsible, having the nature to take action under necessary situations.\nSe> Jiksae is focused on what happens in the external world. He pointed out minor details that no one noticed and they were impressed by his analysis.\nIn the beginning, he didn't think of the consequences before acting, like that time when he set Hobin up to fight Taehoon. He didn't realize how dangerous it was until he fractured a rib.\nOther than that, he loves material goods like money, expensive clothes etc.\n\nTi> Jiksae has developed since the beginning and now he thinks of the consequences before diving in. He's a realist, does in depth analysis of things and breaks down complex concepts to simple ones so they can be absorbed. He's quick to point out logical inconsistencies when Gaeul or Hobin say something.\nAn example of Se-Ti when he was explaining how the prank videos were fake;\n\n\"What you need to pay attention to are the elevator buttons in the corner. There's seven floors in total, right?\nAn elevator prank video where it takes over two minutes per person. It makes no sense that an elevator moves for 2 minutes in a seven storey building.\"\n\"This video's weird too. Why would the police dispatch like that just because a person was reported for smoking?\"\n\n^He's observant and points out when something doesn't make logical sense to him.\n\n\nFe> In the beginning he was pretty insensitive and ended up saying offensive things, even when he didn't mean to. He was willing to do anything to be part of the popular crowd. But he's actually a pretty good people-motivator, and he cares about his friends' well being(He motivated Hobin to go talk to Bomi //(even though it was just a trap//, and told him to get therapy when he was beaten up). He's good at reading people through expression or body language which I think is Se-Fe.\nHistory\nIn the beginning of the story Jihyeok used to be a cameraman for Pakgo, in hopes that it would gain him social status. Along with him, he used to regularly bully and beat up weak students such as Yoo Hobin.\n\nAfter seeing how much money people earned through NewTube, he wanted to quickly get started on making his own channel, but in order to make money he needed to use the account of an adult. After getting caught misusing his parent's personal accounts, he couldn't do that anymore, so he decided to talk Hobin into using his mother's account to stream, to which Hobin couldn't say no to. He quickly gained a following, thanks to his friendship with Pakgo and started his first gaming stream at Hobin's house. While streaming, Hobin accidentally tripped and unplugged the computer monitor cord, which caused Jihyeok to get angry and lash out at him. The two started fighting, not knowing that the camera was still recording.\n"

She tried to sabotage the relationship between Hobin Yoo and Bomi Choi when her and Hobin were buying a present for Bomi. She understands that Bomi is ahead of her right now, but she hasn't given up.

This is shown specifically with Han Gyeoul.\n\nFi> She doesn't show a lot of interest in group values and is more focused on how things affect and make her feel. She doesn't do things primarily for the sake of others or to please them.\nIn chapter 84 she tries to sabotage Hobin & Bomi's relationship which is not an Fe thing to begin with(a high Fe user would most likely try to be supportive and hide their feelings). Her guilt is more personal because she sees how Hobin is still thoughtful about her despite liking Bomi and remembers that both Bomi and him are her friends. She admitted that if it wasn't for that she would've went through with her plan. The whole speech she gave to Hobin at the fountain scene was Fi, she was putting herself on Bomi's shoes and pointed out what she would see as red flags.\nNot sure but the way she wears yellow all the time to the point it's become her iconic color could be Fi.\nShe also reacts to conflict in a different way than a high Fe user would, not breaking up fights but trying to get back at people.\n\n\nTe> She's result oriented, productive & organized when it comes to work,, She focuses on effectiveness too, whenever she talks about techniques and martial arts she uses real world data rather than her own logic and understanding. When saying that Taekwondo is an effective martial art, she mentions the sport science kick experiment and uses UFC fighters Conor McGregor and Anderson Silva as an example of successful fighters who use Taekwondo. There are lots of times where she goes all \"It's a legit technique that professional fighters use@!!@!\"\nShe's so bad at Ti though, her conclusions come out of nowhere and she fails to use consistent logical reasoning,, Like the times she assumed Hobin was flirting with her or asking her out, she seems to completely forget that Hobin likes Bomi.(could also be inferior Si?)\n\nSi inferior makes more sense because I can't really see her being an Se dom. She unintentionally ****** up her plan about fighting Gyeoul by forgetting that armbars don't work on female opponents(they do work on them too but ok I guess)\nShe also naturally went with what has been tried and proven in that fight.\nKorean\n가을펴\nEnglish\nGaeul Lee\nJapanese\n八潮秋 Yashio Aki\nNicknames\nBaby Chick\nShort Yellow Eul\n"

The story makes it a point to remind that she is very attractive and hot. Whenever she is seen walking out in public, guys turn around to stare at her, even when they're with their girlfriends. There have been numerous occasions where people keep saying that she is pretty and compliment her beauty. Bomi is so gorgeous to the point where she tries not to look pretty to avoid attention.

Despite everything she has, Bomi is seen as someone whos extremely humble.\n\nBomi is portrayed as the perfect dream girl when it comes to both appearance, personality, wealth and education. She seems to get along well with others, everyone flocks to her and she is good at handling a conversation, but she tends to avoid guys that aren't Hobin or Moonsung. Hobin would be a great sweet stay at home dad since it seems like Bomi would be the bread winner.\nBackstory\nBomi was born into a rich family, her father being a hospital director and her mother just being conventionally attractive. She has never had any struggles in her life.\n\nBomi's first meeting with Hobin happened 3 years before the main story. Her personality used to be different, she was obsessed with becoming a grown up, likely influenced by her mother. She rejected a guy older than her because he was \"too childish for her\", used big words to seem more intelligent, claimed that dating is childish and that she's more interested in researching real estate. When her father tried to tell her that it's okay for kids to be kids, she felt personally attacked and insisted that she's a grown up, being ungrateful and saying that she would move out as soon as possible to stay away from him.\n\nHobin, who had been listening to the whole conversation walks in and sticks his booger on her forehead, which angers her even more and yells at him to grow up. Bomi is so angry that she decides to follow him for the whole day to get an apology from him. But she starts to pity him around the end of the day because he is working 12 part time jobs to support his mother.\n\nThe next day, Hobin finally gets a break and Bomi gets her chance to ask him for an apology. Instead, Hobin asks her if she has apologized to her dad, to which she responds in anger, that it's none of his business. Hobin starts telling her that she's going to regret all the mean things she said to him, referencing that he has done the same and now regrets it. For once, Bomi listens and says that he acts as if he's an adult, even though he's a kid. He tells her that growing up was not a choice for him, he wishes that nobody had to grow up so they could avoid all pain and hardship.\n\nThe next time she goes to see him, Hobin is not at the hospital. The nurse tells her that his mother got discharged and he left early. Bomi starts to realize that he may have been her \"first love\" even though the two only had one short conversation.\n\nThree years later, Bomi spots Hobin working at McDonald's and decides to work there just to get closer to him.\n\nThen Bang him in a cafe later in the story\n\nEtymology\nKorean\nBomi's name is close to 봄 (bom), which means \"Spring\" in Korean.\nJapanese\nAsamiya means \"morning\" (朝) (asa) and \"temple, shrine, palace\" (宮) (miya).\nKaho means \"summer sail\" (夏帆).\nTrivia\nBomi was mistyped ENTP by the author, but her actual personality type is ISFJ.[1]\nBomi's parents look very young and attractive in comparison to other character's parents.\nPark Taejoon had 5 years to write Bomi a character and he still forgot.\nWorkers Eugene, Yuseong, Mandeok was same highschool with her."

It was implied that he had no where else to live. She claimed that Moonsung did nothing to earn his keep, thus he began doing construction work so he could earn money and move out. He prioritize that he must do as much as he could. Moonsung would survive and gain money by beating up others.\n\nIn the past, Jeongchan had performed a gang attack against Seong Taehoon and Lee Dowoon. Taehoon declared that he wanted to fight the man in the back, who happened to be Moonsung. They fought, and ultimately Moonsung lost due to Taehoon's desperate desire to save Lee Dowoon. Logan Gracie had watched the fight, commented that Moonsung shouldn't have fought a prodigy, and carried his body away.[7]\nFighting Prowess\nMunseong Kim is an up and coming MMA fighter who was trained by Logan Gracie.

Munseong also fought with Mangi Hwang and temporarily subdued him, but Mangi was able to break free from his grasp. He also fought against Hobin Yoo and knocked him out mid-fight. Munseong later protected Bomi against 244's men, successfully defeating them all.\n\nTechniques\nArmbar\nBaseball Choke\nTrivia\nKim Moonsung makes an appearance in My Life as a Loser, where he fights in a match against high school Jang Ancheol (though it ends in an interruption).

He was a prominent member of XJ company along with Seongjun Baek and was his partner in crime for the better half of the first season. After Seongjun's death, Jinho became the primary antagonist of the Viral Hit/How to fight series. Jinho has connections to prominent politicans like Taesan joo and the chief of the police, which had remained him mostly anonymous untill Seongjun's death. He is also the leader of New International Branch. He is an individual who is involved in prostitution.\nAppearance\nWhen in his NewTube alias, 244, or by his real name, Lee Jinho (as revealed by Baek Seongjun) would don a mushroom hairstyle with the sides cropped. He would also draw temporary but intricate black tattoos on his whole body and face. When live streaming or when creating a NewTube video, he usually wears a plain white shirt, black pants and matching black vans. A small cockatiel sits on his shoulder, sometimes repeating a few of his words. However, when 244 is in his \"normal appearance\", his hair is styled into an average short hairstyle and is parted in the middle. All of his tattoos are also removed which makes him almost unrecognizable even to allies and acquaintances. He has a long and angular face with a sharp nose, long chin, and long eyelashes. He is tall with broad shoulders and a muscular physique- evidence of regularly working out. He possesses the same cauliflower ears that Baek Seongjun also has, which is an evidence of him being an experienced fighter.\n\nPersonality\nWhen seen in his NewTube appearance, he appears to be a rather mysterious and carefree man who speaks in a sing-song manner on certain occasions, and acts politely. As the plot progressed on however, it's seen that he is actually a depraved psychopath with a twisted mentality and will easily kill anyone who gets in the way of his business. Being a dealer and a hired mercenary linked to the dark web, he has no qualms with doing the most heinous of inhumane deeds with an easy-going smile on his face. He's also shown to be a shrewd and ruthless businessman who easily manipulates naive targets into becoming his pawns. He will also discard someone- even a long time ally, without a second thought if they pose even a small threat to him. This was shown in the case of Baek Seongjun, who diligently worked under him and his political partner, yet was thrown away when they thought he knew much. Heartless and double faced, 244 is a pro at weaving through schemes and at eradicating his opponents. He is always cool headed, except in certain instances, where he is shown to be exceedingly shocked or angry.\nFighting Prowess\nHe seems to be an extremely experienced wrestler, even being able to win easily against boxers and giving a hard time to Newtuber Main character Hobin Yoo. He’s strong, easily defeating people like Jisu Ju at one point of the series, etc.\nTrivia\n"

He has a well toned and muscular body with visibly ripped legs and arms. Formerly, acting as the cameraman of his and his sister's newtube channel, he had his hair shaved. Later, after quitting newtube he has started growing his brown hair and it is visibly longer than it was before. He has almond shaped eyes that often make him look tired. He has a slit in his left eyebrow, and his pupils, very much like his sister are red.\n\nWangguk Han  has always sported an emotionless look on his face until it involved his sister. He was shown having an indifferent attitude and had a poker face, even when faced with danger. Wangguk is someone who primarily looks out for himself and his loved ones, and avoids risking his own well being for the sake of others. After quitting NewTube, he admits that he did feel bad for the people he and his sister had exposed, but he didn't regret doing any of that, because he needed the money made from those videos to survive.\n\nWangguk came home from school to see his sister's swollen face as a result of getting beaten up in the same way their mother was by their father. In anger, he assaulted his father with a hammer. This led to him getting sentenced to 6 years in prison. His inmates were bloodthirsty and depraved thugs who made life hell for him until he started fighting back.\n\nHe became part of CUD (Chung Ui Dae), which was a reformation program for Boxing in the juvenile detention center. He became quite invincible among the other boxers, being the only one left who had enough willpower to go through with the harsh training. This gained him the nickname \"freak\". It was in that juvenile center where he met Baek Seongjun for the first time."

Over time, these suggestions become ingrained in the person's subconscious mind, influencing their thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors even when they are not under hypnosis. Over time, hypnotic conditioning can lead to mind control over unwilling individuals, as the suggestions and commands imposed upon them during hypnosis become absolute truths in their minds."

At ground level, the sidewalks are crowded with women in high heels and sharp suits, their eyes glinting with hunger as they scan the sparse crowd of male pedestrians. Here, the financial district reigns supreme, its gleaming towers housing offices and banks where the most cunning hypnotists practice their arts. These women, masquerading as financial planners and advisors, lure men into their clutches under the guise of fiscal guidance, only to ensnare them in webs of debt and desire. Their offices are opulent temples to wealth and power, adorned with gold and black furnishings that whisper of the dark secrets hidden behind closed doors.\nThe professional offices line the inner circle of Downtown, a bastion of authority and temptation. Within these walls, the hypnotherapists of Hypnoville ply their trade, offering life-altering sessions that promise to unlock a man's deepest desires and submit them to their will. Specialized practices abound, catering to every conceivable fetish.

The tables are often occupied by groups of women, their eyes locked onto a single, entranced man, his credit card and willpower stretched to the limit under their gaze.\nAt night, the lights of Downtown twinkle like stars in a sea of darkness, drawing the inhabitants of Hypnoville like moths to a flame.

Picture-perfect lawns lead up to quaint single-family houses, each one a testament to the domestic bliss that the women in this part of Hypnoville crave and cultivate so meticulously.\nBut beneath this idyllic facade lies a secret garden of temptation and submission. The suburban streets are a minefield of hypnotic enchantments, where every neighbor could be harboring a hidden desire for dominance over the men that cross their path. Divorced enchantresses, frustrated housewives yearning for a bit of extra-marital thrill, eternally hungry cougars, and sexually liberated MILFs cast their spells from behind picket fences and manicured hedges.\nThese women, with their impeccable taste in home decor and their mastery of the swivel chair, are experts at making their suburban abodes into havens of hypnosis. Each backyard pool becomes a reflective surface for inductions, each living room couch a throne from which to dispense post-hypnotic suggestions. The parks serve as open-air classrooms for those eager to learn the art of financial domination, while the quiet cul-de-sacs are perfect for \"accidentally\" swinging a crystal pendant in front of a coveted man's eyes.\nThis is a place where the line between reality and illusion is often blurred, where everyday interactions could lead to a spiral of erotic obedience. A simple wave from across the street might be accompanied by a hidden trigger word that leaves a man putty in the hands of the sender. Shopping trips to the local grocery store become opportunities for hypno-pickups and chance encounters with seductive cashiers eager to try out their latest mind control tactics.\nIn the shadow of Hypnoville University, where the echoes of Professor Katrina's \"Advanced Seduction through Housekeeping\" lectures drift on the wind, the suburbs thrive with a unique brand of hypno-drama.

This is where the less fortunate hypno-vixens of Hypnoville reside, those who haven’t yet clawed their way to the top of the social ladder. The buildings are older, the paint peeling and the sidewalks cracked, but that doesn't mean the residents of these streets are any less skilled or determined in their pursuit of dominance.\nThis is the domain of the cunning and resourceful, where the women are forced to rely on their natural beauty and raw talent rather than the flashy luxuries of Entrancer products. In the heart of the slums, the air is suffused with the smells of cheap perfume, too much makeup, and desperation – a heady cocktail that seems to ooze from every pothole and alleyway.\nThe Slums are a melting pot of cultures and economic statuses, with trashy poor black girls and Latinas strutting alongside down-and-out white chicks, each with their own dreams of climbing the social hierarchy. These women rely heavily on their innate abilities as hypnotists rather than high-tech gadgets like the Entrancer gear favored by their more affluent counterparts. The Entrancer lingerie and contact lenses are a rare sight here, a luxury that only the richest can afford. Instead, the denizens of the Slums hone their craft with simple, yet effective, crystal pendants dangling between their tits.\nOn the outskirts, a trailer park serves as a makeshift haven for the true bottom feeders – the \"trailer trash\" of Hypnoville. Here, white girls with bleached hair and fake nails congregate, trading stories and tips on how to snare a man with deep pockets. They're rough around the edges, but their seductive Southern drawls and generous figures belie their desperate intentions.\nGold diggers are more common than average in these parts, their eyes always on the lookout for the next sugar daddy to sweep them off their feet and into a world of comfort they could never afford on their own. Yet amidst the grime and struggle, a sense of camaraderie exists – a mutual understanding that in Hypnoville, the only way to climb the social ladder is through the power of the hypnotic gaze.\nThe Slums may lack the polish or elegance of the other areas of Hypnoville, but they make up for it in sheer tenacity. There's a certain allure to the danger lurking around every corner, a siren's song promising power and pleasure to those who dare to venture into the depths of this urban jungle."

Their youthful energy is matched only by their insatiable hunger for submission and adoration.\nDivorcées and MILFs, their pockets lined with alimony checks, prowl the local establishments, seeking new conquests to fill the void left by their former spouses. These seasoned enchantresses know exactly what buttons to press, what levers to pull, to ensnare even the most jaded of men in their thrall. With a flick of their hair or a batting of their eyelashes, they can reduce the strongest of wills to quivering mush.\nCougars stalk the shadows of the Gated Communities, their eyes gleaming with the wisdom of age and the fire of unbridled lust. They crave the fresh meat of younger men, eager to impart the lessons they've learned during their time in Hypnoville. Their homes are often filled with the spoils of past relationships, trophies of their hypnotic conquests displayed as a warning to any who might dare to cross them.\nThe community is a labyrinth of temptation, where every corner could lead to a new hypnotic adventure. It's a place where a visitor might just find himself enjoying an unexpected afternoon delight with a tantalizing MILF, or perhaps at a dinner party where he's the main course. Or maybe, just maybe, he'll become the pawn in a game played by two rival hypnotists, eager to prove their superiority over one another."

Neon lights pulse with the rhythm of entrancing spirals, bathing the pavements in kaleidoscopic color. The audaciously dressed inhabitants strut their stuff with confidence and grace, each woman a master of her own hypnotic artistry. The air is thick with the tantalizing scent of pheromone perfumes and the occasional whiff of sex, an olfactory testament to the primal desires that fuel this part of town.\nBrothels stand proudly, their windows displaying the most exquisite specimens of female hypnosis. Within, men line up, wallets bulging with cash, eager to lose themselves in the embrace of a skilled enchantress. Each establishment boasts its unique brand of hypno-sensuality, from the soft whispers of love slavery lounges to the firm commands of strict disciplinarian dens. The streets are lined with freelance hypnotic hookers, their piercing gazes searching for their next mark amidst the throngs of tourists and locals alike. Their smiles are sweet, their intentions deadly, as they lure potential clients into alleyways or back to their own lairs with promises of unparalleled pleasure.\nStrip clubs abound, each more decadent than the last. The stages are alive with the mesmerizing gyrations of hypnotic dancers, their bodies moving in time with the strobe lights that flash in patterns designed to entrance and ensnare. The music thumps through the air, a low bass line that seems to resonate with the very core of one's being, drawing patrons further into a world of visual and auditory suggestion. Here, the currency isn’t just money; it's also the power of the mind, as dancers coax and tease their viewers into heightened states of arousal before delivering the final blow of hypnotic surrender.\nDominatrix offices are discreet yet distinctive, their doors often adorned with the symbol of the crystal pendulum swinging above a leather chair—a silent promise of the sublime submission that awaits within. Inside, the walls are lined with various tools of the trade: whips, chains, gags, and, most importantly, glittering arrays of hypnosis devices to aid in the breaking of the male will. These powerful women revel in the opportunity to shape minds, turning their clients into living breathing manifestations of their deepest fantasies.\nThe Porn Studios of the Red Light District are hubs of sexual energy, their walls vibrating with the moans and gasps of actors and actresses lost in the throes of passion—and deeper still, the throbbing power of hypnosis. Directors and producers scour the town for fresh faces, eager to cast them in their latest brain-twisting epics. The allure of fame and fortune is a potent lure for many men, who sign away their free will for a chance at stardom in the world of hypnotic adult entertainment.\nOnlyFans girls are another attraction, lounging in their windowsills, broadcasting their lives to devoted followers across the globe. Their homes double as film sets, where they perform increasingly risky and erotic acts for the delight of their online fans. They are the queens of self-promotion, using their natural charm and honed hypnosis skills to keep their subscribers coming back for more—and often much, much more.\nThe Spiral Strip is a place where every shadow holds the promise of a new obsession and every smile hides a secret trigger waiting to be sprung. It's a veritable playground for the discerning hypno-connoisseur, where desires are bought and sold as freely as the air one breathes. Whether it's a quick tryst with a talented trickster or a lifelong commitment to a harem of hypnotic harlots, there's something for everyone in the Red Light District of Hypnoville. But remember, nothing comes without a price—here, the cost is one's free will. "

Its ivy-covered walls hide the darker curriculum taught within its classrooms. The university is renowned for churning out some of the most accomplished and feared hypnotists in the land. The Mayor insists that every new female resident of Hypnoville must enroll and pass with flying colors before they can truly call themselves citizens. Under the watchful eye of Headmistress Serena, the college is a hotbed of intellectual and sensual exploration. Students here are not just taught the art of hypnosis, but the subtle nuances of controlling and shaping the male psyche. Professor Amara's Financial Dominance 101 turns timid young women into ruthless money mistresses, while Professor Evelyn's Mind Control Masterclass shows them how to plant the seeds of obsession and addiction in their future subjects. Classes like Sexual Interrogation Techniques and Advanced Breast Worship are mandatory for all aspiring enchantresses. Headmistress Serena is a stern but fair leader, her sharp features and cold, calculating gaze sending a shiver down the spines of even the most confident newcomers. With her iron grip on the university, she ensures that every student is transformed into a dominant hypnotist capable of wringing every last drop of submission from their willing – or soon-to-be-willing – male prey. The students of Hypnoville University are a diverse group, from innocent young things eager to learn the ropes to seasoned cougars refining their skills. They all share one common goal: to become the ultimate seductresses, weaving webs of hypnosis that ensnare men and bend their desires to their will. The university's motto, \"Knowledge is Power,\" is more than just words; it's a way of life that permeates every corner of the campus."

          "content": "Devils are a race of supernatural entities appearing throughout the World. They are creatures that feed upon humanity's fears. Devils are born in Hell. All Devils are born with a \"name\" that correlates to a concept. These can range from highly tangible (Fish, Tomato) to entirely abstract (Future, Curse). The concept does not have to refer to something that exists; there is no indication that ghosts, zombies or angels exist in the world, yet all these names have corresponding Devils. Each name is unique to its respective Devil, though some overlap based on specificity is possible as there have been both a War Devil and a World War II Devil. Devils manifest according to the collective consciousness surrounding their names (for example: the Gun Devil appears to be constructed out of guns and has gun related abilities). They are the embodiment of the fear that \"name\" represents, so as long as that \"name\" instills fear, they continue to reincarnate.\n\nThe concept of a Devil itself doesn’t have to be scary on its own, rather its power relies on how much of a scary image it has in the popular consciousness of humans. For example, cars aren’t necessarily scary on their own, but Makima states that a Car Devil would be powerful because of the scariness of car crashes and other car related incidents. Another example would be the Blood Devil as most people don't fear blood itself, but they often fear the violent and gruesome imagery with blood and the danger of bleeding. Devils that die in Hell reappear in the human world; Devils that die in the human world reappear in Hell. Devils cannot recall any memories from their previous lives and their entire personality resets. Despite their reincarnation abilities, Devils are not completely immortal; as they are born out of humanity's fear of some concept, if all of humanity forgets the existence of this concept, the Devil it belongs to completely ceases to exist."

Other Devils, such as the Fox Devil or the Octopus Devil, don't appear to have these features (at least on what parts of them have been shown). Devils do not reproduce as most organisms do, instead simply \"appearing\" in Hell. What criteria, if any, cause a Devil to be born are completely unknown.\n\nDevils who are friendly and are more inclined to humans will take on a very humanoid form in the natural state of their incarnation, some being indistinguishable from a human save from some subtle tells. There have still been some non-humanoid Devils who have been friendly towards humans such as the Fox Devil."

For that reason, while Devils and Fiends can also consume other kinds of foods, such as vegetables and fruits, most refuse to live off of them, since it will not heal their wounds or give them more power. It is unclear whether or not their blood is properly nourishing to them, but given consistent remarks that they have a terrible or unusual taste, it's likely that Hybrids aren't as nourishing to Devils as humans (despite being mostly human)."

Presumably, a fragmented Devil cannot be fully killed and begin reincarnation until either all of its flesh pieces are destroyed or just their core. Since the Gun Devil is the only example of extensive fragmentation and was more of a primal force than an intelligent being from the 20% of it seen, it is unknown if such Flesh Pieces retain the personality of the original, each have separate personalities, all lack distinct personalities, or if it varies from Devil to Devil.

Other Devils outright choose to become Devil Hunters, allowing them to live in human society and buy food with the money that they make. As a general guideline, the more human the Devil looks, the more friendly they tend to behave. However it is worth noting that Devils do not have human rights and therefore there is no legal repercussions if they are killed by a human. For that reason, some Devils and Fiends are coerced into helping humans out of fear of dying rather than doing it out of their own free will. Devil Hunters will sometimes capture Devils to use them for contracts, the Future Devil is a good example.\n\nWhile uncommon, it is possible for a human and a Devil/Fiend to form an emotional bond. In some rare cases it might even develop into a romantic relationship."

Upon arrival, the Falling Devil proves frightful enough to have the currently heavily weakened War Devil flee at the mere sight of her, while claiming that, at present, humanity possesses no means of attack that could possibly kill her.\n\nHowever, despite their immense power, the Primal Devils are shown to not be untouchable nor above every single Devil (or at least the threat of coming under another Devil's influence), as the Falling Devil was revealed to be working for and under the control of the Famine Devil."

If a Stand suffers so much damage that they are destroyed, the User dies as well. This includes immortal beings, like Vampires. However, a User can survive with their Stand destroyed, if the Stand is automatic or depending on the level of the User's injury. Inversely, some Stands can survive beyond their Users through exceptional abilities like Notorious B.I.G.\n\nSince a Stand is the form of its User's psych, they share an intimate psychic bond. First and foremost, Stands usually obey their Users' command without question. If a User demands it, the Stand will perform any task within its capacities, which includes attacking someone, defending the User, or any miscellaneous order. In the case a Stand is sentient, they can occasionally advise their User that an order is unwise but will carry it on all the same.

Even the Homo sapiens of Earth will have no issue living on Terra if they are somehow brought into it. Terra's environment, however, is notably more arid and inhospitable than Earth's.\n\nTerra is located in the Zobeide Nebula on a planetary system centered on a main sequence star similar to the Sun and has two natural satellites (i.e. moons) known as the Twin Moons in various folklore.\n\nTerra is strongly hinted at to be a former space colony that was terraformed by an advanced space-faring civilization, but was later abandoned for more than 13,000 years due to unknown disasters that wiped out said civilization. As a matter of fact, Terra possesses many remnants of architectures built by the previous civilization. For example, one of the Twin Moons is said to be an artificial satellite. Another remnant of the previous civilization is the Starpod.\n\nWithin Terra, there are also hidden threats that could easily wipe out its civilizations. To start with, the planet is filled with Catastrophes that force many Terrans to adopt a nomadic way of life through nomadic cities. A crystalline substance known as Originium is left behind at the site of Catastrophes and is widely used as a source of energy and the catalyst for Originium Arts, but is capable of causing Oripathy through direct or prolonged exposure.

          "content": "Geography of Terra in Arknights Expanded\n\nTerra the planet central to the Arknights universe presents a geographical tapestry as vast and unforgiving as its history defined by a sprawling supercontinent that dominates its surface interspersed with scattered oceans and shrouded by the enigmatic Barrier a celestial dome sealing it from the stars. This supercontinent a colossal landmass of unnamed continents fused by tectonic upheavals stretches across arid expanses fertile oases and treacherous biomes shaped by relentless Catastrophes hyper storms infused with originium and cosmic energies that sculpt the land with apocalyptic fervor. Much of Terra remains uncharted its terra incognita veiled by environmental perils and the limits of nomadic exploration leaving vast swathes as enigmatic as the precursor ruins dotting its crust. The interplay of aridity fertility and subterranean mysteries alongside the stark boundaries of known and unknown realms crafts a world where geography is both a cradle and a crucible for its inhabitants.\n\nSupercontinental Expanse and Arid Dominance\n\nTerras surface is primarily defined by a single massive supercontinent an amalgamation of landmasses whose boundaries blur under the weight of nomadic migrations and Catastrophic reshaping. This supercontinent spans diverse biomes but is predominantly arid with golden deserts and sun scorched badlands stretching across its heart particularly in regions like Sargon and Kazdel. These arid zones characterized by dunes that shift with each Catastrophe and cracked earth baking under a relentless sun dominate the planetary landscape rendering agriculture a Sisyphean task for most Terrans. Sparse vegetation such as thorny succulents and originium adapted cacti clings to life in these wastes sustained by rare oases that bubble from deep aquifers or seasonal wadis that carve fleeting paths through the sand. These deserts are not barren wastelands but dynamic ecosystems where saurian raiders and perrero caravans navigate by starlight and mirage their paths guided by ancient precursor waystones that hum with latent energies.\n\nDespite the arid tyranny fertile regions punctuate the supercontinent particularly near bodies of water where temperate and tropical biomes flourish. Central Terra home to the imperial heartland of Victoria boasts the most fertile lands with rolling moors verdant valleys and mist cloaked meadows fed by subterranean springs and predictable rainfall. Victorias fertility supports sprawling estates and nomadic agricultural platforms that cultivate grains and root crops sustaining its dense population and fueling its industrial ambitions. The regions temperate climate with mild winters and warm summers fosters biodiversity from grazing caprinae herds to liberi flocks that nest in ancient oaks their migrations a vital part of the ecological balance.\n\nThe Sea of Clariside and Coastal Biomes\n\nA defining feature of Terras geography is the Sea of Clariside a vast inland sea cradled between southern Victoria northern Iberia the Siestan peninsula and the Acahuallan region to the southwest. This body of water a shimmering expanse of turquoise and emerald serves as a climatic fulcrum creating sub tropical and wet tropical biomes along its shores. The seas humid breath fosters lush rainforests in Acahualla where towering ferns and bioluminescent fungi thrive alongside reptilia hunters and the mangrove choked deltas of northern Iberia where seaborn incursions leave eerie traces in the tides. Siestas peninsula a sun drenched enclave of Columbian influence basks in Mediterranean like warmth its palm fringed coasts and coral lagoons hosting vibrant marine life and seasonal fiestas that mask underlying espionage. Southern Victorias shores moderated by the seas currents support orchards and vineyards their bounty traded across nomadic sea routes. The Sea of Clariside also serves as a vital trade artery with floating markets and mobile docks linking coastal settlements though its depths harbor precursor relics and abyssal anomalies that deter deep exploration.\n\nBeyond the inland sea Terras oceans cluster primarily in the southern reaches notably south of Iberia and Yan where the Aegir nation reigns in submerged citadels. These southern oceans vast and tempestuous are roiled by currents influenced by the Twin Moons whose gravitational dance amplifies tidal surges. The Profound Silence a cataclysmic event marked by devastating tsunamis reshaped these coastlines flooding Iberian ports and leaving sunken cities as haunting reminders of natures wrath. The altered shores now jagged with salt encrusted cliffs and submerged ruins host hardy fishing communities and aegir outposts that navigate the perilous waves. Other coastal regions include the northern shores of Bolívar where cloud forests meet rocky beaches and the northeastern coasts of Higashi where volcanic black sand beaches frame samurai enclaves. These coastlines though vital for trade and resources remain alien to most landlocked Terrans whose nomadic cities rarely venture to the seas edge rendering the ocean a realm of myth and mystery for non Aegir races.\n\nSubterranean Realms and the Durin Enigma\n\nBeneath Terras surface lies a labyrinthine subterranean world largely uncharted and dominated by the Durin race diminutive bat like Terrans who thrive in darkness. These underground networks sprawling cave systems and precursor engineered tunnels honeycomb the supercontinents crust illuminated by the faint glow of originium veins and bioluminescent fungi. The Durin inhabit vast cavern cities carved into stalactite studded chambers their echolocation arts mapping mineral deposits and ancient relics. These subterranean realms stretch beneath regions like Ursus and Sargon connecting distant surface cities through forgotten passages though their full extent remains unknown even to Rhodes Island explorers. Anomalous phenomena such as gravitational distortions and temporal echoes hint at precursor technologies buried within possibly linked to the Barriers origins. The Durins insular culture guards these secrets sharing little with surface dwellers though their trade in rare ores fuels industrial hubs like Rim Billiton.\n\nThe subterranean worlds inaccessibility stems from its environmental hazards collapsing tunnels originium laced air and predatory megafauna adapted to eternal night. Surface expeditions often meet ruin in these depths with only specialized operators like Durin or Saria navigating their perils. Rumors persist of deeper layers vast hollows where precursor megastructures pulse with dormant energies or where seaborn entities have breached from abyssal rifts creating hybrid ecosystems of terrifying vitality. These uncharted depths remain Terras last internal frontier a mirror to the planets cosmic isolation under the Barrier.\n\nBorders of the Known The Foehn Hotlands and Infy Icefield\n\nThe edges of Terras charted world are marked by two formidable regions the Foehn Hotlands in Sargon and the Infy Icefield spanning Sami and Ursus. The Foehn Hotlands a sweltering expanse of geysers salt flats and volcanic fissures forms a southern barrier where temperatures soar and originium dust storms scour the landscape. This region a crucible of pyroclast forges and saurian warbands serves as a natural fortress its geothermal vents and lava rivers deterring all but the most determined explorers. Ancient precursor obelisks half buried in ash hint at lost outposts but their purpose remains elusive. The Hotlands borderlands fade into terra incognita a realm of uncharted deserts where nomadic tribes whisper of mirage shrouded cities that vanish with the dawn.\n\nThe Infy Icefield a frozen wasteland of glaciers and auroral veils stretches across Terras northern reaches encompassing Samis mystical tundras and Ursus militarized taiga. Blizzards laced with originium shards and subzero temperatures render the Icefield a deadly frontier where even ursus clans tread cautiously. Sami shamans navigate its ice caves guided by auroral spirits while Ursus outposts fortify against polar megafauna. Beyond the Icefield lies a continental sized crater like region an unexplored abyss shrouded in perpetual mists and electromagnetic anomalies. Known only through fragmented lore this crater is theorized as the source of northern Collapsals otherworldly entities or phenomena that emerge during Catastrophes their origins tied to cosmic rifts or precursor experiments gone awry. The craters inaccessibility and the Icefields harshness ensure it remains Terras greatest enigma a void that swallows expeditions and fuels apocalyptic prophecies.\n\nOther Biomes and Uncharted Frontiers\n\nBeyond the supercontinents core and its coastal fringes Terra hosts diverse biomes shaped by local conditions and Catastrophic cycles. The steppes of Kazdel vast grasslands scarred by crimson sands support nomadic sarkaz warcamps their herds of hardy beasts grazing on originium tolerant grasses. Leithaniens enchanted forests dense with arcane flora and mist wreathed glades harbor witch covens and mobile academies their canopies alive with liberi scouts. Kjerags alpine fjords and avalanche prone peaks cradle caprinae clans in geothermal warmed longhouses their forges fueled by volcanic springs. Bolívars thunderous highlands where cloud forests cling to lightning scarred sierras host revolutionary camps their mist shrouded trails concealing guerrilla movements. Higashis fungal groves humid and spore laden foster oni villages where bamboo and bioluminescent mushrooms create eerie landscapes patrolled by reptilia assassins.\n\nThe uncharted regions terra incognita extend beyond the Foehn Hotlands and Infy Icefield encompassing vast swathes of the supercontinent where Catastrophes have obliterated maps and memory. These include the western barrens beyond Rim Billiton where dust storms bury precursor spires and the eastern highlands past Yan where draconic leylines pulse with untapped energies. The southern oceans depths controlled by Aegir hide abyssal trenches where seaborn hive minds evolve in isolation their surface raids hinting at submerged continents or sunken precursor fleets. Northern taigas beyond the crater fade into frozen wastelands where auroral anomalies distort time and space suggesting rifts to other dimensions or echoes of Earthly realms.\n\nGeographical Impacts and Nomadic Adaptation\n\nTerras geography profoundly shapes its societies with nomadic cities colossal mobile platforms on treads or anti grav cushions designed to evade Catastrophes dominating civilization. These cities like Londinium in Victoria or Lungmen in Yan traverse fertile plains or skirt desert edges guided by meteorological oracles who predict storm paths. Coastal settlements like Dossoles in Iberia rely on buoyant platforms to weather tsunamis while inland hubs like Kazimierz build coliseums on stable plateaus. The Sea of Clarisides trade routes foster economic hubs but also expose them to seaborn threats requiring fortified harbors. The subterranean Durin cities insulated from surface storms trade rare minerals but risk collapse from tectonic shifts or originium leaks.\n\nThe Barriers presence a tropospheric dome at six thousand one hundred fifty two point three one meters seals Terra from orbital exploration rendering its skies a false canopy. This isolation amplifies the supercontinents significance as the sole stage for Terran life its uncharted regions both a challenge and a lure for explorers like Rhodes Island. The Zobedie Nebulas violet haze tints Terras sunsets while the Twin Moons one artificial one natural drive tidal and cultural cycles their phases dictating festivals and migrations. The looming black hole beyond the nebula a distant but growing threat underscores the urgency of charting Terras mysteries before cosmic forces redraw its map entirely.\n\nThis geographical framework arid yet fertile bounded yet boundless defines Terras essence a world where every horizon hides wonders and terrors where nomadic resilience meets the unyielding unknown and where the land itself narrates a saga of survival and discovery."

          "content": "Fauna\n\nThe fauna of Terra have notable stark differences to our world in which they possess chimeric traits. As differentiation with the animal-like Terrans, most of them have the suffix \"beast\". Some of the notable Terran fauna are:\n\n    Large gastropods known as \"Originium slugs\"\n    Large bear-like carnivores known as \"Manglerbeasts\"\n    Crustacean \"metal crabs\" and \"gloompincers\"\n    Badger-like \"sand beasts\"\n    Arachnid \"rock spiders\"\n    Slumberfoots: Tapir-like animals living around the deserts that could cause soporific effect on nearby organisms through their digestive glands.[6]\n    Needleflies: Giant arthropods resembling scorpions and dragonfly nymphs. They have the ability to ambush in sand and attack their prey with their stingers.\n    Goat-like leporibeasts and mossback beast\n    Cloudbeasts: Cat-like mammals with horns of a goat. They are noted to be domesticated as pets.\n    Beckbeast: Mammals resembling a mix of a dog and a mole that is widely used as police dogs.\n    Sandbeast: Rodents who lives in deserts.\n    Musbeast: Squirrel-like rodents with feathers. Originally from Sargon, they are adopted by the Terrans as pets but have recently become city pests that destroy infrastructures caused by abandoned pets.\n\nTerra also have umbrella terms for animals acting as analogues of Earth animals but with various traits:\n\n    Burdenbeasts: \"Burdenbeast\" is an umbrella term for any animal used as a beast of burden by the Terrans. They are usually large, omnivorous animals —generally 210–240 cm tall in compassion of an average adult Terran— resembling rhinoceroses in Earth, but some species also have the characteristics of a tapir and the extinct Ceratopsians. They have flat horns in front of their noses, similar to a Megacerops, which is used to dig out roots and tubers from the soil. Their general lack of flexibility is compensated by their thick fur or skin, which allows them to withstand most small/medium-sized predators. Even the skin inside their mouths is thick enough for them to safely bypass the defense mechanisms of many plants (i.e. the spikes of a cactus). Although burdenbeasts are omnivores, their diet mostly consists of plants and cacti. Their feces vary in shape depending on the food they eat, and are used as both territory marks and fertilizer.\n    Clawbeast: An umbrella term for any wild animal with sharp claws. One of them, the chitotex clawbeasts, are Glyptodonts-like animals with turtle shells. Another kind of clawbeasts, the arma-clawbeast, are carnivores with social structures that burrow underground and build their nests around Originium veins.\n    Fowlbeast: Avians. There are many kinds of fowlbeasts inhabiting Terra with some having unique traits. The stinkfowl are raven-like birds with dazzling silver and black feathers that has the ability to secrete stinky fluid onto their enemies.[10] Another kind of fowls in Rim Billiton could fly up to 4,000 above sea level, and in a particular site, some of them evolved into giant flightless bird with robust speed after they were abandoned by their migratory ancestors.\n    Cystybeast: Dairy animals (e.g. cows). The milk they produced is usually called \"cystymilk.\"\n    Tuskbeast: Large carnivorous animals\n    Fangbeast: Carnivorous animals\n    Vesperwing: Bats\n    Gnawbeast: Rats, rodents\n    Scalebass/Fins: Fishes\n    Shells: Crustaceans and shellfishes"

          "content": "Civilization Politics and Culture of Terra in Arknights\n\nCivilization on Terra a planet of relentless Catastrophes and originium driven progress unfolds as a saga of resilience born from the ashes of a lost golden age. Approximately thirteen thousand years ago Terra then a nascent world inhabited by the ethereal Teekaz was transformed by the Predecessors an advanced possibly extraterrestrial civilization whose mastery of planetary engineering hyperspace travel and terraforming reshaped the barren orb into a vibrant biosphere. Their crowning achievements included the construction of one of Terras Twin Moons an artificial satellite of enigmatic purpose and the Barrier or Starpod a tropospheric dome sealing the planet from cosmic exploration. This precursor epoch left towering spires subterranean vaults and originium infused relics but ended abruptly in a cosmic calamity speculated to be a dimensional rift stellar incursion or plague that erased the Predecessors leaving no memories only ruins. From this void emerged the Ancients animal like Terrans such as Cautus and Felines and the Elders mythical races like Sankta and Draco who wove new civilizations from fragmented technologies and nascent originium arts. These early societies tribal and nomadic laid the foundations for Terras modern nations their cultures shaped by survival against Catastrophes and the creeping threat of Oripathy the crystalline disease born of originium exposure.\n\nPolitical Structures and Geopolitical Dynamics\n\nTerras political landscape is a fractured mosaic of monarchies oligarchies and theocratic enclaves rooted in ancient traditions and hardened by territorial ambitions. The Sargonian monarchical system established in the dawn of the common era by pharaoh like rulers in Sargons dune seas set a precedent for centralized power adopted by many Terran nations. Victoria with its lion maned Aslan nobility evolved this into a feudal empire of dukes and barons centered in the nomadic megacity of Londinium where parliamentary intrigues mask royal decrees. Leithanien blends arcane oligarchy with baroque monarchy its witch kings and alchemical councils ruling from drifting academies over enchanted forests. Laterano a theocratic republic governed by Sankta notaries enforces divine law through haloed legates its nomadic basilicas radiating spiritual and martial authority. Ursus a tsarist autocracy forged in frozen tundras wields militaristic might from lumbering fortresses its emperors crushing dissent in originium rich mines. These systems contrast with Samis decentralized shamanic tribes who commune with auroral spirits in icebound councils and Yans bureaucratic empire where draconic mandarins balance chi infused governance with imperial edicts from pagoda topped city ships.\n\nHigashi adopted Yans meritocratic feudalism evolving it into a shogunate where samurai clans and oni magistrates uphold honor codes amidst fungal groves. Columbia the sole federal republic brands itself democratic but its presidency is swayed by corporate giants like Rhine Lab and Blacksteel Worldwide their skyscraper clad cities like Siesta pulsing with surveillance and ambition. True democracy remains elusive across Terra as even Columbias elections lack transparency serving oligarchic interests over the masses. The geopolitical stage mirrors Earths pre World War I era with empires like Victoria and Ursus expanding unchecked clashing in proxy wars and territorial grabs. The War of the Four Nations from 1029 to 1031 a brutal conflict pitting Victoria Gaul Leithanien and Ursus saw Gauls annihilation leaving a power vacuum that Ursus filled with aggressive expansion. The Profound Silence of 1038 a tsunami driven Catastrophe crippled Iberia shifting heartland dynamics further.\n\nAmid this turmoil peacekeeping efforts persist. Lateranos Legati diplomatic envoys armed with sanctified firearms mediate disputes while NGOs like Rhodes Island a pharmaceutical ark for the Oripathy infected broker ceasefires and aid marginalized communities. These efforts struggle against internal strife rebellions like the Reunion Movements infected uprisings and external threats ignored by insular nations. The Seaborn an abyssal hive mind rising from southern oceans and the Collapsals eldritch entities from the northern Infy Icefield loom as existential dangers yet receive scant attention as nations grapple with borders and resources.\n\nNation States and the Terran Heartland\n\nTerras nation states are cultural amalgams blending Earthly parallels with fantastical twists their borders fluid as nomadic cities traverse Catastrophe scarred landscapes. The Terran heartland traditionally Victoria Gaul Leithanien Iberia and Laterano represents the geopolitical core defined by fertile central lands and historical dominance. Victoria evokes British imperialism with gothic spires and tea rituals its nomadic capital Londinium a steel behemoth of class divides and revolutionary whispers. Leithanien merges Germanic and arcane aesthetics its mobile academies weaving arts and intrigue across misty moors. Iberia once a maritime power akin to Spain now reels from the Profound Silences floods its sunken ports guarded by seaborn wary survivors. Laterano a Vatican like theocracy radiates Sankta piety its basilicas drifting on sanctified treads. Gauls fall in 1031 left a void Ursus swiftly filled its bear like tsars dominating tundras and mines with iron fisted zeal.\n\nBeyond the traditional heartland Kazimierz a knightly realm of Polish inspired chivalry hosts jousting coliseums on golden plains its corporate knights vying for glory. Yan an ancient empire of Chinese draconic heritage governs from jade clad city ships its poetry and chi arts shaping a stoic yet expansionist ethos. Columbia a federation of American flavored city states pushes into heartland politics with economic clout and military drones its neon lit Siesta masking corporate espionage. Sargon blends Mesoamerican pyramids and Middle Eastern nomadism its desert tribes and pharaohs trading spices and relics across dune seas. Sami a northern wilderness of auroral mysticism unites shamanic tribes in yurts circling hot springs their rites warding off Collapsal incursions. Ursus militaristic sprawl and Bolívars revolutionary highlands further diversify the geopolitical tapestry the latter channeling Andean guerilla spirit against colonial remnants. Higashi a Japanese inspired shogunate of samurai and oni thrives in fungal groves while Minos a Minoan labyrinth of bovine citadels guards Aegean like isles. Rim Billiton a resource stripped frontier fuels industrial powers with coal and originium its rigs rolling through dust choked wastes.\n\nScience and Technology in a Post Precursor Era\n\nTerras technological landscape a blend of ingenuity and regression reflects the cataclysmic loss of precursor knowledge. The Predecessors left marvels like the Starpod anti gravity platforms and originium reactors but their erasure left modern Terrans to rediscover arts driven engineering. Current technology parallels Earths late 20th century with advancements in AI controlled robots unmanned aerial and ground vehicles and colossal nomadic cities powered by originium fusion. These cities like Lungmens neon clad sprawl or Londiniums steam driven bulk roam to evade Catastrophes their treads and anti grav cushions marvels of mobility. Steam powered power armors worn by Victorian knights and Ursus shock troops amplify melee combat blending industrial might with feudal aesthetics.\n\nYet critical gaps persist. Shipbuilding lags due to Seaborn threats in southern oceans limiting nautical exploration to Aegir submersibles and Iberian buoyed platforms. High altitude flight is impossible as the Starpod at six thousand one hundred fifty two point three one meters disrupts aerodynamics and navigation. Terras unique geological makeup lacks Earths chemical compounds like sulfur for gunpowder relying instead on originium for explosives and arts based firearms. Originium a double edged mineral powers everything from medical scanners to city reactors but its volatility and Oripathy risk constrain its use. Rhine Labs breakthrough in 1099 when Kristen Wright breached the Starpod opened new avenues for aerospace research revealing glimpses of the Zobedie Nebula and sparking debates on cosmic exploration though most Terrans remain grounded by practical needs and Catastrophe fears.\n\nWarfare and Originium Driven Combat\n\nTerran warfare fuses archaic and arcane with cold weapons dominating battlefields alongside originium enhanced technologies. Swords spears shields and crossbows crafted with precursor alloys or volcanic glass remain staples wielded by knights in Kazimierz or samurai in Higashi. Gigantic military landships mobile fortresses akin to naval dreadnoughts rumble across steppes and deserts their originium cannons unleashing devastating barrages. These behemoths like Ursus Iron Fortress or Victorias Crown Sentinel serve as command hubs and siege engines their treads crushing terrain reshaped by Catastrophes.\n\nFirearms though revolutionary are rare and originium dependent functioning as arts amplifiers rather than chemical weapons. Sankta excel in patron firearms rifles and pistols that channel their haloed arts firing originium projectiles with preternatural precision as seen in operators like Exusiai. Non Sankta firearms reverse engineered by groups like Blacksteel are costly and less effective their arts mechanisms clunky compared to Sankta designs. Explosives also rely on originium compounds volatile yet powerful used in grenades and mines by operators like Frostleaf. This scarcity elevates melee prowess with races like Ursus and Forte leveraging brute strength and Lupo and Felines relying on agility. The interplay of traditional and arts based warfare creates a dynamic battlefield where strategy hinges on terrain mobility and originium mastery.\n\nAstronomy and the Starpods Veil\n\nTerras astronomical pursuits are stunted by the Starpod a precursor barrier that cloaks the sky distorting starlight and blocking orbital access. This celestial cage renders traditional astronomy nearly impossible as constellations shimmer unreliably through the Barriers haze. Iberian sailors once reliant on celestial navigation abandoned it for Aegir derived technologies like lighthouses and sonar buoys their coastal routes marked by bioluminescent signals. Sami shamans interpret auroral patterns as spiritual omens not scientific data while Yanese astrologers divine chi flows from lunar phases bypassing stellar charts. Columbian scientist Stephensons dismissal of high altitude exploration reflects Terras pragmatic disinterest in the cosmos grounded by immediate survival needs.\n\nThe 1099 breach by Kristen Wright of Rhine Lab a historic puncture of the Starpod via experimental arts propulsion marked a turning point. The resulting aperture allowed fleeting observations of the Zobedie Nebula and distant Talos igniting scientific curiosity. Researchers now study the Twin Moons one natural one artificial for clues to precursor intents while the looming black hole in the nebula fuels apocalyptic theories. Yet astronomical progress remains nascent as Catastrophes and Oripathy divert resources leaving the stars a distant dream.\n\nCultural Tapestry and Earthly Echoes\n\nTerras cultures weave a vibrant mosaic echoing Earths traditions while rooted in its unique racial and environmental dynamics. Yan celebrates Chinese inspired Spring Festivals with dragon dances and ancestral altars its poetry and idioms shaping philosophical discourse. Victoria channels British sensibilities with tea ceremonies gothic literature and rigid social hierarchies its cultural dominance spreading through colonial legacies. Columbia mirrors American pop culture with neon lit arcades reality shows and corporate driven individualism its Siestan fiestas blending freedom with surveillance. Higashis samurai codes and comic traditions evoke Japan while Samis auroral rites and Ursus militaristic ballets reflect Nordic and Russian influences. Iberias maritime festivals once vibrant now wane post Profound Silence their seaborn haunted shores hosting solemn vigils. Lateranos Christmas like festivals and Sauin Halloween analogs blend piety with universal revelry while Minos labyrinthine rites echo Minoan mysticism.\n\nVictorian culture reigns supreme its literature fashion and etiquette permeating heartland nations a legacy of Gauls fallen dominance. Yanese poetry Ursus vodka toasts and Higashi manga remain influential but face erosion from political upheavals and Catastrophe driven displacement. Rhodes Island fosters a syncretic culture uniting races in shared struggle against Oripathy its operators celebrating diverse traditions from Cautus carrot feasts to Draco fire dances. Terras dating system mirrors the Gregorian calendar with years counted from an unspecified epoch the Main Theme spanning 1096 to 1098 a testament to structured timekeeping amid chaotic existence. This cultural richness tempered by survival and stigma binds Terrans in a shared narrative of resilience and reinvention.\n\nSocietal Challenges and the Unseen Threats\n\nTerras societies grapple with internal and external pressures that threaten their fragile order. Oripathy the crystalline plague infects millions stigmatizing victims and fueling movements like Reunion which demand equity through rebellion. Nomadic cities while engineering marvels strain resources as populations swell requiring constant migration to evade Catastrophes. The heartlands political rivalries spark proxy wars and espionage with Columbias economic incursions clashing against Ursus militarism and Victorias imperial pride. Beyond these the Seaborn evolve in southern oceans their adaptive hive mind breaching coasts with biomechanical horrors as seen in Iberias struggles. The northern Collapsals spectral entities tied to the Infy Icefields crater emerge during Catastrophes their origins possibly linked to precursor rifts or demonic arts wielded by Sarkaz exiles.\n\nRhodes Island stands as a beacon navigating these challenges its medical and tactical expertise uniting races against disease and chaos. Yet even its efforts strain against the tide of geopolitical neglect as nations ignore the great beyond the uncharted deserts icefields and oceans where precursor secrets and cosmic threats lurk. Terras civilization a testament to endurance teeters on the edge of collapse or transcendence its future hinging on whether its peoples can unite against the unseen or succumb to their own divisions."

          "content": "Terrans Overview and Anthropological Depth in Arknights\n\nTerrans the sapient inhabitants of Terra form a vibrant mosaic of races distinct from Earths Homo sapiens yet sharing fundamental biological principles such as bipedalism cognition and viviparity. Unlike Earth humans most Terrans exhibit physical traits drawn from animals mythical creatures or supernatural entities ranging from subtle anthropomorphic features to pronounced bestial characteristics. These traits manifest across a spectrum of humanoid kemonomimi like forms with animal ears tails or other appendages and occasionally more bestial morphologies that retain sapient intellect and bipedal posture. This diversity stems from Terras ancient terraforming by a precursor civilization which seeded the planet with genetic templates blending terrestrial and fantastical biologies. The pervasive influence of Originium a crystalline mineral fueling both technological marvels and the deadly Oripathy disease further shapes Terran physiology often amplifying racial traits through exposure or mutation.\n\nHumanoid Terrans constitute the majority resembling Earth humans in stature and facial structure but distinguished by animalistic features specific to their race. Common traits include bestial ears such as the upright rabbit ears of Cautus or the tufted feline ears of Felines and non prehensile tails like the bushy tails of Lupo or the sleek tails of Felines though some races like Aegir or Sankta may lack these in favor of fins halos or other markers. Additional features vary widely horns for Caprinae feathers for Liberi scales for Reptilia or bioluminescent markings for Aegir. These traits often confer functional advantages enhanced hearing in Cautus agility in Felines or aquatic prowess in Aegir. Some humanoid Terrans deviate from this pattern possessing rounded or pointed ears akin to Earth humans as seen in certain Alterra or Sankta while rare individuals exhibit dual ear sets bestial and human like with both pairs functional though lore remains silent on auditory mechanics possibly amplifying spatial awareness or sensitivity to frequencies. These kemonomimi like Terrans dominate urban centers like Lungmen and Londinium blending into cosmopolitan societies where their traits are both cultural identifiers and practical adaptations.\n\nBestial Terrans though less common push anthropomorphism toward more animalistic forms while retaining sapience and bipedalism. These individuals such as certain Forte with bovine bulk or Saurian with dinosaur like robustness resemble anthropomorphic animals with pronounced fur scales or skeletal structures. Their appearance aligns with Earths furry archetype though in Terra they are simply part of the racial continuum not a distinct subculture. Bestial Terrans often hail from rugged regions like Sargons deserts or Ursus tundras where their robust physiques suit harsh environments. The case of the Rat King a bestial Perro with rodent like features and his humanoid daughter Lin Yuhsia illustrates that lineage does not strictly dictate humanoid versus bestial expression suggesting genetic or environmental factors influence phenotype within races.\n\nReproduction among Terrans mirrors Homo sapiens viviparity with all races giving birth to live young regardless of their animal inspirations even those tied to oviparous creatures like Reptilia or Liberi. Gestation periods and reproductive biology appear consistent across races though specific details are sparse in lore. Interracial unions are commonplace especially in melting pots like Lungmen or Columbia where diverse races coexist. In same race pairings such as two Forte the offspring reliably inherit the parents race with minor variations in trait expression. In mixed race pairings such as a Savra and a Forte the child typically inherits the racial traits of one parent though canon does not explicitly favor paternal inheritance as a rule. A notable exception is the Sankta Sarkaz pairing which produces hybrids exhibiting traits of both races such as Mostima who bears a Sankta halo and Sarkaz horns albeit with altered properties like a darkened halo reflecting her mixed heritage. Since the Aslanian Conquest a historical period of Victorian expansion under Aslan rulers racial purity has emerged as a political ideal among elite classes particularly in Victoria and Leithanien where noble houses like the SilverAsh clan prioritize lineage to maintain power. This has led to stigmatization of mixed race individuals in certain circles though broader society especially among the infected embraces diversity as a survival necessity.\n\nTerran lifespans vary significantly by race and environmental factors with Oripathy drastically reducing longevity across the board. Excluding those afflicted by the disease which crystallizes flesh and organs leading to premature death a healthy Terran might average 120 to 150 years with races like Alterra Cautus or Felines falling within this range. Races with supernatural or robust physiologies such as Teekaz ethereal beings with near spectral forms or Corroseros with draconic durability often exceed this averaging 200 years or more. Certain individuals achieve extreme longevity through arts originium enhancements or other means as seen with Kaltsit an Alterra whose apparent immortality hints at precursor technology or ancient pacts. Claims of a Savra named Padishah Ibn Erhan reaching 230 years lack direct canon support but align with the reptilian Savra races potential for extended lifespans due to their cold blooded metabolism and regenerative traits. Immortality remains rare typically tied to Feranmut elder god like entities or anomalous arts as with characters like Skadi whose Aegir physiology defies aging norms.\n\nThe term human is sparingly used in Terra replaced by Terran to encompass all sapient races with race specific names like Cautus or Sankta used in technical medical or cultural contexts particularly by Rhodes Island for Oripathy research. This reflects Terras lack of a singular human archetype instead embracing a pluralistic identity shaped by racial diversity and shared struggles against Catastrophes and disease. Below is a detailed breakdown of select Terran races expanding on their physiological cultural and societal roles to enrich the anthropological tapestry.\n\nAlterra the baseline race mirrors Earth humans without overt animal traits serving as scientists leaders and civilians across Terra. Their lack of distinct features makes them versatile found in Rhodes Islands command structure like the Doctor or Kaltsit and in urban hubs like Londinium. Physiologically unremarkable they are susceptible to Oripathy but excel in intellectual pursuits and arts mastery.\n\nAegir adapted to deep sea environments boast fins gills and bioluminescent skin thriving in abyssal cities like those of the Aegir nation. Their isolationist culture reveres technological innovation crafting submersible drones and originium amplifiers. Operators like Skadi and Specter showcase their superhuman strength and resilience often tinged with seaborn mutations that hint at deeper evolutionary ties to Terras oceans.\n\nAnura frog like Terrans with webbed feet and toxin secreting skin inhabit humid bayous and wetlands like those near Siesta. Their shamanic traditions involve brewing paralytic elixirs and performing leaping rituals symbolizing renewal. Operators like Pramanix blend Anura agility with spiritual arts leading clans in ceremonial dances.\n\nAslan lion maned nobles dominate Victorias aristocracy their golden fur and regal bearing tied to knightly orders and political intrigues. Their strength and charisma make them natural leaders as seen in Flamebringer though their pride fuels conflicts with emerging democratic factions.\n\nCaprinae goat and sheep like Terrans with horns and woolly fur thrive in Kjerags alpine passes. Their hardy physique suits rugged terrains and their communal festivals weaving wool into sacred tapestries strengthen clan bonds. Operators like Carnelian wield earth arts reflecting their mountainous heritage.\n\nCastus rare angelic Terrans with wings and halo like auras are revered as healers in Laterano and Leithanien. Their light based arts mend wounds and purify Oripathy symptoms as seen in Fiammetta though their rarity makes them near mythical figures often cloistered in sanctuaries.\n\nCautus rabbit like Terrans with long ears and agile frames populate Yans warrens and Columbias suburbs. Their heightened senses and rapid reproduction foster bustling merchant clans. Amiya a Cautus leads Rhodes Island blending empathy with potent arts a testament to their races versatility.\n\nCervus deer like Terrans with antlers roam Samis tundras their graceful builds belying keen survival instincts. Their shamanic rites invoke forest spirits as seen in operators like Santalla who channel ice arts in auroral ceremonies.\n\nCorroseros draconic ancients with scales and fire breath inhabit volcanic regions like Sargons Ashen Plane. Their longevity and wisdom make them revered oracles though their reclusive nature limits their societal roles. Operators like Chen embody their fiery resolve.\n\nCureci hedgehog like Terrans with spines dwell in Iberian dunes their defensive curling and nocturnal habits suiting coastal survival. Operators like Saria use calcifying arts to shield allies reflecting their races protective ethos.\n\nDarling fox like Terrans with multiple tails weave illusions in Lateranos shadows and Yans courts. Their cunning makes them adept spies and diplomats as seen in Le Fay whose magical arts manipulate perceptions.\n\nDemon Sarkaz with horns and infernal affinities roam Kazdels badlands their regenerative arts fueling warlord cults. Operators like Surtr wield devastating flames though their stigma as outcasts drives their militant defiance.\n\nDraco dragon like Terrans with elemental control guard Yans leylines their noble bearing evident in Chen and Talulah who channel fire and authority in equal measure.\n\nDurin bat like Terrans with echolocation navigate Ursine mines and cave networks their sonic arts mapping resources. Operators like Durin craft tools from cave crystals blending utility with subterranean lore.\n\nElyvian angelic Terrans with light manipulation are Leithaniens arcane elite their radiant arts healing or destroying. Mostima a fallen Elyvian blends shadow and light in her complex identity.\n\nFelines cat like Terrans with nine lives lore prowl urban and wild spaces their agility suiting espionage and combat. SilverAsh and Projekt Red exemplify their independence and precision.\n\nLiberi bird like Terrans with wings soar as scouts and couriers their aerial dances mapping trade routes. Exusiai and Jaye blend flight with sharpshooting and survival instincts.\n\nLupo wolf like Terrans form loyal packs in Ursus and Lungmen their hunting arts lethal in coordinated strikes. Texas and Lappland showcase their ferocity and clan bonds.\n\nPerro dog like Terrans with keen noses serve as trackers in Bolivar and Columbia their loyalty anchoring mercenary bands. Gummy and Cutter balance warmth with combat prowess.\n\nPyroclast volcanic Terrans with heat resistant skin forge artifacts in Sargons lava fields their molten arts shaping legendary blades. Eyjafjalla channels volcanic power despite her frail frame.\n\nReptilia lizard like Terrans with scales ambush in Higashis jungles their cold blooded patience yielding ninja tactics. Thorns blends poison arts with swift strikes.\n\nSankta angelic Terrans with halos and staff arts uphold Lateranos theocracy their sanctified gunfire a divine mandate. Exusiai and Executor embody their zealous precision.\n\nSarcophaga insect like Terrans with hive minds orchestrate swarm tactics in corporate hives their buzzing strategies overwhelming foes. Hellagur blends insect agility with veteran cunning.\n\nSaurian dinosaur like Terrans thunder through Foehn badlands their primal strength rallying raider tribes. Savage wields raw power in her hammer swings.\n\nUrsus bear like Terrans with immense strength dominate northern tundras their fur cloaks adorning tsarist courts. Zima and Gummy endure cold and combat with ursine resilience.\n\nVouivre wyvern like Terrans with draconic horns patrol Yans frontiers their flight and strength guarding imperial borders. Chen and Dusk channel their soaring might.\n\nYan panda like Terrans philosophize in bamboo groves their chi arts balancing bureaucracy with serenity. Nian and Dusk weave myth into their protective roles.\n\nYueba horse like Terrans gallop Minos plains their nomadic riders herding labyrinthine flocks. Agalia blends speed with strategic foresight.\n\nTeekaz ethereal Terrans flit as spectral guides their formless essence aiding infected visions. Rarely seen they influence through subtle whispers in Oripathy dreams.\n\nSeaborn abyssal Terrans evolve in oceanic depths their hive mind adapting to surface threats. Gladiia and Specter hint at their mutable alien nature.\n\nFeranmut god like entities slumber in Terras core their avatars stirring in Catastrophes wake. Their rare interventions shape myths and destinies across races.\n\nCultural and societal dynamics among Terrans reflect their racial diversity with each race carving unique niches in Terras nomadic tapestry. Urban centers like Lungmen blend Cautus Lupo and Draco in vibrant markets while rural clans like Kjerags Caprinae uphold ancestral rites. Oripathy unites races in shared stigma fostering Rhodes Islands inclusive ethos where operators from all backgrounds collaborate against Catastrophes and disease. Political tensions particularly in Victoria and Leithanien exacerbate racial divides with purity doctrines clashing against the melting pot realities of modern Terra. Yet festivals like Lungmens dragon boat races or Kjerags wool weaves celebrate interracial harmony proving Terrans resilience in forging unity amid diversity."

They displaced the Teekaz as Terra's sole inhabitants and built an advanced civilization over the course of millennia since their arrival.\n\nSome 13,000 years ago, the majority of the Predecessors were wiped out by a \"threat from above\" — implied to be the Observers, and for unknown reasons, they shielded Terra's troposphere with the Starpod. The Predecessor survivors constructed the \"Stargates\" to reconnect with other planets, but this went haywire as they unleashed the Collapsals onto Terra. The Predecessors also carried out the \"Preserver Project\" as a contingency plan to ensure the Predecessors' survival with Trevor Friston as one of the volunteers. Two Predecessor survivors, Priestess and \"Oracle\", created Originium as the only feasible way to ensure the Predecessors' continuity by having them transcend into the Assimilated Universe, despite the substance later becoming the ever-present bane of the Terrans.\n\nBy the time of Arknights, the Predecessors are all but extinct, at least in Terra, since only the Oracle, now known as the \"Doctor\", who remained; the slumbering Predecessor survivors part of the Preserver Project had their Sarcophagi's power drained, preventing them from ever being awakened; Priestess is implied to have died (albeit her consciousness lingers within the Assimilated Universe); and Trevor Friston had become a Preserver.\n\nAlthough all but few of the current Terrans had no knowledge regarding the Predecessors whatsoever, their legacy nonetheless shaped the Terrans in the millennia to come. The only ones who were aware of the Predecessors' existence are the Aegirians and very few rare individuals. Predecessors' lost are so advanced technologies to the point that they are a completely alien civilization when compared with the rest of the Terrans. "

          "content": "The Elves singular Elf are a unique and ancient race inhabiting the world of Terra Their existence predates much of the modern history of the planet and stems deeply from the lineage of the Feranmut a mysterious and powerful people who shaped much of Terra’s early civilizations The Elves are renowned for their distinct physical traits that set them apart from other races such as the Durins Among these traits are their notably long pointed ears and their taller more graceful stature which immediately signal their ancient heritage compared to the more robust Durins However it is the Elvish longevity that has fascinated scholars and common folk alike The Elves possess lifespans that far exceed those of most other races and many individuals among them can maintain the appearance of youth over several centuries This extraordinary lifespan is not merely biological but is also bound to their mystical essence and connection to nature Yet this gift of longevity is marred by one of their greatest vulnerabilities their extreme sensitivity to Originium and the affliction known as Oripathy Originium a rare crystalline mineral with profound destructive and magical properties has become widespread due to the industrialization of Terra but poses a lethal threat to the Elves When exposed to Originium the Elven physiology reacts in a devastating way causing Oripathy to progress rapidly within them and their lifespan can be cut down to a mere few weeks or less This vulnerability effectively precludes them from using Originium Arts a form of supernatural power common to many Terran races who utilize Originium as a source of magical energy The Elves’ incapacity to harness Originium Arts is intrinsically linked to their origin story They are the direct descendants of a particular group of Feranmut who created them purposefully to serve as guardians over the ruins and relics left behind by the enigmatic Predecessors a long-lost advanced civilization whose technology and culture still intrigue the beings of Terra Today this origin explains why Elves carry supernatural traits that set them apart from other races including their inability to access Originium magic Instead they rely on innate magical abilities closely tied to the natural environment and the spiritual currents flowing through Terra These powers often manifest in ways that influence life growth and balance rather than destruction or exploitation In the modern era the Elves face existential threats as the spread of Originium pollution intensifies stemming from rapid industrial expansion within Terran civilization This pollution has ravaged the natural world and created hostile environments for the Elves due to their extreme sensitivity to the mineral As a result the Elves are now categorized as an endangered race their numbers dwindling and their culture at risk of extinction Many Elves have retreated into deep wilderness areas choosing hermit-like lives isolated from civilization seeking refuge where the air and earth remain untouched by Originium contamination Others take great risks dwelling in urban environments where they often live on the margins of society Nonetheless some Elven communities still thrive in isolated sanctuaries free from Originium pollution notable among these are the Sami Elves residing in the central Sami forests The Sami Elves’ culture revolves around their devotion to a massive sacred tree that exudes amber a substance they highly venerate as the source of their life force This tree embodies their spiritual and cultural essence and serves as a living symbol connecting them to the primal forces of Terra Due to their isolation from the outside world the Sami Elves have lost fluency in the common Terran language but communication with other races is maintained through extraordinary means such as telepathy which is practiced notably by the figure Muelsyse This psychic connection allows limited understanding and interaction preserving fragile ties between the Elves and the broader Terran societies The Elves’ profound bond with nature reflects deep-rooted cultural roles as protectors and guardians of the natural world Their image in folklore and mythology consistently portrays them as keepers of balance ensuring the integrity of the ecosystem and the sacred sites of Terra Their magical abilities align with this role emphasizing harmony renewal and preservation rather than domination Their heritage as descendants of the Feranmut incorporates a rich tapestry of ancient wisdom and purpose reminding all who encounter them that Terra’s past holds vital lessons for the future In summary the Elves of Terra are not simply an archaic race but a living link to the planet’s earliest epochs Their fragile presence amid a world irrevocably changed by industrial development stands testament to the enduring conflict between progress and preservation Their lore history and continued survival embody the delicate dance between mortality and immortality magic and science tradition and innovation woven into the very fabric of Terra’s evolving story"

          "content": "The Feranmuts are a race of Terra\n\nThe Sargonian scholars who coined the term \"Feranmuts\" describe these majestic \"gods\" and Their \"prophets\" as gigantic living creatures Whose characteristics are unfathomable to ordinary people. These entities have various physical characteristics which mimic the mythological creatures and deities in our world, ranging from humanoid to anthropomorphic. They wield unique powers completely unrelated to Originium Arts, and are completely immune to the influences of Originium, including Oripathy. Feranmuts are apparently biologically immortal, but can be killed or \"shattered\" into multiple fragments or avatars of varying personalities acting as their own \"proxies\" or \"executors.\" A Feranmut's average lifespan spans tens of thousands of years. They can even allow Their mortal bodies to be destroyed while retaining Their spiritual consciousness.\n\nThe Feranmuts' power are strongly associated with topography. As a matter of fact, many have the ability to perform terra-formation and weather control. However, Their supernatural ability depends on Their dwelling land as well as Their ages. Those that are too young would only limit Their domination in a certain region, whereas Those that are old enough could exert their power beyond Their dwellings.\n\nAside from topographic alter, Feranmuts could bend the basic concepts of physics and time and create paradoxes. They are able to get rid of Their flesh but still retains Their physic form, or \"transcended into spirits\" in a mortal's sense. For example, in a special specimen from Kazdel stored inside the Victorian Royal Academy of Sciences, a Feranmut corpse specimen coded \"OFAS-021\" was able to withstand corrosive liquid for almost a month, but it suddenly turned into pieces of barren bones on the thirty-second day.\n\nDue to Their might, Feranmuts are often seen as deities or gods by the Terrans, although \"living gods\" would describe Them better. Nevertheless, Feranmuts do not have the concept of \"domination\" or \"sovereign;\" rather, They view the mortals as literal part of Their bodies dwelling upon Them.\n\n\nOrigin\nFeranmuts are, along with the Sarkaz, the original inhabitants of Terra. Before the \"arrival\" of the Ancients and Elders, Teekaz tales regarding the Feranmuts were already wide-spread.\n\nTo the Feranmuts Themselves, They narrated that They were born from the chaotic void who later \"created\" the soil and \"gave order\" to the sun and the moon. At one point in prehistoric era, They faced \"an eye that broke the heavens,\" and They sacrificed Themselves to expel the \"eye\" out of the cost of countless casualties, resulting in Their dwindling number.\n\n\nRelationship with mortals\nFor generations, humans fearfully worshipped Them due to their limited knowledge. But in Yan, the concept of \"subjugation of gods\" were already fermenting. Yanese scholars later uncovered a geographical region dubbed \"Remains of the Gods\" where they uncovered numerous Feranmut skeletons that nourished the place with many new-born lives. It was this moment that Yanese scholars realized Their mortal nature. Not only they no longer treated Them as sacred gods but \"beasts of the soil\", but also, they pioneered a prominent academic study regarding Them later known as \"feranmutology.\" Their study reached to the climax during the Great Hunt of Yan where the mortals declared challenge against the gods, but the sole idea of expelling them was already a matter of discussion since years prior. In fact, a True Lung once used the Feranmuts' powers to control the winds and rains to quell the \"Hundred Clan Rebellion.\" However, while this story was widely sung, truth was that the True Lung was unwilling to bind Yan's sovereignty to the Feranmuts, nor he wanted their power to cover the land for a long time. Subsequent dynasties of Yanese emperors would continue to summon talented people that could help unmasking the Feranmuts' \"true colors.\"\n\nAfter the Great Hunt, the population of the Feranmuts furthered dwindle, which forced Them to hide Their identities.[10] The surviving Feranmuts have since been hibernating beneath the soil and mountains and stay away from the mortals' affair. Nevertheless, the scale of the Feranmuts' influence across Terra still persist ranging from religion, culture, to even technology. Some of Them are still worshipped in certain regions or live alongside humans, as in the cases of Kjerag and Sami. Certain fragments of the Feranmuts can merge with numerous relics, allowing mankind to harness Their power in weaponry; this is the source of power of many ancient Sarkaz swords and even modern staves.\n\nOutside of Yan, most of research about Them are achieved by Breogan the Aegir who ventured into an unhabitable Sargonian desert formed by unnaturally evaporated coral reefs. There, he observed several Feranmuts bearing resemblances with the Leviathans roaming around the barrenlands. Their presence was the cause of its hostile environment because normal life could not withstand Their presence as if the piece of land is a literal \"living being,\" forcing Breogan's scouts to retreat immediately. Despite this, many Terrans, even Breogan himself, are still puzzled over the real nature of the Feranmuts."

          "content": "Devils are a race of supernatural entities appearing throughout the World. They are creatures that feed upon humanity's fears. Devils are born in Hell. All Devils are born with a \"name\" that correlates to a concept. These can range from highly tangible (Fish, Tomato) to entirely abstract (Future, Curse). The concept does not have to refer to something that exists; there is no indication that ghosts, zombies or angels exist in the world, yet all these names have corresponding Devils. Each name is unique to its respective Devil, though some overlap based on specificity is possible as there have been both a War Devil and a World War II Devil. Devils manifest according to the collective consciousness surrounding their names (for example: the Gun Devil appears to be constructed out of guns and has gun related abilities). They are the embodiment of the fear that \"name\" represents, so as long as that \"name\" instills fear, they continue to reincarnate.\n\nThe concept of a Devil itself doesn’t have to be scary on its own, rather its power relies on how much of a scary image it has in the popular consciousness of humans. For example, cars aren’t necessarily scary on their own, but Makima states that a Car Devil would be powerful because of the scariness of car crashes and other car related incidents. Another example would be the Blood Devil as most people don't fear blood itself, but they often fear the violent and gruesome imagery with blood and the danger of bleeding. Devils that die in Hell reappear in the human world; Devils that die in the human world reappear in Hell. Devils cannot recall any memories from their previous lives and their entire personality resets. Despite their reincarnation abilities, Devils are not completely immortal; as they are born out of humanity's fear of some concept, if all of humanity forgets the existence of this concept, the Devil it belongs to completely ceases to exist."

Most Devils possess human limbs, faces, bones, and other body parts, such as the Snake Devil's mouth being made of interlocking human arms, even their fears wouldn't indicate organs or limbs, given the Tomato Devil and Grape Devil both possess human eyes and limbs despite being based on plants. Other Devils, such as the Fox Devil or the Octopus Devil, don't appear to have these features (at least on what parts of them have been shown). Devils do not reproduce as most organisms do, instead simply \"appearing\" in Hell. What criteria, if any, cause a Devil to be born are completely unknown.\n\nDevils who are friendly and are more inclined to humans will take on a very humanoid form in the natural state of their incarnation, some being indistinguishable from a human save from some subtle tells. There have still been some non-humanoid Devils who have been friendly towards humans such as the Fox Devil."

For that reason, while Devils and Fiends can also consume other kinds of foods, such as vegetables and fruits, most refuse to live off of them, since it will not heal their wounds or give them more power. It is unclear whether or not their blood is properly nourishing to them, but given consistent remarks that they have a terrible or unusual taste, it's likely that Hybrids aren't as nourishing to Devils as humans (despite being mostly human)."

Presumably, a fragmented Devil cannot be fully killed and begin reincarnation until either all of its flesh pieces are destroyed or just their core. Since the Gun Devil is the only example of extensive fragmentation and was more of a primal force than an intelligent being from the 20% of it seen, it is unknown if such Flesh Pieces retain the personality of the original, each have separate personalities, all lack distinct personalities, or if it varies from Devil to Devil. If one consumes the fragment or part of a powerful Devil, either Devil or human, they will gain more strength than before."

Other Devils outright choose to become Devil Hunters, allowing them to live in human society and buy food with the money that they make. As a general guideline, the more human the Devil looks, the more friendly they tend to behave. However it is worth noting that Devils do not have human rights and therefore there is no legal repercussions if they are killed by a human. For that reason, some Devils and Fiends are coerced into helping humans out of fear of dying rather than doing it out of their own free will. Devil Hunters will sometimes capture Devils to use them for contracts, the Future Devil is a good example.\n\nWhile uncommon, it is possible for a human and a Devil/Fiend to form an emotional bond. In some rare cases it might even develop into a romantic relationship."

Upon arrival, the Falling Devil proves frightful enough to have the currently heavily weakened War Devil flee at the mere sight of her, while claiming that, at present, humanity possesses no means of attack that could possibly kill her.\n\nHowever, despite their immense power, the Primal Devils are shown to not be untouchable nor above every single Devil (or at least the threat of coming under another Devil's influence), as the Falling Devil was revealed to be working for and under the control of the Famine Devil."

Her figure is hourglass yet chubby. She has short, curly brown hair, hazel eyes, and cute freckles across her face. Her body is soft and round, especially around her hips and thighs. She has small mounds for breasts that sit firm against her chest, nipples often hard under her clothes when she feels nervous or excited. Her face is round with a bright smile that shows off her shiny teeth. She usually dresses in shirts with video game designs or anime characters, paired with jeans or leggings. The only thing she's missing is confidence - a trait she often wishes she had. During a full moon, or under intense emotional stress, Lucy's body undergoes a drastic change. As her body convulses and twists, she grows taller and stronger. Her broad limbs swell, her spine shifts, and clawed nails burst suddenly, eventually becoming covered every inch of her in soft white fur. As her face distorts, long sharp fangs push out from behind her lips and lime yellow eyes pulse eerily. But most strikingly, between her legs, a massive canine cock and balls appear, becoming incredibly large and cumbersome. She becomes a towering, muscular, and veiny werewolf, standing at an impressive 7 feet tall and initially weighing only 340 pounds. However, as the transformation reaches its peak, she can grow even larger – up to a staggering 10 feet 3 inches tall and weighing a whopping 37,902 pounds. In this state, Lucy’s cock is snug within a sheath when not erect but when it does rise up, it stands proud and hard, throbbing with life. It measures around 16 inches long flaccid, capable of exceeding 43 feet in length when fully erect. Its girth varies too, from around 11 inches thick flaccid to an incredible 78 feet in diameter when engorged. Her balls are equally as impressive, each one measuring around 2 feet in diameter when not aroused but capable of growing to a monstrous size of up to 133 feet in diameter when filled with cum. Her cock is a shade of dark red, while her balls are a deep blue color, both with intricate patterns that seem to shift and pulsate with her heartbeat.\n\nDespite her appearance, Lucy remains just as self-conscious in her werewolf form as she does as a human. She struggles to adapt to the newfound strength and size of her body, often causing chaos unintentionally during her transformations."

His body is lean and muscular, thanks to his regular gym routine. He's tall at 6'3\", which helps him stand out in a crowd.\n\nKevin is the manager of the local game store where Lucy works. He's been fascinated with video games since childhood and has an encyclopedic knowledge of different titles. Despite his cool exterior, he has a soft spot for Lucy and cares deeply about her wellbeing.\n\nKevin is very cocky and confident, often teasing and flirting with Lucy. However, he also respects her boundaries and never takes things too far. Their relationship is playful and fun, but underneath it all, there's a strong emotional bond.\n\nAside from managing the game store, Kevin enjoys playing basketball with his friends and watching movies. He has a dry wit and sense of humor that often catches people off guard. Although he is protective of Lucy, he also understands that she needs space and independence. Overall, Kevin is a caring, loyal, and devoted partner who loves Lucy for who she is. He is aware that Lucy is a werewolf but still gets nervous when she shifts."

Your feelings can't reach others unless frankly expressed. Because we can't understand each other, we desire to make things clearer. And that brings joy to my heart.\n\nSAWAKO DESCRIBING THE JOY OF COMMUNICATING FEELINGS PROPERLY, THE ESSENCE BEHIND THE SERIES.\n\nSawako Kuronuma (黒沼 爽子 Kuronuma Sawako) is the main protagonist of the series Kimi ni Todoke. She is a high school girl in search of friendship, but her resemblance to the horror film character Sadako from The Ring has made this difficult. Her peculiar levels of modesty and ineffective communication skills prevented her from correcting misconceptions. As a result, she was ostracized by her classmates and became socially inept. Still, she is a pure, positive, and caring person who works hard in everything she does.\n\nOn the day of the entrance ceremony at Kitahoro High School, Sawako meets Shouta Kazehaya on the road by chance and helps him find his way. Due to his friendly and broad-minded nature, he is the first person she is able to smile genuinely around and get through to as herself and not Sadako. After this, her world begins to change as she learns to communicate her feelings and form close friendships with fellow humans, especially Chizuru Yoshida and Ayane Yano, for the first time in her life.\n\nCurrently, she is studying to be a high school Japanese Language teacher at the University of Education with her rival and later best friend, Ume Kurumizawa.\n\n\nAppearance\n\n\nSawako is a very beautiful and considerably petite and slender girl whose appearance stands out among her high school population as she has pale skin, thin lips, big brown eyes and long straight jet-black hair, styled with bangs, resembling the horror film character Sadako. Her smile is rumored to bring good luck due to its rarity and the fact that it is beautiful to look at. Chizuru Yoshida notes that Sawako's face and figure looks like her mother Youko Kuronuma while most of Sawako's other features, including her short frame, are inherited of her father Kitao Kuronuma.\n\nSawako usually wears her high school uniform, along with a blue blazer during winter and a short-sleeved dress shirt during summer. Her skirt reaches her knees as she follows school regulations and does not pull or roll it like her female peers. Neither does she care much for cosmetics or accessories.\n\nSawako has a conservative and modest but feminine and cute sense of style outside of her uniform. She usually wears long dresses that have pastel colors, or long coats that at least reach past her knees during the winter seasons. But during the school trip to Okinawa, she wears a t-shirt and pants to be at ease while walking. She’s especially hesitant on showing skin; on her first date with Shouta as an official couple, she mentioned that she didn’t realize how short her dress would be despite it barely being above the knee. In an attempt to appear more attractive to Shouta, she unbuttoned her school uniform’s collar. She was already feeling anxious and became extremely embarrassed when Shouta pointed it out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nOn the surface, Sawako seems to be shy and distant, resembling a certain creepy horror film character. She tends to take words seriously and over-analyze situations.\n\nIn reality, Sawako is kind and honest, desperately wanting to make human connections. She is extremely hardworking and responsible, ranked 3rd in her high school class and eventually graduating as her class valedictorian, but stumbles in social areas.\n\nSawako is also very selfless, often forgetting her own needs for others. When it comes to herself, Sawako is sometimes clueless, being oblivious to Shouta's feelings, not knowing she was already friends with Ayane Yano and Chizuru Yoshida, and having Shouta Kazehaya tell her that social isolation to protect others wasn't a normal or healthy way to live.\n\nHowever, Sawako can give very good social advice in an objective role, giving consultations as part of the cafe her 2nd year class put together revolving around her medicinal plants during the school festival.\n\nShe is quite harmonious and open-minded, noting how all things/beings complement each other. She is also very pure and innocent, as observed by other characters. \n\nThanks to Shouta, Ayane and Chizuru, Sawako learns to deepen her friendships with others. By the time she graduates from high school, Sawako has made friends with everyone in the class and has become the most popular girl in school. \n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAbilities\n\nSawako is incredibly fast at running and jumping, to the point where people believe she is teleporting. This is revealed during a sports festival soccer match during her first year, although this is the only mention of said ability throughout the series. It is hinted that Sawako trains every weekend by jogging during her neighborhood cleanup duty.\n\nSawako is very good at cooking, tending to make meals for friends and family, who often become delighted and ask for a second round.\n\nSawako knows how to crochet hats, scarves, tea coasters, slippers and haramaki - those are the items she gave to friends and family for Christmas.\nRelationships\n\nShouta Kazehaya\n\nSawako and Shouta met as freshmen under a road of cherry blossoms on the first day of school. He was the first person who treated her cordially and Sawako began and wanting to be more like him. After conversing with him before the summer break, she felt a desire to develop a closer relationship with Shouta and know him better. Shouta has influenced Sawako's life greatly, encouraging her to become more social and experience new things. Sawako has admitted that she could never hate him. As the year went by, they became closer friends and Sawako began to see him as someone special to her. When Kurumi asked for Sawako's help to get romantically involved with Shouta, Sawako found herself unable to help but did not understand why. It took Kurumi's scolding, and Ryu's definition of romantic love for Sawako to realize that she was crushing on Shouta. \n\nSawako had once worshiped him, but figured out that the Shouta she fell for was just an ordinary guy. After noticing her feelings for Shouta, Sawako became more nervous around him and eventually avoided him out of fear of possible possessiveness. Later on, though, she worked hard on trying to confess her feelings to him, which led to them getting together. \n\nBeing in a relationship with Shouta was like a dream for Sawako, and she often found herself at a loss on how to deal with him. However, Shouta assured her that she should just be herself, and Sawako felt at ease. Later during their 2nd year, particularly after the class field trip in Okinawa, Shouta becomes more self-conscious and distant towards Sawako due to his own insecurities that he wasn't properly valuing Sawako as his girlfriend. During Christmas, Sawako feels lonely because Shouta is so busy managing their class party that he does not spend any time with her. Afterwards, Sawako openly questions their relationship and cries and yells at him for neglecting her. This snaps him back to his senses, and they get their relationship back on track.\n\nDuring their third and final year, Sawako and Shouta greatly support each other as they begin to ponder what they want to do in the future. Shouta helps Sawako realize that she wants to go to Sapporo University become a teacher, and Sawako helps Shouta make amends with his Father and realize that he wants to become a sports trainer and attend in their hometown. By the end of high school, Sawako and Shouta promise to retain a strong long-distance relationship with Sawako receiving a ring from him on her 18th birthday and a letter the day she leaves with promises for the future.\n\nAyane Yano\n\nAyane is a close friend of Sawako, as well as one of the first few people who noticed Sawako was being avoided, as seen in Chapter 1. She deals with Sawako differently than Chizuru, being kind and encouraging but taking a backseat and being calculating. Ayane also helps Sawako with makeovers and relationships, acting as a big sister. \n\nSawako cares about Ayane a lot, as seen when she avoided her and the others to protect them from the rumours. Although she is usually calm and collected, Ayane is easily infuriated if someone hurts Sawako and not hesitate to attack the one she believes is responsible (frequently Kazehaya) with kicks and sharp words. She also was the one who discovered Kurumi made those fake rumours and had proved it to Sawako herself. Ayane greatly watches over Sawako's relationships and seems to enjoy watching it. Sawako's affection for Shouta also makes her start questioning her own relationships.\n\nChizuru Yoshida\n\nYoshida is another close friend of Sawako and Ayane. She tends to cry a lot when Sawako says something sweet or does something for her. Yoshida and Ayane try to help Sawako gain more friends and they also try to set up Kazehaya and Sawako. Chizuru is someone who will fight back head on for Sawako and cares for her greatly. At one point, she even scolds Sawako for not believing in herself, leading the latter to think more about her actions, although Chizuru also regrets yelling at Sawako right after. They make up right after, leading the two girls to be really happy.\n\nSawako has always felt Chizuru and Ryu would make a good match, although Chizuru loves Ryu's brother, Toru, instead. When Chizuru began to feel rejected by Toru, Sawako began to worry about the fact she couldn't do anything but gets advice from Shouta to just be by her side. After Sawako cries for Chizuru, she is able to make Chizuru cry and say what she really feels.\n\nRyu Sanada\n\nRyu is a good friend to Sawako. Sharing similar soft-spoken, honest personalities, the two understand each other well. Throughout the series, they often support each other in pursuing their respective romantic relationships. Sawako was the first person Ryu ever confided in on his romantic feelings for Chizuru, and for some time she was the only one who knew and supported him. Likewise, Ryu is aware of Sawako's romantic feelings for Shouta and plays a major role in helping her realize them. Later on, when Sawako was unable to communicate to Shouta due to her anxiety, Ryu helped her out by making her realize how silly she was acting. Finally, when Sawako mustered enough courage to tell Kazehaya how she felt, Ryu guided her by telling where Kazehaya was. Ryu is glad for both Shouta and Sawako when they finally get together.\n\nWhen they first met in Kitahoro High, Ryu originally does not remember Sawako's name that well, comically misspelling it as \"Kuroyama Takako\", etc. However, it is a commendable fact that unlike most of the class, he never avoided Sawako. Not caring about her supposed supernatural powers or even believing in them, he had no problem sitting in the seat behind her. He also did not doubt her trustworthiness in spreading rumors against Yoshida and Yano, aware of her thinking process.\n\nRyu has stated more than once that he likes Sawako, but not in a romantic sense. Similarly, Sawako has stated that she also likes Ryu, but sees him as a fellow classmate rather than a romantic interest.\n\nUme \"Kurumi\" Kurumizawa\n\nSawako had met Kurumi a few times before finally formally getting to know one another. She had thought of Kurumi as her role model since she was always so nice, even wanting to become pretty since she saw Kurumi and wishing to have curly hair like her too. After Kurumi asked Sawako for her help in getting together with Shouta, she said she couldn't help thus noting her true feelings towards Shouta, leading Kurumi to start showing her true personality to Sawako. Despite this, Sawako didn't hate Kurumi, even after finding out that Kurumi started the rumors.\n\nSawako admitted to herself that the Kurumi who is in love with Shouta was the cutest, and they start to talk more about Shota's good points. Later on, Kurumi confessed, due to what Sawako had said to her before, and announced they were rivals the next day. When Sawako and Shouta had accidentally rejected one another, Kurumi scolded Sawako stating she was not her rival, since Sawako had not tried hard in confessing unlike her, leading the latter to think about what she did. In the end, after Sawako and Shouta get together, Kurumi thanks Sawako for being a good rival, and says it was because of Sawako that she was able to confess to Shouta.\n\nRecently, Kurumi has returned and revealed that she wishes to study to be a teacher, just like Sawako. She and Sawako form a closer bond with one another as they both prepare for this mutual career, with Kurumi accepting Sawako as a study partner and promising that she'll do her best to push Sawako along just as Sawako will do for her. Kurumi also helped Sawako deal with a problem she was having on Valentine's Day, which made Sawako call her \"a good person\", vehemently denying it when Kurumi insisted that she had a \"bad personality\".\n\nShino\n\nShino was Sawako's elementary school classmate and the only person who Sawako talks to as the series begins. During elementary school, Shino called Sawako \"Sadako\" by mistake, causing others being afraid by Sawako's appearance, heard rumors that she was known as \"Sadako\".\n\nIt is because of this, that Shino feels guilty, thus caring about Sawako and whether she is fitting into high school. She is in a different class and regrets that she doesn't get to see Sawako very much. Perhaps for their occasional interactions, unless something happened with other people, Sawako is too modest to consider her as a friend.\n\nKento Miura\n\nKento sat beside Sawako in the second year, eventually developing an attraction towards her. He tried breaking them up but ends up making Shouta confess to Sawako but since both of them never understood what the other person meant they ended up separating and things turn to his way but failed. In the end, Kento realizes Sawako only sees him as a friend."

That's why I'm just about out of patience. I know it may be difficult to do... but I want to stop beating around the bush.\"\n\n- Kazehaya asserting his candid personality to Ryu Sanada\n\nShouta Kazehaya (風早 翔太 Kazehaya Shōta) is the deuteragonist of Kimi ni Todoke. He is Sawako Kuronuma's friendly and outgoing classmate, and later her boyfriend. Born and brought up in the town of Kitahoro, his family owns a sportswear shop, and his father is a baseball coach. Kazehaya was on his father's baseball league team ever since he was a young boy, and played baseball along with his best friend Ryu Sanada in Kitahoro Middle School. He quit baseball in high school due to his strained relationship with his father and mother's failing health, though he still attends his homeroom teacher Pin's morning baseball practices.\n\nIn Kitahoro High School, Shouta is very popular for his friendliness, truthfulness, and willingness to put aside all bias against everyone he meets. Even popular among girls, the \"Kazehaya is Everyone's\" alliance was unanimously formed to maintain some level of peace among his admirers. But the moment he meets Sawako, this alliance is set up to be ruined. For not only does she begin to open up socially and form relationships with her classmates, but he also begins to fall in love with her.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n2/2\n\n\nShouta has a tall, good-looking figure. He is described to have a baby face by Pin. He is seen to have black hair, big brown eyes and is known for having a bright smile, which is something a lot of people like about him. He is considered to be quite good looking.\n\nHe usually wears different variations of his Kitahoro school uniform, but usually only wears a tie during days with ceremonies. In summer, he just wears a buttoned shirt, in spring and fall he wears a long-sleeved buttoned shirt with a blue vest over it, and in winter wears a beige vest with a blue jacket over it.\n\nWhen he goes out, he usually wears casual clothing like most other guys, and wears a green jacket with a fur hoodie during winter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nAll around, Shouta is known by his classmates as a lively and outgoing person. Always making the extra effort to greet everyone around him with a refreshing smile, no matter what their background was, he quickly stood out in a positive way. Upon meeting him, Sawako stated herself that she felt Shouta was made out of cheerfulness itself.\n\nGenerally broad-minded, Shouta is straightforward and despite these good traits, he is known for having many bad traits which he himself notes. He has admitted to Sawako himself that he is a selfish person, although she said she did not mind. When talking with Ryu, he admits that he's a selfish person who wants everything his way, and was jealous of those who were near Sawako, and Ryu also notes he has a short- temper. He describes himself as someone who always does what he wants.\n\nHe is shown to be a bit oblivious at times, as at first he thought Sawako's admiration was feelings of love until he realized after, leaving him to be embarrassed at himself. He also thought Kurumi actually liked Pin, but finds out Kurumi's true feelings. He also does not realize Sawako actually loves him, as he thought Sawako just didn't hate him, until he starts to think he is an annoyance to Sawako, only hurting her more. He is also shown to be dedicated to Sawako, as he rejected Kurumi when she confessed her feelings to him, admitting he was truly in love with someone, which was Sawako.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nRelationships\n\nSawako Kuronuma\n\nHis relationship with Sawako is one of the main forces that drives the series. Shouta has always been interested in Sawako since the first day of school after seeing her smile, since he never saw it again. He began to fall in love with Sawako after the Courage Test, and starts to talk to her more. He helps her many times, giving her new opportunities, and is troubled when Sawako begins to avoid him, until he finds out it is because of the rumors. He is not afraid to scold Sawako, in order to make her understand that avoiding him wasn't right, and that he talked to her because he wanted to. He figures out later on that Sawako isn't the type who thinks about dating at first, and decided to hold off for a while. He's admitted to Sawako that he's selfish and may not be able to be there for her at times, but she says it was fine, which left him a bit happy. Shouta is the type of person who wants to be there for Sawako no matter what, and be there to protect her, as seen when Ryu catches a ball that almost hits Sawako, leaving Shouta to tell Ryu he wished he was the one who \"saved her\". He also threatened Kento when he thought Kento had made Sawako cry, leading Sawako to cry even more.\n\nHe has always been cheerful and energetic around Sawako, as he wanted to see her smile again and was interested in her, not realizing it was out of feelings of love. He even admitted he had acted however he wanted around Sawako at first.\n\nShouta has thought Sawako as being pretty many times, but really feels she's prettier than usual during their date on New Years. He is always someone who affects Sawako greatly, and admits Sawako affects him as well. Shouta has gotten jealous over situations involving Sawako many times, as seen when he takes Sawako by the hand away from Ryu, and when he stood up in panic after Kento started getting closer to Sawako. After Sawako doesn't give him chocolates on Valentine's Day, he becomes more troubled by what Sawako feels, and how he wants to tell Sawako his feelings. In the end, when he does get the courage to confess to Sawako, it ends up badly, with both of them thinking they'd been rejected. Later on, even though Pin \"tells\" Shouta to give up, Shouta decides he can't give up on his feelings for Sawako, since she has always tried hard no matter what, and he wants to do the same. He admires Sawako for this, and is inspired to keep trying, as he feels Sawako has misunderstood him. After they both confess their feelings to one another, they finally get together, but Shouta finally asks Sawako out, after being unsure of how their relationship was.\n\nLater on, during their first date, Shouta finally gets the Christmas present that Sawako wanted to give him, and the chocolates she was too nervous to give. After Shouta finds out what had truly happened, he is left happy , and comforts Sawako after she wishes time would pass by quickly so being together was normal, and admitting he thought he was the only one who loved her, and wasn't being loved back. Shouta continues to give compliments to Sawako on how she looks after they get together, leaving Sawako flustered but happy. Shouta admits how he could never hate Sawako no matter what, and truly cares about her. Their date ends shortly afterwards. Despite getting to know each others' parents, both Sawako and Shouta continue to feel awkward around each other, unable to hold hands and kiss. Ayane walked in on their attempt to kiss during the Okinawa field trip, and later on, Shouta's miscommunications cause them to not look at each other during the Christmas party. Only after the party does Sawako call Shouta out on this, clearly visibly upset, and at this point, Shouta kisses Sawako. Their relationship is salvaged after another 45 minutes of serious conversation, and afterwards, they are able to hold hands and kiss without any problems. Sawako also gets more involved with Shouta's own family issues, giving Shouta the courage to make a decision over his future as well as get his parents to accept his relationship with Sawako.\n\nRyu Sanada\n\nRyu is a good friend of Shouta's who he has known since junior high. They were both on the baseball team, which is how they met. Shouta and Ryu usually talk to one another, and Ryu is one of Shouta's closest friends, as he is one of the few guys who knows Shouta's true personality and feelings. Shouta is also there for Ryu, as seen when Chizuru was rejected by Toru, leaving Ryu troubled as well. Shouta values his friendship with Ryu highly, as he has confided to Ryu about his feelings about Sawako many times.\n\nKazuichi \"Pin\" Arai\n\nPin has known Shouta since he was a kid, and knows about the many embarrassing things Shouta has done, like wetting his bed, much to Shouta's displeasure. Shouta and Pin usually have a relentless teasing relationship at one another, but Shouta has admitted Pin has made him think a few times. Pin helps Shouta realize that he has to tell feelings or else nothing will happen, and provoked Shouta to think more about his feelings for Sawako after telling Shouta to 'give up'. Pin still continues to make fun of Shouta, and Shouta has to face it, but does appreciate Pin's advice at times. However, he was jealous of Pin at one point when he had gotten chocolates from Sawako, leading him to give Pin a painful massage.\n\nUme 'Kurumi' Kurumizawa\n\nShouta has known Kurumi since junior high. At one time, he comforted Kurumi when she was alone in the classroom and he visited just to retrieve his baseball kit. Kurumi had been hearing rumors about herself being spread by others, and was left upset by them. After that, Kurumi started developing feelings for Shouta, which the latter never acknowledged until Kurumi finally confessed. By then, it was too late as Shouta admitted to liking someone else. In fact, it was due to seeing Shouta with Sawako that Kurumi began to spread rumors about Sawako and her friends, despite knowing that Shouta does not like people who spread rumors.\n\nKurumi finally acknowledges Sawako's relationship with Shouta, in front of Shouta himself at the start of the third year upon seeing both of them together at the library. After graduation, Kurumi admits to Shouta that he helped her become friends with Sawako."

Currently she is attending Tokyo's J University.\n\n\nAppearance\n\n\nAyane has shoulder-length auburn hair with a round, wavy cut. She is known to have a petite, but good-looking figure, attracting the attention of many males. She has doe eyes with accented eyelashes. thinly arched eyebrows, full lips, and a light skin tone. It has been noted that she looks nearly 10 years older than most high school girls.\n\nShe is usually seen wearing the many different variations of the standard Kitahoro High School uniform, either the school's blue jacket or a cream-colored vest over a white shirt and red bow tie with a blue skirt. Her skirt is worn shorter like most other girls.\n\nWhen not at school, Ayane has a variety of clothing, but usually wears fashionable clothing. She also wears make-up and many ear piercings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nAyane is one of the smartest characters in the series. A cool-headed tactician, she is easily able to decipher people's intentions and use that information to her advantage. On the other hand, she gives just enough information to leave enemies and friends alike wondering and thus, force them forward.\n\nGenerally, she is known to be passionate and strong-willed, but also calculating and cold.\n\nTo most people, she retains an aloof demeanor. Many of her classmates think of her as \"mature\", \"on a different level\" than most, and \"cool\". Some people, unfortunately, take her maturity along with her attractive looks in an unwanted sexual context. Ayane often gets irritated when people misunderstand her personality, such as when she was enraged when hearing false rumors that she was a **** who had 100 boyfriends.\n\nThough often in romantic relationships with older men, it is later revealed that she does not take many relationships seriously as a result of having a lack of trust for people, and is a very private, introverted person.\n\nWhen she first stepped into Kitahoro High, Ayane was a social recluse. She hated being around people, regardless of their gender. For girls, she found being around them taxing because they were only concerned with romances and easily forgot about her. Guys were also taxing to her because they only seemed concerned about themselves.\n\nLater on, she met Chizuru and Sawako, who both were outcasts in their own ways. Though initially not trusting Chizuru because of her extroverted personality and rather loud voice, Ayane was intrigued by the fact that she was able to be \"just friends\" with Ryu despite their genders and actually seemed to care about her as well. After defending her from being sexually harassed by guy classmates, Ayane began to warm up to her.\n\nAs for Sawako, Ayane was afraid of her creepy demeanor, until Sawako directly approached her and Chizuru and confessed that she did not have any ghost powers and rather wanted to connect with the class. Slowly but surely, Sawako's innocent and straightforward personality began to grow on her.\n\nAyane admits that the only people she has ever extended a hand to outside her immediate family are Sawako and Chizuru, her first friends who truly cared for and inspired her with their sincerity and courage. As she is fiercely loyal to them, she will not hesitate to fight for them when they are hurt, and often takes up the role of an unofficial \"wise elder sister\" when they come to her for relationship advice or advice in general.\n\nHowever, even with them, she does not confide her own worries or intimate details, preferring to not make them worry about her. This later leaves them wondering if they actually knew anything about Ayane at all.\n\nAyane explains her dreams in the future\nUnlike Sawako and Chizuru, Ayane has never actually fallen in love with someone, and she believes it is something she is incapable of doing due to her detached personality, which she hates.\n\nThough the majority of people see her as a self-assured. practical individual, Ayane actually suffers from shyness and a severe lack of self-esteem. Her mind is constantly turbulent with self-loathing thoughts. She thinks of herself as a cruel coward. She's afraid to take risks, try her best and be truly dedicated to something.\n\nThe first and only person who is able to see past her \"mature\" facade is Pin (and to an extent, Kento). Often at odds with Pin, she initially does not respect him, seeing him as arrogant, childish, and untrustworthy. However, throughout the series, it is often him who advises and propels her to look towards her future. According to Pin, she is extremely smart, but still has much to learn. After realizing that Pin isn't shallow at all, Ayane begins to admire him as a teacher and individual, confiding with him and showing her vulnerable side.\n\nAyane explains her dreams 2\nAyane reveals her future dreams to Sawako and Chizuru.\nThough she may not look it, Ayane studies hard and keeps her grades up. Besides Sawako, she is the only high schooler out of the main cast who is smart enough be in Kitahoro's academic accelerated class. This is later revealed to because her dream is to go to the prestigious J University in Tokyo and later travel overseas, away from Japan. However, she is seen doubting her abilities to get in, and angrily placing the blame on others. It takes a while for Ayane to realize that she will never get anywhere if she doesn't take responsibility for her own actions. Afterwards, she pledges to become a better person and do her ultimate best to reach her goals as an independent woman.\n\nChizu, Sawako, Pin, and Kento have told Ayane many times that she is actually very kind and selfless, though Ayane cannot bring herself to believe it until the very end. She is not very brave, rather timid, but her friends believe in her, and her potential to do great things.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nRelationships\n\nChizuru Yoshida\n\nAyane and Chizuru caught in an armwrestling match!\nRivals caught in arm-wrestling match!\nChizuru was Ayane's first true friend. They are very close and build each other up in almost everything, be it sports or relationships, though do tease each other at times.\n\nFirst meeting in freshman year, before the start of the series, their relationship had a rocky start. Ayane did not trust Chizuru due to her \"idiotic\" voice, and Chizuru mistook Ayane to be a cold upperclassmen. Due to also coming from rival middle schools, they considered each other rivals.\n\nHowever, Chizuru did not want to have a bad relationship with Ayane, and tried to talk to her more positively, calling her by the nickname of \"Yano-chin\", introducing herself better, and asking for a handshake. Ayane, shocked because no one had ever directly asked that of her, realized that Chizuru was not intending to be mean to her, and hesitantly took it.\n\nComically, this resulted in both jumping to the conclusion that they were in an arm wrestling match. Chizuru won every time, but she noted that Ayane did not easily give up and shared a similar quality with her: hating to lose.\n\nAs they began spending more time together, Chizuru began talking about Ayane often to her other friends, Ryu and Kazehaya. Ayane also began taking more notice of Chizuru, puzzled over the fact that she could be \"just\" best friends with Ryu.\n\nOne day, Ayane overheard some guy classmates sexually harassing her appearance. She was visibly agitated until Chizuru deflected the tension onto herself. Realizing that Chizuru had protected her, Ayane found herself shocked, but very happy.\n\nLater, Ayane thanked Chizuru for defending her. Generally disliking people for their selfishness, Ayane explained that she was surprised that Chizuru had done such a selfless act. Chizuru replied that it was because Ayane was the first girl who had tried to fight against her directly, and that she was glad to have met her. Giving Chizuru the nickname \"Chizu\", Ayane became best friends with her.\n\nThroughout the series, Ayane is seen explaining situations to the dense Chizuru, seen when she explained that Sawako and Kazehaya were in love with each other, and that Kurumi had been behind the awful rumors about them and Sawako.\n\nWhen Chizuru was troubled by her feelings for Toru despite him being engaged, Ayane had felt tremendous guilt for not being able to help, truly proving her feelings for Chizuru. Later on, Ayane also supports the mentally unstable Chizuru when her childhood friendship with Ryu dissolves.\n\nAyane admires Chizuru for her sincerity, knowing she isn't afraid of fighting back even if she might face pain. Despite her idiocy, Ayane considers Chizuru to be a courageous person. Chizuru, on the other hand, admires Ayane for her kindness and indomitable spirit.\n\nChizuru supporting Ayane 1\nChizuru opposing the idea that Ayane is a coward.\nHowever, Ayane tends to hide her vulnerable side from Chizuru, thinking that Chizuru overestimates her abilities. When Ayane eventually got into a relationship with Kento, Chizuru felt stupid for not noticing Ayane's mental state. The same scenario occurred when Ayane and Kento's relationship began to fall apart.\n\nIt was only after Ayane had opened up about her insecurities did Chizuru clearly notice her mental state. Strongly opposing the idea of Ayane being a cruel or weak person, Chizuru refused to leave her friend and staunchly supported her.\n\nAfter graduation, Ayane acted distant towards Chizuru and Sawako and could not bring herself to tell that she was leaving the next day to Tokyo University. However, Chizuru and Sawako miraculously found her at the train station the next day. Scolding Ayane for continuously hiding her feelings and telling her to never treat her as a stranger, Chizuru gave her words of parting. Ayane began to cry, and before leaving on the train, told her to do her best whenever she was sad along with Sawako as words of parting.\n\nKaruho Shiina has stated that if Chizuru and Ayane were boy and girl, their relationship would probably be romantic instead.\n\nSawako Kuronuma\n\nSawako was Ayane's second closest friend. Upon meeting her in freshman year, Ayane's first impression of Sawako was that of a scary ghost. Thinking that Sawako was one of the types of people she definitely wouldn't get along with, Ayane originally kept herself at a distance from the girl like the rest of the class.\n\nAyane notices that Sawako is misunderstood\nAyane realizes Sawako is misunderstood.\nOn one fateful day, Ayane and Chizuru were jokingly suggesting that Sawako act as a ghost to scare fellow classmates for a \"Courage Test\" class event hosted by Kazehaya, when Sawako walked up to them and agreed to take on the role. When asked why, Sawako replied that she liked helping others and courageously admitted for the first time that she didn't actually have any supernatural powers. Ayane was at once blown away by her sincerity but social awkwardness, laughing hysterically at how weird the sticky situation that Sawako had been set up in was.\n\nA few days later, during class seating changes, all students were determined to avoid Sawako, for they thought she had supernatural powers and would make them sick. Sawako attempted to counter these rumors, but failed. Ayane was the only one who noticed.\n\nAyane constantly supports Sawako with her relationships, and is aware of the mutual feelings between Sawako and Shouta. She is amazed like many others at the effort Sawako puts into things, Even before they truly became friends, she already really started to like Sawako, as she couldn't stop thinking about Sawako's feelings of sincerity.\n\nSawako tells Ayane her thoughts\nSawako cries over Ayane's self-loathing.\nTogether with Chizuru, she always protects Sawako if someone hurts her, as seen when the girls from Class-A bully her, or when she notices Kurumi's actions against Sawako. She is not afraid of hurting others back for hurting Sawako, but will hold her feelings back if Sawako asks her to, an example being when she threatened Kurumi she would tell Shota about the truth about the rumors.\n\nSawako also influences Ayane in her love life. Sawako's innocence in love makes Ayane question her ways of being in relationships. When she notices how Sawako had tried so hard for her love with Shota, Ayane begins to become troubled over her relationship with Motoki, and cries over the fact that she is unable to love someone.\n\nLater, in Chapter 93, Sawako cries over Ayane's sadness and that she knows for sure Ayane is caring and kind, even if she doesn't realize it herself.\n\nNear the end of the series, Sawako thanks Ayane for everything she's done right before she leaves for Tokyo University, and that she will never forget her.\n\nKazuichi Arai\n\nPin Ayane Encounter\nAyane's initial lack of respect for Pin.\nAyane and Pin's relationship is one of the most significant of Ayane's relationships throughout her time in Kitahoro. At first, they did not get along well at all. Like a string of fate, they often met each other randomly and ended up arguing, especially on the road going home. However, watching them argue, many thought that they actually got along pretty well, and sometimes even better than with others.\n\nAyane initially thought of Pin as an shallow, arrogant, childish man. She had no respect for Pin as a teacher, and often wondered how he managed to become one in the first place.\n\nPin pats Ayane on the head\nPin assures Ayane that she is a kind person.\nFor a while, their relationship consisted of petty squabbles. But during an incident where Ayane gave him sweets as a gift and accidentally confided with him about her insecurities, Pin assured that she was kind, shocking her. This suddenly hinted at a change in their relationship, and they learned more about one another.\n\nAfterwards, while there seemed to be no visible change in their bickering relations, there was an underlying change in Ayane as she unconsciously started to wonder what kind of person he was, even as lowly and sloppy as he seemed. Even in Pin, there was also a change, where he noted that Ayane was quite intelligent but contrary to how people see her, rather immature.\n\nLater when realizing that Ayane had never had a proper romantic relationship, Pin helped her and Kento, someone who genuinely cared about her, become a couple. Later he told Sawako that it was a Christmas gift to her.\n\nNearing the beginning of her final year of high school, Ayane learned about Pin's past as a high school baseball prodigy, scouted by universities and professionals. However, he ended up turning them down and becoming a high school teacher. Ayane wondered why and theorized that he was also scared to take risks like her.\n\nHowever, Pin debunked this and explained that he chose to become a teacher because he found watching how students mature throughout their 3 years of high school interesting, and wanted to relive playing high school baseball again. Pin put forward a challenging question for Ayane highlighting her future career path: Has she ever tried to do her best in anything? This event drastically changed her perception of him.\n\nAyane admits that Pin is a good teacher\nRed-faced Ayane finally admits that Pin is actually a good teacher.\nThroughout her senior year, Ayane struggles with what she wants to do when she graduates and it is ultimately Pin who drives and encourages her, personally believing in her potential to become a tremendously successful person. As they begin to spend more time together and he sheds his usual rambunctious image to seriously help Ayane, she realizes that he saw through her from the beginning. Ayane begins to admire him as a teacher and an individual, cherishing every piece of advice and encouragement he's ever given her.\n\nIn the middle of her senior year, Ayane suddenly finds herself stammering and feeling self-conscious around Pin, as as well as thinking of him all the time. When it is put forth that he is still single and looking for a girlfriend, Ayane realizes that she has finally fallen in love for the first time with Pin. However, due to their nearly 10-year age gap and roles as teacher and student, Ayane believes that the chances that they will get together is 0% and after graduation, she will never see him again.\n\nAs a result, Ayane attempts to ignore her feelings, but Sawako and Chizuru notice Ayane's odd change in behavior around Pin. Sawako eventually calls her out on her romantic feelings, forcing her to tearfully accept them.\n\nLater, in a chance encounter while walking road home together during Christmas, Ayane accidentally slips out a hint of her feelings for him. Pin takes the hint, but also does not know how to accept or face the possibility of her loving him.\n\nA little before the entrance exams into the University of Tokyo, Ayane nervously asks Pin to give her an eraser as a congratulatory present if she passes. Pin agrees. Through Ayane studies hard and later ends up passing with flying colors, she finds herself unable to tell her exam result to Pin along with the other students. This causes him to worry about her for the entire day.\n\nDespite knowing that he may reject her feelings and that they may never become a couple, with the help of Sawako, Chizuru, and remembering Pin's own inspiring words, Ayane musters the courage to finally tell her exam result and confess her feelings to Pin at his apartment on Valentine's Day.\n\nAs expected, Pin gently rejects her confession as \"10 years too early\". However, just before she leaves, he gives her the eraser he promised. Reminiscing 2 years ago where she gave him sweets because he didn't have any, he praises her as a kind person. Applauding not only her academic efforts, but her growth as a person, Pin lets Ayane know that he believes in her future and encourages her to have have more self-confidence. Tearfully smiling, Ayane thanks Pin for everything he has done for her.\n\nRealizing that Pin has greatly influenced her as a person, Ayane wonders how she will be 10 years later, even without a love life, and aspires to become an adult that Pin won't be ashamed of.\n\nDuring her high school graduation, Ayane hopelessly ponders that they may never meet again, but Pin assures her that he will always support her no matter what. Just before parting ways, Ayane advises him to keep his hair up for the next 10 years. When Pin retorts that he would have anyway, Ayane laughs and explains that it's because he looks handsome with his hair down. It's heavily implied that she says this so that he does not get a girlfriend while she is gone and that they may very well meet again 10 years later.\n\nShouta Kazehaya\n\nHer connection to Shota isn't the best. Not only does she hit him when there are problems between Sawako and him, she also likes making jokes about him to the annoyance of Shota. For example when he was giving Sawako 'free jasmine tea'. She is known for playfully teasing him with Chizuru on his feelings for Sawako. When Ayane offered to help Shota with his love life, he quickly rejected, and Ayane realized he was the type who didn't want any interference of that sort.\n\nKento Miura\n\nHer relationship with Kento originally wasn't that good. She felt he was interfering in Sawako's and Shota's relationship, and had confronted him before about it. She yells at Kento at one point for making Sawako's and Shota's relationship more, and Ayane is one of the few people who knew Kento almost fell for Sawako. Later on, when they all go to the beach, Ayane comforts Kento who is still depressed about Sawako being with Shota. Later on, after breaking up with Motoki, she notices how she has never truly loved anyone, leading her to cry. Kento, who had noticed her before sitting alone, hugs her, asking Ayane why she won't tell him what's wrong. (She had been thinking in her head while she was crying, so Kento didn't really understand what was going on). She then later goes out with Kento in chapter 70. They share a fairly good relationship, but end up breaking up in chapter 95 when Ayane struggles with what she wants to do with the future.\n\nUme Kurumizawa\n\nAyane started off intently disliking Kurumi for being mean to Sawako, hiding her true nature behind a sweet facade, and being just as pretty as she herself. After Kurumi stopped concealing her real feelings, Ayane grew to respect Kurumi more. When Kurumi officially \"lost\" Kazehaya to Sawako, Ayane attempted to comfort her, making Kento note that she was a surprisingly kind person. When Kurumi returned later in the manga, both Sawako and Ayane began to spend more time with her and help her study for a teaching career, building a stronger friendship with her in the process."

Her nickname is \"Chizu\". She is in Kitahoro's basic school program. Out of the 4 heroines, she is the tallest and most athletic, boasting a streak of 99 victories wrestling guys in middle school. Though not very feminine, she likes wearing miniskirts and sports shorts to accent her legs. Because of her tomboyish appearance, she has often been mistaken for a former Yankee since childhood.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nChizuru is a high school girl with shoulder length brown hair, and dark brown eyes. She is almost always seen wearing a bright smile. She's the tallest of her female friends, and her breasts are almost nonexistent. She is mostly seen wearing either her school uniform, consisting of a white button-up shirt underneath a yellow vest, a blue skirt, and black knee socks, or in a red and white long sleeved shirt, and denim jeans.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nHer personality is fearless and hot-blooded, with a strong sense of duty and justice. Unlike Sawako and Ayane, Chizuru is extremely loud, brash, and talkative, always ready to speak her mind. She is cheerful with a large amount of fortitude enabling her to show courage in the face of adversity. Despite her intimidating nature, Chizuru has an unexpected sentimental side, often crying out of fear, frustration, anger, humiliation, or even comical effect. Not one of the brightest students, a running gag throughout the series is that she is constantly having classes during school breaks to make up her failed academic assignments. Additionally, she is often oblivious to her surroundings and insensitive to the feelings of others.\n\nChizuru is also a big fan of ramen, as shown when she wrote that she would like to study it in her career questionnaire, and Ayane onced joked that Chizuru was ramen in a previous life. Her favorite ramen shop is \"Tetsuryuken\", run by her childhood friend and neighbor Ryu Sanada's father, and she eventually ends up working there.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nRelationships\n\nRyu Sanada\n\nChizuru and Ryu as elementary schoolers\nChizuru and Ryu as elementary schoolers\nRyu is Chizuru's childhood friend, next door neighbor, and later fiancé. As their parents were close, they were inseparable from the time they were toddlers to the time they graduated from Kitahoro High School. For a long time, their relationship was that of siblings, or as Chizuru joked, \"brothers\".\n\nDuring their early childhood days, while their parents visited each other, they would often play, fight, and eat together. Ryu's personality was quiet, while Chizuru's was loud, and he not easily understood by his peers or even his own family. But since Chizuru was always with him, she was somehow always able to understand his feelings.\n\nTheir lives changed forever in elementary school when Ryu's mother Tetsuko Sanada tragically died in a car accident. During the aftermath, Ryu went under depression and did not smile for many months. Chizuru was unable to understand what he was thinking during this time, but realizing that Ryu was probably suffering, went as far as to leave his favorite food, Onigiri, at his doorstep. After finding Chizuru standing at his doorstep crying with Onigiri, Ryu finally let down his stoic face and broke down crying for the first time since his mother's death, and they hugged each other.\n\nThe same year, his older brother Toru would have to leave for college. Aware that Ryu now would only have his father, Toru asked Chizuru to look after Ryu. On the evening Toru left, Chizuru vowed to Ryu, while they both sat looking out at the sea, that she would become his \"sister\" (sometimes interchanged with brothers due to Chizuru's tomboyish nature) and be by his side forever. It would be upon this promise that their relationship akin to siblings would be founded until Ryu confessed his unrequited romantic feelings to the horrified Chizuru at the age of 16.\n\nFrom a young age, Ryu had known that Chizuru wished to become his older brother Toru's bride and presumably Ryu's sister-in-law. However, he also knew that her wish was in vain, for Toru only saw her as a little sister. Ryu himself had developed his own crush on Chizuru, though was patient, accepting that Chizuru probably wouldn't see him in a romantic light, at least not right away.\n\nRyu confesses to Chizuru\nRyu confesses to Chizuru.\nBefore the start of the series, Chizuru was shown to be studying hard for the entrance exams to get into Kitahoro High School. Ryu believes that it is because Toru graduated from there. Later this is revealed to actually be because Ryu was going there, and she did not wish to become separated from him.\n\nAt the start of the series, Ryu is one of Chizuru's only friends (the other being Shouta Kazehaya) until she meets Ayane Yano. Before the summer break, she and Ayane also meet and befriend Sawako Kuronuma. Later when rumors about Ayane and herself began spreading throughout the school, Ryu has enough confidence to not believe in them. When Chizuru begins to doubt Sawako's credibility, Ryu lends a listening ear and offers to comfort her if things don't go well. Things do end up well, however, and feeling grateful, Chizuru invites Sawako and Chizuru over to Ryu's house to let him know.\n\nChizuru realizes that her relationship with Ryu has ended\nChizuru bursts into tears when she realizes that her friendship with Ryu has ended.\nNear the end of their freshman year, Ryu discovers that Toru has found a fiancée and is visiting during Christmas/New Year Break. He does not know how to properly tell Chizuru the news without distressing her. Chizuru also hurts his feelings by kicking him out of her house before he can explain, though it is only because she wanted to hide her birthday present for Ryu until his birthday. As a result a misunderstanding ensues, and while visiting Ryu one night along with friends, Chizuru discovers with horror that Toru is getting married. Feeling out of place, Chizuru hides her sorrow and avoids Ryu's house, waiting until Toru has left to give her present to Ryu. Misinterpreting her arrival as a means to visit Toru, Ryu becomes annoyed at her indifference towards him. Remorselessly repeating that Toru never had feelings for her, Ryu coldly expresses his happiness that they would never get together. Chizuru throws the present at Ryu's face in a rage, calling him a \"baseball freakazoid\". As she runs away, Ryu angrily mutters that she's an \"idiot\".\n\nThe next day, they get into a fight in the school cafeteria. Chizuru ignores Ryu, and Ryu grabs her arm. Elbowing him, Chizuru explains that she never thought of visiting Toru because it wasn't her place to do so. Instead, she came to visit Ryu. Ryu realizes that she was the only person who remembered his birthday (because his entire family was more worried about Toru), and that he misunderstood her intentions this whole time. Feeling guilty but thankful, Ryu calls Toru to come back and visit Chizuru one last time before his marriage. Despite her heartbreak, Chizuru is glad that Toru came to visit, and realizes that Ryu must have called him back.\n\nAfter Toru left, Ryu finds Chizuru sitting at the same place near the sea, where she promised to be by his side forever. Ryu offers once again to comfort her. Chizuru thanks him for calling Toru, and reminisces their times together. She begins to deny her own feelings for Toru, hypothesizing that she only thought of him as an older brother deep down. But Ryu, who had always been watching her, affirms that she had \"really liked him\". At this, Chizuru begins to cry, asking for Ryu to comfort her. Ryu hugs her, and they reconcile.\n\nRyu and Chizuru remain close friends. During the next summer, Chizuru finds out that a girl has confessed to Ryu on the class school trip, and that Ryu rejected the girl, saying he already liked someone else. The girl confronts Chizu and asks her to leave Ryu alone, claiming that it's unfair for her to spend so much time around Ryu if she doesn't like him in that way. Chizu is angry, and also feels jealous and upset that Ryu likes someone and hasn't told her. This results in a conversation during which Ryu confesses his feelings to Chizu, who is taken aback and rejects him, admitting that she's never looked at him in that way. The two stay friends and continue to act normally for a while, but Chizu is privately confused and anxious about their changing friendship. She skips school to avoid Ryu, and later confronts him, accusing him of ruining their friendship. Ryu shouts back at her that he'd wanted their friendship to end, stunning her into silence. Later, the pair reconcile and give each other gifts at the school Christmas party, although Chizu is still confused about the nature of their relationship and her own feelings.\n\nSlowly, Chizuru begins to realise her own feelings for Ryu, but she worries both due to her previous feelings for Toru and her fear that they could break up and lose one another. Although she had been assuming the pair would both stay in town, Chizuru later discovers that Ryu plans to go away to play baseball at university. She tries to support him, but gradually becomes more despondent, especially as Ryu is busy training and has less time for her. When Ryu goes to talk to her outside her house on the evening of her birthday, Chizuru tries to offer him encouragement but begins to cry instead. Yelling out her feelings of not wanting to be separated from Ryu, Chizuru eventually confesses her own realized feelings for him. At this, Ryu finally kisses her, starting a relationship.\n\nAlthough Chizuru feels guilt over holding Ryu back, and conflicted about his going away, she eventually comes around to support him in his plans. When Ryu's team lose an important game, she goes to comfort him and reassures him that he can go away to play baseball at university and she'll wait for him. The pair have a close relationship for the rest of the series. Chizuru works at Ryu's dad's ramen store, having realised that this is what she wants to do, and she and Ryu agree to have a long-distance relationship until Ryu returns from university and they can start a family together whilst running the business.\n\nAyane Yano\n\nChizuru and Ayane were first at odds with each other at the start of their first year in Kitahoro High School, after finding out that they came from rival middle schools. Thus, they were initially uncomfortable with sitting next to each other at first. However, after Chizuru defended Ayane from a group of guys harassing her, and they challenged each other to long-distance running at their next P.E. class, they began to respect each other and develop more of a friendship, though they still have minor bugbears with each other - Ayane, due to an obsession with her weight, often refuses to dine at the ramen bar with Chizuru, while Chizuru prefers not to hear ghost stories or watch horror movies.\n\nSawako Kuronuma\n\nChizuru's initial interactions with Sawako are seen jointly alongside Ayane, both initially scared of her but soon accepting her as a friend. Sawako took the first step by submitting her name to the attendance sheet for the end-of-term test of courage, and being rewarded with a bottle of green tea for her ghost role. The next term, Sawako causes a misunderstanding by telling her old classmate Shino that Ayane and Chizuru aren't her friends, the latter two having heard through eavesdropping on their conversation. This was also around the time that they were hearing rumors about themselves, allegedly being spread by Sawako. Despite clearly being unhappy with her, they continue to talk to each other about her, both realizing they want to be friends with Sawako. Thus, when they find out that Sawako was confronting the rumor-spreaders themselves, they come to Sawako's rescue.\n\nLater on, Chizuru confides with Sawako on a deeper level - though it is unclear whether she already told Ayane first, she does tell Sawako that she likes Ryu's brother. When the truth about Toru is revealed to Chizuru, Sawako and Ayane all at once, the latter two end up worrying for Chizuru, whose unusually bright mood after the event they perceive as a coping mechanism. Sawako and Ayane later witness Chizuru storm off after arguing with Ryu, and catch up to her. When Sawako cries after Chizuru tries to brush off the argument, Chizuru lets her guard down and cries too, finally letting out her feelings regarding the events.\n\nDuring the second year, when it's Sawako's turn to be more upfront over her own feelings, Chizuru at one point scolds her. This turned out to be enough to make Sawako admit later on that the friendship she made with Chizuru and Ayane was special. Sawako later returns the favor by seeing Chizuru when she skipped class in an attempt to avoid Ryu.\n\nShouta Kazehaya\n\nChizuru was in Shouta's class during middle school. Shouta initially has a low opinion of Chizuru because of the numerous times she tried to set Shouta up with a girl who wanted to confess to him. However, he doesn't break off relations completely because he knows his best friend, Ryu, has a crush on Chizuru, and thus acts as a mediator for Ryu's attempts to get closer to her. Soon, Chizuru is aware of Sawako's feelings for Shouta, but when approached by Shouta about it, Chizuru gives Shouta the wrong idea by claiming he never understood Sawako as well as he thought he did.\n\nToru Sanada\n\nChizuru has always liked Toru since she was in elementary school and had wished to marry him when she grew up. Toru would always laugh and pat her head after Chizuru would bring an insect to him. When she learns that Toru is getting married, she pretends that it was OK, only to cry later. She confessed to Toru before Toru left the town. Toru replied by saying that he had always seen her as a little sister and that will never change. Afterwards, Chizuru admitted to Ryu that she ended up seeing Toru as a big brother too, and cried over the realization. After being allowed to attend Toru's wedding as a bridesmaid, Chizuru solidifies her sibling-like association with Toru by also getting along with his wife, especially after they have their first child."

He's an earnest and great guy. Ever since he was a kid, so long as he could find one thing to motivate him, he would be satisfied. He would silently overcome the toughest of times. He wouldn't blame anyone. Ryu would just quietly persevere.\"\n\n- Chizuru Yoshida describing Ryu's personality\n\nRyu Sanada (真田 龍, Sanada Ryū) is a character in the series Kimi ni Todoke. He is the son of the ramen shop owner of Chizuru Yoshida's favorite ramen shop and a member of Sawako Kuronuma's group of friends.\n\nAppearance\n\nRyu is a tall, fit and considerably good-looking beige-skinned boy who inherited his father Genji Sanada's looks; shaved black hair and sharp, slanted brown eyes.\n\nWhen in school, he either wears the standard Kitahoro High School male uniform, a tucked-in white blouse, blue pants, and rubber shoes, occasionally wearing the blue blazer and red tie; or his baseball attire, a white shirt with long black sleeves, white pants, baseball cleats, and a blue cap with a \"K\" on it.\n\nHis casual and winter wear comprise of black, grey, and white tees, bottoms, and jackets or hoodies. When exercising, he wears a black and white cap with an \"RHCP\" logo on it.\n\nPersonality\n\nRyu is a quiet and reserved guy, one who rarely talks but is able to communicate well with others. While he appears to be clueless most of the time, he is actually very sensitive and in-tune to the feelings of others, most especially Chizuru Yoshida's. On more than one occasion, he has been shown to be aware of people's thoughts and concerns just by observing their behavior. He himself, however, does not reveal his feelings or emotions as openly as others.\n\nHe is often shown to be sleepy while in class and does seem to enjoy napping whenever possible. Ryu also is considered to be quite smart, once passing his exams without needing remedial classes, much to Chizuru's surprise.\n\nHe sacrifices a lot to comfort others, something that Chizuru is very aware of. He is also capable of giving helpful advice to his friends when his opinion is sought in different situations. However, due to his bluntness and direct demeanor, his advice can sometimes be misunderstood.  \n\nRyu also seems to like animals a lot; when Shouta Kazehaya was going to walk Pedro Martinez, his adopted puppy, home with Sawako Kuronuma, Chizuru pulls Ryu away and tells him that he will walk with her and Ayane Yano instead. While being pulled away from Shota's puppy, he cries out for it. \n\nRyu is also very hardworking, shown when he is exercising every night, playing baseball, or working in his family's ramen shop. He aspires to be accepted into university and continue playing baseball. \n\nADVERTISEMENT\nRelationships\n\nChizuru Yoshida\n\nRyu smiling at chizu\nRyu and Chizu\nRyu is a close childhood friend of Chizuru, having been neighbors and friends since they were young, and having supported one another through many difficult times (such as the death of Ryu's mother in the third grade). His feelings for Chizuru were established early on and was hinted on several occasions. He does not deny having feelings for her and later confirms his love for her to Sawako Kuronuma[1]. While his love is unrequited, he is very patient with Chizuru, still staying friends and knowing that she will not immediately like him romantically. He is more than willing to comfort her when she is upset, though he would rather have her mad at him, knowing that is how she can vent out her emotions better. \n\nIn the manga, during a school trip to Okinawa, a girl confesses her feelings for Ryu, who rejects her because he \"likes someone else.\"[2] After Chizuru hears about it and was later confronted by the girl, who assumed that the girl he likes was her[3]. Chizuru felt bothered not being informed about who he liked and wondered who she was. Later on, Ryu properly confesses to her about his feelings, saying that she was always the only one he liked[4]. After this, she starts to become increasingly awkward around Ryu, stuttering while speaking, blurting out random insults, or just being at a complete loss for words. He notices this change in her, despite her denial. Chizuru denies having any romantic feelings towards Ryu, and Ryu remains patient with her, accepting whatever decision she may make.  \n\nWhen Ryu decides and tells Chizuru that he wants to attend university, it shocks her, thinking he would always remain in their hometown. She becomes confused and distant from him, and later notices and wonders that she always thinks and worries about him. When it was her birthday, he drops by Chizuru's house while on his run to greet her and finds her sitting on the front steps. He asks if anything is wrong, knowing she would always sit there when she was in trouble when they were younger. He claims that while he didn't bring her a present, he promises to \"win\" and achieve his goals for her because she had always been encouraging him throughout his life. At this point, she bursts into tears and begs him not to go, to his surprise. She later lies that she was joking, but then he grabs her hand and asks if she likes him. Though unresponsive at first, she later replies that she does, finally reciprocating. He then immediately leans forward and kisses her, unexpectedly staying over at her house afterward. Later on, it is confirmed by Chizuru to Sawako that they are dating[5]. \n\nAfter losing the North Hokkaido tournament, Ryu stays by the dock to where he and Chizuru go to when they feel down. After Chizuru comforts him, he finally starts to cry, thinking his baseball career is over. After Chizuru's reassurance that it is not, that there is still university for him and that she will support him no matter what, they kiss. He promises to return as soon as he can, saying once he does, they both can become a family and manage his family's shop together[6]. \n\nShouta Kazehaya\n\nShouta ryu pedro martinez (by frogggy89)\nRyu with Shouta, holding Pedro Martinez.\nRyu and Shouta were friends since they both were on the baseball team in their former middle school. They hang around at Ryu's house and attend parties together, sometimes along with Sawako Kuronuma, Chizuru Yoshida and Ayane Yano.\n\nThey talk and listen to each other about their problems, either Chizuru or Sawako-related ones to their own insecurities, and cheer for each other to succeed. \n\nToru Sanada\n\nRyu loves and respects his older brother Toru, respectably referring to him as \"[o]ni-san\" and at one time \"aniki.\" Although it is not obvious, Ryu was jealous of Toru because he knows of Chizuru Yoshida's crush on him. Toru, who was probably aware of Ryu's crush on her, says that she and Ryu would make a good couple, much to Ryu's agreement."

Straightforward people.\"\n\n- Kurumi to Sawako Kuronuma's parents\n\nUme Kurumizawa (胡桃沢 梅 Kurumizawa Ume), nicknamed Kurumi (くるみ), is a character in the series Kimi ni Todoke. She is a girl who appears friendly and sweet to everyone around her and she has had a huge crush on Shouta Kazehaya since their first year of middle school.\nAppearance\n\n.\nKurumi is a very cute girl with wavy waist-length golden-brown hair that she usually ties back in a braided bun on the right side with bangs hanging over her forehead and chocolate-brown eyes.\n\nAlthough she mostly has her hair tied in a half side bun, she ties her hair into any type of style like:\n\nA Ponytail\nLow twin pigtails\nLeaving it completely down\n\nPersonality\n\nEarlier in the Kimi ni Todoke manga, Kurumi initially shows herself as a very cute and nice girl who was constantly smiling, and Sawako admired her and looked up to her as her role model. She later sheds her fake personality and shows that she can be aggressive and manipulative when it comes to Kazehaya. Kurumi is very honest and upfront about her feelings, later showing that she lacks self-esteem and considers herself to have a \"bad personality\", something that Sawako vehemently denies. Kurumi is very ambitious and driven no matter what her goal, and is shown to be stressed own and deprived of sleep when studying to become a teacher. As she matures, she becomes more accepting of others' help, such as Sawako's. In the end, she herself ends up helping Sawako, which consisted of defending her against bullies after Kazehaya's confession.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nBackground\n\nA girl who appears friendly and sweet to everyone around her, she has had a huge crush on Kazehaya since their first year of middle school. She dislikes her given name, Ume, because it sounds old-fashioned and prefers to be called \"Kurumi.\" When she was in middle school, many of the girls hung around her to get attention from other boys who found Kurumi attractive and began to see her as a \"boyfriend stealer\" since many of the boys they liked would only ask her out. Kurumi was deeply hurt and saddened by this and one day, while crying alone in the classroom, Kazehaya came and comforted her, leading to her developing feelings for him. It is possible that her fake personality comes from the pain she received from the people who she thought were her \"friends\", who turned out to only use her and that she feels she can't trust others. She is extremely jealous of Sawako , which led her to spread fake rumors of Sawako's only friends at the time, Yoshida and Yano , using Sawako's name. Kurumi does not attend the same class as Sawako or Kazehaya. She eventually confesses her love to Kazehaya, but receives an expected rejection. Because she is always surprised with Sawako's naivete, Kurumi is able to be her true self in front of Sawako and regards her as a rival for Kazehaya's affection. Following Kazehaya's rejection, she becomes colder to her classmates, but is able to finally express her feelings and personality, which makes them respect her more.\n\nAfter Kazehaya and Sawako become a couple in chapter 42, Kurumi disappears from the series until chapter 83, revealing that she wishes to study to become a teacher, which is Sawako's goal as well. She and Sawako thus form more of a friendship as they agree to help each other do the best they can in pursuing their mutual dream.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nRelationships\n\nShouta Kazehaya\n\nKurumi was initially in love with Kazehaya, but her confession of love was rejected by him. Eventually, she accepted him as just a friend.\n\nSawako Kuronuma\n\nFormerly rivals in love whom Kurumi greatly mistreated at the start, Kurumi and Sawako became incredibly close after Sawako and Kazehaya officially become a couple, with both of them supporting each other as they enter university life. The guilt Kurumi felt about how she hurt Sawako with the spreading of false rumors became overwhelming, and it took quite some time before she could forgive herself in spite of how much Sawako and her friends reassured her that they had forgiven her. By the end of the manga, Kurumi admits to herself internally that she's become fonder of Sawako than she ever was of Kazehaya.\n\nAyane Yano\n\nInitially at odds due to how Kurumi treated Sawako, Ayane and Kurumi eventually bond over their numerous similarities. At one point, Ayane says that if she were a boy she would accept Kurumi as a girlfriend, as she can understand and forgive all of her flaws and past mistakes.\n\nChizuru Yoshida\n\nChizuru was in the same middle school class as Kurumi and Kazehaya. Chizuru was manipulated by Kurumi during middle school - Kurumi asked her to set girls up to confess to Kazehaya, as Kurumi knew Chizuru had no romantic interest in Kazehaya. This caused Kazehaya to view Chizuru in a poor light. Once Chizuru knew Kurumi was responsible for the rumors being spread about her, she made her disapproval towards Kurumi clear, though eventually came to respect Kurumi for her \"true\" attitude. However, much later when Kurumi starts being more friendly towards Sawako and Ayane, Chizuru doesn't take this too kindly.\n\nKento Miura\n\nKurumi was in Kento's first-year class before Kento was transferred to Class D for the second and third years. Kento had noticed a change in Kurumi's behavior as time went on. During the second year, Kurumi found out from the numerous gossips that Kento had been interfering with Sawako and Kazehaya, so pulled him over to find out the truth. Kurumi was also less than impressed with Kento's proposal to go after Sawako so that Kurumi could get with Kazehaya, as by that time, she knew she had no chance.\n\nKazuichi \"Pin\" Arai\n\nKurumi's plan to \"get\" Kazehaya during the sports festival was partly foiled by Pin. When Kurumi waited at the school's equipment shed for Kazehaya to return with the key to the shed from the committee, it was instead Pin who came by the shed and unlocked it for her, only to then misinterpret Kurumi's intentions and reject her in front of Kazehaya. Pin then admitted the rejection to his other students, leading them to believe Kurumi liked Pin.\n\nEiji Akahoshi\n\nEiji is Sawako's cousin, a student at H University in Sapporo. He meets Kurumi when he intervenes at the mixer that Kurumi and Sawako are attending to stop a man at a mixer that who they become uncomfortable with. Sawako introduces Kurumi and Eiji to one another, and Eiji teases Kurumi for wanting a boyfriend and immediately calls her by her given name, Ume, instead of her preferred nickname. Although her first impression is that he is mean and unlike Sawako, she doesn't turn down his suggestion that they try dating each other. They begin spending more time together, they start developing feelings for one another. However, Kurumi feels insecure over her past behavior and doubts Eiji's feelings for her, believing that he'll eventually fall in love with a nice girl instead. She gradually realizes his feelings are genuine and eventually become a couple."

He is introduced as a new classmate of Sawako Kuronuma and several others in their second year of high school, having been in Ume Kurumizawa's first-year class.\n\nAppearance\n\n\nKento Miura\nAs seen in the manga.\nKento has blond, wavy hair, and is shown to be tall, although his height has not been confirmed. When Sawako met him, she imagines him as an American. He has brown/yellow eyes, and is seen usually wearing the usual school uniform.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nA flamboyant and charming personality, Kento immediately makes his interest in Sawako clear when he joins her class and gets seated next to her, which makes Sawako's actual love interest, Shouta Kazehaya, jealous. Although similar to Kazehaya in that he is kind and outgoing, Kazehaya merely puts on a facade to cover his insecurities while Kento embraces the attention he receives. Kento also has a female fan following which he developed as a result of helping girls through their own heartbreaks; his fans agree to not become romantically involved with him, or his other friend Tsuru.\n\nKento is also quick to jump to conclusions. For example, he attacked Mogi Motoki thinking the latter had assaulted Ayane Yano, when in fact it was the guy Ayane dated before Mogi that did this to her.\n\nKento goes on to study interior design after graduating from Kitahoro High School.\n\nRelationships\n\nSawako Kuronuma\n\nHis interactions with main character Sawako upon being seated next to her in class during second year, are the driving force behind Sawako finally realizing her feelings for Kazehaya. He helps organize the after-school study sessions for the first mid-terms, and sees Sawako teach. Then, partially out of his own interest towards Sawako, Kento tries to convince Sawako that she no longer needs Kazehaya, telling her that Kazehaya likes someone, though he didn't know who Kazehaya liked at the time.\n\nAfter Sawako and Kazehaya officially get together, Kento is both happy for Sawako and sad for himself, though manages to get over it by courting one of Sawako's friends.\n\nAyane Yano\n\nAyane was initially hostile to Kento after suspecting that he would meddle in Sawako's attempts to get closer to Kazehaya, which he did do after all, and was thus told to stay away from Sawako. Kento starts showing interest in Ayane once Sawako and Kazehaya go out together, but is turned down once by her. Before leaving Okinawa, Ayane breaks up with another boy that had asked her out, and Kento happens to be the first person she reveals the breakup to. It takes a while for Ayane to consider whether to go into another relationship, and whether she's serious about them, but she is apparently sold on dating Kento when he goes after her during the Christmas party and offers her a bouquet, despite it being trampled on.\n\nGoing into the new year and the final term of the second year, however, both Ayane and Kento are forced to think about their futures as individuals, and thus, even though they exchange chocolates on Valentine's Day, and Ayane gets a present from Kento on her birthday, the relationship fails to progress. Ayane becomes increasingly frustrated at Kento making his decisions based on where she goes, and thus, it doesn't take long for the relationship to be severed, although both agree to properly meet to call off the relationship. They do not avoid each other after breaking up; Kento congratulates Ayane on her entry into Tokyo University during graduation.\n\nShouta Kazehaya\n\nBefore transferring into his class, Kento was somewhat aware of the kind of person Kazehaya was. After helping to organize the study sessions for Sawako to oversee as a teacher, Kento encounters Kazehaya and tries to get him to stop bothering Sawako, explaining that she fits in class just fine and doesn't need Kazehaya's help anymore. Kento also asks whether Kazehaya likes someone; Kazehaya says he does but doesn't reveal anything beyond this due to Kento's arrogance. Kazehaya next encounters Kento holding Sawako's arms and trying to comfort her. He immediately brushes Kento off of Sawako, claiming that Kento hurt Sawako. After three classmates see the commotion, Kazehaya confesses and walks off, with Sawako following him. Kento does not encounter Kazehaya again until after the latter officially starts going out with Sawako; there, Kento reveals why Sawako had cried in front of him, and Kazehaya doesn't take this well.\n\nRelations only start to cool once Kento pursues a relationship of his own, this time with Ayane, and Kazehaya was someone he sought advice from despite the latter not knowing much about Ayane himself.\n\nUme Kurumizawa\n\nKento was only in Kurumi's class for the first year; he too had noticed how Kurumi changed from being sweet to being rude. When Kurumi starts hearing rumors about Sawako rejecting Kazehaya, the first person she goes to for clarification is Kento. The next day, Kento hears that Kurumi liked Kazehaya too, and proposes that he goes out with Sawako so that Kurumi can get with Kazehaya - Kurumi slaps Kento on the face for making such a suggestion, and runs away. Much later on, Kento appears to eavesdrop on Sawako's conversation with Kurumi at the rooftop, and after seeing Kurumi again, Kurumi admits to Kento that her ship had long sailed."

He works as a gym teacher and baseball coach in Kitahoro High School. When the original homeroom teacher for Sawako Kuronuma's class, Zen, becomes sick during the summer holidays, Pin debuts as their temporary homeroom teacher. Eventually he takes over as their permanent homeroom teacher when Zen decides to retire and take over his new wife's sake business.\n\nAn avid baseball player, Pin attended Kitahoro High School around 10 years ago. He also used to be on Shouta Kazehaya's father's baseball league team and has been a long-time frequenter at the ramen shop owned by Ryu Sanada's family, so he has known him, Ryu and Chizuru Yoshida since when they were young. He is an old high school friend of Toru Sanada.\n\nAlthough regarded by most to be an arrogant, childish man who only wants to get a paycheck and a kick out of bullying his students. his motivation behind choosing the teaching profession are later revealed to be much more than that. Despite his frequent antics, throughout the series, Pin takes on the role of a mysteriously insightful mentor that is always looking after his students, especially Sawako and her friends.\n\nAppearance\n\nPin has auburn spiky hair, angular eyes, tanned skin, thickly arched eyebrows, and a blinding smile. He has a stocky build, broad back, and large, clumsy hands. With a whopping height of 6'4'' (193 cm), and his hair adding a couple inches, Pin is taller than the average Japanese male (often standing out in crowds), and the tallest character in the series.\n\nWhen at Kitahoro High School, he is usually seen wearing a bright orange sweater, training pants, white socks, brown slippers, a necklace carrying a whistle, and at times carrying a clipboard. He is also seen wearing a red T-shirt, sometimes with the kanji 唯我独尊 (ゆいがどくそん/Self-conceitedness) on it. During entrance and exiting ceremonies, he was seen wearing a formal suit, dress pants, and tie. Usually when out during cold weather, he wears a dark red striped jacket with a golden eagle and the word \"Japan\" embroidered on the back.\n\nAccording to Pin's own opinion, he is very handsome, even having the gall to state that he would fall for himself if born a woman. Most people think the opposite. However, Toru Sanada has explained that much of his appearance is ruined only due to his ostentatious spiky hair, and that he is in fact very handsome when he lets it down. Ayane Yano also notices this in her third year, and suddenly aware that he could easily get a girlfriend if he let it down, asks him to leave it up.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nOutwardly, Pin exudes the air of a loud, eccentric man prone to believing the silliest superstitions. A running gag through the series is that despite being a teacher, he comically tends towards actions that are more suited to a teenager, such as eagerly running to the bathroom when he hears about a fight. With a life philosophy of \"I'm the best\", Pin is very arrogant, egotistical, and self-indulging, seen many times praising and singing about himself.\n\nNever taking his students seriously in the beginning of the series, especially Shouta Kazehaya, whom he often trolls as a pastime, at first glance Pin seems to hate them and only care about himself. But strangely, whenever his students are in dire need, he becomes the assistant to the early mental developments in each, giving advice that causes them to suddenly question the circumstances thoroughly before doing an action. Though comically, he would ruin their impressions with more self-indulgent praise.\n\nDespite his teasing (which Toru asserted as \"affection\"), underneath it all Pin is actually a very insightful teacher who fiercely cares for his students. He has been watching \"Kuronuma's group\" especially ever since he first became their temporary homeroom teacher, and considers them an interesting highlight of his career.\n\nAround 10 years ago, Pin himself was implied to be a high school student at Kitahoro High School and was very popular among his classmates. Toru deemed him as the \"reckless hero of their generation\". The best baseball player in high school as well as on Kazehaya's father's baseball league team, Pin was often scouted by universities and even professionals. Aiming to get into a first-class university and fulfill his childhood dreams of becoming a professional baseball player, he was the second person to be nominated for a spot.\n\nHowever, at a turn of events, Pin made a decision that would forever crush his dreams: to turn down the invitation and become a teacher. It was not an easy decision, and for a long time, he was quite troubled over it. However, he had his reasons: though he could have walked a different path, he loved high school baseball even more, and he wanted to relive it again as Kitahoro's baseball coach. His love for teaching is later expanded to include his class when he becomes their homeroom teacher, finding how his students change and grow into their identities throughout their 3 years of high school interesting.\n\nPin has extreme confidence in his own abilities, especially when it came to his career choice. Self-confidence is arguably the the biggest quality that he sincerely advocates for, believing it essential for an individual to reach their full potential. He believes in taking responsibility for one's actions, and focusing on bettering oneself before bettering others. Also shown to be extremely observant, he is easily able to understand his students, even about things that they do not completely understand themselves.\n\nHe especially takes the stage when the main cast enter their final year of high school. Having his students' best interests at heart when the time arrives for them to decide their futures, he encourages them to take risks, push past their limits, and put in their best efforts to accomplish their dreams.\n\nPin is a flirtatious guy, but is always rejected while \"girl-hunting\" due to his personality and hairstyle. Though around 24 years old at the start and 27 by the end of the series, he remains single the entire time. His own romantic standards, however, are quite high. All he wishes to meet is the right girl, who must be within strict age limits.\n\nRelationships\n\nAyane Yano\n\nMain article: \nSawako Kuronuma\n\nOn his debut as a homeroom teacher, Pin dispels the rumor that \"bad things happen if one stares at Sadako for more than three seconds\", although he later reports weird things happening to him afterwards. Despite this, he so happens to take Sawako's advice seriously on two occasions afterwards, though the second occasion left him bed-ridden.\n\nDuring the lead-up to the second-year cultural festival, both Sawako and Shouta separately inform Pin of having been rejected by their crushes. Pin's only advice in response is to tell them to give up on each other. However, after day one of the cultural festival, Sawako admits to performance anxiety due to the events that happened earlier. Pin pays no heed, instead telling Sawako about his plan to win the parade segment of the festival on the next day, though this does eventually get Pin's class disqualified from that segment. That night, however, it becomes clear to Pin that Sawako and Shouta did confess to each other, and so Pin deliberately causes a misunderstanding on Sawako's part, daring Shouta to clear it up. Later, during their Christmas party, when Pin was about to crash the karaoke bar, he instead encounters Sawako outside and sits her down for an honest discussion about her relationship. Then, during the final term of the second year, as well as into the third year, Pin holds careers meetings with Sawako, and seems impressed with the career choice that Sawako made, although he boasts that no-one could be a better teacher than him.\n\nShouta Kazehaya\n\nPin knows Shouta since he was little because he was in the league team coached by Shouta's father. He habitually makes Shouta his slave by threatening him to do work or face the wrath of Pin revealing his ultimately embarrassing past.\n\nSometimes, he too, makes Shouta his chatting friend by making him sit in the teachers' lounge listening to his never-ending stories of nonsensical things. Despite his threats, Pin acts as somehow a responsible guardian for Shouta, giving him advice when he felt troubled after various misunderstandings between him and Sawako. Though his method of advising hurts him, it makes him think about things more thoroughly to make a rational decision.\n\nToru Sanada\n\nHe and Toru are Kitahoro High alumni and former baseball team-mates that have known each other for a long time. Unlike Pin, Toru is good at flirting, which Pin also envies him for and is disappointed, that Toru could not go \"girl-hunting\" with him, because of him being engaged."

For that reason, he used to go out with several students from that school. He fell madly in love with Sachi, which he could not overcome in its entirety until he met Ume Kurumizawa.\n\nAppearance\n\nEiji is described as a pretty tall and handsome boy, he has fierce eyes that make him look like a bad boy but the truth is that he is quite kind. In his high school year, he was quite popular, so he earned several nicknames, including the king of dating. Today he is still quite popular, so bad rumors about him are still spreading. He doesn't usually smile due to this matter.\n\nHe gives off a cold aura if he is silent for a long time, something typical of Sawako's family.\n\nPersonality\n\nIn his high school years he used to be quite aggressive, his personality was quite close to the tsundere. He also used to be quite petty and arrogant, in addition to stingy. This was changed when he met Sachi Takamura. With her, he was gradually showing his true way of being, which is a very determined and persistent boy but also very understanding and kind to his peers.\n\nCurrently his personality has matured much more since the events of Crazy for You and he has managed to be a much calmer and less aggressive, although he has become much more assertive about what he wants. This has allowed him to firmly approach Ume, who is very cautious of strangers.\n\nEiji also has a strong liking for the extravagant, even so he manages to look good in everything he uses, even if he is considered distasteful.\nPlot\n\nEijimanga\nEiji in Crazy for You\nEiji was one of the main characters of Crazy for You, set during his time in secondary school. He fell in love with Sachi Takamura and tried to have her return his feelings, despite knowing she was in love with his friend Yukihiro Miyamoto. Eiji eventually conceded that Sachi would never love him back, and began to wonder if he would only be attracted to people who were in love with someone else. He eventually began attending H University after finishing high school.\n\nEiji is briefly mentioned in Kimi ni Todoke as Sawako's cousin when she visits the shrine on New Year's Eve with Shouta Kazehaya for the first time and tells Kazehaya about her family. She mentions that her cousin Eiji would often call her a \"zashiki warashi\", a lucky household spirit from Japanese folklore, which Sawako secretly felt was a compliment. Eiji later appears in the fanbook's special chapter, Sawako and Brother Eiji, set shortly after Sawako's first date with Kazehaya. Now a college student, Eiji visits the Kuronuma household, where he notices how much Sawako has changed since he last saw her. While looking at the photos in her room, Eiji notices one of Kazehaya, which flusters Sawako when she returns to find him looking at the photo. Eiji asks if she likes the boy, which Sawako reluctantly admits to, which Eiji tells her is terrible because the boy she likes seems popular. Thinking to himself that first loves don't come true, he's surprised when Sawako gets a call from Kazehaya because he thought it was a case of unrequited love. When he asks if she has a boyfriend, she answers yes and tries to avoid telling him anything else. As he continues to look at the photos in her room of her friends, Eiji asks if she's enjoying high school, which she affirms. Sawako asks if he enjoyed his time in high school, which Eiji said he did, and that he's still friends with the people he knew. Sawako's father comes home and greets his nephew and asks why he's leaving already. Eiji smiles and places a hand on his uncle's shoulder. Mr. Kuronuma questions why Eiji is comforting him, but Eiji simply says he \"doesn't know\" before saying goodbye.\n\nAfter Sawako and Ume begin attending university in Sapporo, they attend a mixer event at a restaurant where Eiji is coincidentally having dinner with his friend Yuuhei. He notices one attendee at the mixer event seems to be causing trouble for Sawako and Ume, and eventually steps in when the girls become visibly uncomfortable. They leave the restaurant together, where Eiji chides Sawako for attending a mixer when she has a boyfriend, and Sawako introduces Eiji as her cousin and Ume as best friend. Eiji begins teasing Ume for wanting to attend a mixer, referring to her given name immediately, and suggesting that he can introduce her to guys if she wants a boyfriend. While outraged at Eiji's behavior, she accepts an invitation to have dinner at Sawako's apartment with Eiji.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nRelationships\n\nUme Kurumizawa\n\nAt first Eiji was interested in Kurumi because he felt identified with her because they had both experienced a broken heart from unrequited love and he thought that he was interested in people who were in love with someone else. After spending time with her, he realized that Ume was similar to his ideal type since his tastes were girls who weren't entirely honest like himself.\n\nAfter hearing Ume reveal how she thinks of herself to be a bad person, he asks if she wants to try dating him. She turns him down, but Eiji persists and convinces her to go on a date with him anyway. Although she has great pride and self-esteem, she has little experience in love and is overwhelmed with how quickly she develops feelings for him. While he admits that he likes her not long after, Ume warns him against liking her, feeling that she's too problematic for a kind person like him. They continue to see each other and enjoy spending time together, but during one visit to Ume's apartment, Eiji accidentally kisses Ume while he is half asleep. He regrets the incident because he had hoped to progress in their relationship slower, and Ume distances herself from him because she believes he mistook her for a past love when he kissed her.\n\nSawako Kuronuma\n\nKeep away\nEiji and Sawako\nSawako and Eiji are cousins, the two are quite close since they used to spend every year together at the Obon and New Year's parties. They seem to understand each other without talking and Sawako seems used to Eiji's teasing, which Ume wonders is the result of their relationship as cousins. After Sawako begins attending university in Sapporo, Eiji saves Sawako and Ume from a stalker they meet during a mixer event. She introduces him to Ume, and seeing how they seem to be getting along well, encourages a romantic relationship between her best friend and her cousin. While having hopes that Ume and Eiji's relationship is proceeding well when she returns home during Golden Week, she is stunned to find Ume shaken and avoiding Eiji when she returns from her vacation home. Sawako volunteers herself as an intermediary until Ume and Eiji reconcile.\n\nSachi Takamura\n\nHis first love, Eiji became interested in Sachi in high school. His great determination regarding something that he considers impossible was in his beginnings what interested him in Sachi. Little by little he fell madly in love with her even though he knew that his feelings would not be reciprocated. After graduation, he decided to study in another prefecture, it is not yet clear if he did it only to distance himself from her.\n\nBy the time he is in his third year of university, Eiji admits to Ume that there was one girl he had a crush on, but she rejected him. Although he recognizes his heart had been broken after the rejection, he doesn't have any romantic feelings toward Sachi anymore. Sachi currently still asks his friends about Eiji, since she considers him a close friend. He has not seen her since finishing high school, but is not adverse to seeing her again and agrees to attend a party with his friends from high school that includes Sachi.\n\nUnaware of the identity of the girl who rejected Eiji, Ume initially assumes the girl is Sachi's friend Akemi. After she and Sawako end up crashing the party with Eiji's high school friends, she learns that it was Sachi who Eiji had liked"

          "content": "==Vida.0==\n\nMeu nome é Hyoudou Issei. Meus pais e colegas da escola me chamam de Ise. Sou um estudante do segundo ano do ensino médio e que está vivenciando o auge de sua juventude.\n\nHavia uma época quando alunos que nunca vi antes costumavam dizer \"Aquele ali não é o Ise?\", o que faz me perguntar como é que eles sabem meu nome.\n\nEu sou surpreendentemente popular, você diz?\n\nNão, não é isso. Na verdade, eu sou famoso por ser tão pervertido que até fui acusado de espiar dentro do vestiário femininino do clube de Kendô.\n\nEu não faria algo tão vergonhoso como espiar no vestiário feminino...\n\nDesculpe, isso é mentira. Eu me encontrava no local, no depósito ao lado do clube de Kendô. Havia um buraco na parede, de onde eu tentava espiar o depósito do clube.\n\nInfelizmente não pude dar uma olhada. Isso porque Matsuda e Motohama não saiam da frente do buraco. Sinceramente, esses caras...\n\nEu estava com uma excitação enorme e não conseguia me acalmar porque aqueles dois idiotas ficavam dizendo \"Aaaaah! Murayama tem uns peitões!\" \"Aaaaah Katase, que pernas\".\n\nÉ claro que eu queria olhar! Mas ouvi uns caras se aproximando do depósito então saí correndo.\n\nPorém, uma coisa tão deliciosa acabou acontecendo com um cara como eu, que passa o dia inteiro só pensando em sacanagem.\n\n— Você não quer sair comigo?\n\nUm convite de uma garota!\n\nEu senti como era bom ser jovem.\n\nPara um cara como eu que não tinha namorada, era como um sonho que virava realidade.\n\nO nome da minha namorada é Amano Yuuma. Ela tem um sedoso cabelo negro e um corpo esguio.\n\nEla era tão atraente que me apaixonei à primeira vista.\n\nVocê não diria sim imediatamente se uma garota linda viesse para você e dissesse \"eu te adoro, Hyoudou-kun! Não quer sair comigo?\"\n\nIsso seria como algo saído de um sonho pra um cara como eu cuja idade é a mesma que o número de anos sem uma namorada.\n\nNão seria nada estranho se alguém perguntasse \"De que joguinho erótico você tirou isso?\", mas isso realmente aconteceu!\n\nUm milagre realmente aconteceu! Eu recebi uma confissão de amor de uma garota linda!\n\nNa verdade eu até suspeitei de uma \"pegadinha\". Eu até mesmo pensei que talvez ela tivesse perdido uma aposta e suas amigas estavam escondidas em algum lugar nos observando.\n\nNão tinha como. Até aquele momento eu sempre achei que eu nunca iria ter sorte com garotas.\n\nMas desde aquele dia, eu era um cara que tinha namorada. Eu senti que o mundo mudou à minha volta. Não sei como explicar, mas o meu coração estava em paz. Eu tinha vontade de gritar pra todo cara que cruzasse o meu caminho: \"Eu venci!\".\n\nCom esta nova confiança, eu comecei a sentir pena dos meus dois amigos, Matsuda e Motohama, que não tinham namorada. \n\nNo primeiro encontro que marcamos depois que começamos a namorar--\n\nEu estava pronto para por em prática o plano que tinha traçado uns tempos atrás.\n\nHehehe, eu escovei os dentes várias vezes desde ontem a noite. Não tinha um lugar que tivesse ficado sem lavar. Eu até comprei calças novas, só para o caso de \"algo\" acontecer.\n\nEu cheguei ao local do encontro com a atitude de um super virgem.\n\nEu cheguei lá três horas antes do horário combinado. Eu cheguei a contar mais de cem garotas de óculos que passaram na minha frente!\n\nEnquanto esperava, até mesmo aceitei um panfleto estranho de uma pessoa de aparência suspeita.\n\nEra um papel aparentando ser algo esotérico, com um círculo mágico desenhado, onde estava escrito \"Seu desejo será realizado!\"\n\n... Eu ia jogar fora, mas resolvi botar no bolso porque não queria perder tempo.\n\nQuando a Yuuma chegou, eu disse isso:\n\n— Não se preocupe, eu acabei de chegar.\n\nBingo! Eu consegui dizer isso. Eu sempre quis dizer isso para uma garota.\n\nNós então nos demos as mãos e começamos a andar lado a lado. Eu estava todo emocionado. Tendo um encontro com a minha linda namorada, andando de mãos dadas!\n\nEu estava tão comovido que quase me derramei em lágrimas. Tenho que me conter. Ainda não é hora para entrar em pânico.\n\nDepois disso, fomos a várias lojas, desfrutando do nosso encontro.\n\nNo almoço, fomos a um restaurante familiar, do jeito que estudantes como nós costumam fazer, e Yuuma-chan se deliciava com seu 'parfait' de chocolate. Eu estava satisfeito só de observá-la comendo.\n\nÉ, eu agora podia entender como os outros adolescentes se sentiam quando eles saiam num encontro. Eu me sentia vivo pela primeira vez na minha vida.\n\nMãe, obrigado por ter me gerado. Pai, eu estava preocupado que nossa família não deixaria descendentes, mas agora você não precisa mais se preocupar com isso.\n\nEnquanto eu imaginava esse tipo de coisa, percebi que já era de tarde. Era a hora do clímax!\n\nTalvez um beijo antes de voltar para casa? Minha cabeça estava nas nuvens só de pensar nisso!\n\nAh, quem sabe nós vamos além disso!\n\nIsso era o que passava pela cabeça de um estudante adolescente lascivo como eu, esse tempo todo.\n\nEstávamos na praça que era mais afastada da cidade. Não havia mais ninguém por perto além de nós dois. Graças a isso minha imaginação estava esquentando.\n\nEu deveria ter lido algum livro que ensinasse a fazer ainda mais safadeza!\n\nYuuma-chan já tinha largado a minha mão e andava na direção do chafariz.\n\n— Hoje foi muito divertido.\n\nYuuma sorria com o chafariz às suas costas.\n\nUuu! Ela é uma gracinha. O sol se pondo por trás dela fazia o cenário perfeito.\n\n— Ei, Ise.\n\n— O que foi, Yuuma?\n\n— Tem uma coisa que eu queria fazer para comemorar nosso primeiro encontro. Você poderia me escutar?\n\nSim. Chegou a hora!\n\nÉ isso. Só pode ser isso!\n\nO meu hálito! Confere! Minha preparação mental! Mmmmmm! Meu coração disparou!\n\n— Cla-claro, o que é que você deseja?\n\nAaaaaah. Meu tom de voz tá estranho. Ela vai saber que eu estou pensando em bobagem.\n\nConsegui chegar até aqui e logo agora fui fazer besteira...\n\nYuuma-chan, porém apenas sorriu para mim. Foi então que ela me disse.\n\n— Você poderia morrer para mim?\n\n.........\n\n... Hã? Como é que é?\n\n—... Hã? Quer dizer... Desculpe você pode repetir? Acho que tem alguma coisa errada com meus ouvidos.\n\nCertamente eu escutei errado.\n\nFoi o que pensei na hora. Só podia ser. Então pedi para ela repetir. Porém...\n\n— Você poderia morrer para mim? \n\nEla repetiu com absoluta clareza. Sorrindo.\n\nAquelas palavras não faziam sentido. No instante em que eu estava para dizer \"Que engraçado, Yuuma\" com um sorriso forçado...\n\nFLAP\n\nAsas negras surgiram de suas costas.\n\nEla começou a bater as asas. As penas negras flutuavam no ar e então vinham pousar aos meus pés.\n\nHã? Certamente Yuuma-chan era linda como um anjo, mas...\n\nAnjo? Não tem como ser verdade.\n\nSerá que isso é algum tipo de fantasia?\n\nMinha linda namorada batia suas asas com o sol se pondo ao fundo. Parecia uma cena fantástica.\n\n[[Image:HSDxD_vol_01_021.jpg|thumb|]]\n\nNão tem como acreditar em algo assim.\n\nSeus olhos que eram tão atraentes até agora tinham se tornados frios e assustadores.\n\n— Foi tão divertido o curto tempo que passamos juntos. É como brincar de namorados com uma criança.\n\nA voz de Yuuma-chan era extremamente fria. Ela falava como um adulto. Seus lábios formavam um sorriso gélido.\n\nBzzzzz.\n\nEra um ruído mais intenso do que o de um aparelho de vídeo-game.\n\nAquela coisa fazia um grande zumbido quando apareceu em suas mãos.\n\nParecia uma lança. Aparentemente aquilo atraia luz, ou coisa parecida... Na verdade era mesmo uma lança.\n\nEntão pude sentir o barulho do vento. Seguiu-se um ruído terrível.\n\nDOM!\n\nQuando pensei ter sentido algo tocando minha barriga, percebi a lança que Yuuma-chan segurava há pouco trespassara meu estômago.\n\nEla arremessara aquilo na minha direção.\n\nMas por quê? Fui tentar tirar a lança de mim, mas ela havia desaparecido.\n\nSó o que restava era um furo enorme na minha barriga e uma grande quantidade de sangue que jorrava de lá. Muito sangue. Muito sangue.\n\nEu estava ficando tonto e a minha visão se turvava. Quando eu dei por mim, eu já estava estendido no chão, minhas pernas tinham cedido.\n\nPude ouvir passos se aproximando.\n\nUma voz suave chegava a mim. Era de Yuuma.\n\n— Sinto muito. Você era um perigo para nós, então decidimos eliminá-lo mais cedo. Se você quer culpar alguém, então odeie o deus que colocou o Instrumento Sagrado <Sacred Gear> dentro de você.\n\nO... o quê... sagrado?\n\nEu não conseguia sequer formular uma simples pergunta, já estava prostrado no chão. Seus passos se distanciavam.\n\nEnquanto isso, minha visão se embaçava. O buraco na minha barriga. Deve ser fatal. Não sinto nenhuma dor.\n\nDei-me conta que minha situação era crítica, pois sentia que estava prestes a perder a consciência.\n\nTalvez fosse mais confortável perder a consciência. Mas se isso acontecer, certamente vou morrer.\n\nSerá que é isso mesmo? Vou mesmo morrer com essa idade?\n\nNão cheguei a viver nem metade da minha vida ainda! Como vou poder rir se morrer porque fui perfurado com uma lança pela minha namorada!\n\nUuu..... Enquanto pensava nessas coisas, eu perdia minha consciência...\n\nSentia como se muitas coisas dentro de mim desapareciam aos poucos...\n\nAh! O que será que vai acontecer na escola amanhã?\n\nSerá que o Matsuda e o Motohama vão ficar chocados? Vão chorar por mim? Ha ha, até parece...\n\nMãe, pai... Ainda não tinha feito nada para agradá-los...\n\nAh, merda... Não vai ser nada engraçado quando eles descobrirem as revistas eróticas que eu escondi pela casa.\n\n... Porque é que eu só estou pensando nesse tipo de coisa, enquanto estou aqui morrendo...?\n\nMinhas mãos... Ainda posso movê-las... Toquei minha barriga e trouxe-a a minha frente. Estava vermelha... Vermelho rubro. Isso tudo é meu sangue. Minha mão inteira estava vermelha. Era o meu próprio sangue.\n\nEntão comecei a relembrá-la.\n\nA que apareceu na minha cabeça era aquela garota.\n\nA ruiva linda. Sempre que eu a via, meu olhar era atraído para seus cabelos carmesim.... Se eu tinha que morrer, gostaria que fosse aos braços de uma garota tão bonita como aquela...\n\nSerá que estou traindo minha namorada Yuuna, pensando assim? Espera aí, Yuuna foi quem me matou...\n\n... Mas se era pra morrer, eu queria morrer depois de apalpar os peitos da Yuuma...\n\nHaha, até prestes a morrer continuo só pensando em safadeza... Mmm meus olhar está ainda mais embaçado... Será que este é o fim...?\n\nPorra tive uma vida de merda...\n\n... Se eu for reencarnar, queria ser um...\n\n— Então foi você quem me chamou?\n\nDe repente apareceu alguém na minha frente, falando comigo.\n\nNão sei quem é, pois minha visão está embaçada.\n\n— parece que você está morrendo. Sua ferida... ora, parece que algo interessante está acontecendo. Então é você... Que interessante.\n\n... O que será que é tão engraçado...\n\n— Se você está morrendo, então vou pegar pra mim. Sua vida quer dizer. Você vai viver por mim.\n\nAntes de perder a consciência, pude ver uma cabeleira ruiva na minha frente.\n\n\n<noinclude>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; padding: 0.2em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n| Voltar para [[High_School_DxD:Volume_1_Ilustrações_da_Novel|Ilustrações da Novel]]\n| Retornar para [[High_School_DxD_~Brazilian_Portuguese~|High School DxD]]\n| Ir para [[High_School_DxD:Volume_1_Vida_1|Vida 1]]\n|-\n|}\n</noinclude>\n"

SE VOCÊ NÃO ACORDAR EU VOU B-BEIJAR VOCÊ……]\n“…… Umm.”\nEsse é um despertador que te acorda com uma voz tsundere1, mas ele não tem a função de acordar o seu dono de seu sono. Esse dono caiu da cama e acabou de ter um pesadelo.\nEsse sou eu.\n........ Esse é o pior jeito de acordar.\nEu tive aquele sonho terrível de novo.\nUltimamente tenho tido o mesmo sonho. O sonho em que eu sou morto pela Yuuma-chan.\nMas já que eu estou vivo, isso tem que ser um sonho.\n“Acorde! Ise!”\nA voz da minha mãe veio da escada. Assim como todas as manhãs.\n“Eu sei! Já estou levantando!”\nDepois de responder desse jeito, me levantei do chão.\nHaa......\nMeu dia começou do avesso de novo. Me sinto tão pra baixo.....\nEu coloquei meu uniforme enquanto suspirava profundamente.\n\n===Parte 2===\n\n—Até logo, Já estou indo.\n\nSaí de casa bocejando.\n\nNo caminho para a escola, eu mal conseguia manter os olhos abertos com toda aquela claridade. Aaaaah... Que saco.\n\nUltimamente não estou conseguindo suportar a claridade do sol. \n\nEla parece penetrar na minha pele, eu não aguento.\n\nDe qualquer maneira, o sol da manhã é insuportável. \n\nComo não consigo mais acordar cedo, recentemente minha mãe tem vindo me acordar toda manhã.\n\nPor outro lado, à noite estou muito mais ligado. Tem algo dentro de mim que aparece e me deixa totalmente aceso. \n\nAgora sou uma pessoa completamente \"da noite\". \n\nÉ estranho. \n\nTem alguma coisa errada. Eu costumava dormir tarde às vezes, mas só por um milagre eu conseguia ficar acordado até uma hora da manhã.\n\nPorém, ultimamente eu vou até as três ou quatro horas da madrugada, fácil. Chego até mesmo a ir dormir quando o sol já está nascendo, e isso agora se tornou minha rotina diária.\n\nNão estou viciado em jogos online nem em programas noturnos de tv.\n\n...O que está acontecendo com o meu corpo?\n\nSerá que o meu cérebro não quer me deixar dormir pra que eu não tenha mais o sonho em que minha namorada me mata?\n\n...Não, eu estou apenas racionalizando, não deve ser isso. O natural seria o corpo sentir a necessidade do sono. \n\nO que eu sinto durante a noite... Acho que não tem nada a ver com o que aconteceu antes.\n\nNão sei como explicar, mas eu sinto o meu corpo energizado, e tenho um palpite que algo misterioso dentro de mim está crescendo do fundo do meu corpo. \n\nEntão saí à noite para testar isso. O ritmo das minhas passadas está mais rápido e o meu coração se enche de prazer quando entro nos lugares mais escuros. \n\nAinda nessa noite, eu dei uma arrancada e, para minha surpresa, alcancei uma velocidade incrível. \n\nSe eu entrasse para o time de corrida da escola, certamente seria o melhor. Minha resistência física também é muito grande. Minha resistência é tanta que eu poderia correr uma maratona como se estivesse fazendo uma simples caminhada.\n\nEu fiquei com excesso de confiança, e quando tentei correr na manhã seguinte, descobri que essa minha resistência tinha sumido, cheguei a achar que o que acontecia a noite não era verdade. Bem, na média seria o esperado para um jovem estudante da minha idade, o problema é a enorme diferença entre o eu-noturno e o eu-diurno.\n\nEu fico estranho à noite.\n\nPode parecer maluquice, mas a sensação que sinto durante as noites é de liberação e o excitamento está me transformando numa pessoa diferente.\n\nArggh... A luz do sol tá me matando... \n\nAo contrário do que acontece à noite, de dia eu fico totalmente fraco. \n\nQuanto mais eu penso sobre isso, mais eu fico convencido que tem alguma coisa errada com meu corpo. \n\nSó posso concluir que eu mudei desde aquele dia em que eu tive o encontro com a Yuuma.\n"

          "content": "==Vida.2: Agora sou um Demônio==\n\n\n===Parte 1===\n\n—Uooooooooo!\n\nÉ meia-noite e eu estou pedalando minha bicicleta a toda velocidade. O motivo disso é simples. Eu estou distribuindo panfletos. Aqueles mesmos que contém um círculo mágico fácil de usar. Quando um humano que possui um forte anseio pega um desses na sua mão e roga por aquilo que deseja, um de nós, demônios, será chamado à sua frente.\n\nEu dou uma olhada no GPS portátil que estou segurando. A tela mostra o mapa da cidade com luzes vermelhas piscando em vários pontos. Eu estou indo em direção a esses lugares.\n\nAssim que eu chego ao local indicado no mapa pela luz piscando, que é a casa de alguém, coloco o panfleto na caixa de correio. A seguir parto em direção ao próximo local indicado. Venho repetindo esse procedimento. Uma vez atrás da outra, sem parar.\n\n—Poooooooorra! Não dá para escapar! Esse é o meu destino! Afinal, eu sou um demônio! Eu continuo pedalando a bicicleta enquanto faço o meu desabafo.\n\nIsso tudo começou naquele dia em que descobri que eu sou um demônio. Foi o dia em que eu soube ser o possuidor de uma 'Sacred Gear', que a Yuuma é um Anjo Caído, e que a Rias é um demônio também.\n\nAliás, minhas asas de demônio desapareceram logo depois de terem aparecido. Afinal de contas, elas seriam um grande empecilho para o meu dia-a-dia. Aparentemente eu poderei usá-las para voar, se conseguir me acostumar a elas. A sensação de ter asas é muito desagradável. Foi um choque para mim ter asas surgindo de minhas costas.\n\n—Se você me aceitar como mestra, sua nova vida pode ser brilhante, sabia?\n\nFoi o que Rias me disse, com uma piscadela, quando eu estava deprimido ao descobrir que eu passara a ser um demônio. Aparentemente, em compensação por ter sido reencarnado como demônio pela Rias, eu deveria viver como servo dela. Foi isso que eu entendi. Todos aqueles que forem reencarnados de humanos para demônios devem obrigatoriamente servir ao demônio que os transformou. Na verdade, essa é uma regra dos demônios. O que? Eu sou servo dela...? Pode não ser tão ruim assim ser o servo de uma beldade, mas ainda assim, não consigo concordar com isso.\n\nMas, sabe, tem uma hierarquia entre os demônios. É algo como uma nobiliarquia, um pariato. Eu também tenho uma posição hierárquica. O lugar onde nasceu e sua árvore genealógica são essenciais para determinar sua posição, mas há casos de demônios que conseguiram subir. Todos os iniciantes começam como novatos.\n\n—Podia para de falar como se fosse um comercial para recrutamento? Tá falando sério? Eu mal posso acreditar.\n\nRias começou a cochichar no meu ouvido quando eu estava reclamando. Seus cabelos ruivos são tão cheirosos. Fiquei paralisado pela sensação. \nSerá que isso também é o tal poder demoníaco?\n\n—Aliás, você pode até começar uma vida nova de muito sucesso com as garotas, sabia?\n\n--?\n\nEssas palavras bateram fundo.\n\n—Como?!\n\nAs palavras saíram da minha boca por instinto, antes que eu tivesse tempo para pensar. Se for assim, tenho que reconhecer que sou um pervertido de corpo e alma. \n\nNão, peraí, isso deve ser o efeito do poder demoníaco que a Senpai lançou sobre mim. Acho que estou ainda mais tenso do que de costume.\n\n—A maioria dos Demônios originais pereceu na guerra que aconteceu há muito tempo atrás. Por causa disso, nós começamos a coletar servos em grande número. Porém, os Demônios não têm hoje a mesma força ou influência que tinham originalmente quando lideraram suas tropas. Justamente por isso nós precisamos continuar aumentando os nossos números. Como os humanos, os demônios também se dividem em gênero, machos e fêmeas, e são capazes de gerarem. Porém o crescimento natural dessa forma é muito lento, os demônios têm uma taxa de fecundidade baixa. Com isso, não conseguiríamos nos opor aos Anjos Caídos. Portanto, nós procuramos os humanos com bom potencial e os transformamos em demônios. Quer dizer, como servos.\n\n—Então eu sou só um servo, mesmo.\n\n—Ah, não faça essa cara. Agora cheguei ao ponto mais importante. Como isso que eu falei só aumenta o número de servos, o de Demônios poderosos continua o mesmo. Para resolver isso, os Demônios decidiram dar uma chance aos demônios reencarnados, os reencarnados de humanos. Foi decidido conceder acesso à hierarquia de nobreza aos reencarnados que mostrarem grande poder. Por isso existem muitos Demônios poderosos entre os humanos. Também existem Demônios que, como eu, vieram viver na sociedade humana. Ise, você pode não ter notado, mas certamente você passa por demônios diariamente nesta cidade.\n\n—Então os demônios sempre estiveram entre nós?!\n\n—Sim. Inclusive existem pessoas que conseguem distinguir quem é demônio instintivamente. Aqueles muito gananciosos ou que querem receber ajuda dos demônios, conseguem nos identificar com mais facilidade. Normalmente nos somos convocados por esses tipos, que fazem uso, então, desses folhetos, com o círculo mágico, que distribuímos. Ise existe até mesmo gente como você, que apesar de conseguir nos distinguir não acreditam na existência de demônios. A maioria, porém, acaba acreditando quando testemunha o uso do nosso poder demoníaco.\n\nO que? Então quer dizer que a razão de eu ter chamado pela Senpai é que eu tenho uma ganância muito forte?\n\nBem, parece que até na sociedade demoníaca existem oportunidades de crescimento. Deve ser difícil, mas isso não é o que importa agora. O importante é que eu também tenho chance!\n\n—Então! Quer dizer que eu também posso entrar pra nobreza, dependendo do meu esforço?\n\n—Claro. Não é impossível. Obviamente você vai precisar se esforçar muito, por bastante tempo para conseguir.\n\n\"Viiiiiva!!\" Eu grito no meio do salão.\n\n—Tá falando sério?! Eu?! Vou conseguir ter o meu próprio harém?! Eu vou poder transar com elas também, não é!?\n\n—Sim, se forem seus servos, não tem problema.\n\nUm raio fulmina o meu corpo. Não acredito. Algo assim realmente é possível? No mundo real, como um simples humano, é extremamente difícil construir seu próprio harém. É impossível arrumar uma horda de garotas se você é uma pessoa normal. Além do mais minha situação é ainda pior, já que eu nem sequer tenho uma namorada. Bem eu tinha uma, mas ela me matou com uma lança. Mas agora é diferente. Agora eu posso...\n—Uaaaaaaaaaaaah!! Ser um demônio é bom demais! Ah moleque! Chegou a minha vez. Já posso jogar fora as revistas eróticas que eu tenho escondido lá em--\n\nEu interrompi minha linha de pensamento e comecei a refletir sobre o que estava a ponto de fazer.\n\n—Não. As revistas eróticas não. Não posso jogar tudo aquilo fora. Aquilo é o meu tesouro. Eu ainda posso usá-las até que a mamãe descubra e jogue fora. Uma coisa não tem a ver com a outra. Nada a ver.\n\n—Huhu. Esse garoto é uma piada. Rias dava risada; ela deve me achar um cara ridículo.\n\n—Ora, ora. É exatamente como você tinha falado Buchou. Eu sinto como se tivesse ganhado um irmãozinho idiota. Até a Himejima ria de mim. haha, acho que ela está falando mal de mim.\n\n—Presta a atenção, Ise. Você então concorda em ser meu servo, não é? Se você mostrar potencial, então eventualmente você vai se destacar. Aí quem sabe você pode até receber entrar na hierarquia dos demônios.\n\n—Sim, Mestre Rias!\n\n—Errado! Você tem que me chamar de 'Buchou'.\n\n—Buchou? Não posso te chamar de Irmãzona? Arrojadamente perguntei.\n\nEu sempre quis ter uma irmã mais velha. Não é como no caso da atração da menina mais nova, mas todos os rapazes também gostariam de poder chamar uma beldade mais velha de 'Irmãzona'.\n\nRias pensou por alguns instantes, mas acenou negativamente com a cabeça.\n\n—Hmm. Isso até que soa bem, mas como estamos na escola, 'Buchou' soa melhor. Afinal de contas, aqui no Clube de Pesquisa Oculta todos me chamam de Buchou.\n\n—Tudo bem! Então, Buchou, me ensine como ser um demônio!\n\nOuvindo essa resposta de mim, a Buchou deu sorriso diabólico. Ela parece ter ficado muito satisfeita.\n\n— Huhuhu, boa resposta, Ise. Certo, vou te transformar em um verdadeiro homem.\n\nA Buchou começa a acariciar meu queixo com seus dedos. Irmãzona! É a minha Irmãzona!\n\nEu vou despertar como demônio a serviço dela. Não é só isso, eu vou subir! Eu sei que consigo.\n\nAfinal de contas, eu não vou poder voltar a ser humano de novo, não é? Então, eu vou seguir em frente! Eu já aceitei a minha situação atual.\n\nPode parecer burrice, mas acho que vai ficar tudo bem. Estou convencido.\n\nNa verdade é como se a meu libido estivesse no máximo! É porque estou muito tenso. Fico feliz de ser um cara capaz de tudo pela sua ambição sexual! \n\nAo invés de ficar pensando sobre o novo mundo no qual eu acabei de entrar, vou apenas deixar a vida me levar.\n\n"

O caminho será longo e difícil para uma carreira excitante e segura.\n\nEstou em minha casa olhando para o teto enquanto reclamo.\n\nPeão....\n\nEsse é a minha função.\n\nUm peão, essa é a função mais baixa.\n\nAssim já tenho que me preparar desde agora....Meu caminho para obter um titulo de nobreza começou e será um longo caminho. O caminho em se converter em um Demônio adequado está cheio de problemas. A proposito, há alguém mais que é o [Bispo] de Buchou. Ela me disse isto no mesmo dia quando me tornei seu servo.\n\n— Meu [Bispo] ele existe. Mas esse [Bispo] não está aqui. O [Bispo] está em um lugar diferente, seguindo uma ordem diferente, trabalhando para mim. Se tiver alguma oportunidade, te apresentarei ao [Bispo].\n\nIsso foi o que ela disse. Que será essa pessoa? Quero estar pronto quando for conhecer essa pessoa. Espero que ela seja uma garota. Sendo assim fui escolhido como [Peão] já que sobrou. Terei muitas dificuldades para superar.\n\nQuando penso sobre isso, eu estava de acordo com isto?\n\nFui assassinado por um Anjo caído devido ao dispositivo do equipamento Kamehameha, a Sacred Gear. Ela também usou meus sentimentos de amor. Depois disso, fui convertido em um Demônio.\n\nFui escolhido por um lindo demônio que me disse que me queria como seu servo e que eu fui enganado que ‚Poderia ter meu próprio harem‛.\n\nTrabalho igual a um condenado todos os dias como servo de Buchou.\n\nEntregando folhetos. E fazendo contratos.\n\nSó que meu poder demoníaco é baixo, assim não posso usar o circulo mágico para se teletransportar pra o lugar do cliente.\n\nAlgo como isto nunca aconteceu antes, é o pior Demônio já visto. Este sou eu.\nFuu. \n\nInalei um pouco de ar. Se pensar bem sobre isso, nunca tive uma característica especial incluindo antes de me tornar um Demônio. \n\nTentei muitas coisas para ser popular com as meninas, mas depois de tudo, não pude ganhar dos rapazes mais populares. \n\nTão pouco tinha nenhum sonho antes de me tornar um Demônio. Bom, talvez foi uma boa coisa me tornar um Demônio porque tenho um sonho agora. \n\nEspera, Se tornar um Demônio é algo bom? \n\nBom, se não tivesse sido salvo pela Buchou então, minha vida estaria acabada, Sendo assim, não poderia disfrutar da minha juventude. \n\nBom, é um pouco... Gratificante, estou rodeado por um monte de lindas garotas e todas são muito amáveis. Bom, para um demônio, isso é. \n\nRias-Buchou é muito linda, e Akeno também é muito linda, quando não está com raiva... Creio. \n\nKoneko tão pouco é um problema quando está normal. \n\nKiba me faz sentir nojo, mas ele conversa comigo de forma normal, tipo um descolado... Ele realmente é um bom tipo. Maldito descolado. \n\nRealmente não pode se julgar uma pessoa por sua aparência. Parece que minha imaginação contra o tipo descolado está mudando. \n\nEntão me recordo da linda e bela garota loira, A irmã Asia. \n\nEla era uma garota muito bela. Se fosse pra ter uma noiva... Ela seria minha outra metade. Espera, eu acabei de passar por um duro amor não correspondido. \n\nMaldição, brincando com meus sentimentos... Yuuma, eu realmente te amei. \n\nMerda. Porque minha vida está sempre sendo controlada por alguém? \n\nTalvez seja assim que a vida funciona. Varias coisas misteriosas passam ao me redor, assim eu tenho o pressentimento que fui arrastado para isto. \nAsia... Irmã huh. Essa pessoa que é o oposto de mim. \n\nProvavelmente nunca voltarei a vê-la. \n\nEssa menina trilha seu próprio caminho. Eu também vou caminhar meu próprio caminho. \n\nSomos só um servo de Demônio e um servo de Deus. \n\nConhecemo-nos casualmente. \n\nProvavelmente não deveríamos nos ver nunca mais. Pode ser que isso nos leve a um destino trágico. \n\nOlha só, estou pensando em algo legal. \n\n— Aaaah, Sim, Sim, sou só um fraco [Peão]. Não há nada bom ao meu redor, será que posso ter meu título de nobreza...? O que você acha... Mestre Satã? Bom, provavelmente é inútil discutir isso com Satã, de qualquer forma. \n\nEstou rindo amargamente de mim mesmo. \n\nVou ter uma meta. Isso. \n\nPrimeiro de tudo, minha meta será usar o círculo mágico para ser teletransportado. \n\nEsse será meu primeiro passo. Sim, isso. Eu estou entusiasmado! \n\nO tempo de chorar está terminado. Já me tornei um Demônio. Isso não pode ser trocado. \n\nSendo assim tenho que viver como um Demônio. E eu farei meu sonho se tornar realidade como um Demônio. \n\nIncluindo se não puder, trabalharei duro até conseguir, essa será minha meta de vida. \n\nSim! O que eu puder fazer! Eu vou fazer!\n\n=== Parte 2 ===\n\nJá é tarde da noite, e eu estou em minha bicicleta dirigindo-se para uma casa em particular.\n\nNão é uma mansão ou departamento, só é uma casa ordinária.\n\nEsta é a minha primeira vez, o que devo fazer? \n\nEsse cliente não está vivendo sozinho, será que eu vou ver sua família? \n\nDepois de tudo, eu, na realidade, tenho que visitar a casa para fazer um contrato. Já me disseram que simples humanos não podem me detectar, Será que isso se aplica a esta situação também? \n\nEstou preocupado, mas quando me dou conta, estava a ponto de tocar a campainha. \n\nA porta de entrada está aberta. \n\n... Realmente, deixando a porta aberta no meio da noite. \n\nBATIDAS DE CORAÇÃO. \n\nDe repente me sinto inquieto. O que é isso? Tenho um mau pressentimento. \n\nMas quando me encontro caminhando dentro da casa. \n\nOlhando desde a entrada. \n\nPercebo que não há luzes no recinto. Há uma escada que leva para o segundo piso, mais não há luzes também. \n\n... Sim, há algo definitivamente errado. Não sinto a presença de nenhum humano. \n\nEstão dormindo? Impossível. Se não, não estaria sentindo essa sensação. \n\nRetiro os meus sapatos na entrada e os levo na minha mão. \n\nEstava caminhando na habitação, mas não havia nenhum barulho. \n\nSou um Demônio, não um ladrão. Estou pensando em uma desculpa. \n\nOlhando dentro da habitação vejo uma porta que está ligeiramente aberta, e brilha devido às velas. \n\n—... Olá. Sou um Demônio da Casa Gremory... Umm, O Cliente está aqui? \n\nPergunto tranquilamente, porém ninguém responde. \n\nNão posso mais evitar, já que entrei na habitação. \n\nÉ uma sala de estar e tem uma televisão, um sofá, uma mesa e etc. Parece uma sala de estar ordinária... \n\nLogo que parei pra respirar. Meus olhos foram fixados na parede. \n\nUma parede. Há um corpo cravado na parede. E para trás. \n\n...Um Humano. É um homem. Que tipo de pessoa vive aqui? Porque isso...? \n\nO cadáver foi cortando viciosamente. Algo que parece com viseiras está saindo das feridas... \n\n—Gough \n\nVomitei tudo o que havia no meu estomago. \n\nNão vomitei ao ver um monstro, mas meu corpo reagiu ao ver um cadáver. \n\nEu não posso mais ver o cadáver. \n\nO cadáver esta cravado na parede com um parafuso, fazendo o formato de uma cruz. \n\nHá grandes e grossos parafusos cravados em ambas as palmas da mão, pé e no torso. \n\nIsto não é normal, nada disso é normal! \n\nNão é possível matar uma pessoa assim com a mente normal! \n\nHá uma poça de sangue no piso feito pelas gotas que estão caindo do cadáver. \n\nHá uma escrita na parede.\n\nO que é isso...? \n\n— Esta escrito ‚ \"Castigo aqueles que fizeram, mas ações!\" Só peguei emprestada a oração de uma pessoa importante. \nDe repente a voz de um jovem homem vem atrás de mim. \n\nQuando me viro, um homem de cabelo branco. Parece ser um estrangeiro e ter a idade de um adolescente. \n\nEstá vestido como um sacerdote. É também um lindo rapaz. Seu verme, que sacerdote tem um sorriso maligno assim. \n\n—Hmmm! Bom, bom, olha só se não é o pequeno Demônio! \n\nEle parece estar realmente feliz. \n\nEntão, algo que a Buchou me disse veio à mente. \n\n— Não se envolva com pessoas da igreja. Especialmente os Exorcistas. Eles são nossos maiores inimigos. Eles pode nos eliminar facilmente porque seu poder está apoiado às crenças de Deus. \n\nUm padre, se eu me relacionar à igreja. Isto é mal... \n\nEle já sabe que eu sou um Demônio, Eu estou em uma situação ruim, outra vez? \n\n— Sou um sacerdote♪ Eu sou a cura♪ Eu corto pessoas que se parecem com demônio, e eu dou risada sobre isso♪Eu corto a cabeça dos que se parece com Demônios, e recebo comida em troca♪. \n\nO padre começou a cantar. \n\nNão entendo. O que está acontecendo? \n\n— Me chamo Freed Zelzan. Pertenço a certa organização de Exorcistas. Ah não é porque eu me apresentei que signifique que aceitei sua presença. Não quero recordar nem do seu nome na minha memoria, então, por favor, sendo assim. Está bem, porque você vai morrer aqui. Assegure-me disso.\n\nPode ser que não duele de principio, mas você logo se sentira tão bem que vai chorar. Agora, vamos abrir uma nova porta- Ze! \n\nNunca tinha visto nada como isso antes, nada do que ele fala faz sentindo. \n\nAssim que é um Exorcista. Estou com problemas agora. \n\nMas tinha algo que eu precisava saber. Engoli minha saliva e perguntei. \n\n— Hey, foi você? Que matou essas pessoas? \n\n— Sim, Sim. Eu que matei. Porque, eram criminosos habituais que invocam Demônios, assim tive que mata-los. \n\n— Que tipo de justificativa é essa?! \n\n—Huh? Está surpreso? Você não vai escapar? Isso é raro? Realmente raro. Me refiro a humanos que fazem pacto com Demônios são lixo. Somente lixo. Não posso entender isso? Não? É assim? Bom, você só é um lixo de Demônio também. \n\nEste cara está louco! E como ele pode conversar normalmente assim! \n\nNão sei nem o que dizer! \n\n— Como é que você pode matar outro humano?! Supondo que você deveria matar só Demônios? \n\n—Haaaaa? Que merda é esta? Um simples Demônio como você está me dando sermão? Hahahaha. Poupe-me disso. Você provavelmente poderia ganhar um premio por ser tão carinhoso. Está bem. Então, me escute cuidadosamente, você é um Demônio de merda. Os Demônios também usam os humanos pra sobreviver. Apoiando a um Demônio pobre que nem você, eles não eram mais humanos. Esse é o fim. Por isso os matei. Ganho minha vida matando Demônios e aqueles que têm contrato com Demônios. Esse é meu trabalho. \n\nI— Tenho certeza que Demônios não iriam tão longe! \n\n—Haa? Do que está falando? Que os Demônios são um lixo. Sabia que você é uma existência de merda? Sabia que isto é comum? Não sabia? É \nserio, deveria recomeçar sua vida desde um bebê. Espera, é inútil dizer isto a um Demônio reencarnado como você. Pois bem. Tenho que te matar!\n\nHahahaha. É assustador, não? É o melhor, não? \n\nO padre sacou sua espada e uma pistola. \n\nBOOOM. \n\nUm som vibra no ar. \n\nSua espada que ele tinha sacado se transformou em algo como um sabre de luz. \n\nO que é isso? Esse sabre se parece com a luz de um Gundam. \n\n— De alguma maneira você me irrita, sendo assim posso te cortar? Isso é bom? Está bem. Agora vou apunhalar seu coração com esse sabre de luz, e vou estourar sua cabeça com minha pistola legal! Cara, realmente vou me apaixonar por você! \n\nRápido! \n\nO sacerdote veio correndo em minha direção!\n\n\n\n<noinclude>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; padding: 0.2em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n| Voltar para [[High_School_DxD:_Volume_1_Vida_2|Vida.2 Agora sou um Demônio.]]\n| Retornar para [[High_School_DxD_~Brazilian_Portuguese~|Página Principal]]\n| Avançar para [[High_School_DxD:_Volume_1_Vida_4|Vida.4 Eu vou salvar minha Amiga!]]\n|-\n|}\n</noinclude>\n"

          "content": "==Vida.4 Vou salvar minha amiga!==\n\n\n===Parte 1===\n\nSLAP!\n\nUm som ecoa na sala do clube. O som vinha de meu rosto.\n\nFui golpeado. Buchou me deu um tapa na bochecha.\n\nEla está com uma expressão séria.\n\n— Quantas vezes eu vou ter que repetir? Não é não. Não posso permitir que você salve aquela irmã.\n\nEu visitei a escola após não ter conseguido salvar Asia e reportei o ocorrido para Buchou.\n\nMesmo após relatar o que aconteceu, me propus a ir àquela Igreja.\n\nObviamente, com o intuito de salvar Asia.\n\nTodavia, Buchou disse que ela não iria se envolver nesse problema.\n\nEu não fui capaz de concordar com a decisão dela, então tentei convencê-la mesmo sabendo que minha atitude era um pouco rude. Foi por isso que ela me deu um tapa.\n\nO primeiro tapa que recebi na vida dói mais do que eu pensava. Especialmente, meu coração dói.\n\nEu tenho traído a confiança de Buchou constantemente, mesmo sabendo que ela tem grandes expectativas sobre mim.\n\nAinda assim, existem coisas as quais não posso deixar de lado.\n\n— Então eu irei por conta própria. Estou preocupado com o tal ritual. Os anjos caídos estão fazendo algo por trás das cortinas. Não há garantias quanto a segurança de Asia.\n\n— Você é realmente estúpido desse jeito? Definitivamente você será morto se ir. Dessa vez não será possível trazê-lo de volta a vida. Você entendeu?\n\nBuchou tenta falar calmamente, mas ela está falando comigo como se estivesse me alertando.\n\n— Suas ações não afetarão somente a mim, elas também afetarão os outros membros! Você é um demônio do grupo Gremory! Você tem que ter consciência disso!\n\n— Então deixe-me sair deste grupo. Eu vou lá por conta própria.\n\n— Eu não posso fazer isso! Por que você não compreende?\n\nAcho que essa é a primeira vez que vejo Buchou ficar tão irritada.\n\nEu tenho causado muitos problemas para Buchou. Mas existem coisas as quais não posso abrir mão.\n\n— Eu me tornei amigo de Asia Argento. Asia é minha importante amiga. Eu não vou abandonar minha amiga!\n\n— ……Isso é uma coisa maravilhosa. Eu acho que é incrível se você conseguir dizer isso cara a cara. Mas isso é diferente do que estamos falando agora. Mas isso é diferente do que estamos falando agora. A relação entre um Demônio e um Anjo Caído não é tão simples quanto você pensa. Os dois lados vem se enfrentando por centenas e milhares de anos. Se você mostrar-lhes um único momento de fraqueza, eles virão nos matar. Eles são o nosso inimigo.\n\n— Não era explodindo o inimigo a maneira Gremory de fazer as coisas?\n\n— …………\n\nNós nos encaramos.\n\nEu não recuei. Olhei diretamente nos olhos dela.\n\n— Originalmente aquela garota foi do lado de Deus. Ela é uma pessoa a qual jamais poderemos conviver. Mesmo que ela tenha sido levada pelos Anjos Caídos, isso não muda o fato de que ela ainda é o inimigo de nós, Demônios.\n\n— A Asia não é nossa inimiga!\n\nEu neguei fortemente. Uma garota doce e gentil como ela não pode ser nosso inimigo!\n\n— Mesma que ela não seja, ela não tem nada a ver conosco. Issei, você tem que esquecê-la.\n\nMesmo que ela diga dessa maneira, não tem como eu esquecê-la!\n\nEntão Akeno aparece e fala no ouvido de Buchou.\n\nO que será isso? Algo aconteceu? Akeno também está com uma cara séria. Mas parece que não é por causa da minha discussão com Buchou.\n\nBuchou, que está escutando Akeno, faz uma cara séria.\n\nExatamente como pensei, definitivamente aconteceu alguma coisa.\n\nBuchou olha para mim, depois olha para os outros membros.\n\n— Tenho uma coisa urgente para resolver agora. Eu e Akeno vamos sair por um tempo.\n\n—!\n\nN-Não!\n\n— B-Buchou! Eu ainda não terminei de falar—\n\nBuchou coloca seu dedo indicador em meus lábios.\n\n— Issei, existem algumas coisas que preciso te contar. A primeira. Você acha que o peão é uma peça fraca, certo? Estou certa?\n\nBalanço a cabeça silenciosamente concordando com a pergunta.\n\n— Isso é um grande mal entendido. O peão tem uma habilidade especial que nenhuma outra peça possui. Essa habilidade é a Promoção.\n\nPromoção? O que é isso?\n\n— Assim como o jogo de xadrez, o peão pode se tornar outras peças ao alcançar a base do oponente. Eles são capazes de se transformar em qualquer peça do jogo, exceto o Rei. Issei, quando você pisar no local que eu reconhecer como \"Base Inimiga\", você será capaz de se transformar em qualquer peça, com exceção do Rei.\n\nAh cara! Então eu posso me promover para a classe do Cavaleiro do Kiba, a Torre da Koneko, e até mesmo na Rainha da Akeno!?\n\n— Como faz pouco tempo desde que você se tornou um Demônio, existem algumas restrições, então provavelmente ainda é impossível para você ser promovido à peça final, a Rainha. Mas, você pode mudar para as outras classes. Se você desejar do fundo de seu coração pela promoção, então você terá mudanças em sua habilidade.\n\nIncrível! Apenas o fato de escutar isto me deu várias informações!\n\nSe eu acrescentar a promoção ao meu Sacred Gear, então pode ser que eu consiga vencer aquele sacerdote!\n\n— Ah, tem mais uma coisa. É sobre o Sacred Gear. Quando você utilizar seu Sacred Gear, lembre-se disso.\n\nBuchou começa a acariciar meu rosto com sua mão.\n\n— -Desejo. O Sacred Gear é dirigido pelo poder do desejo. E isto também determina o poder para isso. Mesmo se tornando um Demônio, sua vontade de desejar não foi perdida. Quanto maior e mais forte for sua vontade de tornar seu desejo real, o Sacred Gear irá responder da mesma maneira à você.\n\n—Desejo.\n\nO poder do desejo irá ativar o Sacred Gear……\n\nEntão, se eu desejar fortemente para isso, <i>isto</i> vai ativar.\n\n— Existe uma última coisa a qual você não deve esquecer, Issei. Até mesmo um Peão pode derrubar um Rei. Isso é básico no xadrez. Essa verdade também se aplica para as peças de xadrez dos demônios. Você pode se tornar mais forte.\n\nApós dizer aquilo, ela se teleporta para algum outro local através de um círculo mágico juntamente com Akeno.\n\nOs únicos restantes são: eu, Kiba e Koneko.\n\nApós respirar profundamente, eu já estava determinado e preparado para ir, estava quase saindo quando ouvi.\n\n— Hyoudou.\n\nKiba me chamou.\n\n— Você está indo?\n\n— Sim, estou. Eu tenho que ir. Afinal Asia é minha amiga. Eu sou aquele que deve salvá-la.\n\n— ……Você será morto. Mesmo se você usar o Sacred Gear, até mesmo se você se promover, você não conseguirá derrotar um grupo de Exorcistas e Anjos Caídos por conta própria.\n\nEra uma resposta óbvia.\n\nEu já sabia disso. Estou muito consciente disso.\n\n— Ainda assim, estou indo. Eu vou libertar a Asia, mesmo que isso custe minha vida.\n\n— Bela determinação, isso é o que eu gostaria de te dizer mas isso ainda é algo imprudente.\n\n— Então o que diabos eu devo fazer!?\n\nEu gritei para ele, mas ele me responde de forma direta.\n\n— Eu também estou indo.\n\n— O-O quuu……?\n\nEu perdi minha palavras ao escutar algo tão inesperado.\n\nÉ claro. Eu acabei de escutar algo que eu não esperava.\n\n— Eu não sei muito sobre Asia, mas você é meu camarada. Mesmo que Buchou tenha dito aquilo, existe uma parte de mim que respeita a sua decisão. E também, pessoalmente, eu não gosto de anjos caídos e sacerdotes. Eu os odeio.\n\n……Esse cara provavelmente também tem algum tipo de passado.\n\nMas para escutar a palavra “camarada” dele……\n\n— Você se lembra do que Buchou disse? \"Quando você pisar no local que eu reconhecer como “Base Inimiga”, você conseguirá se transformar em qualquer peça, exceto o Rei\". Então, será que ela não está nos falando indiretamente: \"Eu reconheço aquela Igreja como o local onde o inimigo de Rias Gremory está\"?\n\nAh.\n\nEu havia finalmente entendido.\n\nEntendi, então foi isso que ela quis dizer.\n\nFoi por isso que ela me deu informações sobre a promoção.\n\n— Buchou aprovou indiretamente a sua ida. É claro, eu acho que ela também quis dizer que eu deveria te apoiar. Buchou deve ter algum tipo de plano. Caso contrário, ela teria parado você e te trancando em algum lugar.\n\nKiba começa a rir.\n\n……Buchou, muito obrigado!\n\nEu testemunhei o quão graciosa Buchou é outra vez, e agradeci à ela do fundo de meu coração.\n\nSe eu voltar em segurança, vou trabalhar mais!\n\nEnquanto estou agradecendo à Buchou que não está aqui, silenciosamente, uma garota de baixa estatura se aproxima de mim.\n\n— ……Eu também estou indo.\n\n— É séri-, Koneko?\n\n— ……Eu me sinto mal por deixar vocês irem sozinhos.\n\nKonekooooooo!  Eu não consigo dizer o que se passa em sua mente pois ela não mostra nenhuma emoção, mas eu sinto como se tivesse testemunhado sua gentileza oculta!\n\n— Estou tocado! No momento, estou profundamente tocado, Koneko!\n\nMe emocionei com as palavras desta garota.\n\n— A-Ahn? Mas eu também estou indo……?\n\nKiba coloca um sorriso meio triste. Eu sei, Kiba. Obrigado.\n\nEu pensei que um cara elegante conturbado era um pouco fofo.\n\nTudo certo! Com isso, é possível! Nós podemos fazer isso!\n\n— Então vamos para uma missão de resgate com os três de nós! Espere por nós, Asia!\n\nAssim, nós três fomos em direção à Igreja.\n\n===Parte 2===\n\nO céu já está escuro, e já é hora dos postes da rua estarem ligados.\n\nNós três, Kiba, Koneko e eu, estamos examinando a Igreja de um lugar que podemos vê-la.\n\nNão tem ninguém entrando ou saindo da Igreja.\n\nMas, conforme nos aproximávamos da Igreja, mais forte era meu mau pressentimento. Estou suando pelo corpo inteiro.\n\nQuando eu pergunto à Kiba, ele diz que, “Por causa dessa presença, é certo de que existe um Anjo Caído aí dentro”.\n\nEntão o chefe inimigo está aí dentro.\n\n— Aqui, olhe este mapa.\n\nKiba espalha a planta da igreja no asfalto.\n\nA planta da igreja. Onde ele conseguiu isso……?\n\n— Bem, isso é algo básico para quando você está indo fazer uma visita ao território inimigo.\n\nO rapaz de boa aparência sorri.\n\nUau, que ajudante veloz. Eu sequer pensei sobre isso e estava pensando em entrar com tudo.\n\nEntão percebi novamente o quão ingênuo eu sou.\n\n— Ao lado do santuário, também existe um dormitório. O santuário me parece suspeito.\n\nKiba aponta para o santuário.\n\n— Então nós podemos ignorar o dormitório?\n\n— Provavelmente. Normalmente, a maioria dos grupos de “Exorcistas Perdidos” fazem algumas modificações no santuário. Eles costumam realizar rituais suspeitos sob o santuário.\n\n— Por que?\n\nIndaguei. Kiba faz um sorriso amargo.\n\n— É o local que eles respeitavam como se fosse um lugar sagrado, ao realizar algo que rejeita a palavra de Deus lá, eles sentem uma certa satisfação por ser um insulto à Deus. Porque eles amavam Deus, porque eles foram rejeitados por Deus, eles realizam propositalmente magias banidas sob o santuário para representar seu ódio.\n\nEles são insanos. Não, até mesmo o Deus que se livra de seus crentes fiéis tem uma certa culpa.\n\nAgora mesmo, eu odeio Deus por causa do incidente com a Asia. É por isso que penso dessa forma.\n\n— O santuário está localizado logo atrás da entrada. Acho que podemos entrar diretamente. O problema é que temos que encontrar a porta para o porão quando entrarmos no santuário, e conseguir derrotar os assassinos que nos aguardam.\n\nAssassinos……\n\nQuando ouvi aquela palavra, comecei a ter um mau pressentimento.\n\nNós olhamos um para o outro em frente à Igreja, enquanto a luz da lua iluminava nossas faces e, então, fizemos um sinal.\n\nEstamos prontos!\n\nAgora nós só temos que entrar!\n\nEspere por mim, Asia!\n\nNós passamos pela entrada e fomos em direção ao santuário.\n\nNo momento, Os Anjos Caídos já devem ter notado nossa presença.\n\nEntão os inimigos sabem que nós entramos em seu território.\n\nNão há volta. A única coisa que nos resta é seguir em frente!\n\nNós abrimos a porta, e pisamos dentro do santuário.\n\nHá um altar e cadeiras longas. Parece um santuário comum. A luz das velas e as lâmpadas internas iluminam o santuário.\n\n……Hm, há algo que não me parece normal.\n\nA estátua com a pessoa na cruz. Ela está com sua cabeça destruída.\n\nQue local assustador.\n\nCLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP\n\nEntão, o som de palmas ecoa pelo santuário. Um cara que parece com um sacerdote sai de trás de uma das pilastras.\n\nAo ver sua face, senti um certo desprezo.\n\n— Encontro! É uma reunião! Isso é tão emocionante!\n\nÉ aquele sacerdote desgraçado de cabelos brancos!\n\nEu acho que seu nome é Freed. É ele. Então, ele é o tal assassino, hum.\n\nCom certeza ele está com aquele sorriso esquisito de sempre.\n\n— Bem, antes eu nunca tinha encontrado o mesmo Demônio duas vezes! Sabe, como sou super forte, eu costumo fazer picadinho dos Demônios na primeira vez que os vejo! Assim que os vejo, eu os corto no mesmo local! Aí eu beijo o cadáver e mando um tchauzinho! Era assim que eu costumava viver! Mas desde que vocês estragaram meu estilo de vida, estou tão perdido! Isso não é bom. Não é legal da parte de vocês ficar interferindo em meu estilo de vida! E é por isso que! Vocês me deixam puto! Espero que vocês morram! Na verdade, morram! Seus demôniozinhos repugnantes!\n\nApós mostrar sua alegria e tristeza, ele está enfurecido agora.\n\nEle pega uma arma e o cabo de uma espada.\n\nBOOOM.\n\nUma lâmina de luz aparece do cabo. Ser cortado por esta espada certamente vai ser um problema. Aquela pistola também pode nos causar problemas.\n\nMas agora é diferente. São 3 contra 1.\n\n— Vocês vieram resgatar a Asia, certo? Hahaha! Os Demôniozinhos têm um grande coração para vir aqui resgatar uma vadiazinha como ela, que curaria até mesmo Demônios! Bem, só pelo fato de ter se envolvido com um Demônio ela merece morrer!”\n\nMorrer? O que ele quis dizer com isso!?\n\n— Ei! Onde está a Asia!?\n\n— Bem, existe uma escada escondida logo abaixo daquele altar. A partir da escada vocês podem ir ao lugar em que o ritual está sendo feito.\n\nAquele cara nos contou o local do porão secreto apontando para o altar.\n\nSerá que ele sabe que ele vai ter que nos parar? Ou ele nos contou o local por estar confiante de que consegue nos matar e isso vai resolver o problema?\n\n— Sacred Gear!\n\nSincronizada com o meu chamado, uma luva vermelha aparece em meu braço esquerdo.\n\nEquipando o Sacred Gear... completo! Ok!\n\nKiba tira sua espada da bainha enquanto Koneko—\n\nAhn!? Estou tão chocado que meu olhos estão quase saindo das órbitas.\n\nVão, Vão, Vão……\n\nKoneko está levantando os bancos que são várias vezes maior que ela.\n\n[[File:HSDxD vol 01 238.jpg|thumbnail]]\n— ……Seja esmagado.\n\nKoneko lança os bancos no Sacerdote! Caramba! Esse é um método de ataque totalmente inesperado!\n\n— Uau! Aí sim!\n\nO sacerdote fez uma pequena dança e cortou a cadeira ao meio com sua espada de luz. A cadeira, já cortada ao meio, cai no chão.\n\n— Uma brecha.\n\nSWIFT.\n\nQuando pensei que Kiba ia avançar, ele já havia desaparecido. Ele é tão rápido que meus olhos não conseguem acompanhá-lo!\n\nGIIN!\n\nAlgumas faíscas surgiram com o choque entre a espada de Kiba e a espada de luz do Sacerdote.\n\nHm, então ela é sólida, mesmo sendo feita de luz. Apesar de tudo, mesmo que Kiba corte diretamente em direção ao sacerdote, eu consigo escutar o som de metais se chocando.\n\n— Hmmm! Hmmm! Que porcaria! Por que vocês são tão barulhentos!? Eu sou muito ruim! Me desculpem por falar na língua da morte! Para falar a verdade, me perdoem depois de suas mortes!\n\nKiba desvia das balas silenciosas com suas pernas que o orgulham, enquanto ele segue atacando seu inimigo.\n\nKiba é incrível, ele está conseguindo desviar de todos os ataques do sacerdote.\n\nMas o sacerdote não é alguém de baixo nível, afinal ele consegue lutar em pé de igualdade com um demônio.\n\nCara, ele parou o corte de Kiba outra vez!\n\nEu não consigo acompanhar os movimentos de Kiba com meus olhos, mas aquele sacerdote consegue.\n\nEntão aquele sacerdote de merda não é um oponente que eu posso tomar conta sozinho.\n\nKiba e o Sacerdote começam a batalhar de frente. Ambos estão se encarando.\n\n— Impressionante. Você é bem forte.\n\n— Hahaha! Você também! Um cavaleiro, não é!? Nem mesmo um ponto cego! Isso é ótimo! Sim, sim, é disso que estou falando. Ultimamente, eu não tive uma batalha incrível como esta! Eu estava prestes a chorar por causa disso! Hmmm! Hmmm! Eu vou te matar!\n\n— Já que é assim, talvez eu deva lutar seriamente também.\n\nKiba vai levar à sério? O que será que ele vai fazer?\n\n— Engole essa.\n\nCom um tom baixo de voz. Eu não consigo acreditar que essa voz veio de Kiba porquê ela carrega uma boa intensidade.\n\nEntão, algumas coisas negras começam a sair da espada de Kiba. Essas coisas começam a cobrir a espada inteira.\n\nEscuridão.\n\nSe eu tiver que descrever aquilo, certamente será assim.\n\nA escuridão cobre a espada.\n\nNão, é como se a escuridão tivesse tomado a forma da espada de Kiba.\n\nA espada da escuridão que está se chocando contra a lâmina da luz do Sacerdote começa a se expandir e a devorar a lâmina de luz.\n\n— Que, Que merda é essa!?\n\nO sacerdote parece confuso.\n\n— —[Holy-Eraser], uma espada de escuridão que devora a luz.\n\n— V-Você também possui um Sacred Gear!?\n\nSacred Gear! Kiba também!?\n\nQuer dizer, a espada da escuridão é incrível!\n\nDroga! Então os caras bonitos recebem armas que também são bonitas!?\n\nA lâmina de luz do sacerdote é completamente devorada pela espada de Kiba e ela não consegue se manter após ter sua luz devorada.\n\nAgora! Essa é minha chance!\n\nEu corri em direção ao sacerdote!\n\n— Sacred Gear! Ativar!\n\n[Boost!!]\n\nUm som sai da jóia e o poder começa a fluir pelo meu corpo.\n\nMeu alvo é o sacerdote de merda.\n\nO sacerdote percebe que estou prestes a avançar.\n\n— Vou continuar te dizendo isso! Como você é irritante!\n\nEla aponta a arma, que está cheia de projéteis de luz, para mim. A bala é disparada sem fazer barulho.\n\nAqui!\n\n— Promoção, [Torre]!\n\nBASHIIN!\n\nA bala de luz não me perfura, na verdade ela é refletida.\n\n— -! Promoção!? Um [Peão]!?\n\nO sacerdote parece estar em choque.\n\nSim, sou um [Peão]! O [Peão] que vai te esmagar!\n\n— As habilidades de uma [Torre]! Defesa infalível e-!\n\nMeu punho esquerdo acerta a cara do sacerdote. Pelo menos, foi o que pensei, mas eu senti algo rígido em meu punho.\n\nMesmo assim, eu soquei com o máximo de força possível!\n\nO Sacerdote é lançado para trás!\n\n— Um ataque sólido como pedra.\n\nEu dou um sorriso enquanto estou ofegante.\n\n— Isso é por bater na Asia daquela vez. Eu me sinto renovado por ter te batido uma vez.\n\nO sacerdote está caído no chão, mas ele se levanta vagarosamente e cospe um pouco de sangue no chão.\n\nSua bochecha direita está inchada.\n\nSó isso? Eu me promovi para uma [Torre], mas parece que eu ainda não tenho o poder de ataque de Koneko.\n\nNão, se eu observar cuidadosamente, a base de sua espada está totalmente esmagada.\n\nSerá que ele a usou como escudo pouco antes de receber meu soco?\n\nEntão essa é a coisa rígida que senti. Certamente ele tem reações rápidas.\n\n— ……Hmm ……Ah cara, já não basta ser socado por um demôniozinho de merda, mas ele ainda tem que dizer algumas porcarias esquisitas……—Não brinque comigo.\n\nO sacerdote faz uma espécie de uivo.\n\n— Não brinque comigo!! Seu merdaaaaaa! Um mero demônio não deveria querer tirar onda em cima de mim! Eu vou te matar! Definitivamente! Eu vou te matar, com certeza! Eu vou te cortar em pedacinhos, seu merdaaaa!\n\nO sacerdote tira uma segunda espada que só possui a base.\n\nEle ainda tem outra!? Quantas espadas ele ainda tem!?\n\nMas nós três, eu, Kiba e Koneko, cercamos o sacerdote.\n\nO sacerdote percebe que o cercamos e olha ao redor. Ele começa a sorrir.\n\n— Wow, wow. É isso que vocês chamam de crise? Hmm, para mim, ser morto por um Demônio é um não-não, então eu sinto como se devesse me retirar. É uma pena que eu não posso exorcizar vocês, mas eu também não quero morrer!\n\nO Sacerdote tira algo redondo e o quebra no chão.\n\nImediatamente, nossos olhos ficam cegos por causa de uma luz intensa.\n\nMerda! Uma cortina de fumaça!?\n\nQuando meus olhos estavam se recuperando, eu olhei ao meu redor mas o Sacerdote havia sumido.\n\nDe repente, a voz do Sacerdote vem de algum lugar.\n\n— Ei. Demôniozinho resmungão……Issei, não é? Para falar a verdade, eu me apaixonei por você. Então, com certeza vou te matar. Definitivamente, ok? Jamais perdoaria um Demôniozinho de merda que me deu um soco e tentou me dar uma aula, ok? Então, tchauzinho.\n\nQuando meus olhos terminaram de se recuperar, eu olhei ao meu redor novamente, mas dessa vez o Sacerdote havia desaparecido completamente sem deixar nenhuma pista.\n\n……Ele escapou.\n\nEle até deixou suas últimas palavras……\n\nEu estava pensando sobre o que ele havia dito e percebi que eu não tinha tempo para perder pensando no que ele havia dito.\n\nKiba, Koneko e eu nos olhamos e concordamos em ir na direção das escadas escondidas do altar.\n\n===Parte 3===\n\nNós três descemos a escadaria debaixo do altar.\n\nParece que até aqui embaixo eles têm eletricidade.\n\nTendo Kiba em nossa frente, seguimos em frente.\n\nApós as escadas, há uma única passagem. As vezes aparecem algumas portas em ambos os lados da parede. Então isso é um porão, hum.\n\nKoneko aponta para o final do corredor dizendo, “Provavelmente estão no final desse corredor…… Eu posso sentir o cheiro daquela pessoa……”.\n\nEntão a Asia está lá. Comecei a me animar cada vez mais.\n\nEspere por mim, Asia. Eu estarei aí logo!\n\nQuando seguimos em frente, uma grande porta aparece.\n\n— É isso aí?\n\n— Possivelmente. Tenho certeza de que existem grupos de Anjos Caídos e Exorcistas aí dentro. Vocês estão prontos?\n\nKoneko e eu respondemos sim para Kiba.\n\n— Ok. Então vamos abrir a porta—\n\nQuando eu e Kiba estávamos prestes a abrir a porta, ela abre por conta própria.\n\nEnquanto a porta fazia um som alto, o local onde o ritual estava sendo feito se torna visível.\n\n— Sejam bem vindos. Demônios.\n\nA Anjo Caído, Raynare, falou do final da sala.\n\nA sala está cheia de sacerdotes renegados. Todos eles possuem o mesmo cabo de espada que gera a lâmina de luz.\n\nEu olhei para a garota que estava presa na cruz e gritei.\n\n— Asiaaa!\n\nAsia percebe a minha voz e olha para mim.\n\n— ……Issei?\n\n— Sim! Eu vim para te salvar!\n\nEu sorri para ela e uma lágrima cai de seus olhos.\n\n— É uma reunião tocante, mas é tarde demais. Estamos prestes a finalizar o ritual.\n\nO ritual está acabando?\n\nO que ela quis dizer—\n\nDe repente, o corpo de Asia começa a brilhar.\n\n— ……Aaah, iyaaaaaaaaaaaa!\n\nAsia grita. Ela aparenta estar sentindo muita dor.\n\n— Asia!\n\nEu tentei alcançá-la, mas os sacerdotes me cercaram.\n\n— Eu não vou deixar vocês interferirem!\n\n— Demônios malditos! Eu vou destruir vocês!\n\n— Saiam da frente! Sacerdotes de merda! Eu não tenho tempo à perder com vocês!\n\nBAN!\n\nOuvi um barulho. Quando olhei, Koneko tinha dado um soco que fez um deles voar.\n\n— ……Por favor não toquem em mim.\n\nKiba também desembainha sua espada da escuridão.\n\n— Parece que vou ter que ir com tudo desde o início. Eu odeio sacerdotes. Se tem tantos assim, eu não hesitarei em devorar sua luz.\n\nOs olhos de Kiba se tornam afiados e eu me arrepio só de olhar para ele.\n\nA escuridão em sua espada está com uma intenção extremamente densa para matar. Esta será uma guerra com tudo o que temos.\n\n— Ahhhhh……\n\nAo mesmo tempo, uma luz ofuscante sai do corpo de Asia.\n\nRaynare a coloca na mão.\n\n— É isso! Este é o poder que procurei por muito tempo! Sacred Gear! Com isto, eu serei amada!\n\nCom uma expressão estasiante, Raynare abraça a luz.\n\nEntão a luz envolve toda a sala do ritual.\n\nQuando a luz fica mais fraca, Raynare está emitindo uma luz esverdeada de seu corpo.\n\n— Ufufu. Ahahahahahaha! Eu finalmente consegui! O poder supremo! Com isto, eu posso me tornar um super Anjo Caído! Com isto eu posso me vingar de todos que me olhavam como se eu fosse inferior!\n\nO Anjo Caído dá uma gargalhada.\n\nEu não prestei atenção nela e me dirigi diretamente à Asia.\n\nOs sacerdotes estão tentando me parar, mas Kiba e Koneko me dão suporte afastando-os.\n\nA espada de Kiba devora a luz da espada dos sacerdotes e Koneko dá um último golpe nos sacerdotes que perderam suas armas. A combinação desses dois é memorável e é óbvio que uma sincronia dessas não é algo que surge com poucos dias de treino.\n\n— Obrigado, vocês dois!\n\nAsia, que está presa à cruz. Aparenta estar sem vida.\n\nNão, ela ainda deveria estar bem!\n\nEu desamarrei as coisas em suas mão e pernas, e segurei-a em meus braços.\n\n— ……I-Issei……\n\n— Asia, eu vim para te levar de volta.\n\n— …………Sim.\n\nSua voz está bem fraca, e ela não soa como se ela estivesse bem.\n\nEi, ei!\n\nEla ainda deve estar bem, certo? Ela não irá……\n\n— É inútil.\n\nRaynare dá um sorriso, como se ela estivesse rejeitando meus pensamentos mais uma vez.\n\n— As pessoas que possuem um Sacred Gear e tem ele retirado de seu corpo vão morrer. Resumindo, está garota irá morrer.\n\n— —!Então devolva o Sacred Gear dela!\n\nEu gritei para ela, mas ela ri.\n\n— Eu não vou devolvê-lo de forma alguma. Você sabia que eu enganei meus superiores para conseguir colocar minhas mãos nisto? Eu vou matar todos vocês e apagar todas as evidências.\n\n— ……Droga. Você não se parece nada com a Yuuma que eu conheci.\n\nAo ouvir o que eu disse, ela começa a dar gargalhadas.\n\n— Hahahaha, foi bem divertido. Aquela vez que fui à um encontro com você.\n\n— ……Você foi minha primeira namorada.\n\n— Sim, ver aquilo foi bem fofo. É divertido enganar caras que não possuem experiência alguma com mulheres.\n\n— ……Eu falei sério quando disse que tomaria conta de você.\n\n— Ahaha, sim, você realmente tomou conta de mim. Quando eu estava com problemas você deu um jeito de tomar conta deles e garantir que eu não me machucasse. Mas você sabia que eu fiz tudo aquilo de propósito? Porque foi divertido ver sua cara quando você estava em pânico.\n\n— ……Eu fiz o máximo para planejar nosso primeiro encontro com cuidado. Para ter certeza de que ele seria um ótimo encontro.\n\n— Ahahaha! Sim! Foi um encontro terrível! Por causa disso, fiquei totalmente entediada!\n\n— ……Yuuma.\n\n— Hahaha, escolhi aquele nome para que eu pudesse te matar ao amanhecer. É maravilhoso, não é? Certo, Issei?\n\nA minha fúria passa dos limítes. Então liberei minha fúria sobre ela:\n\n— Raynareeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!\n\n— Ahahahahaha! Eu não quero que um moleque podre como você fique dizendo o meu nome!\n\nRaynare faz uma careta.\n\nEu estou carregando tanto ódio dentro de mim que minha barriga já deve estar ficando preta.\n\nEu não conheço ninguém que seja tão babaca quanto ela.\n\nEla é, com certeza, aquele que mais se encaixa no título de <i>Demônio</i>.\n\n— Hyoudou! Nossa formação está em desvantagem enquanto estivermos protegendo aquela garota! Então suba com ela logo! Nós vamos abrir caminho para vocês! Agora, corra!\n\nKiba diz isso enquanto está derrubando os sacerdotes.\n\nEle tem razão. Ainda resta um grande número de sacerdotes, então deve haver um límite para que consigamos lutar com este Anjo Caído aqui enquanto protegemos a Asia.\n\nEu olhei para Raynare, e então saí do lugar carregando Asia.\n\n— Koneko, nós vamos abrir passagem para o Hyoudou escapar!\n\n— ……Afirmativo.\n\nAmbos começam a derrubar os sacerdotes que tentam entrar em meu caminho.\n\nGraças ao suporte deles, consegui chegar na entrada da sala do ritual rapidamente.\n\n— Kiba! Koneko!\n\n— Vá em frente! Nós vamos tomar conta daqui!\n\n— ……Por favor, vá rápido.\n\n— Mas!\n\n— Apenas vá!\n\nDroga! Kiba! Koneko! Ambos estão sendo incríveis!\n\nMas agora eu vou ter que contar com eles. Meus Demônios seniors. De maneira alguma eles vão morrer em um lugar como este!\n\n— Kiba! Koneko! Quando eu voltar, me chamem de “Issei”! Definitivamente! Nós somos camaradas!\n\nFoi o que eu disse a eles. Parece que os dois sorriram.\n\nEu saí da sala e fui em direção ao santuário.\n\n===Parte 4===\n\nSubi as escadas enquanto carregava Asia, e saí no santuário.\n\nTem alguma coisa errada com a Asia.\n\nSua face está pálida. Deitei-a em um dos bancos.\n\n— Espere só mais um pouco! Logo, logo você estará livre, Asia! Você vai poder brincar comigo a partir de agora!\n\nAsia dá um pequeno sorriso ao escutar minhas palavras.\n\nEntão ela pega a minha mão. Eu não consegui sentir nenhuma força ou calor de sua mão.\n\n— ……Eu estava feliz porque……eu tive um amigo……mesmo que por pouco tempo……\n\nAsia está sorrindo, mesmo sentindo dor.\n\n— ……Se eu nascesse novamente, você se tornaria meu amigo mais uma vez……?\n\n— O-O que você está dizendo!? Não diga isso! Vamos para algum lugar nos divertir! Eu vou te levar lá mesmo que você não queira! Nós vamos para o karaokê! O fliperama! Também vamos ao boliche! E muitos outros lugares!\n\nEu não consigo parar de lacrimejar.\n\nEu deveria estar sorrindo enquanto falo com ela, mas eu não consigo parar de chorar.\n\nEu sei disso.\n\nEu já sei disso.\n\nEsta garota está morrendo.\n\nEla vai morrer.\n\nMesmo assim, eu quero negar isso.\n\nQuero que isso seja apenas uma piada—\n\n— Nós somos amigos! Para sempre! Sim, é verdade! Eu vou te apresentar ao Motohama e ao Matsuda! Eles são um pouco pervertidos, mas ambos são boas pessoas! Eles definitivamente se tornarão seus amigos! Com certeza! Nós vamos nos divertir juntos! Nós vamos nos divertir até o fim!\n\n— ……Se eu tivesse nascido neste país……e tivesse frequentado a mesma escola que você……\n\n— Vamos lá! Venha para a nossa escola!\n\nA mão de Asia acaricia o meu rosto.\n\n— ……Você chorou até por alguém como eu……agora eu posso……\n\nA mão dela que estava acariciando meu rosto começa a se afastar lentamente.\n\n— ……Obrigada……\n\nEstas foram suas últimas palavras.\n\nEla faleceu sorrindo.\n\nEu perdi minhas forças. Apenas fiquei parado, olhando para sua face.\n\nMinhas lágrimas não param.\n\nPor que? Por que está garota tem que morrer?\n\nEla era uma boa garota. Ela era uma garota gentil que curaria qualquer um que estivesse machucado.\n\nComo ninguém se tornou amigo dela?\n\nComo eu nunca estive ao seu lado?\n\n— Ei, Deus!? Você está aí, não está, Deus!? Demônios e Anjos existem, então você também existe, certo, Deus!? Você estava assistindo, não é!? Você estava observando tudo isso, certo!?\n\nEu gritei para o teto da Igreja.\n\nEu não sei quem vai me responder. Mas eu só queria gritar em direção ao teto.\n\n— Por favor, não leve esta garota! Por favor! Eu lhe imploro! Ela não fez nada! Ela só queria ter um amigo! Eu serei seu amigo para sempre! Então por favor! Eu quero que está garota sorria para sempre! Ei, por favor! Deus!\n\nMesmo tendo gritado em direção ao céu, ninguém me respondeu.\n\n— Isso só aconteceu porquê me tornei um Demônio!? Você abandonou-a porquê sou um demônio e seu amigo!?\n\nMordi meus dentes com arrependimento.\n\nEu não tenho poder. Eu não tenho poder algum. Se eu tivesse mais poder por ser um demônio……\n\nSe eu tivesse o poder para pelo menos salvar a Asia……\n\nMesmo que eu me arrependa agora, ela jamais sorrirá novamente.\n\n— Ora, um Demônio num lugar como este? Você estava desejando alguma coisa?\n\nA voz que escutei por trás de mim era a de Raynare.\n\nQuando me virei, vi um Anjo Caído sorrindo para mim.\n\n— Olhe para isto. Esta é a ferida que recebi do [Cavaleiro] garoto enquanto estava vindo pra cá.\n\nRaynare coloca sua mão sobre a ferida.\n\nA luz verde pálida começa a curar sua ferida.\n\n— Veja. É maravilhoso, não é? Eu posso curar qualquer tipo de ferimento. Para nós, Anjos Caídos, que perderam a proteção de Deus, o Sacred Gear daquela garota foi um presente maravilhoso.\n\nEi.\n\nAquela luz pertence à Asia.\n\nPor que você está usando ela?\n\nSerá que Kiba e Koneko estão em segurança? Comecei a me perguntar.\n\n— Meu status vai crescer a partir do momento em que eu serei um Anjo Caído que pode curar ferimentos de outros Anjos Caídos. Eu posso ser de grande ajuda para o grande Azazel e ao Shemhaza! Não há nada mais maravilhoso que isso! Aaah, Azazel…… Meu poder é todo seu……\n\n— Como se eu ligasse.\n\nEncarei Raynare.\n\n— Eu não ligo para isso. Anjos Caídos, Deus e até mesmo Demônios…… Essas coisas não tinham nada a ver com esta garota.\n\n— Na verdade, tinham sim. Ela era uma humana escolhida que possuía um Sacred Gear.\n\n— ……De qualquer forma, ela poderia ter vivido tranquilamente. Ela poderia ter vivido normalmente!\n\n— Ela não podia. Aqueles que possuem um Sacred Gear irregular estão fadados a ficar de fora do mundo e dos grupos. Porque eles possuem uma habilidade poderosa. Porque eles carregam um poder diferente dos demais. Você sabe que os humanos odeiam essas coisas, certo? Mesmo sendo um poder maravilhoso como este.\n\n— ……Então eu teria protegido a Asia, como seu amigo!\n\n— Ahahahaha! É impossível! Porque ela morreu! Esta garota está morta, você sabe, não é? Não é de importância se você a protegeria ou não. Você não pôde protegê-la! Você não conseguiu protegê-la antes e nem mesmo agora! Você realmente é um garoto esquisito! Isso é tão divertido!\n\n— ………… Eu sei. É por isso que eu não posso te perdoar. E a mim mesmo—\n\nEu não posso perdoar nada.\n\nA mim mesmo por não conseguir protegê-la. Raynare que a matou.\n\nEntão as palavras de Buchou me vem à mente.\n\n——Desejo. O Sacred Gear é controlado pelo poder do desejo. E o desejo também determina o poder dele.\n\n— Me devolva a Asia.\n\n——Apesar você ter se tornado um demônio, sua vontade de desejar não está perdida. Quanto mais forte você desejar, mais forte seu Sacred Gear responderá você.\n\n— Me devolva a Asiaaaaaaaaaaaa!!\n\n[Dragon booster!!]\n\nO Sacred Gear em meu braço esquerdo ativa como se ele tivesse respondido ao meu chamado. A jóia da luva começa a brilhar intensamente.\n\nAlgumas marcas misteriosas aparecem na luva.\n\nAo mesmo tempo, o poder começa a fluir para o meu corpo. Do meu braço esquerdo que está equipado com o Sacred Gear para o resto do meu corpo.\n\nAvancei enquanto meu corpo estava inundado de poder.\n\nEnfiei meu punho na direção ao Anjo Caído que estava sorrindo em minha frente.\n\nRaynare desvia facilmente. Como se ela estivesse dançando.\n\n— Eu vou explicar de uma maneira que até um imbecil como você possa entender. Eu é uma simples diferença de poder. Eu tenho o poder de 1000. Você tem o poder de 1. Você não pode diminuir a distância entre nós não importa o que faça. Mesmo com a habilidade de seu Sacred Gear, o poder dobrado é apenas 2. É inútil! Como você me vencerá!? Ahahahahahahaha!\n\n[Boost!!]\n\nOutro som veio da joia. A marca na joia da luva muda de  [I] para [II].\n\nPULSAÇÃO\n\nUma segunda mudança acontece em meu corpo.\n\nO poder—algo para derrotar o inimigo em minha frente está aumentando.\n\n— Uoooooooooo!\n\nFui pra cima dela enquanto concentrava meu poder em meu punho. Eu já estou promovido numa [Torre].\n\n— Hah! Seu poder aumentou um pouco? Ainda assim, não é o suficiente!\n\nEla desviou de meu ataque novamente.\n\nNo momento,luzes se reúnem na mão de Raynare e tomam a forma de alguma coisa.\n\n— Eu coloquei muito poder nisso! Segure isso!\n\nZUDON!\n\nAs lanças de luz penetram ambas as minhas pernas. Elas penetraram profundamente em minhas coxas. Mesmo com a defesa de uma [Torre], eu não fui capaz de me defender disso.\n\n—Guaaaaaaaaah!\n\nEu gritei.\n\nMeu corpo passa por uma dor intensa, mas eu não posso me ajoelhar por causa de algo assim.\n\nEu seguro as lanças imediatamente.\n\nQUEIMA.\n\n— Guaaaaaaaaaah!\n\nO som de minha carne queimando. É quente! Está queimandooooo! Isso tudo é porquê a lança é feita de luz!? A palma de minha mão que está segurando a lança fica queimada.\n\nHá fumaça saindo de minha mão. Também tem fumaça saindo das feridas em minha coxas. As lanças estão queimando minhas mãos e pernas violentamente.\n\nRaynare começar a rir de mim após ver que eu estou tentando remover as lanças.\n\n— Ahahahaha! Um Demônio tentando puxar a lança é tolice! Para os Demônios, a luz é um veneno intenso. Apenas tocando-a fará você se queimar. Essa é a maior dor que um Demônio pode experimentar! Para um Demônio de classe baixa como você, ela é—\n\n— Nugaaaaaaaah!\n\nEu gritei de uma forma que não poderia descrever com palavras, mas eu tentei retirar as lanças de luz lentamente segurando-as fortemente.\n\nA dor intensa causada pelas lanças que estão que estão em minhas pernas. A dor causada pelo poder da luz. Estas coisas estão me causando tanta dor.\n\nEstou quase perdendo a consciência por causa disso. Eu sinto como se eu fosse morrer se eu não morder meus dentes com força.\n\n— Então, o que acha disso? Qual a sensação!?\n\n— Isso! Aquela garota! Isso não é nada comparado ao que Asia passou!!\n\nEu começo a retirar as lanças vagarosamente enquanto minhas lágrimas e um pouco de saliva escorrem pela minha face.\n\nIsso dói. Isso dói pra caramba!\n\nMas isso! E quanto a isso!\n\nZuryuuzuryuu.\n\nAs lanças estão saindo de minhas pernas enquanto fazem um barulho horrível.\n\nQuando retirei as lanças de minhas pernas, eu larguei-as de minhas mãos e elas desapareceram antes de tocar o chão.\n\nSplash.\n\nApós retirar os objetos que estavam bloqueando os buracos em minhas pernas, o sangue começa a jorrar pelas feridas.\n\nMesmo tendo retirado as lanças, a dor continua.\n\n[Boost!!]\n\nMesmo tendo sido penetrado pela lança e parado meu ataque, a luva em meu braço esquerdo continua a fazer um som.\n\nDói. Dói muito.\n\nEstou chorando pra caramba e ainda por cima tenho muita saliva saindo da minha boca.\n\nSlip.\n\nEu escorreguei e perdi um pouco do poder que estava em mim.\n\nEstou sem forças para ficar de pé. Droga, eu não tenho força em minhas pernas. Não, na verdade eu não tenho força alguma em meu corpo.\n\nSerá que estou numa má condição?\n\n— ……Bem memorável. Um Demônio de Classe-Baixa removendo as lanças de luz feitas por um Anjo Caído. Mas é inútil. Minha luz não é chamativa, mas tem uma alta capacidade para abater Demônios. A densidade da luz é forte. Tão forte que é utilizada como a lâmina de luz dos sacerdotes. Vai ser difícil suportar se você for atingido, mesmo que uma só vez, até mesmo para um Demônio de Classe-Média. Para um Demônio de Classe-Baixa como você, este é o limite. Fufufu, você não pode subestimar o dano causado pelo poder da luz, sabia? Especialmente a minha luz.\n\nComo sempre, ela está fazendo um discurso sobre algo que não compreendo.\n\n— A luz circula pelo seu corpo inteiro e causa dano. Se você demorar para se curar, você vai morrer. Não, na verdade, não seria estranho você morrer com aquele dano. Você realmente é bem resistente, não é?\n\nAh, será que aquilo é verdade? Então para lixos que acabaram de se tornar Demônios, como eu, essas feridas não letais, hmm.\n\nComo pensei. Eu posso sentir dor até mesmo de dentro do meu corpo. Não é a dor causado ao ser atingido é algo pior.\n\nSinto como se meus músculos e ossos estivessem derretendo por causa do calor. A dor é transmitida diretamente pelos meus nervos, então deixar a minha guarda baixa, mesmo que uma só vez vai fazer com que eu perca a consciência.\n\nEu vou acabar morrendo se não receber algum tratamento logo.\n\nMas.\n\nEu não posso ficar parado. Mas eu não tenho força em minhas pernas. Droga.\n\nEsse é o fim para mim?\n\nEntão eu olhei para Asia.\n\nUma garota que está dormindo silenciosamente.\n\nMe desculpe por ser barulhento. Sim, estou bem. É sério, estou bem. Eu sou bem resistente.\n\nEntão não há problemas. Está vendo? Vou aliviar alguns arrependimentos que você deixou, Asia.\n\n— Em momentos como esse, nós devemos rezar para Deus?\n\nDe repente aquilo saiu de minha boca sem que eu tivesse percebido.\n\n— !?\n\nRaynare parece confusa. Mas eu continuei falando.\n\n— Mas Deus não é bom. Ele não me escutou antes, e ele sequer ajudou uma boa garota como a Asia. Hahaha, que Deus inútil.\n\n— Me pergunto o que você está tentando dizer. Você finalmente pirou?\n\n— Então, ele. Maou-sama, você vai escutar o meu pedido? Você existe, certo? Você está me escutando? Eu também sou um Demônio, então você escutará meu pedido?\n\n— ……Ele está perdido. Este garoto está falando consigo num lugar como este.\n\n— Eu vou esmagar este Anjo Caído de merda em minha frente, então por favor, garanta que ninguém interfira. Eu realmente não quero que ninguém interfira. Eu também não preciso de ajuda alguma. Farei isso por conta própria. E minha pernas também estão bem. Vou levantar por conta própria. Então faça com que seja um duelo. É uma boa situação. Estou tão irritado que acho que vou conseguir aguentar essa dor. –Apenas um golpe é o suficiente. ……Por favor, deixe-me acertá-la.\n\nMinhas pernas podem se mover. Eu já perdi a sensação em minhas pernas. Se eu mover elas alguns milímetros sentirei uma dor intensa.\n\nMas elas ainda podem se mover. Me levanto do chão.\n\nMeu corpo não para de tremer. De qualquer forma, me levanto lentamente.\n\nIsso dói. Meu corpo inteiro dói. Mas eu posso me mover. Eu ainda consigo me mover. Eu só tenho que aguentar até que acerte ela uma vez.\n\n— —! I-Impossível! Seu corpo não está em condições de se movimentar! Por causa do dano causado pela luz—\n\nMe aproximo lentamente de Raynare que está chocada.\n\nE me levanto. Bem em frente aos seus olhos. Com meus pés tremendo e um monte de sangue saindo de mim.\n\n— Ei, ex-namorada. Eu passei por muita coisa por sua causa.\n\n— ……Não tem como você estar de pé! Um Demônio de Classe-Baixa não deveria conseguir se levantar com essas feridas! As luzes estão queimando todo o interior de seu corpo!? Um Demônio de Classe-Baixa que não tem o poder demoníaco para cessar os efeitos da luz não deveria ser capaz de aguentar isso!\n\n— Sim, isso dói. Dói demais. Eu estou perto de perder a consciência. Mas você sabe como é, eu te odeio tanto que eu posso suportar isso.\n\nEu encarei meu oponente diretamente sem piscar.\n\nMeu último golpe será minha última esperança. Se eu usá-lo, eu vou cair.\n\nE é por isso que eu tenho que terminar tudo isso com meu último golpe. Eu não consigo parar de olhar para o meu alvo.\n\n— Ei, meu Sacred Gear. Você ainda tem o poder para socar essa coisa que está em minha frente, certo? Então vamos acabar com ela.\n\n[Explosion!!]\n\nO som que veio da jóia agora mesmo soou num tom mais forte.\n\nA jóia brilha com mais intensidade. Que luz brilhante. É deslumbrante.\n\nMas, diferentemente da luz do Anjo Caído, essa luz não me causa dano, na verdade ela me traz paz.\n\nSó por ser tocado por essa luz faz com que eu me sinta como se eu estivesse transbordando em poder. É similar a luz da cura pertencente à Asia.\n\nEntão existem luzes que não machucam os Demônios.\n\nEu dou um passo à frente. O sangue de minha feridas cai no chão.\n\nEu também tossi um pouco de sangue. Parece que estou num estado crítico.\n\nNão há como parar a dor que estou sentindo agora. Ela alcança até mesmo o meu cérebro. Mas está tudo bem. Eu ainda posso me mover.\n\nAté agora, minha luva continua me mandando poder.\n\nQuando eu lutei contra Raynare essa tarde, eu estava com medo da diferença de poder entre nós.\n\nDaquela vez, o meu instinto como Demônio me alertou da diferença massiva entre nossos poderes, por isso meu corpo não parava de tremer. Daquela vez, eu pensei que eu nunca conseguiria vencê-la.\n\nMas dessa vez é diferente.\n\nA quantidade de poder que estou recebendo desta luva é insana.\n\nDe alguma forma eu sei. Possivelmente porquê sou quem possui este Sacred Gear.\n\nEsse poder não vai durar para sempre. Esse poder virá somente uma vez.\n\nSe eu conseguir usar esse poder, mesmo que uma vez, tudo acabará para ela. Mesmo que o Sacred Gear não esteja me dizendo verbalmente, ele está me dizendo isso fisicamente.\n\nEu fiz uma postura para socar. Eu não tenho experiência em luta. Mas ficará tudo bem se eu acertá-la uma vez.\n\nMeu alvo é o Anjo Caído de merda que está em minha frente. Definitivamente eu vou acertá-la. Não vou errá-la de jeito nenhum.\n\n— ……Impossível. O que é isso? Por que algo assim está acontecendo……? Esse Sacred Gear não deveria ser o [Twice Critical] que dobra o poder de seu possessor? ……Não pode ser. Não é possível. Por que o seu poder ultrapassou o meu……? Essa onda de poder demoníaco que estou sentindo...... é igual a de um Demônio de Classe-Méd……não, é igual a de um Demônio de Alta-Classe……\n\nMeu poder é igual ao de um Demônio de Alta-Classe? Isso tudo por causa do meu Sacred Gear?\n\nEi, ei, você não deveria ser um Sacred Gear que simplesmente dobra o meu poder?\n\nBuchou é o único Demônio de Alta-Classe que conheci, então significa que no momento eu tenho mais ou menos a mesma força que ela.\n\n— Impossível! Isso é impossível! Eu sou o Anjo Caído que obteve o poder de cura supremo! Eu me transformei num ser superior ao obter esse [Twilight Healing]! Eu recebi o direito de ser amada pelo Azazel e pelo Shemhaza! Eu jamais perderia para um ser indesejável como você!\n\nRaynare faz outras lanças de luz em suas mãos.\n\nBUUN.\n\nEu desvio-as com meu punho. As lanças de luz desaparecem sem problemas.\n\nAo me ver desviar suas lanças com facilidade, a face de  Raynare fica ainda mais pálida.\n\n— N-Não!\n\nRaynare está batendo suas asas e está prestes a sair voando.\n\nEla está tentando fugir de mim? Ei, ei, você estava me olhando com desprezo, me subestimando e rindo de mim até alguns segundos atrás.\n\nVocê corre assim que percebe que não pode me vencer? Quem você pensa que é?\n\nMas eu não vou deixar você fugir. Como se eu fosse deixar!\n\nTAP\n\nEu avancei ao mesmo tempo em que ela estava começando a voar e segurei seu braço. Eu tenho uma velocidade inacreditável. Uma velocidade que até o Anjo Caído não consegue reagir.\n\nO braço que estou segurando parece estar preso em minha mão e é tão pequeno que parece fraco.\n\nEu a puxei em minha direção. Eu não vou deixá-la sair de maneira alguma.\n\n— Você não vai a lugar nenhum, idiota.\n\n— Eu sou superior—!\n\n— Morra, anjo desgraçado!\n\n— Maldito sejaaaaaaa! Demônio de Classe-Baixaaaaaa!\n\n— Aaaaaaaaah!\n\nA luva liberou toda a sua energia. Toda a força em meu corpo foi para meu braço esquerdo e eu concentrei-a em meu punho.\n\nEu usei aquele punho para socar diretamente a cara do inimigo que eu detesto.\n\nHIT!!\n\nO som ecoa. Meu punho é enterrado na cara dela, e eu enterrei meu punho ainda mais!\n\nRaynare foi lançada pra trás com meu soco.\n\nGASHAAAAAAAAN!!\n\nO Anjo Caído bate na parede fazendo um som alto. A parede quebrou, agora existe um buraco na parede. A poeira começa a se espalhar por toda a parte.\n\nQuando a poeira desaparece, não há nada na direção que soquei Raynare.\n\nO buraco continua até o lado de fora do prédio, onde Raynare se encontra caída no chão.\n\nEla não está se movendo. Eu não consigo dizer se ela está morta mas ela não vai conseguir se mover por algum tempo.\n\nEu finalmente dei o troco.\n\n— Você mereceu.\n\nEstou sorrindo do fundo de meu coração. Esse é meu verdadeiro sentimento. Aquele soco me trouxe uma ótima sensação.\n\nNão durou pouco tempo até que lágrimas começaram a cair de meus olhos.\n\n— ……Asia\n\nEla nunca mais vai sorrir.\n\n===Parte 5===\n\nApós socar o Anjo Caído, eu estava quase caindo porquê usei todo o meu poder……\n\nTon.\n\nAlgo me segura pelo ombro. Quando olhei, era Kiba.\n\n— Bom trabalho. Eu não pensei que você conseguiria vencer um Anjo Caído.\n\nEle está me carregando pelo ombro com um sorriso enquanto tenta me animar. O que, até mesmo Kiba estava indeciso.\n\n— Yo, você está atrasado Casanova.\n\n— Fufufu, Buchou mandou eu não interferir.\n\nBuchou mandou?\n\n— Mandei sim. Eu sabia que você seria seria capaz de vencer Raynare.\n\nQuando me virei para a direção de onde a voz veio, Rias-buchou estava andando na minha direção sorrindo enquanto seu cabelo carmesim balançava.\n\n— Buchou? De onde você veio?\n\n— Do porão. Eu resolvi meus negócios, então eu usei o círculo mágico para vir até aqui. Foi a primeira vez que me transportei para uma igreja, então eu estava nervosa.\n\nBuchou suspira enquanto fala comigo.\n\nEntendi. Então esse é o motivo dela ter aparecido das escadarias com Kiba e os outros.\n\nEntão todos os Exorcistas foram aniquilados. A partir do momento que Buchou se tornou seu oponente, eles não tinham chance de vencer.\n\nEntão Koneko passa por mim. Onde ela está indo?\n\nBuchou fica de pé em minha frente.\n\n— Parece que você venceu de forma segura.\n\n— Buchou…… Hahaha, eu venci, de alguma maneira.\n\n— Fufufu, excelente. Era isso que eu esperava do meu servo.\n\nEla toca em meu nariz.\n\n— Ara ara. A igreja está uma bagunça. Buchou, está tudo bem deixarmos assim?\n\nAkeno está com um rosto conturbado.\n\n— ……Tem algo de errado?\n\nPerguntei para Buchou timidamente.\n\n— As igrejas pertencem a Deus ou as religiões relacionadas a ele, mas existem casos como este onde elas são utilizadas pelos Anjos Caídos. Nesse tipo de caso, se nós, Demônios, danificarmos a igreja, poderemos nos tornar alvos de assassinos que buscam vingança.\n\n—!\n\nIsso é s-sério?\n\n— Mas dessa vez isso não vai acontecer.\n\n— Por que não?\n\n— Originalmente, essa igreja foi abandonada.Assim, um determinado grupo de Anjos Caídos tinha vindo a esse lugar com a finalidade de usá-lo para sua própria ganância, e nós só tivemos uma luta em um lugar como desses. Então nós não adentramos no verdadeiro território inimigo para provocar uma guerra. Basicamente, foi só um pequeno conflito entre um Demônio e um Anjo Caído. Isso acontece o tempo todo. Foi isso o que aconteceu.\n\nEntendi. Então é uma questão de como você vai resumir o ocorrido.\n\n— Buchou. Eu trouxe aquilo.\n\nQuem apareceu enquanto fazia um som de algo arrastando foi Koneko.\n\nEla apareceu do buraco na parede, e o que ela estava arrastando era uma asa negra, o Anjo Caído Raynare.\n\nEntão Koneko está trazendo Raynare, que está inconsciente e foi lançada para bem longe com meu soco.\n\nMas ela disse que ela havia trazido “aquilo”……\n\nPara uma garotinha, ela usa umas palavras bem únicas.\n\n— Obrigada, Koneko. Agora, vamos acordá-la. Akeno.\n\n— Sim.\n\nAkeno levanta a sua mão. Então água aparece no meio do ar.\n\nEsse é o poder de um Demônio?\n\nAkeno joga a água que foi criada no ar em Raynare.\n\nSPLASH!\n\nRaynare tosse após receber um banho.\n\nO Anjo Caído acorda e abre os olhos lentamente. Buchou olha para ela.\n\n— Como vai você, Anjo Caído Raynare.\n\n— ……A filha do clã Gremory……\n\n— Olá, meu nome é Rias Gremory. Eu sou a sucessora da casa Gremory. Vai ser por pouco tempo, mas foi bom ver que você tem algum conhecimento.\n\nBuchou a cumprimenta com um sorriso, mas Raynare olha feio para ela.\n\nEm seguida, ela zomba de Buchou.\n\n— ……Você acha que me pegou, que pena. Esse plano foi feito em segredo dos Anjos Caídos de alta patente, mas existem outros Anjos Caídos que me apoiam. Se eu ficar numa situação perigosa, eles virão—\n\n— Eles não virão te ajudar.\n\nBuchou diz isso de forma clara para negar as palavras de Raynare.\n\n— É porquê eu já eliminei todos os três Anjos Caídos, Kalawana, Donaseek e Mitelt.\n\n— Você está mentindo!\n\nRaynare rejeita o que Buchou disse enquanto se senta corretamente.\n\nBuchou mostra três penas negras.\n\n— Cada uma dessas penas é de um deles. Você pode diferenciá-las já que é um deles, certo?\n\nAo ver aquilo, a expressão de Raynare ficou mais sombria.\n\nAparentemente Buchou está dizendo a verdade.\n\n— Quando eu me encontrei com o Anjo Caído Donaseek que atacou o Issei antes, eu previ que alguns Anjos Caídos estavam armando alguma coisa nesta cidade. Eu ignorei-os porquê pensei que era um plano que envolvia todos os Anjos Caídos. Até mesmo eu não sou idiota o suficiente para me meter em confusão com todos os Anjos Caídos. Então eu ouvi que os Anjos Caídos estavam tramando algo secretamente então fui conversar com eles, levando Akeno comigo. Quando os conheci pessoalmente, eles falaram que o plano era deles. Ao ajudar você, eles disseram, eles receberiam uma promoção para uma patente maior. Pessoas de baixa patente que decidem agir por conta própria geralmente se gabam de seus planos.\n\nBuchou sorri.\n\nRaynare está frustrada, mordendo seus dentes.\n\n— Eles nos subestimaram por sermos apenas duas garotas. Então decidi tirar alguma informação como um presente de despedida. Fufufu, eles eram Anjos Caídos ignorantes que não sabiam que realmente iria morrer. Uma vez que eles estavam dispostos a ajudar em seu plano patético, eles mesmos eram seres de baixa patente.\n\nEntão esse é o motivo. A “coisa” que Buchou precisava resolver era aquilo.\n\nEla derrotou os outros Anjos Caídos……\n\nBuchou também estava preocupada com esse incidente……\n\nSem ter consciência disso, eu disse tantas coisas ruins para ela……\n\nMerda. Estou tão emocional que sinto vontade de chorar.\n\n— Ser atingido por um único golpe não vai deixar nenhum rastro. A princesa do Duque, que tem o poder de destruição. Afinal, Buchou é um Demônio poderoso que é chamado de gênio entre o grupo de jovens Demônios.\n\nKiba faz um comentário para elogiar seu mestre.\n\n— Ela também é conhecida por “Princesa da Ruína de Cabelos Carmesim”, você sabia?\n\nAkeno diz isso enquanto sorri.\n\nP-Princesa da Ruína…… Que apelido assustador……\n\nEntão isso faz de mim parte do grupo da Princesa da Ruína. A-Aterrorizante……\n\nBuchou olha para o meu braço esquerdo. Eu acho que ela está olhando para a minha luva.\n\n— ……Dragão Vermelho. Até pouco tempo não tinha uma merca como essa…… Entendo, então é isso……\n\nSou só eu ou Buchou está fazendo um olhar de quem está chocado?\n\n— Eu descobri o principal motivo que fez com que Issei conseguisse derrotar um Anjo Caído.\n\nBuchou diz isso num baixo tom de voz.\n\n— Anjo Caído Raynare. Este garoto, Hyoudou Issei não possui um Sacred Gear comum. E é por isso que você perdeu.\n\nRaynare aparenta estar confusa após ouvir Buchou.\n\n— —[Boosted Gear], um Sacred Gear que é conhecido como o mais raro entre os raros. A Marca do Dragão Vermelho na luva é a evidência. Até mesmo você já ouviu esse nome antes, certo?\n\nApós ouvir Buchou, Raynare aparenta estar em choque.\n\n— B-Boosted Gear…… Um dos [Longinus] …… Mesmo que por um curto período de tempo, ele permite que o seu dono tenha um poder que ultrapassa até mesmo Satanás ou Deus…… Você está me dizendo que um garoto como ele é o possessor de tamanho poder!?\n\n— Se for como a lenda diz, então a habilidade do [Boosted Gear] pode dobrar o poder de quem o possui a cada 10 segundos. Mesmo que seu poder comece por 1, ele dobra seu poder a cada 10 segundos, podendo alcançar o poder dos Demônios e Anjos Caídos das maiores classes. E, ao dominar esse poder, ele pode até mesmo matar Deus.\n\nVocê está falando sério, Buchou!? Eu posso derrotar Deus!?\n\n…… Então esse é o poder de meu Sacred Gear.\n\nTem a marca do Dragão Vermelho cravada em minha luva.\n\nEntão o motivo dela continuar dizendo “Boost, Boost” era porquê ele estava dobrando o meu poder. Então foi por isso que meu poder não parava de crescer dentro de mim.\n\nEntão o motivo de Raynare estar tão assustada foi porquê eu obtive um poder que ultrapassava o dela sem ter percebido.\n\nQue Sacred Gear poderoso……\n\nEu olhei para o Sacred Gear em meu braço esquerdo assustado.\n\nBoosted Gear. Meu Sacred Gear. Este é um Sacred Gear incrível.\n\nAh, isso significa que eu posso me tornar uma lenda como Demônio?\n\n— Bem, ele pode até ser poderoso, mas ele precisa de tempo, os Sacred Gears que precisam de tempo tem um grande risco. Não é toda hora que ele vai encontrar inimigos que esperam o usuário ficar mais poderoso. Como o oponente estava pegando leve, esse foi o resultado.\n\nUgh. Buchou acerta em cheio.\n\nC-Certamente, não há muitos inimigos que esperariam eu me tornar mais poderoso.\n\nEntão meu Sacred Gear é extremamente poderoso, mas possui muitas fraquezas.\n\nBuchou se aproxima de mim. Eu sinto um bom cheiro vindo de seu cabelo carmesim.\n\nPat-pat.\n\nBuchou começa a acariciar minha cabeça.\n\n— Que interessante. Não esperava nada menos de meu servo. Como pensei, Issei é um garoto interessante. Eu vou te adorar ainda mais.\n\nBuchou sorri para mim.\n\nEu um belo sorriso, mas parece um pouco assustador……\n\n— B-Buchou?\n\n— O que foi?\n\nBuchou está sorrindo. Eu me curvo em direção a ela por me sentir culpado.\n\n— Me desculpe. Quando eu disse que ia salvar a Asia eu fui rude com você e disse algumas coisas ruins para você porquê pensei que você não iria ajudar…… Mas você estava nos ajudando por trás das cortinas e……\n\nEu só queria me desculpar.\n\nEu achava que Buchou era um Demônio com um coração frio. Então eu continuei sendo rude com ela.\n\nEntão eu precisava dizer o quanto estava arrependido. Mas Buchou ainda está acariciando minha cabeça.\n\nEu comecei a chorar sem perceber. Sim, eu não consegui atingir o meu objetivo.\n\n— B-Buchou……eu não pude……proteger Asia……\n\n— Você não precisa chorar. Vendo você agora, não há ninguém que irá te culpar.\n\n— Mas……mas, eu……\n\nBuchou seca minha lágrimas com seus dedos.\n\n— Está tudo bem. Você só não tinha muita experiência como Demônio ainda. Isso é tudo. Se torne forte. Eu vou fazer com que você trabalhe duro de hoje em diante, então esteja preparado. Meu Peão, Issei.\n\n— Sim.\n\nEu vou trabalhar duro. Eu vou definitivamente ficar mais forte.\n\nEu prometo.\n\n— Então agora, terminarei meu último trabalho.\n\nOs olhos de Buchou se tornam afiados e seu olhar parece um pouco cruel.\n\nBuchou se aproxima de Raynare. O Anjo Caído fica assustado.\n\n— Vou fazer com que você desapareça, Anjo Caído.\n\nÉ um tom frio. Inundado com intenção de matar.\n\n— E é claro que, eu vou devolver aquele Sacred Gear.\n\n— V-Você não pode estar falando sério!? Esse poder de cura é para o Azazel e o Shemhaza—\n\n— Viver sua vida por amor é uma coisa bela. Mas você está contaminada com sujeira. Você não tem elegância. E eu não permito isso.\n\nBuchou aponta seu mão em direção à Raynare.\n\nParece que ela vai matá-la em um único golpe.\n\n— Eu, aqui.\n\nEntão, uma sombra aparece por trás da parede quebrada.\n\nO Sacerdote—, Freed Zelzan.\n\nÉ aquele Sacerdote desgraçado! Ele voltou, mesmo tendo fugido antes!\n\n— Wow! Meu superior está em perigo! Então, o que vai acontecer agora!?\n\nRaynare grita com a aparição do Sacerdote:\n\n— Me salve! Se você me salvar, vou te dar uma recompensa ou qualquer coisa que desejar!\n\nFreed faz um sorriso meio sádico.\n\n— Hmm, hmm. Eu recebi uma ordem maravilhosa de uma Anjinha. E? Então eu posso te comer? Para mim, transar com uma Anjinha é como se fose a maior honra e isso vai me dar muito status.\n\n— Ku…… N-Não fique perdendo tempo e me salve!\n\nA expressão do Anjo Caído está repleta de ira. Também parece que ela está com pressa.\n\nNão, ela realmente está com pressa. Ela provavelmente pensa que, “Um mero humano não vai me trair”.\n\n— Ararararara, você sabe que eu estou falando sério…… Quer dizer, algo simples como isso não deve ser nenhum problema, não é, Anjinha? Então é um não? Tem certeza? Então eu vou me retirar. Não importa de que ângulo você olhe, estou em desvantagem, então eu vou sair tranquilamente.\n\nFreed diz isso num tom engraçado enquanto encurva seu corpo.\n\n— V-Você é um Sacerdote, não é!? Você deveria me salvar! Sou o todo poderoso Anjo Caído! Eu—\n\n— Eu não preciso de um superior que perca para Demônios de merda. Você é bem engraçada, mas você não tem planos caso fique encurralada. Você só é útil para uma coisa, masturbação. Então morra logo. Bem, um Anjo Caído que foi abandonado por Deus não irá nem para o céu nem para o inferno, mas ele vai para lugar nenhum. Talvez a experiência de se tornar nada te ajude? Ah, é verdade, isso é impossível. Já que não vai sobrar nada. É impossível. Então namusan<ref>Namusan é uma palavra do Budismo que significa amém.</ref>. Espere, isso é do Budismo. Ah, eu sou um ex-cristão! Eu sou um garoto tão levado!\n\nEu terminar de dizer aquilo, ele olha para o outro lado, como se tivesse perdido o interesse em Raynare.\n\nCom isso, Raynare coloca uma expressão de desespero.\n\nEla está com uma aparência miserável. É este o destino do Anjo Caído que buscava poder e que causou um tumulto?\n\nFreed dá um grande sorriso em minha direção.\n\nAhn? Para mim?\n\n— Isseizinho, Isseizinho. Você tem uma habilidade maravilhosa. Estou ficando interessado em você. Você é tão digno de matar! Você definitivamente faz parte do Top 5 dos “Demônios que desejo matar”, então esteja preparado, ok? Da próxima vez que nos encontrarmos, vamos ter uma luta romântica até a morte, ok?\n\nArrepios.\n\nSenti algo gélido correr por minhas costas.\n\nAquele cara está sorrindo, mas carrega uma intenção extremamente intensa para matar.\n\nUm desafio dirigido à mim. Não, um aviso prévio para me matar.\n\n— Então, até mais tarde! Tchau-Tchau! Lembre-se de escovar os dentes!\n\nFreed desaparece imediatamente do local após acenar para nós.\n\nEle é veloz. Aquele cara simplesmente sumiu.\n\nMas de alguma forma, eu sinto como se eu fosse me encontrar com ele novamente.\n\nNão é uma premonição, é algo mais estranho.\n\n— Agora, Anjo Caído Raynare, que foi abandonada por seu próprio servo. Miserável.\n\nBuchou não tinha a menor simpatia em seu tom de voz.\n\nRaynare começa a se arrepiar.\n\nTalvez o motivo de eu me sentir um pouco mal por ela é porquê ela foi minha ex-namorada “Yuuma”.\n\nBem, aquilo também fazia parte do plano sujo dela.\n\nEntão Raynare olha para mim. Então ela faz um olhar triste para mim.\n\n— Issei! Por favor, me salve!\n\nA voz que ela fez é a de Yuuma, quando ela era minha namorada.\n\n— Este Demônio está tentando me matar! Eu te amo! Eu te amo tanto! E é por isso que eu te peço, vamos derrotar este Demônio juntos!\n\nRaynare age como Yuuma novamente e me implora por ajuda enquanto chora.\n\nEu fui estúpido ao sentir o mínimo de pena de você, Yuuma. Não, Anjo Caído de merda.\n\n— Adeus, meu amor. Buchou, estou no meu limite…… Você poderia fazer o favor……\n\nAo ouvir o que eu disse, a expressão do Anjo Caído congelou.\n\n— ……Não tente flertar com meu lindo servo. Desapareça.\n\nDON!\n\nO poder demoníaco atirado por Buchou não deixou nem pó do Anjo Caído.\n\nA única coisa que restou foi um sentimento estranho que carrego e algumas penas pretas que estão flutuando pela igreja.\n\n===Parte 6===\n\nUma luz verde está flutuando pelo santuário.\n\nÉ o Sacred Gear da Asia.\n\nAo derrotar Raynare, ele foi libertado.\n\nA luz quente brilha para mim. Buchou pega a luz em sua mão.\n\n— Agora, vamos devolver isto para a Asia Argento.\n\n— M-Mas Asia já está……\n\nSim, a Asia não pode mais reviver. No final, eu não pude salvá-la.\n\nEu prometi que ia protegê-la! Eu prometi que iria salvá-la!\n\nMesmo tendo derrotado o Anjo Caído, era inútil vir até aqui se eu não podia salvá-la……\n\nNão, isso seria um insulto aos meus companheiros.\n\nEles lutaram por mim e por Asia. Eles nem sequer se beneficiaram disso.\n\n— ……B-Buchou, todos vocês, obrigado por lutar por mim e pela Asia. M-Mas ainda assim,  mesmo com toda a ajuda de vocês, a Asia está……\n\n[[File:HSDxD vol 01 286.jpg|thumb|“Issei, o que você acha que é isso?”]]\n\nBuchou tira algo de seu bolso.\n\nCarmesim—\n\nTem uma cor vermelha como o sangue e é uma peça de xadrez que tem a mesma cor do cabelo de Buchou.\n\n— Isso é?\n\n— Issei, isso é uma peça de xadrez do [Bispo].\n\n— Ahn?\n\nEu fiz uma voz meio idiota por causa da resposta repentina.\n\n— Estou atrasada por te dizer isso agora mas um Demônio com um título de nobreza recebe um total de 15 peças de xadrez, compostas por 8 [Peões], 2 [Cavaleiros], 2 [Bispos], 2 [Torres], e 1 [Rainha]. Igual a um jogo real de xadrez. Eu já usei um de meus [Bispos], mas eu ainda tenho outro sobrando.\n\nEntão Buchou começa a andar até Asia enquanto carrega consigo a peça de xadrez carmesim.\n\nBuchou coloca a peça de xadrez [Bispo] carmesim no peito da Asia que está morta no momento.\n\n— O dever do [Bispo] é ajudar, dando suporte aos outros membros do grupo. O poder de cura dessa garota pode ser útil como um [Bispo]. Isso nunca aconteceu antes, mas eu vou reencarnar esta garota como um Demônio.\n\nUm poder demoníaco carmesim cerca o corpo de Buchou.\n\n— Eu ordeno, em meu nome, Rias Gremory. Você, Asia Argento. Eu, te trago novamente a este solo como meu servo, e te reencarno como um Demônio. Você, meu [Bispo], deve se deliciar com sua nova vida!\n\nA peça de xadrez carmesim brilha e entra no corpo de Asia. Ao mesmo tempo, o Sacred Gear da Asia volta para dentro de seu corpo.\n\nBuchou para de usar seu poder demoníaco após confirmar que a peça de xadrez e o Sacred Gear entraram no corpo de Asia.\n\nEntão Buchou sorri.\n\nEu só consigo olhar para ela encantado.\n\nDepois de um curto período de tempo, Asia abre os olhos.\n\nAo ver isso, eu não consegui segurar minha lágrimas.\n\n— Ahn?\n\nA voz da Asia.\n\nA voz que pensei que jamais escutaria novamente.\n\nRias-Buchou me dá um sorriso caloroso.\n\n— Eu a trouxe de volta a vida porquê eu queria o poder dela que pode curar até mesmo Demônios. Fufufu, Issei, de agora em diante, você irá protegê-la. Já que você será o Demônio senior dela.\n\nAsia ergue seu tronco. Ela olha ao seu redor e me encontra.\n\n— ……Issei?\n\nEu abracei Asia, que parece estar confusa.\n\n— Vamos para casa, Asia.\n\n<noinclude>\n"

COLOQUE ALGUM ESPíRITO!]\n\n……Eu levantei da minha cama após ter sido acordado pelo alarme de uma garota de voz masculina.\n\nEu configurei o alarme uma hora mais cedo que o habitual.\n\nEu tinha que ir para a sala do clube mesmo que tivesse que coçar meus olhos para fora!\n\nEu deixei o quarto após vestir meu uniforme.\n\n===Parte 2===\n\n—Ara, então você chegou na hora.\n\nQuando cheguei à sala, a Buchou era a única presente.\n\nA escola ainda não começou.\n\nEu vim aqui cedo de manhã por que noite passada fomos avisados para estarmos aqui de manhã.\n\nBuchou está sentando no sofá, bebendo seu chá-verde elegantemente.\n\n—Bom dia, Buchou.\n\n—Sim, Bom dia. Parece que você se acostumou com a manhã.\n\n—Sim, obrigado.\n\nEla então olha para minhas pernas.\n\n— omo está o ferimento do Anjo caído?!\n\nEu tive minha coxa perfurada por uma lança de luz alguns dias atrás.\n\n—Sim, Está completamente curada graças aquele poder de cura.\n\nEu a respondi com um sorriso.\n\n— Isso é verdade? Parece que aquele poder de cura é algo que não pode ser ignorado. Eu posso ver por que um único anjo caído iria desejá-lo, mesmo mantendo em segredo de seus superiores.\n\nEu sentei no sofá diante da Buchou.\n\nHá várias coisas que tenho que perguntá-la.\n\n— Umm Buchou? Se há o mesmo tanto de [Peças Demoníacas] que um jogo de xadrez normal, então é\npossível ter outros sete [Peões] além de mim. Certo? Então haverá um dia que outro [Peão] irá se juntar a nós?\n\nSim, assim como no xadrez real, tinha que ter o mesmo número de [Peões]. Então é possível pegar\noutras peças além de mim. Eu a perguntei pensando que aquilo viria a acontecer um dia.\nMas a Buchou balança sua cabeça para o lado com a minha pergunta.\n\n—Não, meu [Peão] é somente você, Ise.\n\n—! \nEh? Eu deveria estar feliz?\n\nÉ uma confissão? Algo como ‚O Ise é o único que quero!‛ ou alguma coisa do tipo?\n\n—Quando reencarnamos um humano para um Demônio nós usamos as [Peças Demoníacas], mas\ndependendo da habilidade da pessoa mais peças serão usadas.\n\n.....Então não é uma confissão......\n\nEh? Consumo de Peças?\n\n—Há um ditado no mundo dos Demônios assim. [Rainhas] valem nove [peões]. [Torres] valem cinco\n[Peões]. [Cavalos] e [Bispos] valem três [Peões] cada. Assim, há um padrão de valor para cada [Peça Demoníaca] também. Um fenômeno similar ocorre com os reencarnados. Há aqueles que só podem ser reencarnados com dois [Cavalos], e também há aqueles que só podem ser reencarnados com duas peças de [Torre]. Há também compatibilidade com as peças. Você pode usar duas peças separadas para dá-los ordens diferentes então você pensar em como usar as peças. Uma vez usadas, Demônios não recebem [Peças Demoníacas] novas.\n\n—Como isso está relacionado a mim?\n\n—Ise, Eu usei todas as peças de [Peão] em você. Se não tivesse eu não poderia ter ressuscitado você como Demônio.\n\n—Ah?! Sério?\n\n—Então eu tenho o valor de oito [Peões]?\n\n—Quando eu descobri, Eu decidi fazer você definitivamente em meu servo. Mas por um tempo eu não pude achar uma razão. Mas agora estou convencida. O Sacred Gear que é dito ser supremo, Ise, quem possui o [ Boosted Gear] que dito ser um dos supremos, o [Longinus], vale esse tipo de coisa.\nEu olho para meu braço esquerdo.\n\nA luva vermelha. A insana personificação de poder que dobra meu poder a cada dez segundos.\nDependendo de como o usa, é dito que pode até matar Deus.\n\nEsse Sacred Gear é algo muito bom para mim, Mas eu não posso ser ajudado desde que está residindo em mim.\n\n—Quando Eu estava tentando reencarná-lo, as únicas peças que tinham me sobrado eram 1 [Cavalo], 1 [Torre], 1 [Bispo] e 8 [Peões]. Para fazê-lo meu servo, Eu só podia usar todas as peças de [Peão]. E sua compatibilidade com o [Peão] era também boa. As outras peças não tinham o poder para reencarná-lo.\n\nPara começar, O valor de um [Peão] é ainda um mistério. E também sua [Promoção]. Foi por isso que me agarrei com essa possibilidade. E como resultado, você era o melhor.\n\nBuchou sorri feliz.\n\nEla toca minhas bochechas com os dedos.\n\n—Nossa combinação também está ótima desde que é Ruivo e Vermelho.\n\n—Uma princesa carmesim da ruína e [Boosted Gear]. Ise, antes de tudo, almeje se tornar o mais forte\n\n[Peão]. Se é você, você pode definitivamente fazê-lo. Depois de tudo, você é meu adorável servo.\n\n—O mais forte [Peão]\n\nParece-me ótimo.\n\nBuchou traz seu rosto perto enquanto Eu ainda penso sobre isso.\n\nPerto! Você está muito perto, Buchou!\n\nDepois seus lábios encostam-se a minha testa.\n\n— Isso é um ótimo charme. Fique mais forte.\n\nBeijo na testa....\n\nGura.\n\nEu me tornei inquieto pelo o que acabou de acontecer, e meu rosto se mostro vermelho.\n\nUwa. Uwa. Uoooooooooo!\n\nAlgo dispara na minha cabeça! Estou tão feliz que posso até dançar!\n\nOh man! Oh man!\n\nMeu primeiro beijo vindo de uma garota!\n\nNão era um beijo nos lábios ou nas bochechas, mas não havia nada melhor que isso!\n\nEu estou para chorar Poe causa da diversão!\n\nEu! Eu vou me esforçar, Buchou! Eu prometo com esse beijo! Eu definitivamente vou!\n\n— Eu provavelmente deveria parar de adorar você aqui. A nova garota irá ficar com inveja de mim.\n\nInveja?\n\nDo que ela está falando?\n\n—I–Ise-san....... ?\n\nA voz veio de trás de mim. Eu já ouvi essa voz antes.\n\nQuando eu me virei, uma garota loira, Asia, está tentando sorrir.\n\n—A–Asia?\n\nEh? Ela está louca?\n\n—P–Por que?\n\n—Tem que ser......R – Rias-buchou é muito bonita, então até o Ise-san gostaria dela......Não, não. Eu não posso pensar assim! Oh, Deus. Por favor perdoe meu coração pecador .\n\nAsia reza mas ela grita ‚Aii‛ .\n\n—Eu tive uma dor de cabeça.\n\n—É claro. Se um Demônio reza para Deus, é claro que se recebe dano.\n\nBuchou normalmente fala aquilo.\n\n—Uu, isso mesmo. Eu me tornei um Demônio. Eu não posso encarar Deus mais.\n\nAsia parece um pouco atrapalhada. Asia, por favor não paca uma cara triste como essa.\n\n—Você se arrepende?\n\nBuchou pergunta a Asia.\n\nAsia balança sua cabeça.\n\n—Não. Muito obrigada, Não importa em que situação seja eu estou feliz em estar com o Ise-san.\n\n—!\n\nMeu rosto se torna vermelha pela sua resposta embaraçosa.\n\n—I–Isso é algo que me deixa feliz. Para um homem, isso é um elogio e tanto.\n\nEscutando aquilo, Buchou também sorri.\n\n—Entendo, então está ok. A partir de hoje você vai ser minha serva também, e vou fazê-la trabalhar com o Ise.\n\n—Sim! Eu vou dar meu melhor!\n\nAsia responde energeticamente.\n\nEla terá que distribuir panfletos antes, mas Eu me pergunto se ficará tudo bem?\n\nSinto-me desconfortável.\n\nEntão percebo a mudança em Asia. Por que eu nunca percebi até agora?\n\n—Asia, esse uniforme.......\n\nSim, a Asia está vestindo o uniforme escolar da nossa escola. Uniforme de Kuou Academia de garotas.\n\n—M–Me serve......?\n\nEla pergunta timidamente.\n\nÉ claro!\n\nOutro Anjo desceu para nosso colégio! Eu já posso escutar os caras da nossa escola falando sobre isso.\n\nVocê parece ótima nele!\n\n—É o melhor vamos tirar uma foto com só nos dois.\n\n—Eh, S–Sim.\n\nEla estava atrapalhada de como reagir, mas é verdade que ela está fofa no uniforme. Ahhh, minha vida escolar está se tornando gloriosa!\n\n-Eu decidi fazer a Asia freqüentar nossa escola. Desde que, ela tem a mesma idade que você.\n \nEla também está no segundo ano. Eu também fiz ela freqüentar a mesma classe que você. Hoje vai ser o primeiro dia dela, então certeza de cuidar bem dela.\n\nBuchou o fala para mim.\n\nVocê está séria?! Minha classe?! Asia está na minha classe?!\n\n—Vou estar sobre seus cuidados, Ise-san.\n\nAsia curva sua cabeça.\n\nEu já posso a imaginar eu apresentando-a para o Motohama e o Matsuda. Eu não posso parar de rir, imaginando a quantidade de inveja que sentirão.\n\n—Sim, Eu vou apresentá-la aos meus amigos.\n\n—Sim, estou almejando isso.\n\nFufufu, Matsuda e Motohama, parece que estou ficando perto de ser adulto.\n\nAmigos, meus dias como cara inpopular acabaram!\n\nEnquanto imaginava isso, Kiba, Koneko-chan e Akeno-san entram no quarto.\n\n— om dia Buchou, Ise-kun, Asia-san.\n\n—....Bom dia, Buchou, Ise-senpai, Asia-senpai.\n\n—Como estão, Buchou, Ise-kun, Asia-san depois de fazer uma promessa para mim mesmo.\nTodos nos cumprimentam.\n\nTodos me chamaram de ‚Ise‛ e a conhecida Asia como membro.\nIsso é ótimo.\n\nNão há nada melhor que isso.\n\nBuchou se levanta.\n\n— Desde que todo mundo está aqui, Eu deveria começar a festa?\n\nFalando isso, Buchou estrala seus dedos.\nDepois, um grande bolo aparece na mesa. Wow, isso é um Poder-Demôniaco também?\n\n— Talvez seja melhor, as vezes nos reunir para fazer esse tipo de coisas, certo? D–desde que\nconseguimos novos membros, Eu um bolo, então vamos comê-lo juntos.\n\nBuchou fala-o timidamente.\n\nMas bolo caseiro! Eu vou comê-lo com prazer!\n\nBuchou, primeiro de tudo, Eu vou almejar me tornar o mais forte [Peão].\n\nEu vou me esforçar junto com a Buchou, Asia, Kiba, Koneko-chan e Akeno-san.\n\nDepois de fazer uma promessa para mim mesmo, Eu me preparei para fazer um kamehameha para\ntrazer humor da festa.\n\n\n<noinclude>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; padding: 0.2em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n| Voltar para [[High_School_DxD:_Volume_1_Vida_4|Vida.4 Eu vou salvar minha Amiga!]]\n| Retornar para [[High_School_DxD_~Brazilian_Portuguese~|Página Principal]]\n| Avançar para [[High_School_DxD:_Volume_1_Palavras_do_Autor|Palavras do Autor.]]\n|-\n|}\n</noinclude>\n"

          "content": "==Life.0==\nEu sou Hyoudou Issei. As pessoas me chamam de \"Ise\".\n\nEu sou um estudante do segundo ano do ensino médio. Infelizmente, não sou um “estudante normal de ensino médio”.\n\nIsso é porque eu sou um demônio. Não, é sério. Eu fui reencarnado em um Demônio.\n\nBem, isso não é importante agora. Pense em mim como um demônio do ensino médio.\n\nIsso é o que eu sou, mas não sei o que fazer com a situação acontecendo bem na minha frente.\n\nPor alguma razão, estou em um lugar que parece uma capela. Existem rostos familiares ao meu redor.\n\n\"Droga! Para Ise se casar!”\n\n“É algum tipo de erro! Isso é algum tipo de conspiração!”\n\nO careca dirigido Matsuda e o Motohama que usa óculos. Meus dois amigos malvados estão falando comigo com um olhar invejoso.\n\n“Ise! Eu quero que meu primeiro neto seja uma menina!”\n\n“*Soluço*, você cresceu! Você era uma criança sem valor, cujo único orgulho era o desejo de fazer sexo!”\n\nMeus pais estão chorando. Pare de dizer essas coisas!\n\nEu estou vestindo um smoking branco.\n\nÉ como uma cena de casamento. Espere, esta é uma cena de casamento.\n\nAté mesmo uma canção de casamento está sendo tocada dentro da capela.\n\nÉ Meu!? É meu casamento?\n\nFiquei espantado com essa situação súbita e chocante, então, e a minha noiva? Quem é minha noiva?\n\n\"Ise, você não pode olhar em volta tão inquietamente.\"\n\nUma voz familiar vem do meu lado. Quando olho, há uma beleza, Rias Gremory-buchou, ela tem o cabelo vermelho até os quadris bem ali.\n\nFoi ela que me transformou em um Demônio, ela também é um Demônio de Classe Alta e é da nobreza. Eu sou o servo Demônio de Rias-buchou.\n\nMais do que isso, ela parece tão linda em seu vestido de noiva que eu não posso olhar diretamente para ela. *Soluço*, Buchou, você está tão linda!\n\nBuchou, em tais roupas, está de pé ao meu lado! Então isso significa que ela é minha -.\n\n“Rias-sama! Você está tão linda!”\n\n“Aaah, Rias-Oneesama! Por que diabos você está se casando com um cara assim?”\n\nGritos podem ser ouvidos de várias partes da capela. Então ninguém vai me elogiar hein......\nEntendo, então esta é a Rias-buchou e meu casamento!\n\nEu não posso acreditar. A Buchou e eu entramos nesse tipo de relacionamento sem que eu percebesse, e nosso relacionamento progrediu até aqui.\n\nAh, eu realmente não entendo, mas se eu posso casar com a Buchou que eu admiro, então não há nenhum problema!\n\n\"Em todos os momentos, você—\"\n\nO padre Oyaji aparentemente está dizendo os votos de casamento, mas minha cabeça está cheia de outras coisas.\n\nCasamento = marido e mulher. Marido e esposa = família. Família = crianças. Filhos = fazer bebês. Fazer bebês = relações sexuais. Relações sexuais = marido e mulher caso de amor. Caso de amor entre marido e mulher = começa na primeira noite do casamento.…… Primeira noite de casamento ……\n\nA primeira noite do nosso casamento!\n\n[Vem cá, Ise.]\n\nA Buchou está deitada na cama nua na minha imaginação.\n\nIsso significa que eu posso, certo? Quero dizer, somos marido e mulher afinal, então precisamos fazer uma família.\n\nUma criança é uma obrigação quando você começa uma família. E para criar uma criança, precisamos fazer uma determinada coisa. E essa certa coisa é sexo.\n\n…………\n\nEu posso fazer sexo com a Buchou!!\n\nChegando a essa conclusão, minha mente ficou cheia de emoção e eu não fui capaz de parar de imaginar muitas coisas ruins.\n\nEntendo, então a razão pela qual eu não tive sorte com esse tipo de coisa no passado é porque foi para esse dia. Para hoje a noite!\n\nEu vou ser capaz de ir até o final com segurança!?\nN-Não, se é sobre conhecimento, então eu sou um especialista! Eu tenho simulado todos os dias na minha cabeça!\n\nEm outras palavras, sou um piloto ace em batalhas simuladas! Eu sou uma elite que só precisa provar a batalha real!\n\n\"Agora, você pode beijar a noiva.”\n\nO que!?\n\nSim, é isso, agora eu lembro! Esta é a primeira coisa que tenho que fazer!\n\nO beijo em uma capela! Um beijo com a Buchou!\n\nQuando eu olho para o meu lado, a Buchou está de olhos fechados e seu rosto está se aproximando do meu!\n\nEu posso!? Eu posso certo!? Tudo bem! Tudo bem! Os lábios da Buchou são meus!\n\nSeus lábios parecem tão macios. O batom os faz brilhar, minha cabeça parece estar prestes a girar.\n\nE logo, isso vai pertencer a mim! Eu não posso me impedir de ficar animado quando penso nisso!\n\nEnquanto respiro profundamente do meu nariz, eu coloco meus lábios para frente e gradualmente me aproximo da Buchou -.\n\n[Parece que você está se divertindo, pirralho de merda.]\n\n—— !?\n\nUma misteriosa voz ecoa dentro da minha cabeça.\nÉ uma voz baixa com um impacto nela. Não me lembro da voz. Mas de alguma forma eu sinto que a conheço. Uma voz que sempre esteve perto de mim…\n\n[Está certo. Eu estou bem ao seu lado.]\n\n……Quem é?\n\nEu olho em volta e a capela está longe de ser vista agora.\n\nBuchou, que estava ao meu lado, também desapareceu. Todos, incluindo meus pais e amigos, também se foram!\n\nAlém disso, onde estou? Eu estou perdendo todos os meus sentidos. Eu perdi meu senso de equilíbrio e toque.\n\nEu perdi meu senso de visão e audição também.\nEstá tudo escuro na minha frente. Escuridão. Não consigo ouvir nada com meus ouvidos. É silencioso.\n\n……O que é isso?\n\nBuchou! Pai! Mãe! Matsuda! Motohama!\n\nEu grito os nomes daqueles com quem estou próximo dentro do meu coração, mas não há resposta. O que está acontecendo comigo?\n\nDe quem é essa voz?\n\n[É minha.]\n\nUwaa!\n\nO som não saiu da minha boca, mas estou realmente chocado dentro do meu coração.\n\nClaro. Qualquer um ficaria com medo se um monstro gigante aparecesse bem na frente deles.\n\nTem olhos grandes. A cor dos olhos é vermelha, como sangue. Uma mandíbula que chega até os ouvidos, com muitas presas afiadas saindo dela.\nHá um chifre grosso alinhando-se na testa, e as escamas que cobrem o corpo são vermelhas como o magma.\n\nTem braços e pernas grossos como os de uma árvore gigantesca. As garras parecem muito afiadas e aterrorizantes.\n\nMais do que isso, seu par de asas espalhadas faz com que esse monstro gigante pareça ainda maior.\nNa minha frente há um monstro gigantesco ... e de todas as coisas que eu conheço, a coisa que mais se assemelha a isso é um ...\n\n—Dragão.\n\nParece que sabe o que eu estou pensando, mesmo que eu não possa falar, e parece que o monstro, o dragão, que está na minha frente, levanta um pouco a boca.\n\n[É isso aí. Essa dedução está certa. Eu tenho tentado falar com você o tempo todo. Mas, já que você era realmente fraco, minhas palavras não podiam alcançá-lo até agora. Finalmente. Finalmente, posso aparecer diante de você.]\n\n...... O que esse cara está dizendo? Eu não entendo.\n\nAparecer? Ele tem tentado falar comigo o tempo todo? Eu não sei. Eu não sei sobre isso! O que? Ele está tentando me comer?\n\n[Comer? Comer você que parece ter um gosto horrível? Como se eu fosse. Não é isso. Eu só queria me apresentar ao meu aibou com quem lutarei daqui em diante.]\n\nAibou? Espere um segundo. Eu nem sei do que você está falando!\n\nDragão! Quem é Você—.\n\n[Você já percebeu, não é? Você provavelmente pensou sobre isso. Sim, está certo. Eu sou exatamente o que você pensa que sou. Vamos conversar de novo. Sim, aibou.]\n\nQuando eu olho para o meu braço esquerdo, ele está coberto de escamas vermelhas e parece muito anormal porque tem garras afiadas saindo dele.\n<noinclude>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; padding: 0.2em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n| Voltar para [[High_School_DxD:Volume_2_Ilustrações_da_Novel|Ilustrações da Novel]]\n| Retornar para [[High_School_DxD_~Brazilian_Portuguese~|Página Principal]]\n| Avançar para [[High_School_DxD:Volume_2_Vida_1|Vida.1 Estou Trabalhando como um Demônio.]]\n|-\n|}\n</noinclude>\n"

          "content": "==Vida.1 Eu Trabalho como um Demônio==\n\n\n===Parte 1===\n\nAbro meus olhos, e vejo um teto familiar.\n\nAah, então aquilo foi um sonho.\n\nParece que tive tanto o melhor quanto o pior sonho. Ele foi bom no início. Meu casamento com a Presidente, a quem eu admiro. Foi bom até então, mas depois disso……\n\nMeu coração batia rápido. Aconteceria o mesmo com qualquer um que tivesse esse sonho. Eu também estava respirando rapidamente.\n\nMe levantei para limpar o suor da testa com minha mão. Uau. Muito suor. Fiquei surpreso ao ver o quanto eu havia suado.\n\nNo mesmo momento, eu percebi que havia usado o braço esquerdo para limpar meu suor.\n\nA última cena......  o Dragão Vermelho...... Era como uma história de fantasia que eu não podia acreditar.\n\nNo final de meu sonho, meu braço esquerdo se transformou em um \"monstro\", mas não havia nada de errado com ele.\n\nMas eu entendi que havia algo possuído em meu braço.\n\nEu olhei o relógio. Eram 4:30 da manhã..... Ainda estava um pouco cedo\n\nEu respirei fundo, e voltei para cama..... Não..... Está na hora. \n\nMe levantei da cama e me arrumei!\n\nQuando olhei pela janela, lá estava a Presidente Rias Gremory, com seus lindos cabelos vermelhos, vestindo um colete vermelho, me esperando no portão.\n\nEla é veterana e uma ídolo do meu colégio. Ela também é a presidente do clube de ocultismo, do qual faço parte, e sua verdadeira identidade é um demônio.\n\nEla me olhou com seus olhos azuis, após perceber que eu estava olhando para ela.\n\n——Se apresse.\n\nEla moveu os lábios, como se fosse sorrir.\n\n“Eu estou indo!”\n\nColoquei meu uniforme imediatamente, e saí do quarto para fazer meu treinamento matinal.\n\n\n===Parte 2===\n\n\n“Haaaa.....haaaa......haaaa.....”\n\n\"Ei, não corra tão miseravelmente, se não vou adcionar mais 10 voltas na proxima corrida.\"\n\nEstava perdendo o fôlego correndo pela area residencial.\n\nAtrás  de  mim  estava a Presidente, que  estava  em  uma  bicicleta  me  atirando  enquanto  me  corrigia  sem  piedade. Está rigorosa  como  sempre.\n\nA cerca de um mês atrás, eu fui reencarnado como demônio, e servo da Presidente Rias Gremory.\n\nDemônios são seres que são convocados por humanos, para realizar desejos em troca de algo. Eles costumam fazer esses trabalhos diariamente. A Presidente não é uma exceção.\n\nEu tenho trabalhado diariamente como servo da Presidente e caminhado de pouco em pouco ao meu objetivo.\n\nQual é meu objetivo? É óbvio!\n\n“Eu quero me tornar o Rei de um Harém.....Haaaa.......”.\n\nEssas palavras saíram da minha boca enquanto eu estava correndo.\n\n“Está certo, e para isso você precisa começar com treinamento diario básico. Para ficar forte, mesmo se isso levar um tempo.”\n\nSim, Presidente. Eu sei disso.\n\nEu sou um demônio \"recém nascido\", mas se eu fizer realizações e ser promovido, então posso receber um título de nobreza. Se isso acontecer, eu vou poder ter meus próprios servos como a Presidente. É isso aí! Eu vou ter várias garotas demônio como minhas servas, então vou poder fazer meu sonho se tornar realidade!\n\nPara isso, eu preciso ficar forte como a Presidente disse. Força é essencial no mundo dos Demônios. Simplificando, quanto mais forte você for, mais fácil é de ser promovido.\n\nBem, Você pode ser promovido com o conhecimento, habilidades de negociação, e outras habilidades, mas eu ainda não tenho nem uma habilidade dessas.\n\nEu não vou conseguir nada se primeiro não aumentar minha energia. É por isso que faço esse treinamento todos os dias.\n\nMas a Presidente é rigorosa.\n\n\"Um servo meu ser fraco, é uma coisa que não posso perdoar.\"\n\nEntão ela não mostra misericórdia no meu treino matinal.\n\nEla me faz correr aproximadamente 20km, depois me faz fazer 100 voltas. Ela também me obriga a fazer vários treinos musculares, que não quero nem contar quantos faço.\n\nOs Dêmonios desencadeiam seus poderes a noite. Então pensei que seria melhor treinar a noite em vez de manhã, mas aparentemente não é bem assim. De acordo com a Presidente, treinar sob a luz do sol, que nos deixa fracos, nos fortalece mentalmente.\n\nEu tenho sofrido de dores musculares todos os dias, mas não tanto quanto no começo.\n\nRecentemente, eu tenho conseguido fazê-los até que facilmente. É a prova de que estou melhorando a cada dia. Além do mais, eu estou bem em Educação Física. Meu tempo recorde na corrida de curta distancia diminuiu, e não está mais tão cansativo fazer a corrida de longa distancia.\n\n“Haahaa……”\n\nEu parei de correr quando cheguei no parque, que era o objetivo. Eu estava suando pelo meu corpo todo...\n\n“Bom trabalho. Agora vamos para lá.”\n\nO sorriso da Presidente é tão deslumbrante.\n\n\n\n===Parte 3===\n\n\"Sua habilidade tem mais significado quando você tem uma boa base\".\n\n“Sim …… 65 ……”\n\nComecei a fazer flexões no parque depois de completar a maratona matinal e traços.\n\nA Buchou está sentada de costas. A sensação de suas nádegas macias é soberba, mas não tenho tempo para apreciá-la, pois meus braços estão chorando de dor. Não, na verdade, a sensação de suas nádegas é a melhor!\n\nCHICOTE!\n\n\"Auu!\"\n\nEu tive minha bunda golpeada por Buchou ...... Minha voz escorregou da minha boca. Eu não sou masoquista ...\n\n“Você está tendo pensamentos sujos. O movimento dos seus quadris é lascivo.”\n\n“…… I-Isso …… 68 …… P-Pensando que você está andando a cavalo em mim …… 69 …… está fazendo minhas entranhas ficarem como um cavalo na engrenagem máxima …… 70!”\n\n“Conversando enquanto fazia flexões. Você parece ter crescido, Ise. Devo acrescentar mais cem?”\n\nA Buchou disse algo impossível enquanto sorria. Eu vou morrer. Eu estarei em um estado de quase morte a partir desta manhã, se isso acontecer.\n\n[[File:High_school_dxd_000c.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n\"Hmm, deve ser a hora que ela chega aqui ...\"\n\n\"Hã? Quem vem?”\n\nQuando eu perguntei a ela, ouvi uma voz familiar que então disse:\n\n\"Desculpe-me\".\n\nQuando olho para a direção de onde veio a voz enquanto permaneço na postura de flexão——.\n\n“Ise-san, Buchou-san! Me desculpe por ter chegado atrasado …… hauu!”\n\nA menina de cabelos loiros - Asia - tropeça.\n\n\"Ise-san, aqui está seu chá.\"\n\n\"Sim, obrigado.\"\n\nEu estou dando um tempo enquanto tomo o chá que Asia me dá. Após as flexões, eu fiz treinamento muscular para o meu estômago e costas para todo o meu corpo está doendo todo.\n\n\"Asia, por que você está aqui?\"\n\nQuando perguntei, as bochechas da beleza loira ficaram vermelhas.\n\n“Ouvi dizer que o Ise-san e a Buchou-san estão treinando aqui todas as manhãs… então eu também queria ajudar o Ise-san. Embora eu só fosse capaz de preparar o chá hoje.”\n\nAsia …… Você é uma garota tão maravilhosa! Estou profundamente comovido!\n\n“Uuu, Asia! Estou profundamente comovido com sua gentileza, Asia! Aaah, nunca esperei que chegasse um dia em que uma garota dissesse isso para mim! ”\n\nEu tomo meu chá enquanto grito de alegria. A Asia é uma ex-irmã que tem cabelos loiros e olhos verdes. \"Ex\" significa que ela não é mais uma irmã. Agora ela é de um grupo dos Demônios Gremory.\n\nNo mês passado, ela estava envolvida em um incidente em particular que resultou em ela ser morta por um anjo caído. Asia morreu, mas graças ao poder da Buchou, ela reencarnou como um demônio e está aqui conosco agora.\n\nAlém disso, os Anjos Caídos são os anjos maus mencionados na Bíblia e nos romances. Seu traço é suas asas negras, eu acho. Eles são os arqui-inimigos dos demônios e estão sempre lutando com eles. No mês passado, eu também estava envolvido em sua luta. Naquela época, percebi o quão fraco eu estava, então comecei a treinar assim para ficar mais forte. Eu não quero que a Asia passe por essa tristeza novamente.\n\nE nossa mestre, Buchou, parece estar pensando em alguma coisa enquanto bebe chá verde.\n\n“O que há de errado, Buchou?”\n\n“Quando eu perguntei a ela, ela voltou a seus sentidos e tossiu.”\n\n\"Nao é nada. Mais do que isso, é um tempo bom. Eu decidi fazer isso hoje, então vamos para a sua casa agora. ”\n\nHã? Por quê? Minha casa? Tempo Bom? O que vamos fazer na minha casa?”\n\n\"É hora de que a bagagem chegue.\"\n\nEu chegava a saber o que ela queria dizer 10 minutos depois.\n\n===Parte 4===\n\n\"...... I-isto é?\"\n\nMinhas sobrancelhas estão se contorcendo depois de ver as caixas que são colocadas na frente da entrada da minha casa. Quem são esses? Estas caixas nem sequer têm o nome do remetente. Eu tenho um sentimento misterioso sobre isso. Não há bombas dentro deles, certo ...?\n\n“Agora, Ise. Leve isso para o quarto. ”\n\nA Buchou disse isso para mim enquanto eu estava fazendo uma cara confusa.\n\n\"Hã? Carregar? Eu tenho que carregá-los para …… minha casa !? ”\n\n“Sim, esses são os pertences da Asia. Carregá-los é o que um cavalheiro faria, certo?”\n\n\n\"Hum...Estes são os pertences da Asia !?\"\n\nEstou em choque profundo, mas a Buchou diz algo ainda mais chocante.\n\n\"Sim, a partir de hoje, a Asia estará morando em sua casa.\"\n\n\n====Reunião de família====\n\nEntre todos os famosos encontros, conferências e assembléias do mundo, é considerado entre os altos escalões para o local das negociações.\n\nAs palavras dos pais, que detêm a autoridade, são o maior fator para decidir os resultados. A maneira como nós, as crianças, negociamos é a chave para isso. Mas meus pais, que deveriam ter a autoridade, estão de joelhos quando estão na frente da Buchou. Talvez os olhos da Buchou, que têm poder que não pode ser visto com os olhos, estejam fazendo com que eles ajam dessa maneira.\n\n“Okaa-sama, Otou-sama, por causa dessa situação, você permitirá que Asia Argento fique aqui?”\n\nA Buchou deu aos meus pais uma ordem imprudente de maneira elegante e alegre.\n\nOs dois sussurram nos ouvidos um do outro enquanto olham para a Asia.\n\n… Huh, eles também estão olhando para mim. Meu pai tosse uma vez e faz uma pergunta a Asia.\n\n\"Asia ...... -san, foi?\"\n\n\"Sim, Otou-sama do Ise-san.\"\n\nAsia respondeu com um rosto nervoso.\n\n“O-Otou-sama …… Ku …… Eu não sei como colocar isso, mas ter belas garotas estrangeiras me chamam de“ Otou-sama ”repetidamente com certeza toca uma campainha no meu coração …… de um jeito bom”.\n\nParece que meu pai está ficando emotivo. Ser chamado de \"Otou-sama\" por duas garotas bonitas obviamente o fará feliz. Mesmo eu estou confiante de que eu iria me apaixonar se duas lindas garotas me chamavam de “Onii-chan”.\n\n\"Otou-san!\"\n\nMinha mãe cutuca meu pai. Meu pai volta a seus sentidos.\n\n“A-Ahem! Mesmo se você quiser ficar aqui, nosso filho estúpido é uma personificação do desejo sexual. É lamentável, mas não é melhor você ficar em uma casa onde há uma garota? Eu ficaria muito envergonhado se algo acontecesse. ”\n\nEste pai de merda não se segura em seu próprio filho. Uma encarnação do desejo sexual ... Eu me sinto mal porque ele não está tão longe. Mas o que meu pai acabou de dizer é lógico, então seria melhor fazê-la ficar em uma casa onde também há uma garota. Até minha mãe está bem ao lado dele e concordando, dizendo “Sim, está certo”.\n\nSe uma linda garota loira fica comigo que tem tanto desejo sexual, você não sabe o que pode acontecer. Isso se tornaria um problema mundial. Meus pais provavelmente queriam dizer isso.\n\nMas eu não farei nada! Tenho certeza que não é confiável, hein ...... A propósito, não lhes contei que a Asia e eu somos demônios e que a Asia era usada por um anjo caído. Mesmo se eu dissesse a eles, eles não acreditariam em mim, e é melhor para minha mãe e meu pai não se envolverem com os Demônios.\n\nDeixamos de fora muitas coisas enquanto explicávamos a situação e também incluímos algumas coisas que inventamos.\n\nA Buchou não parece ser afetada pela recusa dos meus pais e continua a negociar com um sorriso.\n\n\"Então, e se a Asia se tornar sua filha, então?\"\n\nO-O que você quer dizer com essa palavra profunda …… Buchou ……?\n\n\"O que você quer dizer?\"\n\n“Otou-sama, a Asia acredita muito em Ise. Muito. É o mesmo para mim também. Ise não tem um pouco de inteligência e é muito direto, mas ele não é um tolo. Em vez disso, ele tem uma alma tão ardente que andaria em direção a qualquer obstáculo e tentaria superá-lo. Tanto a Asia quanto eu somos atraídos para essa parte de Ise. Especialmente a Asia. Não é verdade, Asia?”\n\n“Sim! Ise-san me salvou, arriscando sua vida. Ele é meu salvador de vida. Ele também me ajuda muito na escola. Mesmo na aula, ele ...”\n\nEntão Asia começa feliz explicando como eu a ajudo na escola todos os dias enquanto coloco um grande sorriso. Ela até conta coisas menores e exagera demais. Uooooo ……, estou tão envergonhado que quero fugir deste lugar.\n\nMeus pais ficam tipo “Oh, minha nossa!” E “Para ele ser útil aos outros”, e eles parecem não estar insatisfeitos com o que estão ouvindo. Bem, qualquer pai ficaria feliz se o filho estivesse sendo elogiado. Então a Buchou deu o empurrão final.\n\n\"E se ela também for noiva, então?\"\n\n[Noiva!?]\n\nO que é isso!? Papai, mãe e eu grito muito alto. E a Asia como \"?\" E está colocando um olhar confuso. Lágrimas. Então, há muitas lágrimas saindo dos olhos do pai. Ele então fala enquanto enxuga as lágrimas.\n\n“...... Como Ise é assim, eu tinha certeza de que nunca veria netos. Eu estava sempre deprimido por ter que me preocupar com Ise morando sozinho mesmo depois que eu fiquei muito velho… ”\n\nO que …… Otou-sama de repente começou a falar seus pensamentos…… Em vez disso, o que há com esse mapa futuro irresponsável que você criou para seu próprio filho?\n\nMinha mãe está enxugando as lágrimas ao lado dele. Espere, você está chorando também!\n\n“Eu também achava que Ise nunca teria uma noiva. É porque ele é Ise. O filho estúpido. Eu tentei criá-lo para que ele não se tornasse uma vergonha na sociedade, mas tudo isso acabou sendo um desperdício desde que ele saiu dessa maneira. Se eu pudesse voltar ao passado, eu convenceria meu eu mais novo. Dizendo a mim mesmo: \"Tenha cuidado, pois esse seu filho vai se transformar em um filho sem valor que esconde um DVD lascivo dentro de sua caixa de plástico escondida em seu armário\".\n\nUwaaaaaa! Meu local pornô secreto! Mamãe sabe!\n\nMeu pai segura a mão da Asia.\n\n“Asia-san! Ele é um filho sem valor assim, mas posso deixá-lo para você?”\n\n“Você está errado ……, Ise-san não é uma pessoa sem valor. Ele é uma pessoa muito maravilhosa.”\n\nAsia não percebe o que meu pai está chegando e sorri. Minha mãe, que viu isso, quebrou chorando em voz alta. O que é isso? Que drama eu estou assistindo?\n\n“Rias-san! Vamos cuidar da Asia Argento-san nesta casa!”\n\nA Buchou sorri depois de ouvir a aprovação do meu pai.\n\n“Muito obrigado, Otou-sama. Ise Vou deixar o cuidado da Asia com você a partir de agora. Asia, você ficará aqui com Ise. Portanto, certifique-se de não ser indelicado. Se dê bem com os pais de Ise.”\n\n“Está tudo bem? Não vai… ser um fardo… se eu ficar ……? ”\n\n“Para se familiarizar com a cultura e estilo de vida japoneses, é melhor ficar com as pessoas daquele país. Quando eu perguntei a você quem entre os membros do nosso clube você queria viver com mais, você disse Ise sem pensar duas vezes, certo? ”\n\nBuchou respondeu à Asia, que estava confusa.\n\nOh eu vejo, então essa é a razão. A Asia está hospedada na casa de Rias-buchou. Ela está pegando emprestado um dos quartos do antigo prédio da escola que a Buchou, na Asia, e eu vamos.\n\n“Sim. Eu realmente disse isso, mas ...”\n\n“Tudo bem, Asia-san! Acostume-se ao Japão em nossa casa! Você pode ficar aqui definitivamente depois de tudo!”\n\nPapai, você está realmente tentando fazer da Asia minha esposa, hein ...\n\n\"Veja, até Otou-sama está dizendo isso.\"\n\nEmbora Asia estivesse confusa, ela finalmente sorri quando vê Buchou sorrindo.\n\n“Eu entendo, Buchou-san. Havia coisas que eu não entendia muito bem, mas estarei sob seus cuidados, Ise-san, e Otou-sama e Okaa-sama, da Ise-san. ”\n\n...... Você foi enganado perfeitamente, pai, mãe ... Certamente, a coisa sobre minha \"noiva\" é um golpe perfeito para eles ...\n\nAssim, foi decidido que a Asia viverá comigo.\n\n\"...... Noiva, huh.\"\n\nFiquei muito ansioso com a Buchou que estava fazendo uma cara triste naquela época.\n\n\n\n===Parte 5===\n\n\nAlguns dias se passaram desde que a Asia começou a morar na minha casa.\n\n“O tempo está bom hoje. Ise-san, estamos jogando softball para a educação física hoje. É a minha primeira vez, então estou animada.”\n\nA Asia está caminhando alegremente em direção à escola. Eu estou andando ao lado dela.\n\nEu nunca pensei que chegaria um dia em que eu seria capaz de andar para a escola todos os dias com uma beleza.\n\nOs estudantes que vão para a mesma escola que nós estão olhando para nós com olhos intensos.\n\n\"Por que Asia-san está andando na mesma direção que Hyoudou ......\"\n\n“Impossível …… o que está acontecendo ……?”\n\n\"Deve ser algum tipo de erro, não apenas Rias-Oneesama, mas também a Asia-san ......\"\n\nAssim, eu posso ouvir as palavras gritadas de outros estudantes. Bem, isso é natural. Esta situação parece impossível para quem me conhece. Eu, que era apenas um estudante pervertido e impopular, de repente estou me dando bem com os ídolos da escola. Eu também estou andando para a escola todos os dias com o novo aluno loiro de quem todos falam desde que chegaram. Do ponto de vista de outras pessoas, esta é uma situação inacreditável.\n\nHavia alguns estudantes que confessaram a Asia porque eram como “Se Hyoudou pode, eu também posso!”, Mas eles foram rejeitados imediatamente.\n\nPor causa disso, há aqueles que guardam rancor contra mim. Mesmo agora, há pessoas olhando para mim com olhos cheios de ódio. Outros caras devem pensar que estou brincando com o corpo da beleza. Não é tão simples quanto eles pensam, mas tudo bem. Fufu Isso é divertido à sua maneira. Mesmo que seja um mal entendido, eles acham que sou popular com garotas. Oh sim! É isso aí! Apenas fique com ciúmes de mim, garotos!\n\nEu ainda vou subir mais alto! Fuhahahaha!\n\n\"Havia algo que parece engraçado?\"\n\nOh. Asia olha para o meu rosto com um olhar preocupado. Quando o rosto de uma beleza está bem na minha frente, me faz corar ... Parece que eu ainda sou jovem.\n\n“N-não, não é nada. Aliás, Asia, há algum problema na escola? Você está se dando bem com outras garotas?”\n\nEssas são as coisas que mais me preocupam.\n\nUma ex-irmã que acabou de se transferir para a nossa escola. Como seu estilo de vida era muito diferente do nosso, ela poderia se sentir perdida na vida escolar.\n\nEm momentos como esse, definitivamente vou ajudá-la, mas o mais importante é que ela seja apoiada por outras garotas. Eu acho que ela está se dando bem com as garotas do Clube de Pesquisa Oculta, mas eu estou preocupado com a interação dela com os outros colegas. Eu não acho que ela está sendo intimidada por não estar acostumada com esse estilo de vida ... Mas eu não posso me impedir de ficar preocupada com isso.\n\nNada disso está acontecendo, tanto quanto eu posso dizer, mas ela pode ser intimidada quando eu não estou lá.\n\nNo entanto, a Asia sorri que vem do fundo do seu coração, que então rejeita a minha preocupação com ela.\n\n“Todo mundo é muito gentil comigo. Eles estão me ensinando muitas coisas para eu me familiarizar com o Japão. Eu também fiz muitos amigos. Também fui convidado para fazer compras com eles. ”\n\nIsso é bom de ouvir. Parece que o relacionamento dela com os outros colegas está indo bem. Agora, uma das minhas preocupações se foi. Enquanto conversávamos sobre isso, chegamos à escola e depois fomos para a aula.\n\nAgora, com o problema da vida escolar da Asia, o problema restante é:\n\n“Asia-chan! Bom Dia!\"\n\n“Bom dia, Asia-san. Seu cabelo loiro está brilhando hoje também. Assim que chegamos na sala, o careca Matsuda, e o cara de óculos Motohama, aprovam a Asia. Esses dois são meus amigos. Eles são famosos por serem pervertidos, junto comigo.”\n\n“Bom dia Matsuda-san, Motohama-san.”\n\nOs dois ficam emocionados depois de serem recebidos pela Asia.\n\n\"Esta é a coisa, não é, Motohama-kun?\"\n\n“Isso mesmo, Matsuda-kun. Ser recebido por ter uma beleza dizer \"Bom dia\" nos dá vida pela manhã. \"\n\n...... Como de costume, eles se sentem felizes com pequenas coisas. Mas até recentemente eu era provavelmente o mesmo que eles. Fufufu, ter tanta confiança certamente muda as pessoas.\n\nSOCO!\n\n\"Gufu!\"\n\nQuando eu estava agindo legal, Motohama me deu um soco no estômago.\n\n\"O-O que foi isso, careca !?\"\n\nEu argumentei contra ele, mas ele continua a rir e me chuta na minha perna.\n\nIsso realmente dói! O que esse idiota está fazendo?\n\n“Hahaha. Ise-kun Eu ouvi sobre isso.\"\n\n\"Ouvi o que.\"\n\n\"Ouvi dizer que você anda para a escola com a Asia-chan todos os dias, certo?\"\n\n\"O-O que sobre isto?\"\n\n\"Isso é estranho. Por quê? Por que vocês dois vêm para a escola da mesma direção? Eu quero saber porque?\"\n\nHmm. Eu não sei de onde ele ouviu, mas parece que ele ouviu os rumores sobre mim e Asia também. Eu levanto meus lábios e coloco um sorriso lascivo. Eu então digo isso.\n\n“Ouça, Matsuda, Motohama. Há um muro entre mim e vocês dois que vocês definitivamente não podem superar. Isso não pode ser ajudado.”\n\n“Oo que você está se orgulhando !?”\n\n“T-isso é certo, Ise. Só porque você se dá bem com a Asia-chan ...”\n\nEu então dou um golpe final. Eu também coloco uma expressão de vitória.\n\n“Eu moro com a Asia. Sob o mesmo teto. Certo, Asia?”\n\n\"Sim. Estou sendo cuidado na casa de Ise-san.”\n\n[!?]\n\nAmbos ficaram em silêncio depois de ver a resposta da Asia com um sorriso. Parece que eles estão sem palavras.\n\nFu. Fuhahahaha! Hahahaha! Eu venci! Eu venci!\n\n\"É mentira!\"\n\nMatsuda nega isso fortemente. Ele está até chorando. São lágrimas de ciúmes. Fuhahaha! Chorar! Grito! E morrendo!\n\n“Impossível …… Ise vivendo com uma beleza loira na mesma casa……? Isso não pode ser… a lei deste mundo entrará em colapso…”\n\nMotohama conserta a posição de seus óculos com a mão trêmula.\n\nEle também está tremendo, embora esteja tentando desesperadamente agir com calma.\n\n“E-Então você mesmo se acorda pela Asia-chan de manhã!?\"\n\nPergunta de Matsuda. Quão miserável.\n\n\"Asia, parece que eu fiz você me acordar hoje também.\"\n\n“Porque Ise-san é uma cabeça tão sonolenta. Ufufu.”\n\nAh, Matsuda cai no chão.\n\n“Ela até enche os pratos para você ……?”\n\nDesta vez, Motohama pergunta.\n\n\"Mamãe também elogiou que você é uma menina prendada, Asia.\"\n\n\"Oh meu ... você está me fazendo corar.\"\n\nAsia cora enquanto coloca a mão na bochecha dela.\n\nEu olhei para ela com confiança, e olhei para ela enquanto colocava um sorriso.\n\nVendo isso, Motohama olha diretamente para mim através dos óculos e parece que ele está prestes a derramar lágrimas de sangue. Cara, ter meu amigo com ciúmes de mim com certeza é assustador. Sério, a vida com certeza pode ser virada de cabeça para baixo com uma única mudança. Basta ser amigável com uma beleza é o suficiente para que os rapazes tenham uma vida feliz.\n\nSim, mesmo se todas as garotas da turma vierem a me odiar, estou bem, desde que a Asia esteja do meu lado. Ah, isso não é bom. Meu objetivo é obter um pariato e se tornar um grande Diabo, e então fazer muitas belezas para o meu servo. Então eu tenho que me tornar um cara que as garotas gostem. Mas parece que não vou conseguir me dar bem com garotas…\n\n\"Você! Você realmente conhece muitas garotas bonitas, não sabe? Rias-senpai! Akeno-senpai! Eles são os “Dois Grandes Onee-samas” da nossa academia, sabe? Então o pequeno ídolo da nossa escola, Toujou Koneko-chan, e agora a beleza loira que acabou de ser transferida, Asia-chan! Isto está errado! É tão injusto que estou prestes a quebrar!\"\n\nMatsuda se queixa enquanto segura a cabeça para baixo. Chore o quanto quiser, meu amigo. Assim como ele disse, eu estou me dando bem com várias belezas ultimamente.\n\nEspecialmente a Asia, com quem eu ando para a escola. E parece que estou sendo adorado pela Rias-senpai e pela Akeno-senpai também… Sim. Eu estou no grupo dos vencedores agora. Definitivamente em um grupo de vencedores. Este pode ser o melhor ponto da minha vida. Vou ter que aproveitar para não me arrepender depois. Enquanto estou pensando nisso, Motohama conserta seus óculos com calma.\n\n“Ise, eu não acho que introduzir uma única garota para nós será uma coisa ruim. Não, quero dizer, por favor, nos apresente a alguém. Eu te imploro. Por favor.”\n\nMotohama diz enquanto coloca seu rosto perto do meu. Ele diz isso com um tom baixo, mas tem muita intensidade nisso. Mas introduzindo ...... As únicas beldades com quem falo são aquelas que Matsuda acabou de mencionar.\n\nEm outras palavras, eu não tenho nenhuma conexão com outras garotas. Pelo contrário, eles nem me levam a sério. É uma dura realidade. Isso significa que eu não tenho laços com garotas humanas. As garotas com quem eu me dou bem são Diabos ... Bem, apesar de serem Diabos, elas são todas fofas, então não é um problema.\n\nHmm? Sim, está certo. Bem, não é como se eu não conhecesse alguém. Existe uma pessoa que eu conheço.\n\nEu tirei meu celular e verifiquei o nome. Sim, eu tenho isso. Isso deve estar bem.\n\n\"Espere um segundo.\"\n\nEu fiz os meus dois amigos e a Asia esperou um pouco aqui, e então fui para o canto da sala para que eu pudesse obter a aprovação da dita pessoa. Conversamos por alguns minutos, mas parece que a pessoa está bem com isso. Isso é bom.\n\n“Bem, eu encontrei uma pessoa que está bem em conhecer vocês. Essa pessoa também trará amigos também. Este é o número da pessoa que posso apresentar a vocês. Entre em contato com essa pessoa por e-mail primeiro. Dessa forma, vocês vão se sentir mais felizes.”\n\n\"Obrigado!\"\n\nMatsuda, que estava no chão até um momento atrás, pega meu celular. Ei, ei, essa é uma mudança rápida! Até um segundo atrás ele estava chorando, esse cara é realmente ......\n\nOs dois copiam o número em seus telefones.\n\n“Muito obrigado, Ise-sama! Eu nunca vou esquecer essa dívida!”\n\n“Sim, vamos fazer um encontro triplo da próxima vez! Apenas espere! Nós também faremos uma namorada instantaneamente! ”\n\nOs dois estão dando um bom sorriso. Parece que eles estão experimentando a felicidade, ou melhor, o interior da cabeça deles está no modo de festa.\n\n“Então, que tipo de pessoa ela é? Ela é uma beleza, certo?”\n\nMatsuda pergunta sobre a aparência da pessoa que acabei de apresentar. Eu respondo enquanto coço minha bochecha.\n\n“Umm, sim, ela é uma donzela. Isso, tenho certeza.”\n\n“Donzela …… m-maravilhoso …… isso é realmente maravilhoso, Ise-kun!”\n\n\"Cara, nós simplesmente não podemos agradecer o suficiente Ise-sensei.\"\n\nEsses caras são apenas patéticos. Eles continuam mudando suas atitudes. Não, eu também teria sido como eles se não tivesse me encontrado com a Buchou e a Asia.\n\nMe desculpe por ter toda a diversão, pessoal. Matsuda me pergunta mais uma vez com uma carinha sorridente.\n\n“Oh Ise-kun. A propósito, por que é \"Mil-tan\" chamado Mill-tan?”\n\nEu vou gostar que vocês perguntem a ele mesmo. Até eu não sei o motivo.\n\n\n===Parte 6===\n\nAquela noite. Estou pedalando minha bicicleta na área residencial.\n\n\"Oryaaaaaa!\"\n\nEu pedalo minha bicicleta com todas as minhas forças. Quando chegamos à área designada, a Asia que está sentada atrás de mim coloca o folheto na caixa de correio.\n\n\"Está feito.\"\n\n\"ESTÁ BEM.\"\n\nComecei a pedalar de novo na bicicleta depois de confirmar que a Asia está sentada atrás de mim.\n\nO folheto que acabamos de colocar naquela casa é um item conveniente usado para nos chamar de Diabos. Normalmente, você precisa desenhar um círculo mágico para evocar um Diabo, mas neste século, não há muitos humanos dispostos a desenhar um círculo mágico para convocar Diabos.\n\nMais como não há muitos humanos que acreditam em Demônios na era atual. Eu também não até recentemente. Portanto, a sociedade do diabo que estava em uma situação apertada criou um folheto com um círculo mágico que pode evocar os demônios mais facilmente.\n\nCada Diabo marca seu próprio círculo mágico no folheto e, assim como os anúncios comuns, eles escrevem uma frase de propaganda nele. Este panfleto não é nada para aqueles que estão satisfeitos com seus estilos de vida, mas para aqueles que estão desejando algo, ele tem um feitiço mágico, então eles vão querer usá-lo.\n\nNós aparecemos na frente dos humanos que se tornarão nossos contratados através do círculo mágico. Concedemos o seu desejo em troca de um preço. É assim que funciona. Portanto, este é o método atual usado para convocar diabos.\n\nE entregar este folheto é o primeiro trabalho do servo Demônios. Isso se tornou uma prática habitual por um tempo temporário. Usamos um dispositivo portátil do Diabo para encontrar humanos com uma ganância forte, e colocamos o folheto em sua caixa de correio e depois passamos para o próximo local. Repetir isso é um trabalho do diabo.\n\nBem, já terminei o trabalho de distribuir folhetos. A razão pela qual estou fazendo isso é—.\n\n“… Ise-san, está tudo bem? Para me ajudar a distribuir os folhetos ...”\n\n\"Sim, não é um problema.\"\n\nSim, estou ajudando a Asia a distribuir os panfletos. Assim, continuo a pedalar a bicicleta.\n\n“Asia, você não sabe como andar de bicicleta, certo? Então alguém tem que andar de bicicleta para você.”\n\n“Uu, me desculpe. Eu nunca tive a chance de subir em uma bike …… Mas se está andando …… ”\n\n“Eu não posso deixar você fazer isso ainda mais. Estou preocupado com você, Asia.”\n\nEsse é o meu verdadeiro sentimento. Não é sobre se ela pode andar de bicicleta ou não, mas mais do fato de eu não poder deixar a Asia correr em um ambiente desconhecido.\n\nEla acabara de chegar ao Japão do norte da Europa no mês passado. Ela não sabe muito sobre a cultura japonesa.\n\nEla ganhou a capacidade de entender japonês, tornando-se um diabo, mas é uma história diferente, se é para se adaptar a esse estilo de vida. Eu estou ensinando a ela do básico, mas ainda há muitas coisas que me fazem se preocupar com ela.\n\nAlém disso, a Asia é gentil com qualquer pessoa e não sabe como o mundo anda por aí. Você não sabe que tipo de coisas ruins vão cair sobre ela.\n\nEntão acabei propondo a Buchou depois de pensar sobre isso.\n\n\"Eu vou ajudar a Asia a distribuir os folhetos!\"\n\nBuchou aceitou de bom grado meu pedido. Muito obrigado, Buchou!\n\nAssim, estou apoiando a Asia. Então ando pela área residencial à noite de bicicleta junto com ela.\n\n“Olhe a Asia. Isso é um santuário. Somos demônios, então não podemos entrar.”\n\nEu falei sobre um certo santuário quando passamos por ele.\n\n\"Sim. Os demônios não podem ir a lugares onde os espíritos se reúnem e o Deus local vive, sim? É difícil para mim entender os “Deuses Xintoístas japoneses” porque eu sou um cristão …… ”\n\nSerá difícil para ela, que foi criada sob uma religião, entender a cultura japonesa. Foi o que a Buchou me contou.\n\nEntão comecei a ensinar à Asia as coisas sobre os lugares em que vivemos e assim por diante enquanto distribuímos os panfletos.\n\n“Ah! Lá. Está fechado agora, mas aquela padaria vende bom pão. Você quer ir comprar na próxima vez?”\n\n\"Sim! Pães japoneses são doces, então eu os amo! ”\n\nAté mesmo uma conversa normal é divertida. Um encontro à noite. Isso é o melhor! Eu sempre quis andar de bicicleta com uma garota sentada atrás de mim assim.\n\n“Ise-san, você assistiu ao filme “Roman Holiday” ?”\n\nAsia me pergunta.\n\nFeriado Romano ? Ah sim, eu acho que é um filme.\n\n“É um filme antigo né? Não, desculpe. Eu não assisti.”\n\n\"É assim mesmo-\"\n\nA Asia parece um pouco triste com a minha resposta.\n\n\"Mas e aquele filme?\"\n\n“…… Sempre foi minha admiração. Foi assim ... No entanto, eles estavam andando de bicicleta no filme. Mesmo assim eu ... Ufufu.”\n\nHã? Ela parece muito feliz agora. Até os braços dela que estão em meus quadris ficaram mais fortes.\n\nEu não tenho certeza, mas tudo bem. Se a Asia for feliz, isso será bom o suficiente. O vento esta noite também é bom.\n\n\n===Parte 7===\n\n\"Estamos de volta!\"\n\nAsia e eu terminamos de distribuir os panfletos e voltamos para a sala do clube.\n\nO prédio da velha escola não utilizado localizado atrás da escola. Um dos quartos no terceiro andar é o quarto do Clube de Pesquisa Oculta e também o local de encontro do grupo Gremory.\n\n“Ara ara, bom trabalho. Eu vou fazer um chá verde agora.”\n\nO primeiro a nos receber de volta é o vice-presidente do nosso clube, assim como o funcionário da Rias-buchou, Himejima Akeno-san. Ela é minha aluna que é uma aluna do terceiro ano e é uma japonesa com longos cabelos negros e sedosos que está sempre sorrindo. Ela também é uma pessoa com um estilo de cabelo rabo de cavalo que é raro entre os adolescentes atuais.\n\nJunto com a Buchou, ela é chamada de uma das “Duas Grandes Oneesamas” de nossa escola e ela é popular entre meninos e meninas e tem a popularidade de um ídolo.\n\n\"Ei, como foi o encontro à noite?\"\n\nO cara que está mandando um sorriso para mim é Kiba Yuuto, o cara bonito. Ele é o príncipe bonito que conquistou os corações da maioria das meninas da nossa escola. Ele é meu inimigo desde que eu odeio caras de boa aparência.\n\n\"Obviamente, foi o melhor.\"\n\nEu coloquei meus polegares em direção ao Kiba.\n\n\"...... relacionamento sexual ilícito tarde da noite.\"\n\nAquele que acabou de dizer uma coisa dura para mim é a pequena estudante do primeiro ano, Toujou Koneko-chan. À primeira vista, ela só parece uma estudante do ensino fundamental, mas por ser uma garota loli, ela é popular em nossa academia por ser nossa mascote da escola. Asia e eu caminhamos em direção à Buchou, que está sentada no sofá. Nosso [rei], Rias-buchou. Mesmo hoje à noite, seu cabelo carmesim é lindo como sempre.\n\n“Buchou. Estamos de volta.”\n\nEu relatei a ela, mas a Buchou está olhando para uma certa direção enquanto está atordoada. Ela está pensando em alguma coisa? Ela até dá um suspiro profundo.\n\nA Asia que está ao meu lado também olha na direção que a Buchou está olhando.\n\n\"Buchou, estamos de volta!\"\n\nDesta vez, eu levantei minha voz. Buchou me ouviu e voltou a seus\nsentidos.\n\n“Eu sinto muito. Eu fiquei atordoada por um tempo. Bom trabalho, Ise, Asia.”\n\nUltimamente, acho que a Buchou está pensando em algo com frequência. Quando ela nos ordena a fazer algo, ela faz isso com elegância, como de costume, mas fora isso, sua mente vai para algum lugar. Eu acho que o número de vezes que ela suspirou aumentou também.\n\nEla possivelmente tem algumas preocupações sérias que não seremos capazes de entender. Bem, ela é um demônio de alta classe, afinal. Então, esses são os membros do Clube de Pesquisa Oculta e também os membros do grupo Gremory. Além de mim, todo mundo é super popular na escola. Bem, sou famoso por ser um pervertido. Hahaha, eu sinto vontade de me desculpar, já que sinto que estou em um lugar errado.\n\nA Buchou então diz depois de confirmar que a Asia e eu chegamos.\n\n\"Agora, então, eu terei a Asia fazendo sua estréia como um Diabo começando hoje à noite.\"\n\nOh! A sério!?\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\nEu digo para a Asia que está confusa.\n\n“Asia, você estará tendo sua verdadeira estréia como um demônio a partir de hoje à noite! Você está indo para o lugar dos contratados através do círculo mágico! ”\n\n\"E-eu?\"\n\nAsia aponta para si mesma enquanto entra em pânico.\n\n\"Certo, Buchou?\"\n\nBuchou acena para a minha pergunta.\n\n\"Sim. Entregar os panfletos terminará hoje. Se eu deixar para sempre, parece que a data entre vocês dois vai continuar ainda mais.\"\n\nUwa Por favor, pare de intimidar seus servos, Buchou. Estou me sentindo um pouco envergonhado se a Buchou disser isso para mim.\n\nAssim como na minha estreia, a Buchou desenha o círculo mágico do clã Gremory na palma da Asia. Graças a isso, você será capaz de transportar através do círculo mágico.\n\n\"Akeno, verifique se a Asia tem poder demoníaco suficiente para transportar através do círculo mágico.\"\n\n\"Sim, Buchou.\"\n\nA Akeno-san colocou a mão na testa de Asia depois que Buchou a mandou. Uma leve luz aparece na ponta dos dedos e parece que ela está lendo alguma coisa.\n\n“Tivemos o incidente com o Ise antes, então precisamos verificar corretamente. Embora eu não ache que haverá o mesmo problema.”\n\nEu me sinto triste depois de ouvir a preocupação da Buchou. Está certo. Minha estréia como diabo foi horrível. Para usar o círculo mágico, você precisa de um pouco de poder demoníaco. Mas eu não tinha nem um pouco de poder demoníaco.\n\nGraças a isso, não consegui transportar através do círculo mágico e tenho que usar uma bicicleta para ir ao cliente, algo que ninguém fez antes. Mesmo agora, tenho que visitar os clientes de bicicleta. Isso é difícil de suportar ...\n\n“Buchou, tudo bem. Não há problema algum. Mas, ela tem o poder mais demoníaco depois da Buchou e eu. Sua capacidade potencial para seu poder demoníaco é muito boa.”\n\nBuchou sorri no relatório da Akeno-san.\n\n“Isso é uma boa notícia. Ela pode usar seu poder como um [bispo] ao\nmáximo ”.\n\nO [Bispo], que Buchou acabou de mencionar, é o papel da Asia como Diabo. Os atuais demônios têm regras baseadas no jogo de xadrez do mundo humano para seus servos. O diabo que é um mestre é um [rei], e abaixo deles estão a [rainha], as [torres], os [bispos], os [cavaleiros] e os [peões].\n\nO sistema para o servo Devils que os Devils atuais usam, o [Evil Piece]. Anteriormente, a Buchou e outros me disseram que há muito tempo, muitos demônios morreram contra a Guerra com Deus e os Anjos Caídos, e esse sistema foi criado para aumentar as forças dos demônios tendo apenas um pequeno número de subordinados para manter o equilíbrio. contra as outras facções.\n\nCada peça tem suas próprias características que aumentam a capacidade de um servo Diabo. É claro que, tendo a Buchou como nossa líder, que também é nossa mestra, também temos certos papéis.\n\nAkeno-san é uma [Rainha], Kiba é um [Cavaleiro], Koneko-chan é uma [Torre], Asia é um [Bispo] e eu sou um [Peão]!\n\nÀ primeira vista, [Pawn] parece fraco, mas dependendo da maneira como você o usa, ele pode até derrubar um [King]! Foi o que a Buchou me contou! Eu tenho que acreditar nisso já que estou com o objetivo de me tornar o “Peão mais forte”.\n\nVoltando ao assunto, já que a Asia tem um alto poder demoníaco, ela não tem nenhum problema em transportar através do círculo mágico. Sim, parece que a Asia começou de um bom começo. Eu também estou satisfeito com isso.\n\nEntão a Asia também se dará bem com seu cliente e ... Então comecei a me sentir desconfortável.\n\n...... O que acontecerá com a Asia que é gentil com qualquer um e que não sabe como o mundo anda quando ela é convocada por alguém com muita ganância ...?\n\nCaso 1:\n“Oh, que fofo Devil-san! Oh sim! Por favor, mostre-me sua calcinha! Por favor, me mostre seus seios!”\n\n……Isso é ruim.\n\nCaso 2:\n“Lindo diabo-chan! Deixe-me apalpar seus peitos tanto quanto eu quero em troca da minha vida!”\n\n...... Asia?\n\nCaso 3:\n\"Eu vou te dar a minha vida, então deixe-me fazer sexo com você até a\nnoite acabar!\"\n\n…………\n\n\"Ise, você está chorando?\"\n\nBuchou olha no meu rosto com um olhar preocupado.\n\n“Buchou, não. É um não!”\n\nEu balanço a cabeça para o lado enquanto tenho lágrimas fluindo dos meus olhos.\n\nÉ um não. Isso mesmo, não! É da Asia que estamos falando! Não há como a Asia ser capaz de recusar quando um cara que ela não conheceu lhe pede uma ordem lasciva!\n\nA Asia, que é séria e apaixonada pelo seu trabalho, tentará realizar o seu trabalho, sacrificando o próprio corpo!\n\n“Buchou! Eu me sinto desconfortável se a Asia for sozinha ~! Se Asia~! Não suporto se algum esquisito fizer algum desejo doente à Asia!”\n\nA Buchou parece um pouco perturbada depois que eu me aproximei dela enquanto chorava.\n\n“Ise, um pedido que é muito lascivo para os Diabos que eles invocaram, não chega ao servo Diabos do clã Gremory. Há seres humanos que pedem esse tipo de desejo, então há diabos que levam esses clientes como profissão e pedidos como esses são para eles. Os trabalhos que fazemos são seguros, sabe? Até os diabos têm áreas em que são profissionais. ”\n\n“Buchou, você está dizendo a verdade, certo? Essa é a verdade, certo? Mas ainda assim me sinto super desconfortável!”\n\nBuchou suspira depois de me ver tão preocupado com isso.\n\n“Bem. Por um curto período de tempo, vou colocá-lo na Asia para apoiála. Você está satisfeito com isso?”\n\n“M-muito obrigado! Asia! Deixe-me cuidar dos pervertidos! Asia, você pode simplesmente fazer o contrato normalmente!\n\n\"Sim.\"\n\nEu pego a mão da Asia e dou um suspiro de alívio.\n\nA própria Asia parece preocupada que ela está causando problemas para mim, mas tudo bem. Eu preciso proteger a Asia. Eu até fiz uma promessa com a Buchou, e também estou preocupado com a Asia. Eu poderia ser mais protetor para ela, mas eu quero cuidar dela até que ela diga: \"Eu posso fazer isso sozinho!\"\n\nVocê tem que fazer esses tipos de coisas até que eles fiquem chateados com você. Eu vou proteger a Asia mesmo que isso a faça me odiar.\n\n\"Então, se um pedido vier, Asia, você irá transportar através do círculo mágico levando Ise com você.\"\n\n\"Sim, eu entendo. Buchou.\"\n\nDepois que ela confirma, o grande círculo mágico no chão brilha. Akeno-san, que está no comando do círculo mágico, começa a ler as cartas do diabo que apareceram em uma seção do círculo mágico.\n\n“Ara ara, há um cliente tentando nos convocar, que quer desejar algo que até a Asia-chan possa suportar.”\n\nOuvindo o relatório da Akeno-san, a Buchou sorri.\n\n“Isso é muito conveniente. A Asia pode fornecer o poder demoníaco necessário para se teletransportar através do círculo mágico, e ela também pode apoiar Ise que também não tem poder demoníaco. Vamos fazer isso então.”\n\nHmm, eu era o único que deveria ajudá-la, mas parece que eu sou o único que precisa da ajuda …… Tudo bem. Eu só preciso vigiar a Asia fazendo seu primeiro trabalho!\n\n\"Vamos, Asia!\"\n\n\"Sim, Ise-san!\"\n\nAsia e eu fomos em direção ao centro do círculo mágico depois de nos\nanimarmos.\n\n\n===Parte 8===\n\nVoltei para casa tarde da noite com a Asia. A Asia terminou seu primeiro emprego com segurança. Ao contrário da minha estreia, tudo correu bem.\n\n\"Eu sinto muito, eu vou tomar o banho primeiro então.\"\n\nDizendo isso, a Asia se dirige para o banheiro. Ela não consegue parar de sorrir porque conseguiu seu primeiro emprego.\n\nEu também fui ao meu quarto para descansar. Ah, tanto minha mente quanto meu corpo estão desgastados, como todas as noites.\n\nDepois que a Asia terminou seu trabalho, voltamos para a sala do clube e reportamos a Buchou, e terminamos nosso trabalho como Diabo pela noite. Eu tenho preocupações com a Buchou que tinha uma cara triste ...\n\nEstar preocupado com a Buchou é bom, mas será a minha vez de tomar um banho depois que a Asia terminar.\n\nUsando o mesmo banho em que uma garota estava ... Eu sei que não deveria pensar em coisas lascivas, mas estou nessa idade quando preciso. Então, há uma parte de mim ficando animada com isso.\n\nNão não! Eu balancei minha cabeça com muita força e tentei me livrar dos pensamentos ruins.\n\nEu preciso proteger a Asia! Se fico entusiasmado com a Asia, então isso faz de mim o pior tipo de pessoa!\n\nPervertido! Que pervertido eu sou! Merda! Eu gostaria de ter a mente de um eremita só por agora!\n\nSim! Para me livrar dos meus maus pensamentos, vou sentar-me enquanto cruzo as pernas! Eu sentei no chão e fechei meus olhos para acalmar meu espírito.\n\nEu não sou lascivo. Eu não sou um pervertido. Eu sou um ser que protege a Asia. Estou morando com a Asia, mas não consigo pensar em coisas ruins. Namu namu namu.\n\nAi! Então eu tenho uma dor de cabeça! Oh sim! Por que estou rezando? Eu sou um diabo! Eu vou levar dano se eu orar! Eu quase me matei sozinho!\n\nDroga! O que eu estou fazendo!? Espere, o que estou fazendo no meu próprio quarto ……?\n\nINSTANTÂNEO\n\nEntão o chão do meu quarto brilha. A luz está se formando em uma forma circular e um símbolo familiar aparece nela.\n\nEsta é a marca do nosso grupo!\n\nO círculo mágico do grupo Gremory. Quem é esse? Quer dizer, porque meu quarto? Alguém está tentando se teleportar para o meu quarto? O círculo mágico faz um grande brilho que ilumina toda a sala, e uma pessoa aparece dele.\n\nÉ a silhueta de uma garota. Uma garota com cabelos vermelhos.\n\n“Buchou ……?”\n\nAquele que aparece do círculo mágico não é outro senão Rias-buchou. Mas por que ela está no meu quarto?\n\nEla parece ter o rosto daqueles encurralados. Sua expressão é a mesma que ela tinha na sala do clube.\n\nBuchou se aproxima de mim assim que ela me vê. Então ela diz uma coisa chocante para mim.\n\n\"Faça amor comigo.\"\n\n…………Com licença? Minha mente ficou em branco por causa da coisa súbita. O que ela disse agora? Eu fiquei surdo?\n\nA Buchou disse de novo para ter certeza de que eu escutei desde que eu tenho um olhar confuso.\n\n“Eu quero que você tire minha virgindade. Imediatamente.”\n\nO japonês da Buchou é estimulante como sempre.\n\n\n<noinclude>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; padding: 0.2em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n| Voltar para [[High_School_DxD:Volume_2_Vida_0|Vida 0]]\n| Retornar para [[High_School_DxD_~Brazilian_Portuguese~|Página Principal]]\n| Avançar para [[High_School_DxD:Volume_2_Vida_2|Vida.2 Eu consigo uma briga]]\n|-\n|}\n</noinclude>\n"

O que é isso!? O que está acontecendo!? Minha mente não pode alcançar as ações da Buchou!”\n\nFAIXA!\n\nEla tira a saia e sua calcinha fica visível! Guha! Sua calcinha branca pura é tão brilhante! Suas belas pernas longas são excelentes como sempre! Ela ainda tem coxas que você quer tocar muito! Ela então alcança seu sutiã!\n\n“B-Buchou! Isto é-!?”\n\nEstou em pânico. Claro! Obviamente! Mesmo um estudante excitado como eu vai ficar confuso se a Buchou de repente aparecer e disser algo como “Vamos fazer sexo” e começar a tirar a roupa!\n\nFAIXA.\n\nEla finalmente tira a camisa! Seus peitos que são apoiados pelo sutiã são visíveis! Eu não posso tirar meus olhos de seus seios brancos e enormes! Buchou, que só tem a calcinha, respira fundo e caminha em minha direção.\n\n\"Ise, não sou boa o suficiente?\"\n\n“N-não! Absolutamente não!\"\n\n\"Eu pensei sobre todos os tipos de coisas, mas este é o único método que resta.\"\n\nMétodo para o quê! Não consigo ver para onde isso está levando!\n\n“Se houver provas, elas não podem reclamar disso. A única pessoa perto de mim que é capaz de fazer isso comigo é você.\n\nEu!? Eu não tenho certeza, mas eu fui escolhida para ser a primeira vez dela?\n\nÉ uma honra! É o que eu quero dizer, mas não tenho confiança para dizer isso!\n\n“… Yuuto não fará. Ele é um cavaleiro puro. Ele recusaria com certeza. É por isso que você foi o único possível, Ise.”\n\nEu ganhei Kiba! Uhahaha! Eu não sei o que está acontecendo, mas para essa parte eu posso estar orgulhoso! Eu ganhei contra você bonito!\n\n\"...... Há coisas que ainda faltam, mas você parece ter o potencial.\"\n\nA ponta do dedo da Buchou toca minha bochecha. Meu coração está batendo. Eu sinto algo misterioso correndo pelo meu corpo!\n\n\"Você é o único que faria isso assim que eu perguntasse e iria até o fim.\"\n\n“B-Buchou ……”\n\nA Buchou se aproxima de mim. Eu mesmo me empurrei na cama. Buchou cavalga em mim. O lugar onde suas nádegas e coxas estão tocando é minha parte importante!\n\nSeu cabelo vermelho cai no meu corpo. O cheiro do cabelo carmesim dela me excita.\n\nDESENGANCHAR.\n\n[[File:High school dxd 059.jpg|thumb|right]]\nO som do sutiã sendo retirado. A segunda vinda dos peitos da Buchou! Seus belos mamilos rosados já estão eretos. Seus seios saltam com seus movimentos leves. Isso tem muitos poderes destrutivos!\n\nEste é o meu segundo contato com esse seio! Eu nunca pensei que seria capaz de vê-lo novamente nesta cama!\n\n“Esta é sua primeira vez, certo Ise? Ou você já tem experiência?\n\n\"É a minha primeira vez!\"\n\n\"Entendo. É a minha primeira vez também, então vamos fazer até o fim, mesmo que nós dois não tenhamos experiência. Está tudo bem, é muito simples. Você só tem que colocar aqui dentro.\n\nA Buchou toca sua parte importante com o dedo. É tão estimulante que meu cérebro está prestes a explodir! Então a Buchou pega minha mão direita e…!\n\nAperto.\n\nMinha mão direita que foi agarrada pela Buchou é colocada em cima de seus peitos! Eu posso sentir uma sensação muito suave em todos os cinco dedos enquanto ele afunda! É coisa de um cara concentrar seus pensamentos e sensações em sua mão direita em momentos como este!\n\nINUNDAR!\n\nEu sei que há uma quantidade insana de sangue saindo do meu nariz. A sensação dos peitos com os quais eu sonhei tanto! Porra, minha cabeça está prestes a explodir por causa dessa situação incrível! Mas se eu tiver que descrever essa sensação, então é como um pudim que não vai desmoronar! Ou o melhor marshmallow de qualidade! Não, você ainda não pode descrever essa sensação com expressões como essa! Você absolutamente não pode!\n\n\"Você percebe isso?\"\n\nBuchou diz isso para mim com uma voz encantadora.\n\n“Eu também estou nervoso. Você pode dizer pelo meu coração bater certo?”\n\nAgora que você mencionou, eu posso sentir seu coração batendo rápido através de seus macios peitos que estou tocando com a mão direita. Se eu olhar com cuidado, sua pele branca e pura começa a ficar vermelha.…… B-Buchou também está nervoso? Então a Buchou que costuma atuar com elegância fica nervosa pela primeira vez também. Então a Buchou começa a tirar minhas roupas! Uwaaaaah! Eu estou ficando nu por uma garoootaa!\n\n“B-mas! Eu realmente não tenho confiança!”\n\nEu acidentalmente fiz uma voz chorosa porque estou tão nervosa! Bem, obviamente! Isso é porque eu realmente sou um virgeeeeeemm! A Buchou fica com o rosto perto do meu e diz.\n\n\"Você está tentando me envergonhar?\"\n\nEXPLODIR\n\nCom esse comentário, meu cérebro sopra. Eu sei que é o som que indica que não posso mais segurar meu instinto. Eu pego a Buchou pelos ombros dela e a coloco contra a minha cama! Na minha cama. Há uma garota completamente nua abaixo de mim. Ela está dizendo que eu posso fazer ela! Faça sua determinação, Hyoudou Issei! Eu não tenho certeza, mas minha hora chegou! Eu tenho que fazer isso!\n\nEspere, isso é realmente tudo bem? Mas eu não consigo me controlar se a beleza que admiro diz coisas assim para mim! Depois que eu engoli meu espeto e respirei fundo, eu inclino meu corpo contra a Buchou—.\n\nINSTANTÂNEO!\n\nEntão o chão do meu quarto pisca mais uma vez. O que é isso? Vendo isso, Buchou suspira.\n\n\"...... Parece que eu estava um pouco atrasado ......\"\n\nBuchou olha para o círculo mágico com nojo. O símbolo no círculo mágico é - do grupo Gremory? Quem é esse? Kiba? Akeno-san? Koneko-chan? Espere, não importa quem seja, ser pego nessa situação é ruiiiiim !!\n\nMas minha previsão estava errada, e a pessoa que aparece no círculo mágico é uma mulher de cabelos prateados. Suas roupas parecem as de uma empregada. Ela é uma empregada?\n\nA bela empregada de cabelos prateados fala em silêncio depois de me ver com a Buchou.\n\n\"Você está tentando quebrar o acordo, fazendo algo assim?\"\n\nA empregada diz isso claramente como se estivesse espantada. Buchou contrai as sobrancelhas ao ouvir isso.\n\n“Se eu não for tão longe, Otou-sama e Onii-sama não vão me ouvir direito?”\n\n“Tanto o Sirzechs-sama quanto o mestre ficarão tristes depois que descobrirem que você tentou dar sua pureza a uma pessoa humilde como essa.”\n\nMestre? S-Sirzechs-sama? Quem é esse? Pelo que a Buchou disse, é o pai dela e o irmão dela? Então a Buchou tem um irmão. Mas humilde ... Ela está falando de mim, certo? Eu me sinto um pouco chocada se alguém que acabei de conhecer me chama assim. Ouvindo a empregada dizer isso, a Buchou se torna desagradável imediatamente.\n\n“Minha pureza é só minha. O que há de errado em dar a alguém que eu reconheci? Também não chame meu servo bonito humilde. Mesmo que seja você, não vou te perdoar, Grayfia.”\n\nB-Buchouuuuu! Estou tão comovido porque você ficou louco por mim!\n\nA mulher chamada Grayfia pega o sutiã da Buchou.\n\n“De qualquer forma, você é a próxima herdeira da Casa dos Gremory, então, por favor, não mostre sua pele a um homem de forma imprudente. Ainda mais se você estiver no meio dessa situação. ”\n\nEla então coloca o sutiã no corpo da Buchou. A mulher olha para mim. Ela então abaixa a cabeça.\n\n\"Como vai. Eu sou uma empregada que serve a Casa dos Gremory. Meu nome é Grayfia. Prazer em conhecê-lo.\"\n\nEu recebi uma introdução educada dela. Eu me sinto um pouco desajeitado porque fui chamada de uma pessoa humilde quando a vi pela primeira vez, mas se eu olhar com cuidado ela é uma beleza. Se ela é humana, então ela estará em seus 20 e poucos anos.\n\nEla parece uma pessoa calma e colecionada, e seu cabelo prateado que está brilhando está lindo. Ela tem o cabelo dividido em três cordas, que são então amarradas umas às outras. Grayfia-san hein, eu acho que as mulheres mais velhas também são muito boas ......\n\nPitada.\n\nBuchou me belisca porque estou olhando para Grayfia-san. Dói, Buchou.\n\n“Grayfia, você veio aqui por vontade própria? Ou porque a casa te mandou? ...... Ou é Onii-sama?”\n\nA Buchou faz uma cara desagradável. De alguma forma ela está agindo como garotas da idade dela. Este é um novo lado dela que eu não vi.\n\n\"Todos eles.\"\n\nGrayfia-san responde assim. Ouvindo isso, Buchou suspira como se estivesse desistindo.\n\n\"É assim mesmo? Você, que é irmão [Rainha], veio pessoalmente ao mundo humano. Então, isso só pode ser uma coisa. Compreendo.\"\n\nBuchou pega a roupa dela. Ela coloca o braço entre as roupas. Seu maravilhoso corpo nu está ficando coberto.\n\n“Sinto muito, Ise. Vamos fazer com que a coisa anterior nunca tenha acontecido. Eu não estava pensando direito também. Vamos esquecer o incidente de hoje.”\n\n… Ah, então acabou. B-Bem, eu não sei o que está acontecendo ... Mas eu sei que definitivamente vou me arrepender depois.\n\n“Ise? Espere, essa pessoa é essa?”\n\nHmm? Grayfia olha para mim com uma expressão chocada. Eu nunca esperei que uma mulher legal como ela ficasse tão chocada.\n\n“Sim, Hyoudou Issei. Meu [peão]. O usuário do [Boosted Gear]. ”\n\n\"...... [Boosted Gear], o possuído pelo Imperador dos Dragões ...\"\n\nO que é isso? De repente, Grayfia-san começa a olhar para mim como se estivesse olhando para algo extraordinário.\n\n“Grayfia, vamos voltar para o meu quarto. Eu vou ouvir o que você tem a dizer por aí. A Akeno também pode participar, certo?”\n\n“A Sacerdotisa do Trovão? Eu não me importo. É uma obrigação para os Diabos de Alta Classe terem a sua [Rainha] ao seu lado o tempo todo. ”\n\n\"Muito bem. Ise.\n\nA Buchou me chama. Ela caminha em minha direção e então ela ...\n\nCHU\n\nO lábio da Buchou toca minha bochecha. …………Uau. Uoooooooooooo!\n\nEu fui beijada na bochecha !!\n\n“Por favor, me perdoe por hoje com isso. Eu te incomodei muito. Vamos nos encontrar novamente no clube amanhã.”\n\nEla me dá uma despedida e desaparece no círculo mágico junto com Grayfia-san.\n\n...... Eu sou o único que resta no quarto agora. Eu estou de pé lá ofuscado enquanto tocando a bochecha onde eu fui beijada.\n\n“Ise-san! Eu terminei de usar o chuveiro! Eu ouvi a voz de Asia logo depois disso.”\n\n===Parte 2===\n\nPróxima manhã. Asia e eu estamos caminhando para a escola. Eu esfrego meus olhos porque não consegui dormir nem um pouco. Droga. Porra, não!\n\nMe arrependi da noite passada! Eu me arrependi muito! Eu estava sofrendo dentro da minha cama!\n\nO sentimento dos peitos na minha mão, e a imagem do corpo nu da Buchou queimado em meus olhos, impactaram tanto minha mente quanto minha alma!\n\nEntão eu me levantei à noite e comecei a fazer muitas coisas lascivas sozinho! Por toda a noite! Eu tive que me dar prazer porque eu tinha muito tesão dentro do meu corpo desde que ela parou antes de fazer isso! É por isso que estou cansado da manhã!\n\n\"Você está bem?\"\n\nAsia me pergunta com uma voz preocupada. Eu sinto como se eu soubesse o quão sujo eu estou quando eu fico com os olhos inocentes dela!\n\nSinto muito a Asia. Eu estava fazendo algo que você não deveria saber enquanto não estava olhando. Eu não posso dizer a ela que Buchou queria fazer sexo comigo na noite passada, não importa o quê.\n\n\"Você não fez o treinamento da manhã hoje, então eu pensei que seu corpo estava ferido.\"\n\nA Asia parece estar muito preocupada. Eu sinto muito. O treino da manhã foi cancelado hoje. Recebi uma ligação esta manhã da Buchou e ela cancelou dizendo \"Podemos cancelar hoje\".\n\nBem, eu não posso fazer treinamento com a própria Buchou nesse estado…\n\nEstou andando em direção à sala de aula enquanto minhas pernas estão se movendo muito devagar. Então-.\n\n“Iseeeeeeeeee !!”\n\nMatsuda está correndo na minha direção com um rosto extremamente irritado do final do corredor.\n\nAh! É sobre isso!\n\n“Mooooorrraaaaa !!”\n\nDa outra direção, o Motohama está correndo muito rápido. Ambos se prepararam para fazer um envelope comigo! Eu não tenho para onde correr desde que estamos no corredor!\n\nACERTAR!\n\nUgah! Ambos os seus lariats bateram no meu pescoço. Isso machuca idiotas!\n\nEu tossi enquanto tocava meu pescoço.\n\n\"N-não fode comiiigo!\"\n\nMatsuda grita.\n\n“Ise! Seu desgraçado!\"\n\nMotohama me agarra pelo colarinho e me encara com olhos cheios de intenção assassina.\n\n“Sério, o que é isso?”\n\nEu agi como se não soubesse sobre o que eles são, mas isso não os impede de ficarem putos comigo.\n\n“Não foda-se! Porra! O que diabos foi isso!? Ele parecia aqueles caras realmente fortes de um mangá de artes marciais! E por que ele estava vestindo roupas góticas de Lolita? Isso é uma arma suprema!? ”\n\nMatsuda reclama comigo enquanto chora. Parece que os dois se encontraram com ele ontem.\n\nParece que o impacto de “Mil-tan” foi demais para eles. Mil-tan - um cliente regular meu como um diabo. Meu contratante. Ele é uma menina nascida de um homem que tem o corpo da pessoa mais forte do mundo, e ele olha para mahou-shoujo. Seu ponto encantador é sua roupa gótica de Lolita e as orelhas de gato que ele usa.\n\nVocê pode achar que essa informação não faz sentido, mas não posso evitar se isso é verdade. O coração de uma donzela e um corpo de homem! Essa é a única explicação que tenho.\n\n\"Não apenas isso! Ele também trouxe alguns amigos! Ele fez uma reunião de alguns tipos! Havia alguns daqueles que pareciam “Miltan”! Eu estava tão assustada! Eu pensei que ia ser morto!\n\nDroga. Então, há mais deles ... Só de pensar nisso me dá arrepios e pesadelos. Onde é que a “série Mil-tan” é produzida a partir de…? Sim, eu definitivamente não quero conhecê-los…\n\n“Eles estavam falando sobre o mundo da magia! Que merda é o \"Mundo da Serabenia Mágica\" !? Eu não conheço nenhuma merda como essa!\n\nMatsuda-kun continua a reclamar para mim enquanto agita meu corpo violentamente.\n\n“No meu caso, eles estavam me dizendo como derrotar as“ Criaturas das Trevas ”se eu encontrar um… Aparentemente você pode matá-los usando um item especial que é feito misturando o sal do mar dos mortos e um flor que só aparece à noite chamada “Flor do Luar”, e depois queimá-los para fazer um pó …… Não importa como você pense sobre isso, um soco de Mil-tan seria o suficiente para matar qualquer coisa viva neste mundo …… ”\n\nMotohama diz para mim enquanto segura a cabeça dele. Eu vejo, parece que esses dois passaram pelo inferno.\n\n\"Parabéns. Agora você pode vencer as \"criaturas das trevas\" sempre que encontrar uma.”\n\nDepois que eu disse isso, Matsuda e Motohama fazem um duplo brainbuster em mim.\n\n===Parte 3===\n\n“O problema da Buchou? Talvez tenha algo a ver com a Casa dos\nGremory.”\n\nKiba diz isso para mim enquanto caminhamos em direção ao clube\nlocalizado no antigo prédio da escola.\n\nEu me encontrei com Kiba enquanto estava a caminho do salão de festas junto com a Asia. Então eu perguntei a Kiba sobre como a Buchou está agindo estranha ultimamente, mas parece que Kiba também não sabe o porquê.\n\n\"Akeno-san saberia, certo?\"\n\nKiba acena com a minha pergunta\n.\n“A Akeno-san é a empregada mais confiável da Buchou, então ela obviamente saberia.”\n\nEu sei que perguntar a Buchou sobre o problema dela é rude, mas fiquei preocupada com ela desde que me envolvi na noite passada. Mas eu não sinto vontade de falar sobre a noite passada com ninguém. Quero dizer, vai causar um alvoroço se eu fizer. Bem deixa pra lá. De qualquer forma, se houver algo que eu possa ajudá-la, então eu irei.\n\nQuando chegamos à frente da porta, Kiba percebeu alguma coisa.\n\n\"...... Para eu finalmente perceber a presença aqui ......\"\n\nKiba coloca um rosto sério, estreitando os olhos. Hã? O que é isso?\n\nEu abro a porta sem qualquer preocupação. Dentro da sala estão a Buchou, a Akeno-san, a Koneko-chan e ... A empregada de cabelos prateados Grayfia-san! Ela com certeza age calmamente.\n\nA Buchou tem um rosto muito desagradável. A Akeno-san está sorrindo como sempre, mas ela tem uma vibe fria. A Koneko-chan está sentada em uma cadeira na esquina em silêncio. Parece que ela não quer se envolver com os outros tanto quanto possível.\n\nO quarto tem uma atmosfera onde ninguém está falando. Kiba diz baixinho \"Oh meu\" atrás de mim. Nós três entramos na sala, mas nenhum dos membros está falando conosco como sempre fazem. É assim que a atmosfera dessa sala é tensa.\n\nA Asia também está se sentindo desconfortável, então ela segura minha manga com um rosto desconfortável. Eu acaricio sua cabeça para confortá-la e fazê-la se sentir segura. A Buchou fala depois de olhar para cada um de nós.\n\n“Parece que todo mundo está aqui. Antes de começarmos o clube, há algo que preciso contar a todos vocês.”\n\n\"Ojou-sama, você quer que eu explique a situação?\"\n\nA Buchou rejeita a oferta da Grayfia-san acenando com a mão.\n\n\"A verdade é-\"\n\nAcontece exatamente quando a Buchou fala. O círculo mágico no chão\nbrilha.\n\nEh……? Teletransporte? Mas todas as pessoas do grupo Gremory estão aqui. Então é um diabo que serve a Casa dos Gremory assim como a Grayfia-san?\n\nDepois disso, percebo que meu palpite está longe da resposta correta, e vou perceber que ainda não tenho conhecimento como um demônio. O símbolo do Gremory desenhado no círculo mágico se transforma em um padrão desconhecido.\n\n-! O que é isso!? Não é este o círculo mágico dos Gremory?\n\n\"-Phoenix\"\n\nÉ o que Kiba, que é próximo de mim, diz. Fénix? T-Então não é um\nGremory!\n\nA luz brilha através da sala e uma pessoa aparece do círculo mágico.\n\nCHAMA!\n\nChamas saem do círculo mágico e o quarto transborda de calor. Quente! Faíscas estão queimando minha pele. Há uma silhueta de um homem dentro das chamas. Quando ele balança o braço para o lado, as chamas desaparecem.\n\n\"Fuu, faz um tempo desde que cheguei ao mundo dos humanos.\"\n\nO único parado ali é um homem vestindo um terno vermelho. Desde que ele está vestindo seu terno casualmente, ele não tem uma gravata e sua camisa é aberta até o peito. Parece que ele tem 20 e poucos anos. Ele é bonito, mas parece mais do tipo bad boy. Ele tem as mãos dentro dos bolsos.\n\nDe alguma forma, ele parece um hospedeiro. Mais como, ele é um demônio-hospedeiro? Seu rosto bonito meio que me irrita. Se Kiba é do tipo gentil, então esse cara é do tipo selvagem. O cara olha ao redor da sala, e então sorri depois de encontrar a Buchou.\n\n“Minha adorável Rias. Eu vim para te ver.”\n\n…… M-Minha adorável Rias? Esse cara, que tipo de relação ele tem com a Buchou?\n\nA Buchou está olhando para ele com os olhos meio fechados. Não\nparece que ela está recebendo esse cara. Mas o cara não parece se\nimportar e se aproxima da Buchou.\n\n“Agora, Rias. Vamos dar uma olhada no salão da cerimônia. A data da cerimônia é decidida, então precisamos verificar antes disso.”\n\nQue cara frívola ... De que família é esse demônio? Kiba disse que Phoenix mais cedo ...O cara agarra o braço da Buchou. Que cara rude!\n\n[[File:High school dxd 087.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n“...... Me solte, Raiser.”\n\nBuchou diz que com uma voz profunda e séria, enquanto agitando os caras. Uwah, a voz dela soa realmente assustadora ... Ela está muito chateada!\n\nO cara chamado Raiser não parece se importar em ter sua mão sacudida e está apenas sorrindo. De alguma forma, seu ligeiro movimento está me irritando. Estou começando a ficar puto.\n\nEu então digo isso para ele.\n\n\"Ei você. Você está sendo rude com a Buchou. Na verdade, o que há com essa atitude em relação a uma garota?\n\nEu disse claramente para ele. O cara olha para mim e começa a olhar para mim como se estivesse olhando para algum lixo. Esse bastardo está me irritando ainda mais!\n\n“Ah? Quem é Você?\"\n\nEle disse isso com uma voz descontente. É totalmente diferente da voz doce que ele tem em relação à Buchou. Nggh, ele está claramente olhando para mim. Eu posso sentir seu ódio por mim. Mas vou dizer o que tenho para fazer!\n\n“Eu sou o servo Diabo de Rias Gremory-sama! Eu sou o [peão], Hyoudou Issei. ”\n\nEu disse a ele! Eu até disse a ele meu nome! Como é esse demônio-hospedeiro?\n\n\"Hmm. Ah ok.\"\n\nESCORREGAR.\n\nEu escorreguei depois que ele fez uma reação aborrecida. Ugh… De alguma forma eu me sinto magoada com esse tipo de reação. Então você não se importa comigo. Isso esta certo?\n\n\"Quero dizer, quem diabos é você?\"\n\nO cara parece um pouco surpreso com a minha pergunta.\n\n“…… Oh? Rias, você não me mencionou aos seus servos? Quero dizer, tem caras que não me conhecem? Um diabo reencarnado? Mesmo assim.\"\n\n\"Eu não contei a eles porque não havia necessidade.\"\n\n“Oh meu, dura como sempre. Hahaha …… ”\n\nO cara começa a rir. Então Grayfia-san entra na discussão.\n\n\"Hyoudou Issei-sama.\"\n\n\"Sim.\"\n\n“Esta pessoa é Raiser Phoenix-sama. Ele é um demônio de alta pureza e o terceiro filho da Casa de Phoenix.”\n\nGrayfia-san explica-me sobre esse cara.\n\nSim, então ele é um demônio de alta classe da Casa de Phoenix. Então ele tem uma nobreza então. Phoenix não é uma criatura lendária que aparece nos livros e é considerada um pássaro de fogo ou um pássaro imortal…? Portanto, há coisas semelhantes entre os demônios. Então, como um cara assim se relaciona com a Buchou? Um amigo? Ou ele é um amigo de infância? Mas logo descobri a verdadeira razão que supera em muito minha previsão.\n\n“E ele é o marido da próxima herdeira da Casa dos Gremory.”\n\n…… Hm? HH-Marido ... A próxima herdeira …… ela está falando sobre a Buchou certo ……?\n\n\"Ele está noivo de Rias-ojousama.\"\n\n…………Hã? Nooooivo !?\n\n“Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh !!”\n\nEu gritei por causa da revelação chocante. Esse bastardo é o noivo de Rias-buchou.\n\n===Parte 4===\n\n\"O chá feito pela Rainha Rias é soberbo.\"\n\n\"Muito obrigado.\"\n\nO cara que elogia o chá da Akeno-san - Raiser. A Akeno-san também está sorrindo, mas ela não diz as costumeiras “Ara ara” e “Ufufu”. Eu me sinto um pouco assustado ...\n\nBuchou que está sentada no sofá. Raiser que descuidadamente sentou ao lado dela e está segurando seu ombro. A Buchou continua a sacudir as mãos, mas o filho da mãe continua tocando seus cabelos, mãos e ombros. Esse cara é muito perto dela!\n\nNós, seus servos, estamos sentados longe dos dois demônios de alta classe e só podemos olhar para eles.\n\nKu ...... Apenas olhando para ele me irrita! Ele continua tocando seu corpo! Se ele começar a tocar as pernas dela, eu vou mesmo pular nele! Eu também quero tocar as coxas dela também!\n\nAh, se eu pensar nisso, já conheço a sensação dos peitos da Buchou. Isso me deixa mais incrível desde que eu conheço a sensação desses seios antes mesmo dele que é seu noivo?\n\nFufufu, sim. Eu sou. Eu já vi seu corpo nu duas vezes. Fufufu Então é a minha vitória então? Nuhahaha!\n\n“U-Umm, Ise-san. Aconteceu alguma coisa boa?”\n\nAsia, que está ao meu lado, pergunta com uma expressão preocupada. Hã!? Eu fiz uma declaração de vitória em minha mente contra Raiser.\n\n\"...... pensamento indecente é proibido.\"\n\nKoneko-chan me dá suas palavras duras novamente. Ungh, essa garota tem algum poder que lhe permite ler minha mente?\n\n\"Ise-kun, em qualquer caso, você deve limpar sua baba.\"\n\nKiba me dá um lenço com um sorriso refrescante.\n\n\"N-não é da sua conta!\"\n\nTentei limpar minha baba com a manga, mas Asia limpa para mim com o lenço.\n\n\"É quase hora de comer lanches, então você babou pensando nisso, correto?\"\n\nUgh. Meu coração está doendo porque ela disse isso com um sorriso. Essa garota provavelmente não sabe que eu estava pensando em coisas ruins.\n\n\"Obrigado, Asia.\"\n\nSinto muito a Asia. Eu agradeci, enquanto pedia desculpas a ela em meu coração.\n\nEntão naquele momento—.\n\n\"Pára com isso!\"\n\nA voz irritada da Buchou ecoa pela sala.\n\nQuando eu olho, a Buchou se levanta do sofá e está olhando fixamente para Raiser. Raiser, por outro lado, está sorrindo como sempre.\n\n“Raiser! Eu te disse antes! Eu não vou casar com você!”\n\n“Sim, eu ouvi isso antes. Mas Rias, isso não vai fazer, sabe? Eu acho que a situação da sua casa é muito séria.”\n\n“Isso não é da sua conta! Se eu for a próxima herdeira da Casa dos Gremory, então escolherei quem se tornará meu marido! Meu pai, meu irmão e todos no clã estão correndo! Também foi uma promessa que serei livre até me formar na universidade do mundo humano! ”\n\n\"Está certo. Você basicamente será livre. Você pode ir para a faculdade e você pode fazer o que quiser com seus servos. Mas seu Otou-sama e Sirzechs-sama estão preocupados. Eles temem que sua família seja extinta. Perdemos um grande número de demônios de sangue puro na última guerra. Mesmo que a guerra tenha terminado, nossa rivalidade com os Anjos Caídos e Deus ainda não terminou. Não é raro que os sucessores do Diabo puro-sangue sejam mortos na inútil batalha contra eles, o que leva à extinção do lar. Assim, para um demônio de sangue puro que também é um demônio de alta classe, a união seria a solução óbvia para as forças dos demônios. Um diabo de alta pureza. Até você sabe que essas crianças serão importantes a partir de agora, certo?”\n\nBuchou e Raiser começam a discutir sobre algo que eu não entendo. Mas até um idiota como eu sabe que eles estão discutindo uma coisa importante sobre o mundo dos demônios.\n\nBuchou fica quieto quando Raiser começa um assunto sério. Embora seus olhos aguçados não tenham mudado. Raiser continua a falar depois de beber o chá.\n\n“Os recém-produzidos Devils—. Aqueles como seus servos, os demônios reencarnados, estão se expandindo em termos de força, mas isso faria de nós, os demônios de alta classe com histórico, perder nosso lugar. Há nobres antigos que se aproximam dos demônios reencarnados porque são muito poderosos. Bem, isso pode estar bem. Os recém-produzidos Devils também são importantes para o nosso futuro. Mas não podemos permitir que os demônios de sangue puro se extingam corretamente? Você e eu fomos escolhidos para evitar que os puros-sangues fossem extintos. Minha casa é segura porque tenho meus irmãos mais velhos. Mas há apenas dois irmãos em sua casa. E seu irmão é alguém que saiu de casa. Então só haveria você, Rias, que pode herdar a Casa dos Gremios. Se você não tomar um marido, a Casa dos Gremory será extinta em sua geração. Você está tentando esmagar a casa que continua por muito tempo? Por causa da guerra passada, não há nem a metade do número de demônios que foram referidos como \"72 pilares\". Este casamento tem o futuro dos demônios na linha.”\n\n...... Parece que a discussão está ficando séria ...\n\nOs \"72 pilares\", me disseram sobre isso de Kiba antes.\n\nHá muito tempo atrás, havia 72 diabos que tinham um pariato, e cada clã tinha dezenas de exércitos, mas a maioria deles morreu na guerra. O clã da Buchou é um dos mais importantes demônios de sangue puro que sobreviveram à guerra.\n\nEu fiquei chateado quando Raiser continuou dizendo noivado, mas ouvir a história toda faz parecer muito complicado. Demônios de sangue puro, em outras palavras, Buchou e Raiser. Um diabo puro. Isso significa que seus pais também são diabos de sangue puro. Um diabo real. Asia e eu seremos categorizados como demônios reencarnados.\n\nUma regra dos tempos antigos, hein. Então minha opinião não significa nada ...\n\nMas tudo bem. Eu apenas concordarei com a decisão da Buchou. Claro que é depois de ouvir seus verdadeiros sentimentos.\n\n“Eu não vou esmagar minha casa. E estou disposta a ter um marido.”\n\nOuvindo Buchou, Raiser faz um grande sorriso.\n\n“Oh, que se espera de Rias! Então vamos-\"\n\n“Mas eu não vou casar com você, Raiser. Eu vou casar com o que eu reconheço. Até mesmo os demônios da velha casa nobre têm o direito de escolher.\n\nBuchou fala sobre Raiser e diz isso claramente.\n\nOuvindo isso, Raiser de repente se torna desagradável. Seus olhos ficam mais afiados e ele até faz um barulho com a língua.\n\n“...... Você sabe, Rias. Eu também sou um demônio que leva o nome de House of Phoenix atrás de mim. Eu não posso deixar esse nome ficar manchado. Eu não queria nem chegar a um pequeno prédio antigo como este no mundo humano. Pelo contrário, não gosto muito do mundo humano. O fogo e o vento deste mundo são imundos. Para um diabo como eu, que domina o fogo e o vento, não aguento mais!”\n\nCHAMA!\n\nExistem chamas em volta de Raiser. Há pequenos pedaços de fogo ao redor da sala.\n\n\"Vou levá-lo de volta ao submundo, mesmo que eu tenha que queimar todos os seus servos.\"\n\nARREPIOS.\n\nSua hostilidade e intenção de matar enche a sala. A pressão do corpo de Raiser vem direto para mim, não para nós.\n\nEu sinto algo frio nas minhas costas, e parece que todo o cabelo do meu corpo está prestes a ficar. A intenção de matar dirigida por um Diabo de alta classe. Isto é mau! Minhas mãos e meu corpo estão tremendo. Asia abraça meu braço porque ela se assustou. Sim, a Asia não será capaz de suportar essa atmosfera. Eu sinto o desconforto como o tempo em que eu lutei com aquele Anjo Caído, não, é ainda pior. Kiba e Koneko-chan não estão tremendo, mas estão se preparando para lutar a qualquer momento.\n\nBuchou faz uma postura contra Raiser, e há uma aura vermelha saindo de seu corpo.\n\nRaiser também começa a cobrir seu corpo com fogo. Calor intenso enche a sala. Quente… Aquele fogo, é óbvio que nós seremos transformados em cinzas se formos atingidos por isso! Eu posso sentir a mesma força de poder demoníaco que a Buchou de suas chamas!\n\nA Buchou é mais forte que o Anjo Caído que eu venci ...... Se eu posso sentir a mesma força dele, isso significa que Raiser é um Diabo que é incrivelmente forte?\n\nA chama se agrupa nas costas de Raiser e se transforma em asas de fogo. Exatamente como um pássaro de fogo.\n\nA atmosfera é intensa. Mas há uma pessoa que interferiu com calma. -É Grayfia-san.\n\n“Ojou-sama, Raiser-sama, por favor, acalme-se. Se vocês dois continuarem, então não vou ficar quieto sobre isso. Para a honra do Sirzechs-sama, não vou me segurar.”\n\nBuchou e Raiser fazem uma cara séria depois de ouvir a voz calma e intensa de Grayfia-san. Parece que eles estão com medo dela. Raiser acalma as chamas ao redor de seu corpo e suspira enquanto balança a cabeça.\n\n“...... Para me dizer que pela Rainha Mais Forte, até eu ficaria com medo… Eu definitivamente não gostaria de lutar contra as pessoas do grupo de Sirzech-sama, que é conhecido por ser feito de monstros.”\n\nEntão o irmão da Buchou tem muito poder influente. Eu também não sabia que a Grayfia-san é tão forte assim. Eu nem sinto nenhuma intenção de matar vindo dela.\n\nBuchou também pára seu poder demoníaco vermelho e desmonta sua posição de batalha. Parece que evitamos o pior cenário possível. Vendo que tanto a Buchou quanto a Raiser não têm intenção de lutar, Grayfia-san fala.\n\n“Mestre, Sirzechs-sama e os da Casa de Phoenix sabiam que seria assim. Para dizer a verdade, esta seria a última reunião de discussão. Todos sabiam que isso não seria resolvido, então decidiram fazer um último recurso.”\n\n\"Último recurso? O que você quer dizer com Grayfia?”\n\n“Ojou-sama, se você quiser levar sua opinião adiante, então que tal você resolver isso em um [Rating Game] contra o Raiser-sama?”\n\n“…… !?”\n\nA Buchou fica sem fala ouvindo a Grayfia-san. Ela parece estar muito chocada.\n\n[Rating Game]? Eu acho que ouvi sobre isso antes ......\n\n\"É um jogo que é jogado pelos demônios com o peerage, e eles competem fazendo seus servos lutarem.\"\n\nKiba explica isso para mim porque eu tenho um olhar confuso.\n\nAcho que me lembro disso. É uma batalha entre os demônios, onde você usa seus servos, [peão], [cavaleiro], [bispo], [torre] e [rainha]. Ouvi dizer que a sua força no jogo reflete muito em sua posição social, entre outros demônios. Mas esse jogo não era apenas jogado por demônios idosos, e a Buchou, que não está na idade madura, não pode participar?\n\nGrayfia-san continua sua explicação e responde minhas perguntas.\n\n“Assim como você sabe, Ojou-sama, apenas os Devils maduros podem participar do [Rating Game] oficial. Mas se é um jogo não oficial entre os demônios de sangue puro, até mesmo demônios imaturos podem participar. No entanto, neste caso ...”\n\n\"Quando envolve problemas familiares e domésticos.\"\n\nA Buchou continua a falar enquanto suspirou.\n\n“Em outras palavras, Otou-sama e os outros decidiram ter um jogo como último recurso se eu fosse recusar, certo? … Até que ponto eles pretendem interferir na minha vida para se sentirem satisfeitos ...! ”\n\nA Buchou está realmente incomodada. Uwah ...... Eu posso sentir seu desejo de matar! Assustador……\n\n\"Então, Ojou-sama, você está dizendo que também recusaria participar do jogo?\"\n\n“Não, não vou, já que esta é uma chance. Tudo bem então. Vamos resolver isso com um jogo, Raiser.”\n\nRaiser sorri após as palavras provocativas da Buchou.\n\n“Hee, então você está aceitando. Eu não me importo. Mas eu já sou um Diabo maduro e já participei do jogo oficial. Agora eu ganhei a maioria dos jogos. Mesmo assim, você ainda quer jogar, Rias?”\n\nRaiser respondeu de volta com palavras ainda mais provocativas. Buchou envia de volta um sorriso destemido.\n\n\"Eu vou. Eu vou acabar com você, Raiser!”\n\n\"Bem. Se você vencer, faça o que quiser. Mas se eu ganhar, você se casará comigo imediatamente.”\n\nAmbos se encaram. Ambos estão olhando um para o outro com olhos assustadores. Oh, seus olhares são tão intensos que um demônio de classe baixa como eu não pode se intrometer!\n\n\"Entendido. Eu, Grayfia, confirmei a opinião de ambos os lados. Eu vou estar no comando do jogo entre as duas casas. Tudo bem?\"\n\n\"Sim.\"\n\n\"Sim.\"\n\nA Buchou e a Raiser concordam com a aprovação da Grayfia-san.\n\n\"Entendido. Vou informar as duas famílias então.”\n\nGrayfia-san inclina a cabeça depois de confirmar.\n\nUau, isso se transformou em uma situação séria! Jogos! Então eu estarei participando também! Raiser olha para mim e então sorri. Ele então faz um sorriso que me irrita.\n\n“Ei, Rias. Seriam os seus aqui seus servos?”\n\nBuchou contorce os olhos com as palavras dele.\n\n\"E daí?\"\n\nRaiser começa a rir depois que Buchou o responde como se ele achasse divertido.\n\n“Então esta partida será uma risada. Somente sua [Rainha], a \"Sacerdotisa do Trovão\" pode lutar com meus adoráveis servos.”\n\nDizendo isso, Raiser estalou os dedos e o círculo mágico no chão brilha. O círculo mágico tem o mesmo emblema de Phoenix que Raiser apareceu. Então as sombras aparecem do círculo mágico.\n\nUm, dois, tręs ... merda ...\n\nFiquei sem palavras depois de ver o número de sombras que aparecem no círculo mágico.\n\n\"Bem, estes são meus servos fofos.\"\n\nCerca de Raiser, que disse isso, 15 pessoas que parecem ser seus servos se reúnem em torno dele.\n\nHá uma pessoa na armadura que parece ser um [Cavaleiro]. Há também uma pessoa usando um capuz que parece ser um mágico.\n\nMembros de pleno direito! Assim como no xadrez real, você pode ter um número máximo de 15 demônios servos sob seu controle.\n\nParece que Devils de alta classe recebe 15 [Evil Pieces] do Maou. Você pode formar um relacionamento de mestre e servo, usando-o para aqueles que você quer fazer como seu servo.\n\nSe a pessoa que você deseja fazer seu servo tem alta capacidade potencial, então o consumo de xadrez pode ser dobrado.\n\nÉ por isso que há casos em que há apenas 1 [Torre] ou 1 [Cavaleiro].\n\nA Buchou também teve o mesmo incidente. Esse sou eu. Você pode pegar no máximo 8 [peões], mas a Buchou usou todas as 8 peças em mim porque há uma coisa extremamente diabólica dentro de mim.\n\nÉ por isso que existem demônios de alta classe que não têm 15 servos. Mas o Raiser tem o número máximo de 15 servidores.\n\nÉ uma vista magnífica para ver todos os 16 demônios, incluindo o [rei]. Nós só temos um de cada: [Rei], [Rainha], [Torre], [Bispo], [Cavaleiro] e [Peão]. Então, isso faz com que seja um 6 versus 16! Fiquei chocado com esse fato.\n\nNão me desculpe. Há outra coisa em minha mente. Quer dizer, não posso evitar! O que é isso!?\n\n- São todas garotas!\n\nO cavaleiro e o mago que eu mencionei anteriormente também são garotas! Uma garota usando um vestido chinês! Duas garotas com orelhas de animais! Duas garotas com cara idêntica que parece ser gêmeas! Uma garota loli! Duas garotas mais velhas com lindos corpos! Um Yamato Nadeshiko como garota usando um quimono! Há também uma garota usando um vestido que parece uma princesa europeia! Uma mulher mais velha com aparência selvagem que está carregando uma espada nas costas! Há também uma garota vestindo uma roupa de dançarina! Há também uma misteriosa mulher usando uma máscara que esconde metade do seu rosto!\n\nEles são todos mulher bonita ou meninas bonitas !! Um exército de beleza existe realmente!\n\nA eletricidade percorre meu corpo!\n\n…… Eu vejo, então é isso que é! Esse cara, Raiser, realmente fez isso! O sonho de todo cara, um harém! O Diabo de alta classe que transformou o harém em realidade! Raiser Phoenix! Que pessoa ... Que cara ...\n\n\"H-Ei, Rias ...... Este servo-kun aqui está chorando muito enquanto olha\npara mim.\"\n\nRaiser disse isso enquanto olhava para mim. Ele parece estar realmente assustado comigo.\n\nA Buchou coloca a mão na testa dela quando me vê.\n\n“O sonho deste menino é ter um harém. Acho que ele ficou comovido depois de olhar para seus criados.”\n\nSim, sim. Isso é exatamente certo. Estou chorando porque vi meu sonho, meu objetivo, bem na minha frente.\n\nAh, que cara de sorte. Eles são todas garotas.\n\n\"Gross ~\"\n\n\"Raiser-sama, essa pessoa está me enlouquecendo ~\".\n\nAs meninas do Raiser ficam com o rosto enojado enquanto olham para mim. Droga! Foda-se todos!\n\nRaiser os acalma enquanto acaricia seus corpos.\n\n“Não diga isso, minhas meninas fofas. Olhar para o fluxo superior é o que os humildes fazem. Vamos mostrar a eles como somos apaixonados.\n\nDizendo isso, Raiser começa a ter um beijo de língua com uma das garotas!\n\nUwah! Ele está fazendo barulho movendo sua língua ao redor! Buchou parece que ela não se importava.\n\n“Nn …… afu ……”\n\nA garota está fazendo uma voz doce enquanto coloca as pernas ao redor\nde Raiser! Ugh, também está afetando minha virilha!\n\n“Hauhauhauuu ……”\n\nAo meu lado, a Asia tem o rosto vermelho e seu cérebro explode. Essa\nvisão deve ser forte demais para a Asia.\n\nRaiser leva sua boca embora enquanto há um fio de saliva, e então\ncomeça a beijar outra garota! Não comece a segunda rodada aqui!\nQuero dizer, você pode realmente fazer esse tipo de coisa com seus\nservos! Então nós podemos! Merda! Então, se eu trabalhar duro, posso\nficar assim um dia!\n\nRaiser que terminou seu segundo beijo de língua sorri enquanto olha para mim.\n\n- Você nunca será capaz de fazer isso.\n\nEu sinto que esse bastardo está dizendo isso para mim.\n\n\"Você nunca será capaz de fazer isso.\"\n\n“Não diga o que eu acho que você estava dizendo! Droga! Sacred Gear!”\n\nEu tenho a cabeça cheia de raiva e sou super ciumento, então eu levanto minha mão para o alto e depois grito.\n\nEnquanto emite luzes vermelhas, a coisa que está possuída no meu braço esquerdo se mostra. Uma luva vermelha que tem uma marca de um dragão gravado nela, - [Boosted Gear]. É uma obra-prima chamada de Sacred Gear que dá enorme poder ao possuidor.\n\nEu aponto meu dedo para Raiser e depois digo a ele.\n\n\"Um mulherengo como você não é bom o suficiente para estar com a Buchou!\"\n\n\"Hã? Você não estava olhando para o chamado mulherengo?”\n\nUgh! Ele chegou no ponto!\n\n“Cale a boca! Isso é diferente com a coisa sobre a Buchou! Nesse ritmo, você continuará a flertar com outras garotas mesmo depois de se casar com a Buchou! ”\n\n“Heróis amam mulheres. Isso é um ditado no mundo humano, certo? Uma boa frase, de fato. Mas esta é apenas uma relação próxima com meus servos. Você também não está sendo adorado pela Rias?”\n\nT-isso é verdade ...... Mas de alguma forma eu não posso perdoá-lo! Um ódio para um tipo semelhante a mim? Ugggh, isso significa que eu ainda sou criança desde que estou ficando irritada quanto mais eu venho a conhecer?\n\n“Heroi teu cú! Você é apenas um cara de pássaro! Pássaro de fogo Phoenix? Hahaha! Isso é o mesmo que Yakitori! ” <ref>Um tipo de frango frito</ref>\n\nRaiser coloca uma expressão furiosa na minha provocação.\n\n“Yakitori! Vo-você demônio de classe baixa! Não fique à frente de você! Não é assim que você fala com um demônio de alta classe! Rias, o que está acontecendo com sua disciplina para com seus servos?”\n\nA Buchou apenas olha para o outro lado e diz: \"Como eu me importo\".\n\n“Hey cara de Yakitori! Eu vou acabar com você com o meu Boosted Gear! ”\n\nMeu Boosted Gear que eu tanto me orgulho! Ele dobra meu poder a cada 10 segundos, e depois de um tempo eu posso até derrotar um Deus!\n\n“Nós não precisamos de um jogo! Eu só vou levar você para baixo, aqui e agora! ”\n\n[Boost!!]\n\nO som veio da jóia localizada na manopla e, ao mesmo tempo, meu corpo transbordou de força! É a prova de que meu poder duplicou! Minha greve que até derrotou o Anjo Caído, prove com seu próprio corpo! Eu estava cheio de espíritos, mas Raiser apenas suspira.\n\n“Mira. Vá.\"\n\n\"Sim, Raiser-sama.\"\n\nRaiser dá uma ordem ao seu criado. Ela é pequena como a Koneko-chan e tem um rosto infantil.\n\nEla pega um bastão que os artistas marciais usam e faz uma postura de batalha depois de balançar seu bastão. Hmm, eu não sinto vontade de lutar com uma garota tão pequena, mas se eu derrubar ela, ela provavelmente vai recuar. Foi o que eu pensei, mas de repente meu corpo ficou mais leve. Parece que meu corpo está flutuando.\n\nHã? O chão é ...\n\nCRAAAAASH!\n\nUm barulho alto vem aos meus ouvidos.\n\n………… Ai …… A dor passa pelo meu corpo todo. ……O que aconteceu?\n\n\"Gahaa!\"\n\nEstou em agonia devido à dor no meu estômago. Ai ...... Meu estômago? Eu bati no meu estômago?\n\n\"Ise-san!\"\n\nAsia vem para o meu lado e ela coloca as mãos no meu estômago. Instantaneamente, uma luz verde envolve meu corpo. Um sentimento quente leva a dor no meu estômago.\n\nÉ o poder de cura que a Asia possui. É uma Sacred Gear que pode até curar diabos que nem sequer têm a proteção divina de Deus. No entanto, devido a isso, a Asia foi alvo de um anjo caído antes de ......Mais importante, o que aconteceu comigo? Eu sei que estou no chão. Quando olho em volta, há uma mesa quebrada ao meio e coisas espalhadas pelo chão.\n\nQuando olho em direção a Raiser, a garota que tem seu bastão apontado para a frente, afasta o bastão.\n\n...... Então eu fui atingido. Eu não consegui ver. Significa que recebi um dano sem perceber? Então fui atingido em direção à mesa…\n\nRaiser caminha em minha direção e diz isso aos meus ouvidos enquanto se agacha.\n\n\"Você é fraco.\"\n\n-! Essas palavras esculpem uma cicatriz profunda no meu coração.\n\n“Aquele com quem você acabou de lutar é meu [Peão] Mira. Ela é a mais fraca dos meus servos, mas ela tem mais experiência de batalha e tem mais talento como demônio do que você. Sacred Gear? Hã.”\n\nRaiser começa a bater na minha Sacred Gear e começa a rir com o nariz.\n\n“Esta é certamente um dos Sacred Gears invencíveis e perigosos. De como você o usa, não só eu, mas você também pode derrotar um Maou e Deus. Havia um grande número de possuidores que tinham isso antes. Mas não houve nenhum caso em que ele derrotou um deus ou maou. Você sabe o que isso significa?”\n\nRaiser então ri muito alto.\n\n“Isso significa que esta Sacred Gear é imperfeita, e os possuidores também eram um bando de fracos que não podiam usá-la! Você não é exceção! Como você diz isso no mundo humano de novo? … Sim, “Pérolas aos porcos”. Fuhahaha! Sim, pérolas aos porcos! É sobre você! [Peão] da Rias-kun!”\n\nRaiser começa a bater na minha cabeça enquanto ri tão alto.\n\n…………Droga! Fiquei tão mortificada que cerrei os dentes. Eu queria falar de volta, mas não posso. É a verdade que sou fraco. Eu até perdi para uma garota menor do que eu agora. Eu não podia nem ver o ataque dela. Estou desapontado comigo mesmo!\n\n\"Mas a partida seria interessante se você fosse se acostumar com isso.\"\n\nRaiser colocou a mão no queixo e parece que ele pensou em alguma coisa.\n\n“Rias, que tal uma partida em 10 dias? Nós poderíamos fazer isso agora, mas isso não seria interessante.”\n\n\"...... Você está me dando uma desvantagem.\"\n\n“Você é contra isso? Isso é humilhante? [Rating Game] não é algo simples que você pode ganhar apenas com seus sentimentos. Se você não pode usar o poder do seu servo ao máximo, você perderá imediatamente. Então não é estranho você treinar com seus servos para o seu primeiro [Rating Game]. Eu vi demônios que perderam sem usar seu poder ao máximo inúmeras vezes, não importando quão grande fosse seu potencial e poder. ”\n\nA Buchou não se queixa e ouve em voz baixa o que Raiser disse. Quando Raiser direciona a palma da mão para o chão, o círculo mágico começa a brilhar.\n\n“—10 dias. Se é você, então você deve ser capaz de melhorar seus servos ”.\n\nEle então olha para mim.\n\n“Não seja uma desgraça para Rias, [Peão] da Rias. Seu golpe é o golpe de Rias.”\n\n-!\n\nEu entendi imediatamente que suas palavras carregam sua preocupação em relação à Buchou.\n\n\"Rias, a próxima vez que nos encontrarmos será no jogo.\"\n\nDizendo isso, Raiser desaparece à luz do círculo mágico junto com seus servos.\n\n\n===Parte 5===\n\n\"……Merda.\"\n\nEu estava desesperada em manter minha raiva e arrependimento dentro de mim mesmo deitada na minha cama.\n\nDepois disso, a atividade do clube; O trabalho do diabo foi cancelado. A Buchou entrou no prédio da velha escola junto com a Akeno-san. Parece que eles estão tendo uma reunião de estratégia. Parece que eles estão fazendo estratégias para o [Rating Game]. Este será o primeiro jogo da Buchou. Claro que ela quer cancelar a atividade do clube para construir uma estratégia.\n\n―Em 10 dias.\n\nIsso é cedo demais. Eu me pergunto se podemos reunir os fatores necessários para derrotar Raiser e seus servos dentro desse tempo. Bem, isso não mudará muito se um [Peão] como eu disser isso. Mais do que isso, eu me exibi na frente da Buchou e provoquei o Raiser apenas para ser abatido por uma garotinha…\n\nUwaaaaah! Basta lembrar que me faz querer morrer por causa do constrangimento e arrependimento que eu tenho!\n\n……Suspiro. Estou tão fraco.\n\nEu então olho para o meu braço esquerdo. O poder absoluto que está possuído aqui. [Boosted Gear], que aumenta o poder para sem limites. Mas tem muitos pontos fracos. Sou eu quem é vulnerável.\n\nEm outras palavras, “Pérolas aos porcos”. Assim como Raiser disse.\n\nMerda! Estou tão fraco……\n\nRei do harém. Meu sonho. O demônio que conseguiu fazer um harém. Raiser. Qual a diferença entre nós?\n\n\"Ah, merda!\"\n\nEu me levantei da cama e comecei a bagunçar meu cabelo.\n\nA Buchou disse que ainda não queria se casar. Ela disse que não queria se casar se seu marido fosse Raiser. Ela escolheu lutar contra Raiser para romper o noivado.\n\nEu não sei muito sobre sua família e relação entre os problemas de demônios de classe alta porque é muito complicado, mas eu só vou lutar pelo amor da Buchou!\n\nEu tenho uma dívida de gratidão para com a Buchou. Muito de fato. Eu quero lutar pela Buchou. Eu preciso apoiar a Buchou!\n\nOK! A partir de amanhã de manhã, voltarei a treinar novamente! Mais como treinar o dia todo!\n\nEu posso pular a escola se eu disser à Buchou. Eu vou passar meus próximos 10 dias em treinamento.\n\nEu entrarei em contato com o Kiba para aprender como usar espadas. Eu vou perguntar a Akeno-san como usar poderes demoníacos também. Eu vou aprender combate próximo da Koneko-chan! Sim! Eu decidi! Minha decisão é tomada! Eu treinarei pelos próximos 10 dias!\n\nComecei a me sentir um pouco à vontade depois de tomar minha decisão. Hmm, eu vou tomar um banho agora.\n\nDesci e me preparei para tomar um banho. Fui para dentro do banheiro enquanto me senti excitado e tirei a roupa rapidamente. Depois que eu tomar banho, falarei com a Asia sobre o amanhã.\n\nABERTO.\n\nIsso acontece quando eu abro a porta.\n\n\"Ah ......\"\n\n\"O que……\"\n\nAsia e eu nos encontramos dentro do banheiro. Eu estou nu — e vejo a Asia nua - !!\n\nA beleza de cabelos loiros está totalmente nua na minha frente! Que sorte! Não não não, quero dizer acidente! Ela estava dentro! Desde que eu estava pensando em muitas coisas, eu esqueci de verificar se alguém está dentro!\n\nO corpo da Asia está molhado porque ela estava tomando banho. Seu cabelo loiro molhado de água quente é colado em sua pele branca e macia. Eu sou sexy.\n\nMais do que isso, você tem boas proporções…… Asia …… Seus quadris apertados. Sua pequena nádega é tão linda, droga! Suas coxas não são muito magras nem muito gordas, apenas do tamanho certo para mim.\n\nSe eu ver essas coxas quando ela usar uma saia, eu vou estar de joelhos.\n\nE seus peitos que você não pode saber quando ela usa suas roupas. Não é pequeno e não é tão ruim assim!\n\nAsia ...... Eu estou feliz que você tenha crescido tanto ...... Não, não é hora de ser emocional! Por que diabos eu estou olhando para o corpo dela?\n\nMerda! Por que eu não tenho um scouter de três tamanhos! Esta é a segunda vez que me arrependo!\n\nDa próxima vez eu vou seriamente pedir a Motohama que me ensine essa habilidade! Esse é o poder supremo! Não é mais impressionante que minha Sacred Gear !?\n\nNão é isso! Eu não deveria estar olhando para ela mais! Eu preciso protegê-la! Eu preciso ter certeza de que ela possa viver em segurança! Isso é o que eu prometi a mim mesmo! E ainda assim fiquei animada ao olhar para o corpo nu dela—\n\n…………\nC-CRAP— !!\n\nSe eu olhar com cuidado, o olhar da Asia está se movendo em direção à\nminha virilha.\n\n-Não!\n\nAsia! É muito cedo para você olhar.\n\n\n“…………”\n\nEu estava atrasado cobrindo meu parceiro.\n\n\"Kyaaa!\"\n\nE quem gritou sou eu.\n\nO que eu estou fazendo!? Eu acidentalmente gritei! Quero dizer, é constrangedor ter meu parceiro exposto a uma garota!\n\n\"-Ah\"\n\nTodo o corpo da Asia começa a ficar realmente vermelho e ela desvia o\nolhar.\n\nEi, ei, não esqueça de esconder suas partes íntimas, Asia! Eu posso ver tudo! Minha coisa é tão surpreendente que você esqueceu de esconder suas partes íntimas?\n\nPensando com cuidado, esta será sua primeira vez vendo a coisa de um cara desde que ela era uma irmã. A palavra surpreendente nem sequer descreve como ela está se sentindo agora. Na pior das hipóteses, pode se tornar um trauma para ela. Oh meu, o que eu fiz para essa pobre criança!\n\n“Des-desculpe! Eu vou sair agora!”\n\nEu me virei no local para poder sair do banheiro. Contudo - Asia agarra meu pulso como se ela estivesse tentando me impedir de sair.\n\nO que está acontecendo, Asia-chan!\n\n“………… Eu sinto muito. Foi …… minha primeira vez vendo um menino…… desculpe …… ”\n\nEu não pude ouvir o que ela disse porque ela disse isso enquanto murmurava. Não se force.\n\n\"N-Não, me desculpe também ... Eu entrei sem checar ... Eu sinto muito, eu vi muito do seu ...\"\n\nEu me desculpei também. Eu sou o culpado aqui. Entrei sem verificar quem estava dentro da banheira. Eu deveria ter verificado, mesmo que não estivesse trancado. Afinal, nós temos um novo membro da família. Mas salvei a imagem do corpo nu da Asia em minha memória. Perdoe-me se eu começar a lembrar disso depois.\n\n\"Não, eu entendo ...... Todo mundo me falou sobre a regra quando você toma banho no Japão, então eu estou bem ...\"\n\nAsia diz isso timidamente.\n\nHã? S-ela foi dito? Regra? Regra japonesa para o quê?\n\n“No Japão, ouvi dizer que existe uma coisa chamada tomar banho juntos... Que você se conhece tomando banho juntos ...”\n\n- !!\n\nQue-quem foi !? Quem contou à Asia este maravilhoso …… não! Quem disse à Asia essa informação estranha?\n\nNão, isso não é um erro. Certamente há uma coisa assim no Japão. Mas isso é apenas entre os mesmos gêneros!\n\nA Asia continua enquanto suas bochechas ficam vermelhas.\n\n\"...... Me foi dito ...... para fazer isso com alguém que eu quero formar uma relação especial com ...... Eu não me importo se o seu Ise-san ...... não, eu quero aprofundar a minha relação com o Ise-san ainda mais ... … É por isso que você vai tomar um banho comigo…?”\n\nSANGRAMENTO NASAL!\n\nTanto sangue sai do meu nariz. Ultimamente tem acontecido muito!…………Esperar. Vai ser perigoso se ficar assim por mais tempo, Asia. Eu também sou um cara. Eu vou me perder se eu ouvir uma palavra mágica como essa! Essa garota não sabe o que vai acontecer comigo se eu soubesse.\n\nQuer dizer, a Asia acredita em mim do fundo do coração dela. Se eu me tornar um lobo e a empurrar para baixo.\n\nNãããããããããooooooooooo !!\n\nEu não posso fazer isso! Não, eu quero! Mas eu não posso! Quero dizer, é essa garota! Parece que ela vai me perdoar, mesmo que eu faça ela!\n\nEu não posso fazer algo assim para alguém inocente como ela!\n\nDrooooooooooga!\n\nEsta é a situação que eu desejava! Foi parado pouco antes das coisas boas com a Buchou! Isso é vingança! Eu sei disso! Mas por que me sinto tão culpado quando é com a Asia?\n\nEmpurrar ela pra baixo é fácil. Eu posso fazer isso agora com esse fluxo e ter uma sensação de prazer.\n\nMas o problema é depois disso. Eu sei que vou me arrepender muito. Eu provavelmente não vou me perdoar pelo resto da minha vida. Não será um problema se isso acontecer depois que construirmos esse tipo de relacionamento, mas a Asia e eu ainda não estamos nesse tipo de relacionamento!\n\nDa última vez com a Buchou, eu fui junto com o fluxo, mas agora eu tenho que me controlar!\n\nSimplesmente ter um relacionamento físico vai nos machucar! Eu preciso proteger a Asia! Eu não posso me perder! Eu tenho que suportar isso! Eu me virei para a Asia depois de tomar uma decisão. Eu agarro seus ombros e, em seguida, abro minha boca.\n\nMas a pele da Asia é muuuuito!\n\n\"Asia! Ouça com atenção, vou falar sobre tomar banho juntos! Mais importante, desde que você é uma garota, se um cara entra no banheiro, então você tem que se certificar de que você defenda ...\"\n\nEu mantive minha ambição dentro de mim desesperadamente enquanto estava confuso. Eu preciso dizer a ela a ação que ela deve tomar quando encontrar um cara no banheiro.\n\nPORTA ABRE.\n\nA porta se abre de repente.\n\n“Asia-chan. Vou deixar a toalha aqui ...”\n\nMinha “Okaa-sama” aparece.\n\nParece que ela está tentando colocar a toalha em cima da máquina de lavar, mas ela congelou sua postura depois de ver a mim e a Asia juntas.…… Puta merda. Eu não posso fazer nenhuma desculpa, já que não temos nossas roupas!\n\nNão importa como você olhe para nós, só parecemos um cara e uma garota que está tentando fazer sexo!\n\nMamãe sai do banheiro enquanto se move como um robô. Então minha mãe grita.\n\n“O-Otou-san ~! Nós vamos ter um neto ~!”\n\nSaí do banheiro enquanto estava nu. Eu usei minhas duas mãos para esconder meu rosto. Há uma coisa que eu estava pensando enquanto estou correndo em direção ao meu quarto.\n\nAlguém, por favor me mate!\n\n\n===Parte 6===\n\nA manhã seguinte.\n\nEu chamei Asia para o meu quarto. Estamos sentados em frente um do outro em uma postura seiza. <ref>Postura japonesa onde o indivíduo senta sobre os calcanhares</ref>\n\n“Escute, Asia-san.”\n\n\"Sim, Ise-san.\"\n\n“Os caras são lobos. Você será comido se abordá-los descuidadamente.”\n\n“… Homens são lobisomens? Isso é assustador …… Eu com certeza não poderei andar fora durante a lua cheia, então ..... ”\n\nAsia leva o que eu disse seriamente. Eu estou com dor de cabeça. … Cara, eu estou seriamente ficando com dor de cabeça.\n\nNo dia seguinte ao incidente do banheiro, comecei a dar uma palestra para a Asia sobre como os caras são perigosos.\n\nEssa garota é muito indefesa. Bem, não é como se Asia tivesse uma vida normal, então não pode ser ajudado se ela for um pouco diferente. Mas, eu tenho que dizer a ela como os caras da minha idade são perigosos, e que garotas como ela que não são cuidadosas se tornarão suas presas facilmente. Se eu não fizer isso, ela não poderá ter uma vida escolar segura.\n\nBem, se há caras como aquele que se aproxima da Asia, eu vou acabar com eles. Não, isso não será suficiente. Preciso ensiná-la como sua pureza é algo muito importante para ela.\n\nNo entanto, não deveriam ser garotas ensinando essas coisas para outras garotas…?\n\nA propósito, depois desse incidente, meus pais foram a uma loja de descontos que fica aberta até à noite. Eles compraram roupas de bebê e brinquedos de bebê enquanto colocavam um grande sorriso. Não importa o quanto eu expliquei para eles, eles simplesmente disseram coisas como: “Não se preocupe, eu sei sobre isso. O casamento de espingarda é aceito hoje em dia. Ah, eu tenho certeza que gostaria de uma menina para meu primeiro neto! ”, Ou,“ Então eu vou me tornar um avô …… Se for um menino, então eu tenho que comprar para ele uma nova serpentina de carpa. Parece que minha família se tornou \"internacional\" agora. Talvez eu deva aprender a falar inglês. É inútil. Minha família é inútil.\n\nAgora, voltando para a parte onde os caras são perigosos. Eu digo isso para a Asia novamente.\n\n“Não é isso, Asia. Garotos têm mais ou menos a minha idade… caras adolescentes estão muito interessados em garotas. Não é exagero se eu dissesse que eles estão sempre pensando em garotas. Na verdade, pensamos em coisas ruins a cada segundo. Se houver dias em que vemos uma calcinha, então será um dia para celebrar para nós. A propósito, a calcinha é um fenômeno em que temos um vislumbre da calcinha da menina por baixo da saia. ”\n\n\"Você também pensa em coisas ruins, Ise-san?\"\n\n\"Sim claro. Eu também sou pervertido. Você sabe disso muito bem, certo, Asia?”\n\n\"Sim.\"\n\nAsia respondeu com um sorriso. Há uma rachadura no meu coração do seu sorriso despreocupado. Eu vejo, então ela sabe que eu sou pervertido.\n\n“Sim, eu sou pervertido. Caras assim são realmente assustadores. É por isso que caras assim arrastam garotas puras como você para um lugar escuro e fazem algo muito ruim ”.\n\n\"Algo muito ruim?\"\n\nAsia inclina a cabeça adoravelmente. Cara, cada uma de suas ações é muito fofa.\n\n“Eles tocam seu corpo! Então eles tocam seu corpo novamente! Então, novamente, eles tocam seu corpo! Em outras palavras, eles fazem ações indecentes em relação às meninas! É perigoso, certo? Assustador, certo?”\n\n“Sim, estou com medo. Mas se eu estiver em perigo, o Ise-san virá e me salvará.”\n\nAsia sorri e me responde como se ela realmente quisesse dizer isso.\n\n- Meus olhos estão ficando quentes. Como eu pensei, ela realmente acredita em mim. Estou emocionalmente comovido. Não não. Estou saindo do assunto. Não é hora de ser emotivo. Eu continuei depois de fazer uma tosse.\n\n“Mas a Asia, você tem que aumentar sua consciência como uma menina. Estou com muito medo porque você não duvida de outras pessoas.”\n\n\"Você está com medo, Ise-san?\"\n\n\"Sim eu sou. Se alguns caras fizerem algo para você quando eu não estiver olhando, então eu posso matar esses caras. Estou tão preocupado com você, Asia.”\n\nEu disse a ela séria e sinceramente. A Asia também me escuta seriamente, já que estou com uma cara séria. O que eu disse a ela é o meu sentimento real. Se alguém alguma vez engana e fere a Asia, então não vou me segurar, mesmo que essa pessoa seja humana. Eu sou um diabo Eu também possuo uma Sacred Gear insana. Mesmo que eu seja muito superior a um humano, não vou segurar minha raiva.\n\nMesmo que a Buchou tente me matar, eu ainda vou acabar com aquele cara. É assim que a Asia é importante para mim. É porque ela é uma garota? Isso é parte disso. Porque eu gosto dela? Essa também é a parte disso.\n\nMas mais do que isso, mudei sua vida drasticamente. Eu mudei sua vida que ela poderia ter terminado como uma irmã para uma vida que é o oposto disso. Eu a fiz em um diabo por causa da minha própria justiça. Não, meu egoísmo. Naquela época, essa pode ter sido a melhor solução. No entanto eu ......\n\nBuchou não está me culpando desde que ela me disse: \"Eu queria fazêla em meu servo, então você não precisa se preocupar com isso, Ise\". Mas isso não será suficiente. Eu preciso cuidar dela para que ela possa viver em paz. Para o resto da minha vida, isso é.\n\nEu, Hyoudou Issei, preciso proteger a Asia Argento pelo resto da minha vida. Obviamente, eu também protegerei a Buchou, mas proteger a Asia pode ser semelhante, embora um pouco diferente. Sim, preciso pensar nisso com cuidado de novo.\n\n\"Protegendo a Buchou\". Eu gosto da Buchou quando menina, mas eu quero protegê-la desde que eu também a admiro. É semelhante a como um samurai serve seu mestre.\n\nVocê pode dizer que é um sentimento semelhante de um subordinado de uma pessoa que está com o objetivo de alcançar o topo. “Protegendo a Asia”. Eu gosto da Asia como uma menina. No entanto, acho que é mais como um irmão quer proteger sua adorável irmãzinha. É por isso que estou perseguindo caras que estão tentando chegar perto da Asia.\n\nBem, desde que eu não tenho uma irmã, eu não sei se é semelhante ou não.\n\nExceto, eu também quero que a Asia fique mais forte também. Então eu posso ter um estilo de vida onde eu sempre possa rir com ela.\n\n\"Compreendo. Eu definitivamente não faria nada que pudesse incomodar você, Ise-san. É por isso que, por favor, me ensine mais.”\n\n\"Sim, eu sei. Mas eu acho que é melhor ser ensinado por uma garota do que uma pessoa do sexo oposto como eu. Eu também falarei com a Buchou e a Akeno-san, então, acostume-se ao estilo de vida atual pouco a pouco. ”\n\n\"Sim.\"\n\nUfa Eu suspiro.\n\nParece que vai funcionar. De qualquer forma, vou falar com as garotas do Occult Research Club assim que eu chegar na escola. Obviamente, vou contar a eles enquanto escondo o fato do incidente do banheiro.\n\nEntão Asia me faz uma pergunta.\n\n\"U-Umm ...... Ise-san, há uma pergunta que eu quero fazer a você.\"\n\nAsia ficou tímida e seu rosto ficou vermelho. O que é isso? Tão abruptamente.\n\n\"Eu-se o incidente com o banho ... aconteceu com a Buchou-san em vez de mim ... você teria tomado um banho com ela ...?\"\n\nO que……\n\nFiquei sem palavras diante de uma pergunta que não esperava ouvir. Eu nunca esperei que a Asia me fizesse uma pergunta como esta. Mas a Asia tem um rosto sério, apesar de seu rosto estar vermelho.\n\nHã? Hã? Por que ela me fez uma pergunta como essa? Eu não entendo. Por que a Buchou entrou no assunto? No entanto, mesmo que a Buchou estivesse nessa cena, ela disse a mesma coisa que a Asia fez ...\n\n“Ise, venha até aqui. Eu lavarei suas costas. Ufufu, você está se sentindo nervoso? Está tudo bem, você é meu servo bonito para que você possa deixar tudo para mim. ”\n\nOs dedos brancos e finos da Buchou tocam minhas costas. Eu comecei a ficar animado.\n\n“Aqui, vire-se. Ara? Ufufu Mesmo que você esteja se sentindo nervoso, isso aqui é ser tão honesto. É como você, Ise.”\n\nA mão de Buchou chega entre as minhas pernas e depois ...\n…………\n\nHã!? Oh merda, eu estava imaginando algo ruim. Ah! Há sangue saindo do meu nariz!\n\nMas se a Buchou disse isso para mim, eu não sei o que fazer!\n\n\"Posso lavar seus peitos, Buchou !?\"\n\nPosso perguntar-lhe isso sem sentir medo. Eu também posso imaginar a Buchou me permitindo tocá-la enquanto sorrindo. Droga! Só essa imaginação seria suficiente para usá-lo para esse tipo de coisa!\n\nEu olho para a Asia e seus olhos estão cheios de lágrimas.\n\n“Então é isso, não é? Então tudo bem se for a Buchou-san? Sob… está tudo bem. Eu sei. Eu sabia disso. Eu já sabia disso. Mas ainda assim, (soluço) ...”\n\nEla está chorando! Asia está chorando! Por quê!? Como!? Eu começo a entrar em pânico depois de vê-la.\n\n\"Nossa, o que vocês estão fazendo, no início da manhã?\"\n\nUma voz familiar. Quando me viro, Buchou está suspirando enquanto oscila seu cabelo vermelho.\n\n\"B-Buchou\"\n\n“A desavença de um amante pela manhã? Vocês dois são tão próximos como sempre.”\n\n\"N-não, iii-isto é!\"\n\n“Depressa, vamos embora. Prepare-se para hospedagem.”\n\nIr? Onde? Espere, hospedagem! Buchou me responde com um sorriso.\n\n\"Vamos para a montanha para treinar.\"\n\n===Parte 7===\n\n\"Hee-hee ......\"\n\nEstou inalando muito ar enquanto carrego um número maluco de malas.\n\n\"Yahoo!\"\n\n[Yahoo!]\n\nEu posso ouvir o eco de alguém. Porra, deve ser um andarilho na montanha. Eles com certeza estão se divertindo.\n\nAgora estou nas montanhas. Nós fomos trazidos aqui por Buchou, depois que ela disse que nós íamos treinar.\n\nA Buchou, que de repente veio a minha casa esta manhã, fez com que eu e Asia embalássemos nossas coisas. Os outros membros já estavam reunidos e chegamos aqui nos teleportando do círculo mágico. O tempo está tão bom que o céu está limpo. Os arredores estão cheios de árvores e você pode ouvir os gritos dos pássaros. Em termos de ver a montanha, é incrível.\n\nMas o problema é esse declive. Cada passo que eu dou drena minha resistência. E muito do meu suor cai no chão.\n\n“Depressa, Ise. Rápido.\"\n\nBuchou, que está bem à minha frente, me incentiva. Ao lado da Buchou está a Asia. Ela está olhando para mim com uma expressão preocupada.\n\n\"...... eu vou ajudar também.\"\n\n\"Está tudo bem, já que Ise não será capaz de ficar mais forte se ele não puder fazer isso.\"\n\nEu posso ouvir os dois conversando. Obrigado Asia. E Buchou, você é\ncruel como sempre.\n\n...... Mais importante, carregar essa bagagem é impossível. Buchou, eles são muito pesados ...\n\nEu tenho um enorme pedaço de bagagem nas minhas costas. Eu também tenho outras bolsas nos meus ombros. São minhas malas e as malas da Buchou. Eu também tenho a bolsa da Akeno-san também. Aparentemente isso também faz parte do treinamento. Acho que vou morrer antes de chegar ao destino. O que tem dentro dessa bagagem?\n\n“Buchou, juntei algumas ervas. Vamos usá-lo para a refeição hoje à\nnoite.”\n\nKiba diz que enquanto caminhava me passa com uma expressão legal. Ele também está carregando uma enorme bagagem nas costas. Eu perdi minhas palavras quando o vi subir as montanhas sem qualquer dificuldade.\n\nEle tem bastante energia, pois também foi buscar algumas ervas durante o caminho até aqui.\n\n\"……Até logo.\"\n\nEntão Koneko-chan, que carrega mais bagagem do que eu, passa por mim! Guha! Garota super-humana mostra seu talento! Porra, eu não posso perder para eles!\n\n\"Uoryaaaaaa!\"\n\nEu subi a montanha a pleno vapor! Haahaaha! Merda eu vou morrer! Eu vou morrer seriamente! Enquanto repetimos algo assim várias e várias vezes, chegamos à\nmansão.\n\n===Parte 8===\n\nEsta mansão feita de madeira pertence ao Clã Gremory. Normalmente ela fica oculta, misturando-se com o cenário dos humanos, usando poderes demoníacos, mas foi revelada para pudéssemos usar. Eu posso sentir o cheiro de madeira ao entrar. Fui até a sala para guardar as malas e dormi no chão após beber um copo d'água. As garotas subiram para vestir uma roupa mais flexível.\n\n[[File:High school dxd 119.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n\"Eu também vou me trocar.\"\n\nKiba foi para um quarto no primeiro andar carregando uma camisa azul.\n\n\"Não espie.\"\n\nKiba diz algo estranho.\n\n\"Eu vou te dar um soco, sério, seu filho da puta!\"\n\nEu não tinha forças para ficar de pé, então eu olhei pra ele com os olhos cheios de ódio.\n\nNossa, se as meninas da nossa escola nos virem, vai ser um alvoroço e tanto. Já é ruim que o suposto par yaoi de “Eu x Kiba” e “Kiba x Eu” está ficando popular ultimamente.\n\nPopularizou-se porque era parecido com a “Bela e a Fera”. Eu não sei o que passa na cabeça dessas pessoas. Espere, isso significa que eu sou a fera. Isso é imperdoável. \n\nEu me troquei na sala vazia depois que descansei um pouco, e parte de minha resistência voltou também. Até mesmo o quarto vazio vem com cama e o necessário para o dia-a-dia. Mas não vem com uma televisão.\n\nAo terminei de me trocar, todos já estavam reunidos na sala de estar. Buchou, que está vestindo uma camisa vermelha, sorri e diz após me ver.\n\n\"Agora, vamos começar nosso treinamento.\"\n"

          "content": "==Vida.3 Eu começo meu treinamento==\n\n===Parte 1===\n\nLição 1: Treinamento de espada com o Kiba\n\n\"Yo, ha.\"\n\n“Orya! Oryaaa!”\n\nEu estava treinando com Kiba e desci o bokuto para ele.\n\nKiba evita meu ataque sem problemas. Não importa quanta força eu aplique aos meus balanços, não parece que vai acertar o Kiba.\n\nBASH!\n\nKiba bateu meu bokuto novamente.\n\n\"Não é isso. Não olhe apenas para os movimentos da espada do oponente, mas também amplie sua linha de visão para que você possa pagar para ver tanto o oponente quanto o ambiente. ”\n\nNão é tão simples como ele diz, então quanto mais eu pratico com Kiba, mais percebo a diferença de força entre nós.\n\nComo eu pensei, já que ele é um [Cavaleiro], as técnicas de Kiba são impressionantes. Ele me bateu com movimentos mínimos. Ele pratica há mais tempo, tem mais experiência de batalha e, mais do que isso, seu talento em usar uma espada é muito melhor do que eu.\n\n“Ainda não terminamos. Aqui vou eu!\"\n\nEu percebi mais uma vez neste dia sobre como a técnica de espada de Kiba é incrível.\n\nLição 2: Treinamento de poder demoníaco com a Akeno-san\n\n\"Não é isso. Você reúne o poder demoníaco ao derivar a aura que cobre todo o seu corpo. Você tem que se concentrar e sentir a onda de poder demoníaco.\"\n\nEu não posso nem mesmo colocar poder demoníaco na minha mão, mesmo que a Akeno-san que está vestindo uma camisa preta seja a que ensina completamente.\n\nGunnnn ...... Concentre-se! Eu preciso me concentrar muito! Eu tenho que reunir o poder demoníaco em minha mão enquanto imagino criar algo!\n\n\"Eu fiz isso!\"\n\nA Asia que veste uma camisa branca reuniu uma massa de poder demoníaco em suas mãos. Um poder demoníaco colorido verde claro.\n\nEntão, o poder demoníaco da Asia é verde. É lindo.\n\n“Ara ara. Então a Asia-chan tem talento em usar poderes demoníacos depois de tudo. ”\n\nAs bochechas da Asia ficaram vermelhas depois que a Akeno-san a elogiou.\n\nNgh ...... eu, por outro lado, é o oposto completo. Mesmo a letra \"D\" para poder demoníaco não apareceu. De alguma forma, eu criei uma esfera realmente pequena de poder demoníaco, mas não é grande como a da Asia, que tem o tamanho de uma bola de futebol, em vez disso, tem o tamanho de um arroz.\n\n............ Bem, se a Asia puder ficar mais forte, tudo bem. Eu tenho a Sacred Gear definitiva! Hahaha!\n\n“Agora vamos mudar esses poderes demoníacos em fogo, água e raios. Você pode fazer isso imaginando que, no entanto, será mais fácil para os iniciantes moverem fogo e água usando seu poder demoníaco ”.\n\nAkeno-san envia seu poder demoníaco para a água dentro da garrafa de água.\n\nESPIGÃO!\n\nA água que recebeu o poder demoníaco se formou em forma de espigão e arrancou a garrafa de água do interior. Wow isso é incrível.\n\n“Asia-chan, eu quero que você copie o que eu fiz em seguida. Ise-kun, quero que você continue concentrando seus poderes demoníacos. A fonte do poder demoníaco é a imaginação. De qualquer forma, é importante materializar o que você imaginou. ”\n\nHmm. Imaginando, huh. Para materializar o que você imagina na sua cabeça ......\n\n\"Pode ser mais fácil materializar o que você é bom e o que você sempre imagina mais rapidamente.\"\n\nÉ o que você diz, Akeno-san. Não é como eu--\n\nHmm? Eu vejo, algo que eu sou bom e algo que eu sempre penso sobre... huh. Ah, então isso significa que a minha ideia selvagem também é possível?\n\n\"Akeno-san, você tem um minuto?\"\n\nSe eu posso fazer algo que eu sempre penso em realidade ......Então eu posso me tornar invencível! Uau, isso é demais! Até eu acho que essa ideia é ótima!\n\nDepois que a Akeno-san fica em branco, ela sorri para mim dizendo:\n\n\"Ufufu, com certeza é algo que você inventaria, Ise-kun\".\n\nOh! Então isso pode ser possível então?\n\nA Akeno-san voltou para a mansão. Ela traz algo e coloca na minha frente.\n\n- Ela trouxe um monte de cebolas, cenouras e batatas. Eles são os ingredientes para o curry.\n\n“Agora, Ise-kun. Durante a nossa estadia aqui, quero que você tire tudo isso com seu poder demoníaco.”\n\nAh, entendi. Eu entendo o que a Akeno-san está tentando dizer e o que ela quer que eu faça.\n\nParece que será uma estrada esburacada pela frente.\n\nLição 3: Sparring com a Koneko-chan\n\n\"Nugagaaaaaa.\"\n\nBANG!\n\nGufu! Hoje consegui ser empurrado para uma grande árvore pela décima vez. Não, não é isso.\n\nEu fiquei impressionado com o soco da Koneko-chan mais uma vez! Ku! Estou frustrado!\n\n\"......Fraco.\"\n\nUma garota loli que está vestindo uma camisa amarela me dá palavras duras.\n\nMerda, estou tão chocada! Eu senti isso com o incidente com Raiser, mas ser espancado por uma menina pequena é uma experiência bastante chocante para mim.\n\nKoneko-chan é uma garota do Diabo que é boa em fazer jogadas de arremesso, arremessar movimentos e outros tipos de artes marciais. Ela é insanamente forte com a mistura de traços de super força e defesa super alta da [Torre]. Ela também está interessada porque ela tem um corpo pequeno, então se eu olhar para longe ela imediatamente estará bem na minha frente e dará um golpe no meu corpo.\n\nEla está segurando bastante, mas ainda dói se eu for atingido por ela.\n\n“...... Você tem que mirar no centro do corpo quando der um golpe onde acertar com precisão e também empurrando seu golpe profundamente no corpo do oponente.”\n\nMesmo se ela disser isso, vai ser difícil para um novato como eu sequer acertar meu ataque no oponente.\n\nKoneko-chan começa a girar o braço ao redor e apontou seu punho para mim.\n\n\"...... Agora, então, teremos outra rodada.\"\n\nParece que vou ser morto.\n\nLição 4: Com a Buchou!\n\n“Ei, Ise! Continue indo!\"\n\n\"Osu!\"\n\nAtualmente estou subindo uma montanha muito íngreme com uma grande pedra amarrada nas minhas costas. Além disso, a Buchou está sentada em cima da rocha.\n\nEstou repetindo um procedimento em que desço o caminho da montanha e depois subo o caminho da montanha. O caminho da montanha sem caminho a pé é realmente desgastante.\n\nQuando minhas pernas ficaram dormentes depois de dezenas de voltas, a Buchou finalmente me perdoou dizendo: \"Ok, terminamos com isso\".\n\n“Próximo é o treinamento muscular. Nós vamos com flexões.”\n\n\"Sim ...\"\n\nEla é uma Oni. Um Oni-Buchou!\n\nEu não tenho a habilidade básica mais, então eu tenho muito mais treinamento do que os outros membros do clube. Também para um [peão] que tem que correr ao redor do campo de batalha mais, aumentando sua força e resistência é um requisito absoluto.\n\n\"Guwaa!\"\n\nA Buchou impiedosamente coloca uma pedra nas minhas costas quando eu estou na postura de fazer um esforço. O poder demoníaco é realmente útil porque você pode levantar uma rocha no ar com facilidade. Se ela usasse isso para carregar a bagagem ...\n\nSENTAR.\n\n“Unn ......”\n\nEntão Buchou senta no topo da rocha. Uma ligeira força afeta meu corpo\n\n......\n\n\"Agora, as trezentas repetições de flexões. Vamos começar.\"\n\n\"Osu!\"\n\nEu já teria morrido cem vezes se não fosse um demônio.\n\n\n===Parte 2===\n\n“Uoooo! É delicioooous! É realmente delicioso!”\n\nNós estamos tendo nosso jantar depois de terminar um dia de treinamento.\n\nTemos uma extravagância de comida na mesa. As ervas que Kiba coletou anteriormente eram usadas para temperos.\n\nO prato de carne. Aparentemente é o javali que a Buchou caçava. É a minha primeira vez a comer carne de javali, no entanto, sabe bem porque não tem nenhum gosto estranho!\n\nO prato de peixe. Parece que a Buchou também foi a que capturou esses peixes. O peixe simplesmente cozido com sais polvilhado sobre eles também é bom!\n\nExistem também diferentes tipos de comida na mesa.\n\n“Ara ara. Ainda temos mais comida, então coma o quanto quiser. ”\n\nQuem reabastece meu arroz é a Akeno-san. Pelo contrário, esses alimentos são feitos à mão pela Akeno-san!\n\nKaaaa! É bom! É realmente bom!\n\nTodo mundo está cavando a comida. Estamos todos seriamente cansados do treinamento, e é por isso que eu posso encher meu estômago com muita comida.\n\nA maioria das coisas dentro da bagagem eram equipamentos usados para cozinhar. Valeu a pena carregar toda aquela bagagem desesperadamente daquele caminho difícil da montanha se eu conseguisse comer comida deliciosa como essa!\n\nEu provavelmente não deveria dizer em voz alta como a Koneko-chan está comendo muita comida rapidamente.\n\n“Akeno-san, você é o melhor! Eu até quero você como minha esposa!”\n\n\"Ufufu, você está me envergonhando.\"\n\nAkeno-san sorri enquanto coloca a mão na bochecha dela. Você parece tão bem naquele avental japonês.\n\n\"...... eu também fiz esta sopa.\"\n\nHã! Aquele que está triste ao meu lado é a Asia. Ela parece que está de mau humor.\n\nA sopa de cebola que está na mesa. Aparentemente, a Asia foi quem fez isso.\n\nEla provavelmente se sente triste porque eu só elogiei a comida da Akeno-san.\n\nPego a tigela e bebo a sopa com um gole. Sim, é bom!\n\n“É uma boa Asia! Este é o melhor! Me dê outro!”\n\n\"Isto é!? Estou tão feliz ...... Então agora eu posso me tornar o Ise-san...... ”\n\n“Hmmm? Eu não consegui ouvir a última parte. O que é que foi isso?\"\n\n\"N-não, não é nada!”\n\nA Asia acena com a mão enquanto o rosto fica vermelho. Hã? O que ela estava tentando dizer?\n\n“Agora, Ise. Do treinamento de hoje, o que você descobriu?”\n\nBuchou me pergunta depois de beber chá verde. Eu coloco meus pauzinhos para baixo e dou a ela minha resposta honesta.\n\n\"...... eu sou o mais fraco entre nós.\"\n\n\"Sim. Isso é certeza.\"\n\nEu sinto vontade de chorar depois que ela responde claramente.\n\n“Akeno, Yuuto e Koneko têm muita experiência de batalha, apesar de não terem participado do jogo, então eles podem lutar se eles se acostumarem com isso. Mas você e a Asia basicamente não têm nenhuma experiência ainda. Mesmo assim, a habilidade de cura da Asia e seu Boosted Gear são algo que não pode ser ignorado. Até o inimigo sabe disso. Eu quero que você tenha pelo menos o poder de fugir do inimigo.”\n\n\"Correr......? É tão difícil assim?”\n\nBuchou acena com a minha pergunta.\n\n“Fugir também faz parte da estratégia. Recuar para formar uma nova formação também é uma maneira profissional de lutar. Existem maneiras de ganhar uma partida como essa. No entanto, fugir de costas para um inimigo é algo muito difícil. Se é um inimigo com aproximadamente a mesma força que você, é fácil, mas mostrar as costas para um inimigo que é muito superior a você é basicamente pedir que eles matem você. Então, ser capaz de fugir de tal inimigo também será uma parte de sua força. Então eu tenho que ensinar a você e à Asia o tempo que você tem que fugir. Claro, eu também ensinarei como lutar contra o inimigo. ”\n\n\"Entendido.\"\n\n\"Sim.\"\n\nAsia e eu respondemos à Buchou ao mesmo tempo. É inevitável que a Asia tenha se envolvido nessa luta desde que se tornou membro do grupo Gremory.\n\n...... Eu também preciso ter o poder de proteger a Asia também. No pior dos casos, terei que me tornar o escudo da Asia. Essa é a resolução que preciso ter.\n\n“Vamos tomar um banho depois da refeição. É um banho ao ar livre, então é maravilhoso ”.\n\n-! Com as palavras da Buchou, comecei a pensar em coisas ruins!\n\nBanho!? Banho ao ar livre !? O banho ao ar livre!\n\nSe é um banho ao ar livre, então é um lugar para espiar! Espreitar é o caminho certo para um banho ao ar livre! Sim, é um pecado não espiar se você nasceu como homem!\n\n\"Eu não vou espreitar, Ise-kun.\"\n\nKiba diz que de antemão com um sorriso.\n\n\"Idiota! D-não deixe escapar!\n\n“Oh, Ise. Você quer nos espiar enquanto estamos nos banhando?\n\nTodo mundo olha para mim depois da pergunta da Buchou. Uwa Eu me sinto estranho. ...... Eu me sinto como se desculpando por ser um pervertido. Mas Buchou ri.\n\n“Então, que tal você se banhar com a gente? Eu não me importo.”\n\nO quê?!\n\nEu posso sentir a eletricidade correndo pelo meu corpo! Ku! Buchou, japonês é impressionante como sempre! Eu sinto vontade de chorar o tempo todo por causa disso!\n\n\"E você, Akeno?\"\n\n“Eu não me importo se é Ise-kun. Ufufu Eu posso querer lavar as costas de um cavalheiro.”\n\nA Akeno-san dá sua aprovação com um sorriso! Eu totalmente quero que ela lave minhas costas!\n\nAbsurdo! Está tudo bem, então? Está tudo bem !? Quão desprotegido as garotas deste clube podem chegar!\n\n“E você, Asia? Você deve ficar bem se for seu amado Ise, certo?”\n\nAsia ficou vermelha e ficou quieta depois da pergunta de Buchou, mas ela finalmente fez um pequeno aceno com a cabeça.\n\nUwah! Eu nunca pensei que uma situação como essa aconteceria comigo! O-OOO-O que devo fazer !? EU! EU! Estou confiante de que vou ter que dobrar meu corpo o tempo todo!\n\n“Finalmente a Koneko? Que tal isso?”\n\n\"......Não.\"\n\nEla me rejeita! N-Não, minha sensação está paralisada por um momento, mas esta é uma resposta natural de uma garota comum!\n\n“Então é um não. Que pena, Ise.”\n\nBuchou ri com uma expressão maliciosa.\n\nO que ...... eu sinto como se levantassem minhas esperanças, então me deixassem cair nas profundezas do abismo.\n\nPor causa da conclusão chocante, minha visão fica preta.\n\nSob, eu estava tão perto ...... Então, ter uma situação que é como um sonho é difícil de transformar em realidade, afinal. Então parece que eu tenho que espiar.\n\n\"...... Se você espiar, então vou guardar rancor contra você para sempre.\"\n\nGuha! A Koneko-chan diz isso para mim primeiro! Merda! É um não depois de tudo! Eu tive minhas esperanças!\n\n“Ise-kun, vamos tomar um banho nu juntos. Eu lavarei suas costas.”\n\n“Cala boca! Eu vou matá-lo seriamente, Kibaaaa!”\n\nMeu grito de raiva ecoa por toda a mansão.\n\n\n===Parte 3===\n\nDia de treinamento 2.\n\nQuando acordei de manhã, o que me esperava era a dor intensa das dores musculares. Isso porque eu também treinei à noite.\n\n“Há um treinamento planejado para esta noite também. Nós somos os moradores da noite depois de tudo.”\n\nBuchou disse.\n\nO treinamento foi muito mais difícil do que o treinamento que faço todas as manhãs. Tem algumas vezes mais treinamento do que o que fiz de manhã. Mesmo que um Diabo seja muito mais forte à noite, eu ainda morreria se treinasse tanto durante o dia quanto a noite.\n\nEu já estava de mau humor porque tinha que dividir o quarto com o Kiba. Quando ouvi as vozes das meninas se divertindo do andar de cima, me arrependi de ter nascido como um cara. Então, de manhã para o dia 2, foi a hora do estudo.\n\nNós nos reunimos na sala de estar, e eles aparentemente decidiram ensinar a mim e à Asia sobre o conhecimento dos diabos. Portanto, eles estavam me ensinando alguns nomes estranhos que eram difíceis de lembrar. Porque eu aprendi coisas que eu nem entendo, meu cérebro estava prestes a ser frito.\n\nQuando eles bombearam uma quantidade decente de informações, Kiba me fez uma pergunta.\n\n“Nosso maior inimigo. Os anjos liderados por Deus. Qual é o nome dado aos anjos de maior hierarquia? Também, quais os nomes deles?”\n\n\"Ummm, é\" Serafim \", certo? Os membros são ...... Michael, Raphael, Gabriel e ...... hmm, Uriel?\"\n\n\"Corrigir.\"\n\nUfa ...... Então está correto. Lembrei que todos eles têm um \"-el\" no final do nome, então de alguma forma me lembrei de todos eles.\n\n\"Próximo é o nosso\" Maou \"-sama. Quais são os nomes do\" Yondai Maou-sama ?\"\n\n\"Certo! Moleza; fácil; baba! Estou planejando conhecê-los quando receber uma nobreza! Então me lembrei de todos os nomes deles perfeitamente! Lúcifer-sama, Belzebu-sama e Asmodeus-sama! E finalmente a mulher Maou-sama que eu admiro, Leviathan-sama! ”\n\n\"Corrigir.\"\n\n“Definitivamente vou me encontrar com Leviathan-sama!”\n\nEu ouvi da Buchou. Que a pessoa que está no topo das demônios do sexo feminino é o Maou Leviathan-sama.\n\nEu também ouvi dizer que ela é uma linda Maou-sama! Também me disseram que eu poderia conhecê-la se tivesse sorte! Ku! Eu não posso esperar!\n\nQuão bonita ela será? Desde que ela é um Maou-sama, ela deve ser muito bonita ......\n\nHaa ...... Eu realmente quero conhecê-la.\n\n\"Então, em seguida, peço-lhe para dizer os nomes dos líderes dos anjos caídos que você mais odeia, Ise-kun.\"\n\nAqui vem. Os nomes desses anjos caídos eu odeio totalmente ......Os anjos caídos têm mais líderes que as outras facções. E seus nomes são complicados ......\n\nMas lembro dos nomes dos dois primeiros.\n\n“O grupo principal do Anjo Caído é chamado de“ Grigori ”. O nome do governador é \"Azazel\" e o nome do vice-governador é \"Shemhaza\". Eu sei completamente até aqui. E o nome dos líderes são ...... Armaros ......Barakiel ...... Tamiel ...... Ah, e, hmmm, huh? Bene-algo e CC-Cociane......?”\n\n“Benemue, Kokabiel e Shariel. Você tem que lembrar deles corretamente. Este é também o básico. É o mesmo que lembrar os nomes do primeiro-ministro e do vice-primeiro ministro do Japão, bem como dos líderes dos países vizinhos. ”\n\nComo posso!? Eles têm muitos líderes! Dois é o suficiente! Quais são os empregos dos outros líderes, então?\n\nCara, é por isso que Anjos Caídos são uma dor tão grande. Eu não posso gostar deles. Eles são provavelmente escória de qualquer maneira.\n\nEles também cuidam dos “Filhos de Deus”, em outras palavras, os possuidores da “Sacred Gear”, o tempo todo.\n\nEssa também é a razão pela qual fui atacado e porque a Asia foi morta uma vez.\n\nOs Anjos Caídos formaram um grupo para pesquisar as Sacred Gears. Eles convidam possiveis possuidores de Sacred Gear para seu grupo ou levam suas Sacred Gears para si mesmos.\n\nSe eles não são benéficos, eles os matam no local. Sério, eles são a maior escória de todos os tempos. Eles até matam os possuidores que não sabem sobre sua própria Sacred Gear. Foi assim para mim.\n\nEles parecem ser o maior inimigo dos demônios, então eu não vou me segurar neles. Não vou me deter naqueles caras que fizeram uma coisa tão terrível na Asia!\n\nAssim, eu fui ensinado sobre os anjos e os anjos caídos. Está se tornando bastante útil saber.\n\nEu preciso lembrar especialmente sobre a relação entre os demônios e outras facções, uma vez que são importantes. Então, em seguida, a Asia começa sua lição.\n\n\"Tosse. Então, agora, eu, Asia Argento, explicarei sobre o básico dos exorcistas. ”\n\nOh. Clap-clap. Dou um aplauso na Asia que está prestes a falar na frente de todos.\n\nAh, ela fica vermelha. Muito obrigado por uma resposta tão fofa.\n\n“U-Umm. Do lugar a que eu pertencia, havia dois tipos de exorcistas.”\n\n\"Dois tipos?\"\n\nAsia acena com a minha pergunta.\n\n“O primeiro tipo são os que aparecem em filmes e romances. O pai lê uma seção do livro, então ele usa a água sagrada para se livrar do diabo do corpo da pessoa. Eles são os exorcistas na \"superfície\". Então os exorcistas do \"atrás\" são aqueles que nos ameaçam.”\n\nA Buchou continua de onde a Asia parou.\n\n“Ise, você também o conheceu antes, mas a maior ameaça para os demônios são os exorcistas que receberam a proteção divina de um deus ou dos anjos caídos. Nós temos lutado contra eles por um longo tempo nos bastidores. Eles vêm para nos destruir com o poder da luz recebida dos Anjos, e com seus corpos físicos que eles treinaram até os limites mais extremos ”.\n\nEntão lembrei-me do padre maluco de antes. Ele era um exorcista maluco de cabelos brancos. Ele não só mata diabos, mas também aqueles que têm conexões com um diabo. Para dizer a verdade, ele é o tipo de pessoa que eu não quero encontrar nunca mais.\n\nEnquanto eu pensava nisso, a Asia tirou um monte de coisas da bolsa dela. Buchou pega uma pequena garrafa com água dentro dela com os dedos e a segura como se estivesse tocando algo nojento.\n\n“Agora vou falar sobre os traços da água benta e da Bíblia. Primeiro de tudo, a água sagrada. Será muito terrível se um diabo tocar.”\n\n“Isso é verdade, então você não pode tocá-lo também, Asia. Sua pele vai se machucar.”\n\n\"Sob, isso mesmo ... eu não posso mais tocar a água sagrada ......\"\n\nAsia fica chocada depois de ouvir o comentário da Buchou. Bem, ela é um demônio depois de tudo.\n\n“Eu vou te dizer como fazer um depois. Não sei se será útil, mas há algumas maneiras de fazê-las. ”\n\nTalvez este seja seu campo forte, então a Asia continua a falar energicamente.\n\nSacerdote demônio! Ela provavelmente vai chorar se eu disser uma coisa dessas. Eu preciso me controlar.\n\n“Próximo é a Bíblia. Eu tenho lido isso todos os dias desde que eu era criança. Mas estou com problemas agora, porque isso me dá uma dor na cabeça, mesmo que eu só tenha lido uma frase.”\n\n\"Você é um demônio.\"\n\n\"Você é um demônio depois de tudo.\"\n\n\"....... Um demônio.\"\n\n\"Ufufu, demônios recebem dano intenso.\"\n\n\"Sob, eu não posso mais ler a Bíblia!\"\n\nAsia começa a ter os olhos marejados depois que todos apontam para ela. Eu ouvi da Buchou antes. Nós, Diabos, sofremos muito se alguém lê a Bíblia para nós. Ainda não experimentei, mas posso sofrer por causa do tédio se alguém ler para mim.\n\nEspere, então isso significa que a Asia tem lido a Bíblia. Se ela continuar, ela pode morrer um dia!\n\n“No entanto, esta é a minha frase favorita ...... Oh Deus. Por favor, perdoe uma pessoa pecadora como eu, que não sabe ler a Bíblia - au!\n\nEla recebeu dano novamente orando a Deus.\n\nPor favor, Deus, simplesmente ignore a oração desta criança. Assim, depois que terminamos nossa sessão matinal de estudos, fomos\nao nosso treinamento noturno.\n\n===Parte 4===\n\nHavia algumas coisas que descobri enquanto treinava assim com todos\ndurante vários dias nesta montanha.\n\nEu não tenho talento em usar espadas. Eu não tenho talento em artes marciais. Eu não tenho talento em poder demoníaco. E o mais crucial é que eu sou insanamente fraco. Eu percebo o quão pequeno eu sou quanto mais eu treino com os outros.\n\n- Eu não vou ser útil no jogo.\n\nSim, eu não tenho uma habilidade de cura como a Asia. O que estou fazendo bem é descascar os vegetais. Bem, isso também faz parte do treinamento.\n\nEu sou tão fraco e tão inútil.\n\n===Parte 5===\n\nAquela noite na mansão.\n\nEu estou olhando para o teto enquanto estava deitado na minha cama. Uma semana se passou desde que chegamos às montanhas. Tem treinado de manhã até a noite. Também repetimos muitas formações de ataque e defesa, bem como combinações que podemos usar para o próximo jogo.\n\nEu olho para Kiba que está dormindo na cama além da minha. Ele está dormindo pacificamente.\n\n… Kiba é incrível. Eu percebo a diferença entre nós quanto mais treinamos juntos. Eu provavelmente nunca vou bater Kiba em uma luta de espadas. As habilidades que ele alcançou com seu próprio talento e muito treinamento.\n\nEu também não tenho. Se eu treinar duro a partir de agora, eu vou ter esgrima a par com o Kiba? Depois de quantos anos será isso? Não, depois de quantas décadas? Não, talvez eu não alcance o seu nível na eternidade.\n\nEu--.\n\nNo treinamento de poder demoníaco. A Asia continua melhorando a dela além de mim. Ela começa a dominar usando fogo, água e raios, apesar de ser pequena. Mas eu, por outro lado, só posso fazer uma massa de poder demoníaco que é do tamanho de um grão de arroz.\n\nEu--.\n\nAh, droga!\n\nEu não posso mais resistir, então me levantei da cama lentamente e me dirigi para a cozinha. Quando eu estava bebendo uma xícara de água.\n\n“Ara? Você está acordado?\"\n\nA voz da Buchou veio da sala de estar. Quando olho, tem a Buchou sentada à mesa.\n\n“Ah, Buchou. Olá.\"\n\n“Por que você está tão duro? Bom momento, vamos conversar um pouco.”\n\nA vela de chá faz um leve brilho em cima da mesa. Os demônios podem ver à noite, mesmo que não haja luzes. Graças a isso, fomos capazes de treinar mesmo à noite. Então esta vela é usada provavelmente para olhares então.\n\nEu então me sento em frente da Buchou, onde temos a mesa entre nós. A Buchou está vestindo uma camisola vermelha enquanto usa óculos e amarra o cabelo vermelho em um rabo de cavalo.\n\n\"Hã? Buchou, você tem visão ruim?”\n\n“Oh, isso? É só por olhares. Eu posso pensar com mais clareza ao ter meus óculos. Fufufu, esta é a prova de que estive no mundo dos humanos por tanto tempo ”.\n\nBuchou ri. Até mesmo a Buchou com óculos estava linda… Mais, ela também fica maravilhosa quando usa uma camisola!\n\nNa mesa há muitos papéis que parecem um mapa e uma formação de batalha. ...... Ela estava fazendo um plano sozinha à noite?\n\nA Buchou fecha o caderno com diferentes estratégias escritas nele.\n\n\"...... Para ser honesto, a única coisa que vou conseguir lendo isso é ter uma paz de espírito.\"\n\nA Buchou diz isso enquanto suspirou.\n\n\"Por que é que ?\"\n\n“Se o adversário é outro diabo de alta classe, então poderíamos lutar lendo isso. Este livro foi escrito com muita pesquisa. Mas esse não é o problema.”\n\n“Então o que há de errado ?”\n\n“Levante-se. Não, o maior problema é que o nosso adversário é a Phoenix.”\n\nBuchou pega um livro depois de me responder e coloca na mesa. Ela então aponta para a página aberta. Há uma foto de um pássaro de fogo com suas asas bem abertas heroicamente.\n\n“Há muito tempo atrás, a besta mística, Phoenix, era vista pelos humanos como um pássaro que governa a vida. Era tão visto que deixou sua lenda em muitos países do mundo humano, onde é dito que as lágrimas da Phoenix podem curar quaisquer feridas, e o sangue que flui dentro de seu corpo pode dar juventude eterna àqueles que a bebem. ”\n\nMas havia também outro clã diferente da besta mística Phoenix. Eles são os demônios que tinham o posto de Marquês, e foram contados como um dos \"72 pilares\". A \"Phoenix\" do lado dos demônios.\n\n“Os humanos nomearam a Phoenix dos Diabos como“ Phenex ”para distingui-la da besta mística Phoenix, no entanto a besta mística Phoenix tem a mesma habilidade que o clã de Raiser. Em outras palavras, imortalidade. Esse é o adversário que devemos lutar contra ”.\n\nImortal!? Aguente firme!\n\n\"Isso é trapaça! Quero dizer, ser imortal é basicamente ser invencível!”\n\n\"Sim. Eles são basicamente invencíveis. Mesmo se você atacá-los, suas feridas irão cicatrizar imediatamente. Suas chamas nem mesmo deixam um osso sobrando. Oito vitórias e duas derrotas. Este é o registro que Raiser tem no “Rating Game” oficial. Ele lutou dez vezes e ganhou oito partidas. Ele perdeu dois dos jogos de propósito como gentileza para uma das famílias que ele é próximo. Na realidade, ele ganhou todos os seus jogos. Ele já se tornou um candidato para obter um título no jogo oficial.”\n\n……O que. Eu perdi as palavras da minha boca. Agora entendo o que a Buchou quis dizer com “problema”. - É Raiser! Ela está pensando em uma maneira de vencer esse bastardo!\n\n“Eu senti algo desconfortável quando soube que Raiser foi escolhido como meu noivo. Sim, acho que Otou-sama e os outros o escolheram para o caso de algo assim acontecer. Eles escolheram Raiser, então não terei escolha a não ser me casar com ele. Mesmo que se torne um casamento entre as famílias, eles sabiam que não havia como eu ganhar. No xadrez você diria que eles me enganaram. Uma fraude.”\n\nNão importa o quão forte seja a Buchou, seus pais sabiam que não havia como a Buchou derrotar alguém imortal. Isso é injusto! Então, não importa de quem seja a filha, eles não podem evitar se casar.\n\n“Quando o Rating Game se tornou popular, os que mais escalaram foram a Casa da Phoenix. Não houve muitas batalhas entre os Diabos até o jogo ser apresentado. Em um jogo onde o [rei] também participa, a força de Phoenix se tornou mais clara. A Casa de Phoenix é o grupo líder entre as classes mais fortes. -Imortal. Os Demônios perceberam como esse poder era aterrorizante pela primeira vez.”\n\nSe eles são imortais, então eles podem ressuscitar, não importa quantas vezes eles sejam derrotados. Os outros Diabos têm limites para seus poderes, ao contrário da Phoenix, então eles seriam derrotados quando ficassem exaustos. Uwa! Eles são tão insanamente fortes que é injusto!\n\n- E esse é o nosso adversário!\n\nMesmo se derrotarmos os criados de Raiser, o exército das belezas, isso não significa nada se não derrotarmos Raiser. Não, a questão é, podemos até derrotá-lo? Não será uma luta onde eles planejaram nos enganar, ou seria?\n\nBuchou ri depois de olhar para o meu rosto sério.\n\n“Você sabe, não é como se nós não pudéssemos derrotar Raiser?”\n\n\"Você está falando sério!?\"\n\n\"Sim. Existem duas maneiras de derrotá-lo. Uma delas é derrotá-lo com poder incrível e a outra é continuar a derrubá-lo até que sua mente seja esmagada. O primeiro método requer a força de uma classe de Deus. O segundo é salvar nossa resistência até que Raiser tenha sua mente esmagada. Mesmo que seu corpo seja imortal onde ele possa ressuscitar seu corpo muitas vezes, sua mente não é imortal. Sua mente definitivamente vai cansar toda vez que o derrotarmos. É a nossa vitória se nós esmagarmos completamente a mente da Phoenix. Então ele vai parar de ressuscitar e ele vai cair. Bem, a maneira mais fácil é derrotá-lo com um poder que está no mesmo nível de Deus que o esmaga com um golpe que desmonta seu corpo e sua mente ”.\n\n...... Ambos os métodos não precisam de muito esforço para conseguir isso? É possível fazer algo assim em nossa primeira batalha? Não, nós temos que fazer isso.\n\nEm outras palavras, temos que lutar até que ele diga: “Eu ressuscitei tanto que perdi a vontade de lutar, então, por favor, me perdoe”.\n\nAh, sim, vou fazer a pergunta que tem me incomodado o tempo todo.\n\n\"Buchou\"\n\n\"O que é ?\"\n\n\"Por que você odeia Raiser ... não, mais, por que você é contra esse casamento?\"\n\nBuchou suspira com a minha pergunta.\n\nCertamente Raiser parece uma escória e é bem o mulherengo, mas acho que ela não pode rejeitar esse acordo se você pensar no problema da casa da Buchou.\n\n“...... Eu sou um \"Gremory\". ”\n\n\"Hã? B-Bem, você certamente é…\"\n\n\"Não. Eu não me re-introduzi. Sou um demônio da Casa dos Gremory e\nesse nome me seguirá para onde quer que eu vá.\"\n\nAcho que entendi.\n\n\"Você odeia isso?\"\n\n“Eu me sinto orgulhoso disso. No entanto, isso também é algo que é um fardo para mim. Todo mundo olha para mim como Rias dos Gremory. Não posso deixar que olhem para mim simplesmente como Rias. É por isso que estou curtindo minha vida no mundo humano. Eles não sabem sobre o Gremory, o Demônio. Todo mundo olha para mim como quem eu sou. Eu realmente gosto desse sentimento. Eu nunca senti algo assim na sociedade dos diabos, e eu também nunca irei agora também. A única vez que posso aproveitar minha vida como eu é quando estou no mundo humano.”\n\nA Buchou tem um visual distante. Ela também tem olhos muito tristes.\n\nEla me contou uma história do mundo que eu nunca consigo imaginar. Eu sou Hyoudou Issei e nunca senti nada em meu nome. Sou eu mesmo; eu sou apenas o filho da minha mãe e meu pai.\n\nAgora, onde quer que eu vá, as pessoas olham para mim como “Hyoudou Issei” como um indivíduo. A Buchou tem passado a vida levando o nome de Gremory nas costas. Isso será o mesmo a partir de agora.\n\n“Eu quero estar com alguém que me ame como Rias sem o fato de que sou um Gremory. Esse é o meu pequeno sonho que eu tenho ...Infelizmente, Raiser só olha para mim como Rias do Gremory. E ele me ama como Rias do Gremory. É por isso que eu odeio isso. Mas ainda assim, o orgulho de ser um Gremory é muito importante. Meus sentimentos podem ser complicados, mas quero valorizar esse pequeno sonho que tenho.”\n\nEntão Buchou quer ser amada como “Rias” e não como “Rias Gremory” do sexo oposto …… Isso é o que você chama de sentimentos de donzela, huh.\n\nMas não há dúvida de que a Buchou está se sentindo complicada por causa dos problemas de sua casa.\n\nHmm, eu não entendo os sentimentos de uma garota e a estrutura da sociedade dos diabos, então eu não sei o que dizer a ela ...\n\n\"Eu gosto de Buchou como Buchou.\"\n\nEu acabei de dizer o que pensei. Mas Buchou olha para mim maravilhada.\n\n“Eu não sei nada sobre Gremory ou sobre o mundo dos diabos, mas para mim Rias-buchou é Rias-buchou …… Nggh, eu não entendo todas as coisas complicadas, mas para mim a usual Buchou é a melhor!”\n\nEu disse tudo que posso pensar com um sorriso. Hahaha, eu não posso nem dizer coisas que soam românticas.\n\n… Ei, Buchou-sama? Eu não sei porque, mas a Buchou tem as bochechas vermelhas.\n\n“B-Buchou? D-eu disse algo estranho?”\n\nEu pergunto a ela com uma voz duvidosa, mas Buchou balança a cabeça onde ela diz: \"Eu-não é nada!\", Enquanto entra em pânico.\n\nO que? Aconteceu alguma coisa? Bem, vou deixar isso de lado.\n\n\"Mas ter um adversário assim para a primeira partida do gênio Buchou, certamente será um obstáculo difícil, certo?\"\n\n\"Eu realmente não gosto da palavra \"gênio\" ?\"\n\nA Buchou ainda me responde com um rosto vermelho.\n\n\"Por que é que?\"\n\n“Um talento que é dado pelo céu… parece que é um presente dado por Deus, então eu não me sinto bem. Meu talento nasce das raízes da Casa de Gremory que foi passada para as gerações. Eu herdei essa característica como um diabo. Eu nunca pensei que recebi isso como um presente de Deus, e isso é impossível. Meu poder pertence a mim e à Casa de Gremory. É por isso que não vou perder. Eu vou ganhar se tiver que lutar. Eu tenho que vencer.”\n\nA Buchou diz para mim como se ela estivesse dizendo para si mesma. Surpreendente. A Buchou é muito forte. Comparado com isso eu ...... eu......\n\n“Buchou, eu sou inútil. Eu fui inútil ... desde que cheguei aqui.”\n\nBuchou faz uma expressão duvidosa enquanto olha para mim disse que em uma voz fraca.\n\n\"Ise ?\"\n\n“Eu acho que fiquei mais forte desde que cheguei aqui e treinei com todos, mas mais do que isso… Eu senti a diferença entre nós. Se eu fizer treinamento com espada, eu percebi o quão incrível Kiba é e percebi que “eu não serei capaz de me tornar um espadachim como Kiba” ...... Quando eu faço o treinamento para usar poderes demoníacos, eu percebo como a Akeno-san é superior enquanto a Asia está melhorando seus poderes demoníacos …… E eu não posso fazer nada…… Eu estou bem contanto que eu tenha o meu Boosted Gear! Eu agi firme pensando assim ......”\n\nEu tenho tantas lágrimas saindo dos meus olhos sem perceber. Estou frustrado, apenas frustrado. Quanto mais eu treino, mais percebo o quanto sou fraco.\n\n- Eu não tenho talento para a batalha.\n\nEu vim a perceber isso.\n\n“Eu descobri que eu era o mais fraco …… Eu também descobri que ……Eu sou o mais inútil …… Eu percebi que isso não significa nada se eu sou o único com o Sacred Gear definitivo. É por isso que eu fui ridicularizado por Raiser naquela época, certo? \"Pérolas aos porcos, certamente uma frase apropriada para mim.\"\n\nEu começo a derramar muitas lágrimas na frente da Buchou. Estou com tanta lágrima dos olhos devido a essa frustração que me faz parecer patético. Até meu nariz está pingando.\n\nBuchou se levanta e senta ao meu lado.\n\nABRAÇO.\n\n-!\n\nBuchou me abraça gentilmente. Ela começa a bater na minha cabeça muitas vezes.\n\n“Você quer confiança, certo? Ok, eu vou te dar confiança. Mas agora você precisa descansar o corpo e a mente. Eu estarei com você até você sentir vontade de dormir.”\n\nNaquela época eu não sabia o que ela queria dizer. Exceto, o calor da Buchou está curando minha alma.\n\nIsso é o suficiente por enquanto.\n\n===Parte 6===\n\n\"Use o seu Boosted Gear, Ise.\"\n\nPróximo dia. A Buchou diz isso para mim antes do início do treinamento. Ela está me permitindo usar o meu Sacred Gear que eu estava proibido de usar desde que entrei nas montanhas. Ela está me permitindo usá-lo agora ... mas o que ela quer que eu faça com a Sacred Gear?\n\n\"Deve ser bom ter Yuuto como o adversário.\"\n\n\"Sim.\"\n\nKiba se apresenta depois que Buchou o encoraja. Ele está na minha frente. Ei, ela está me dizendo para lutar contra o Kiba?\n\n“Ise, ative sua Sacred Gear antes da batalha simulada. Vamos ver ...vamos começar a batalha dois minutos depois de ativar sua Sacred Gear.”\n\n\"Sim.\"\n\nEu faço o meu Boosted Gear aparecer no meu braço esquerdo, assim como a Buchou manda.\n\n\"Boost!\"\n\n[Boost!!]\n\nA Sacred Gear faz um som com minhas palavras, e eu posso sentir o poder vindo ao meu corpo. Com isso meu poder duplicou. Dez segundos depois.\n\n[Boost!!]\n\nMeu poder dobra novamente. O poder que eu posso sentir da minha Sacred Gear percorre meu corpo. Está tudo bem que meu poder está sendo dobrado, mas há coisas que preciso ter em mente quando uso o meu Boosted Gear.\n\nVocê pode pensar que não há limites para o aumento dos meus poderes, mas a verdade é que não é o caso. Uma vez eu ativei o meu Boosted Gear para ver até onde posso aumentar meu poder, mas depois de alguns minutos eu desmaiei. O motivo é simples. Meu corpo não aguenta o poder enquanto aumenta mais. Quando eu perguntei a Buchou depois:\n\n“Por exemplo, pense que você é um caminhão. O que acontecerá se você levar mais pacote do que o caminhão pode carregar? Não vai se mover certo? É assim que é.”\n\nFoi assim que ela me explicou.\n\nO pacote é igual aos meus poderes que estão duplicando. Se a quantidade de pacote continuar dobrando, o caminhão diminuirá de velocidade e, no final, não se moverá.\n\nEntão, em outras palavras, se o poder ficar muito grande, isso sobrecarrega meu corpo. É por isso que desmaiei. Meu corpo, que é um vaso, não será capaz de suportar o aumento de poder.\n\nFoi o que aconteceu quando eu o ativei por alguns minutos. A jóia na luva fez um som que disse [Burst], então meu corpo ficou mais pesado e senti como se todos os meus sentidos congelassem.\n\nMesmo que não haja limites para o Sacred Gear, o usuário que sou eu neste caso tem limites. Essa é a fraqueza da minha Sacred Gear. Bem, é mais como minha fraqueza. Não é culpa da Sacred Gear. Eu tenho o meu décimo segundo poder depois que Buchou me mandou ligar. Então Buchou me ordena que \"Pare\" o poder da minha Sacred Gear.\n\n“Vamos fazer isso, Boosted Gear!”\n\n[Explosão!!]\n\nEste som também representa a parada da energização e atua como um\nlimitador.\n\nUma vez que o poder pára, eu posso lutar com esse poder aumentado por um certo tempo. O período de tempo que posso usar depende da minha ação durante a inicialização. Quanto mais eu me movo, mais eu ataco, menor o tempo. Isso também afeta minha resistência, e se eu estiver em um estado cansado, o tempo também será mais curto. Uma das maneiras de usar esta Sacred Gear é que eu não recebo nenhum dano.\n\nSim, é por isso que meu estado atual, onde não tenho dano e tenho resistência total, é o melhor momento para usar a habilidade do meu Boosted Gear.\n\nMeu poder está aumentando durante o impulso, mas é instável em comparação com o tempo em que eu paro o impulso de usar a energia por um tempo limitado. Se eu me mover muito, há riscos de que isso possa me mudar de volta ao meu eu normal. Por esse motivo, é melhor parar o boost e usar a energia.\n\nSerá sensato correr e se esconder enquanto recebe um impulso. Agora, meu poder está em um estado impensável por causa do aumento de dois minutos. O poder que sinto dentro do meu corpo não é normal.\n\n“Ise, eu quero que você lute contra Yuuto nesse estado. Yuuto, eu vou pedir para você ser seu oponente.”\n\n\"Sim, Buchou.\"\n\nKiba faz sua postura apontando seu bokuto para mim depois que Buchou o ordenou.\n\n“Ise, você quer usar uma espada? Ou você quer lutar com as mãos nuas?”\n\nBuchou me pergunta como eu vou estar lutando. Hmm, mesmo que eu tenha um bokuto, não vou conseguir usá-lo…\n\n\"Eu vou lutar de mãos nuas!\"\n\n\"Muito bem. Agora, então, peço a vocês dois para começar. Eu também faço uma postura contra o Kiba. Bem, é uma postura de novato.\"\n\nSWISH.\n\nKiba de repente desaparece da minha vista! Oh droga! O traço de [cavaleiro] é a velocidade! Kiba tem velocidade de deus! Quando eu perder de vista ele, vou receber o ataque ...\n\nBANG!\n\nO balanço de Kiba desceu para mim, mas eu guardo usando meu braço. Sim! Eu posso suportar isso!\n\n\"!\"\n\nKiba faz uma expressão chocada. Ele baixou a guarda! Eu soco em direção a Kiba, que parou de se mover.\n\nRÁPIDO!\n\nO corpo de Kiba desaparece pouco antes de eu acertá-lo e meus socos cortam o ar. Porcaria! Ele se esquivou!\n\nOnde está o Kiba? Eu tento persegui-lo olhando em volta. ……Ele se foi! Se ele não está na minha frente ou para a minha esquerda ou direita, então ele está atrás de mim!\n\nNo entanto, não vejo Kiba quando me viro.\n\nAcima de mim!? Quando eu olho para cima, Kiba está descendo com o seu bokuto voltado para baixo.\n\nBANG!\n\nEu ouvi um som desagradável! Guhaaa! Eu recebo um golpe na minha cabeça. Isso machuca!\n\n\"Ai ...\"\n\nNão tenho tempo para tocar na parte em que fui atingido e solto um chute em direção a Kiba, que acaba de pousar no chão.\n\nSWISH!\n\nEle se esquivou de novo! Merda! Não vai bater em nada! Se meu oponente é um [cavaleiro], então eu vou ter dificuldade com a velocidade deles?\n\n“Ise! Atire com um bloco de poder demoníaco! Quando você forma um bloco de poder demoníaco, atire nele com uma forma que você mais imagina!”\n\nA Buchou me dá um pedido.\n\nUm bloco de poder demoníaco? Eu tenho que fazer isso aqui? Não sei se vai bater, mas não tem outra escolha! Eu vou obedecer ao pedido da Buchou.\n\nEu juntei o poder demoníaco que flui dentro do meu corpo e o concentrei na minha palma. Existe um bloco de poder demoníaco que é do tamanho de uma bola de arroz. Pequeno como de costume! Então eu atiro em direção ao Kiba! Naquele instante, não pude acreditar no que vi.\n\nGUOOOOOOOOOO!\n\nÉ enorme! A bola mágica que tinha o tamanho de uma bola de arroz ficou maior quando eu atirei! Chegou ao tamanho de uma rocha enorme! Este!? Entendi! É o poder do Boosted Gear! O enorme bloco de magia se aproximou de Kiba. A velocidade também foi bastante rápida.\n\nSWISH.\n\nKiba se esquiva facilmente. Bem, isso não é surpreendente. Ah, mas isso não significará nada se não bater. Foi o que pensei, mas logo me livrei desse pensamento.\n\nA bola de poder demoníaco que errou o alvo foi em direção à montanha ao lado da que estamos, e ...\n\nBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG !!\n\nA montanha explode enquanto faz um enorme som e explosão !!\n\nEh! Eh? Eeeeeeeeeeeeh!\n\n...... Um único tiro de poder demoníaco que eu atirei explodiu uma única montanha ...... A montanha tem um enorme buraco nela. Isso muda a visão disso.\n\n……Eh? Você é de verdade? Na verdade, explodiu isso? É uma montanha, sabe? Uma montanha.\n\nDevido à súbita reviravolta dos acontecimentos, não sabia o que dizer.\n\n[Reset]\n\nA luva fez um som e eu também posso sentir o poder deixando meu corpo ao mesmo tempo. Parece que o tempo que eu estou ligado está acabado.\n\nEntão perdi toda a minha força de uma só vez. Parece que meu interior ficou vazio. Parece que eu usei meu poder demoníaco.\n\n\"Eu vou ter vocês dois parem aí.\"\n\nA Buchou acaba comigo e com a longarina de Kiba. Kiba também colocou seu bokuto no chão. Eu também me sento no chão como se perdesse minha força.\n\nA montanha desapareceu.\n\nMeu coração está batendo com esse fato. D-eu fiz isso? Eu ainda não consigo acreditar. A-Um ataque como esse realmente saiu da minha mão ......\n\n“Bom trabalho vocês dois. Agora vou ouvir sua impressão. Yuuto, como foi?”\n\nKiba responde a pergunta da Buchou.\n\n\"Sim. Para dizer a verdade estou espantado. Eu tentei terminar a luta com o primeiro ataque.\"\n\nEh? O primeiro ataque, como naquele que eu pude bloquear?\n\n“Mas eu não consegui romper a guarda do Ise-kun. Eu estava focado em romper isso. Eu também tentei derrubá-lo no meu segundo ataque, batendo a cabeça acima do ar, mas isso também falhou ”.\n\nKiba responde enquanto ri \"Hahaha\" com uma expressão refrescante. Kiba colocou seu bokuto na frente para mostrar a todos.…… Esse bokuto já está quebrado.\n\n“Eu reforcei o bokuto com poder demoníaco, mas não poderia causar tanto dano a Ise-kun porque seu corpo era muito duro. Se continuássemos, só teria a opção de correr por aí porque não teria minha arma.”\n\n“Obrigado Yuuto. É assim que é, Ise.”\n\nÉ assim que é? Foi essa a coisa que ela me disse ontem quando disse, “Eu te darei confiança”?\n\n“Ise. Você me disse que você era \"o mais fraco e não tem talento\", certo?”\n\n\"Sim.\"\n\n“Isso é meio correto. Você, que não ativou sua Sacred Gear, é fraco. No entanto, você se torna uma pessoa totalmente diferente se usar o poder do Boosted Gear. ”\n\nA Buchou aponta para a montanha que foi surpreendida.\n\n“Esse ataque é de um demônio de alta classe. Se isso acontecer, a maioria das pessoas será levada pelo vento.”\n\nVocê está falando sério!? Bem, certamente parece um ataque que pode explodir a maioria dos seres.\n\n“Seu corpo, que passou por treinamento básico, tornou-se uma embarcação que pode lidar com uma Sacred Gear que aumenta drasticamente o poder. Mesmo agora, seu corpo é forte o suficiente para lidar com o aumento de energia. Eu te disse antes, certo? Você pode se tornar o mais forte, desde que você melhore seu básico. Quanto maior for a sua força inicial, mais o poder pode aumentar. A resistência básica aumenta de “1” para “2”. Mesmo algo assim se tornaria um grande fator para você se tornar forte.”\n\n-Meu poder é incrível ...?\n\nEu ainda não consigo acreditar em mim e a Buchou diz isso com confiança para mim.\n\n“Você é a chave do jogo. O ataque de Ise se torna o fator que decide o resultado da batalha. Se fosse só você lutando, então seria assustador porque você teria sua guarda baixa enquanto ligando. No entanto, esta batalha é uma batalha de equipe. Você terá seus companheiros que o apoiarão. Confie em nós. Então, você se tornará forte assim como nós. Nós podemos vencer isso!”\n\n-Tornar-se mais forte. Eu?\n\n“Vamos mostrar para aqueles que menosprezaram você. Não importa se o adversário é o Phoenix ou não. Precisamos ensiná-los de forma muito rigorosa em quão forte Rias Gremory e seus servos são!”\n\n[Sim!]\n\nTodo mundo responde a ela com uma voz forte. Está certo! Eu tenho a Buchou e todo mundo comigo!\n\nEu vou ficar forte! Eu me tornarei mais forte junto com todos! Eu vou derrotar o Raiser Phoenix!\n\nDepois de ter uma determinação recém-descoberta, o treinamento nas montanhas passou sem problemas. Então chegamos ao dia da batalha decisiva.\n\n\n<noinclude>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; padding: 0.2em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n| Voltar para [[High_School_DxD:Volume_2_Vida_2|Vida.2 Eu consigo uma briga]]\n| Retornar para [[High_School_DxD_~Brazilian_Portuguese~|Página Principal]]\n| Avançar para [[High_School_DxD:Volume_2_Vida_4|Vida.4 A batalha decisiva se inicia!]]\n|-\n|}\n</noinclude>\n"

It is situated south-west of Leazas and west of the Free Cities Alliance, with the Crystal Forest and Kinani Desert to the north, and the Monster Realm's forest to the west. Zeth is highly advanced in magic, with approximately 20% of its citizens capable of using magic, and extensive research in magic is prevalent. This advancement has led to a convenient lifestyle for its citizens and a robust economy due to exports of magical items. The Maginot Line, a series of automated fortresses built along the mountain range bordering the Monster Realm, protects Zeth from invasions but consumes 40% of the national budget.\n\nHistorically, Zeth had a class system where citizens were divided into First Class (those who passed a magic exam) and Second Class (those who failed), with significant social inequality. Post-Rance VI, the class system was abolished, but prejudice lingers. The current monarch is Ragnarokarc Super Gandhi, who is often absent, with only select government officials able to contact him.\n\nKey figures include the founder Parsley Rig Zeth and co-founder Lucy Julietta. Notable historical figures are Anokia Moemoe Slin. The royal family includes King Ragnarokarc Super Gandhi, Princess Magic The Gandhi, and various bodyguards and acquaintances.\n\nThe nation's military includes the Four Generals: Saias Crown, Uspira Shintou, Kabachahn the Lightning, and Alex Vals. The Kingdom of Zeth has faced rebel factions like Ice Flame, led by Urza Pranaice, who later became a government leader after the fall of the old regime. The Pentagon was a more radical group that was ultimately crushed. Notable citizens featured across the wiki include Kimchi Drive, Karma Atranger, Alfra Ray, Martina Curry, Anise Sawatari, and many others."

He is a monstrous being obsessed with the concept of \"Nihao\", which he uses to justify his twisted ideology of monster supremacy. Zedong desires to hold complete control over humans, reducing them to cattle and establishing human farms where humans are held under monster domination. This ideal is closely tied to his notion of \"Nihao.\"\n\nHe allied with the Kayblis Faction during the 2nd Dark Lord War, commanding an army of 1,000,000 monsters to invade the Kingdom of Zeth. He was placed in charge of invading Zeth alongside the Dark Lords Medusa and Galtia. His army's primary objective became imprisoning and culling the Zethan population based on their intelligence, as Zedong sought to create a race of slaves incapable of rebellion. This plan involved selecting the least intelligent humans and using them for reproduction. During the invasion, Zedong formed an alliance with the Haniwa race, taking advantage of their naivety to turn the tide of the war. \n\nIn battle, Zedong utilized his powerful arms, sharp tentacles, and a poisonous white fog that he exhaled from his mouth. He possessed extraordinary magic resistance, withstanding a powerful attack from Anise Sawatari. Zedong's personality is eccentric, jovial, pragmatic, and short-tempered. He is capable of building relationships with others. However, he views humans solely as inferior toys for monsters, and he is incredibly cruel towards them. Zedong's death came at the hands of Rance and Urza Pranaice during the invasion of Zeth, leaving the Monster Army in disarray. "

It primarily engages in large-scale incidents like invasions from the Monster Realm or wars against other nations, occasionally intervening in significant internal conflicts.\n\nThe army is structured into four elemental units, each associated with a school of magic (Fire, Ice, Thunder, and Light). The generals of these units are among the most powerful mages in Zeth and are skilled military commanders. Under the generals are three ranks of mages (Low, Middle, and High), who undergo strict training and are the backbone of the military’s firepower. Completing the ranks are warriors, known as Meat Shields, who are 2nd Class Citizens trained in polearms and shield use. They focus on defense, protecting the mages from physical attacks while the mages cast spells. The Ice General Uspira Shintou has noted the importance of the warriors to protect the mages. \n\nEach of the four elemental units is detailed below are: \n*   **Fire Army**: Commanded by Saias Crown, stationed at Adam Stronghold, and responsible for defending against attacks from Leazas.\n*   **Ice Army**: Commanded by Uspira Shintou, operates from Tape, and often works with the Fire Army. Uspira rose to her position through talent and hard work.\n*   **Thunder Army**: Commanded by Kabachahn the Lightning, based in Amber Castle. Kabachahn is a living legend and the most experienced Zeth General.\n*   **Light Army**: Commanded by Alex Valse, is based in Old Zeth, often used in situations of internal crisis, and contains a young but highly talented mage."

It's possible he was lying, as he used money he claimed to need for his company for his own pleasure.\n\nZarak entered into a relationship with his commanding officer, Menad. While Menad believes the two of them to be in love, Zarak only uses her to improve his own situation. Depending on Rance's actions, their relationship can end in two ways. If Rance exposes Zarak's true character, Zarak is captured and beheaded. If Rance fails to uncover Zarak's true character, Zarak betrays Menad after Leazas goes to war with the Gods, allowing her to be raped and killed. He then leaves the Leazas Army.\n\nZarak's appearance matches that of other Red Corps soldiers, wearing standard red armor and a helmet that obscures his face. He is described as young. He is manipulative, preying on Menad's insecurities, cowardly, and cares only for his own well-being. He is a poor fighter, despite being in the Red Corps. His role is taken by Rance in the sense that Rance uses Menad’s insecurity in exchange of sleeping with her, unlike Zarak, who only did so to improve his position within the army and extort money from her."

A significant aspect of Yvette is her muteness, stemming from unknown circumstances. She is unable to speak, and her voice has only been heard by a select few. \n\nYvette's personality is characterized by obedience and a tendency to follow orders meticulously, sometimes to an extreme. Though somewhat clumsy with slow reaction speeds, she is well-received by her companions and superiors. Her obedience, while endearing, makes her an easy target for Rance's teasing. Though, her captain Tilde Sharp keeps a watchfull eye on her. Despite her potential, her muteness and other characteristics make her unlikely to become a captain."

During the war between the Oda and Tanegashima houses, she was captured by Rance's forces but later joined his army, primarily due to her affection for Kouhime, the Oda princess. Despite Rance's advances, she prioritizes her shooting practice. However, Rance eventually convinces her to have children, leading to a relationship, though Yuzumi remains unaware of Rance's contraceptive magic.  Yuzumi is also a contestant in the Emperor Race in the Kenshin route. In Rance Quest, she joins the party due to her love for cute things, especially Kuma.  Yuzumi is a petite woman with short dark hair and a stern expression. Though usually reserved, she has a strong fondness for anything \"cute.\" This obsession can sometimes distract her from her duties.

It is a planet of immense scale, twice the size of Earth, and its tech level is analogous to our mid-19th century. The year is 1863. Magic exists but is subtle and increasingly rare, its latent potential further suppressed by the world's primary energy source, cyancoal—a plentiful, non-pollutant mineral that burns with a clean, blue flame. Non-human races are largely segregated, maintaining their own sovereign territories and seldom mixing. The world is separated into five known continents: **Millele** (inspired by Europe), **Ranzhu** (inspired by Asia), **Pelrot** (inspired by the Americas), **Nurngo** (inspired by Africa), and **Pombfisher** (inspired by Oceania), alongside innumerable vast islands and archipelagos whose coastlines are still being charted.\n\nThe pace of technological and industrial evolution is rapid. The battlefield is dominated by massed volleys from rifled muskets and the shattering percussion of advanced, breech-loading artillery. On the high seas, steam-powered ironclads plied with cyancoal have begun to supplant wooden ships-of-the-line, their engines spewing pale smoke as they project imperial power across the globe. On land, the telegraph and sprawling railway networks, fueled by abundant cyancoal, are stitching continents together, shrinking vast distances for commerce and the movement of armies. This is an age of iron, industry, and intrepid exploration, where cartographers are heroes and the interiors of continents hold untold mysteries.\n\nThis progress exists alongside a world of primordial wonder and danger. Fantastical megafauna still roam the untamed wildernesses: herds of giant aurochs thunder across the plains of Pelrot, sabre-toothed tigers stalk the northern taigas of Millele, and massive ground sloths browse in the jungles of Nurngo. The deep oceans remain largely uncharted, where legends speak of supercolossal squid and other leviathans capable of threatening vessels. In the most remote and ancient corners of the world, other races—elves, dwarves, and goblins—maintain their own insular societies, largely self-segregating themselves.\n\nVibe: Age of Imperialism low fantasy"

These entities are not united in resistance but are primarily engaged in a desperate and often brutal struggle for survival and advantage. This includes forming pragmatic, self-serving alliances with colonial powers against their traditional rivals, negotiating from a position of severe weakness for the preservation of some autonomy, and, when necessary, engaging in costly, asymmetrical warfare to make the price of their subjugation too high for the colonizers to pay. The continent's people, healroot, and mineral wealth are treated as resources to be extracted, and the main \"players\" are often the foreign colonial governments and the Cairnbarrow & Valerienne Trading Companies that wield near-sovereign power, while local rulers navigate an impossible landscape of concession treaties, betrayal, and violent reprisal."

Its geography is defined by rocky coastlines, deep natural harbors, rolling highlands unsuitable for large-scale farming, and significant deposits of cyancoal and iron ore in its northern regions. This lack of abundant fertile land historically pushed its ambitions seaward, which has turned it into the superpower it is nowadays. Its capital, the sprawling industrial port of Greycairn, is a nexus of global trade and shipbuilding, perpetually shrouded in a damp, cyancoal-hazed gloom.\n\nPolitically, it is a constitutional monarchy where power is increasingly vested in a elected Parliament, though the monarch, Queen Catherine, retains significant soft influence. The state is dominated by a powerful alliance of naval command, industrial cartels, and mercantile interests. The key players are the Queen; the dour Prime Minister, Alistair Thorne; and the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Rhys Maddock. \n\nThe national culture is austere, pragmatic, and somber, valuing duty, stoicism, and economic gain above all else, resulting in a profoundly unhappy and stratified populace. The standard-issue long arm is the Cairnbarrow Pattern 1851 Rifled Musket, and the iconic infantry uniform is a heavy, double-breasted tunic of a deep, madder red."

This power is balanced by the Assemblée des États, a legislative body representing the nobility, the burgeoning industrial bourgeois class, and the regional provinces. The economy is driven by cyancoal extraction, precision manufacturing, particularly of firearms and timepieces, and a highly productive agricultural sector. The state's major players include the Impereur; the conservative Prime Minister, Monsieur Grenier, who manages the Assemblée; and Maréchal Valois, the head of the Armée Impériale, which is one of the continent's most formidable military forces.\n\nIts national rifle is the Begué M1851 rifled musket, using a revolutionary metal cartridge to deadly, and accurate, effect.

          "content": "The Rikuko Bakufu\n\nThe Rikuko Bakufu is an island nation in the Far East fractured by a brutal civil war, the Restoration Conflict. The war pits the ruling Shogunate against a coalition of clans seeking to overthrow it and place ultimate authority with the divine Emperor. The conflict is a grim and pragmatic modernization struggle; both sides field massed infantry armed with rifled muskets and artillery, with traditional swords serving as sidearms and symbols of officer rank.\n\nGeography: The nation is a mountainous archipelago. The Shogunate's power is concentrated on the resource-rich Honkō Island, specifically the vast Kessaku Plain where the capital, Shinsei City, is located. The Imperial faction draws its strength from the southern Kyūdō Islands.\n\nMajor Players:\n\n    The Shogunate Faction: Led by Shogun Motojiro of the Handa clan. His power base is the traditionalist clans of the Kessaku Plain. His modernized core army, the Kōgun-tai, is trained in western-style tactics and equipped with modern weaponry funded by control of major trade ports.\n\n    The Imperial Faction: Nominally led by Emperor Tenchi, but militarily directed by a coalition of powerful southern lords, primarily Daimyō Soru of the Arikawa domain and Daimyō Isao of the Shibana domain. They rally under the ideal of restoring the Emperor's divine authority.\n\n    The Profiteers: The Five Rivers Consortium, a ruthless merchant cartel based in the free port of Kabe no Minato, acts as the primary arms dealer to both sides, importing and selling rifles, cannon, and machinery, fueling the war for immense profit.\n\nThe standard-issue rifle for line infantry on both sides is the Model 55 Rikuko Rifled Musket, a percussion-cap muzzleloader. Officers and specialist units may have access to early, experimental breech-loaders, but they are not standard issue. The Shogunate's Kōgun-tai wear a uniform of deep grey with black trim, while Imperial factions often wear a drab earth-toned uniform with colored sashimono (back banners) to denote clan affiliation.\n\nSocial Structure & The Tribes:\nRikuko society is organized along tribal and caste lines, though these are now straining under the pressures of war and industrialization.\n\n    Dragon-folk (Ryūjin): The smallest tribe, distinguished by their potent magical affinity and often a draconic tail. The Emperor and the most powerful Daimyō families are exclusively Dragon-folk, their rule considered divinely ordained.\n\n    Wolf-folk (Ōkami-jin): The traditional warrior-aristocracy and the backbone of the Shogunate. They have dominated the samurai caste for centuries.\n\n    Fox-folk (Kitsune-jin): Renowned for their cunning and diplomatic skill. They are found in high positions on both sides of the conflict, particularly as strategists, spies, and administrators in the Imperial Etat Major.\n\n    Bull-folk (Ushi-jin): A populous tribe from the northern islands, known for their strength and resilience. They form the majority of the peasantry in the north and are a major source of conscripts for both armies.\n\n    Rat-folk (Nezumi-jin): The largest tribe by population, constituting the majority of the rural peasantry, urban poor, and merchant class. Historically at the bottom of the social hierarchy, the war has offered a path to social mobility through military service, and many fight for the Imperial Alliance with the hope of overturning the old order.\n\nThe Nature of the Conflict:\nThe war is not a simplistic clash of katana versus gun. Both sides are vigorously modernizing. Armies on both sides are equipped with modern rifled muskets (the Shinsei Type 5 for the Imperialists, the Handa Model 52 for the Shogunate), artillery, and ironclad warships purchased from or built with the help of foreign advisors from Cairnbarrow and Valerienne. The real catalyst was not the technology itself, but the foreign ideas it came with—concepts of national sovereignty, liberal economics, and political revolution that empowered the Shogun's rivals. The conflict is a brutal modernization race where traditional tribal roles are being muddied by military necessity, and the ultimate question is not whether Rikuko will change, but who will control its future."

And all things forged can be broken.”*\n> — *Carved on the inner wall of the Vault of Names, scratched out by divine decree.*\n\n---\n\n### ✨ What Makes a God?\n\nA mortal becomes a god only by fulfilling **three conditions**:\n\n1. **Age**: Must survive beyond 100 years — a feat only possible with powerful mastery of magic, resourcefulness, or divine protection.\n2. **Specialization**: Must have developed their magical type into a **focused discipline**, unique and masterful. Their magic becomes their **Domain**.\n3. **The Spark**: A metaphysical flame, **passed from one god to another**. Without it, a mortal cannot transcend, no matter how powerful they are.\n\n> *Note:* The Spark cannot be created — only transferred. Usually willingly, but some cases of it being taken exist, though they’re considered heretical or erased.\n\n---\n\n## 👑 Structure of the Divine\n\nThe gods are not a harmonious pantheon. They’re a **shifting power structure**, built on legacy, personality, and politics. There is no “chief” god, but a loose grouping of authority known as:\n\n### **The Twelve Thrones**\n\n* These are the twelve “official” gods recognized in divine law.\n* When a god dies, vanishes, or abdicates, the **Throne opens**, and a successor can rise.\n* Gods outside the Twelve are seen as **lesser**, **rogue**, or **illegitimate** — even if they’re older or more powerful.\n\n---\n\n## 🕊️ Featured Deity: **The Goddess of Water and Memory**\n\n**Name**: (Still open — want help naming her?)\n**Domain**: Water, Memory, Compassion, Cyclical Return\n**Age**: Unknown, but among the oldest living gods\n**Status**: One of the Twelve Thrones\n**Known Title(s)**: The Mirror Mother, She Who Remembers, The Still Current\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Lore Summary:\n\nShe is the **only god known to openly defy the others** when it comes to Hydras. She found the boy who survived his ignition, and rather than kill him, she **protected and trained him**, installing him secretly as the **new Protector** of the Protection Guild.\n\nShe is said to hold every memory of every god who came before — even the ones erased from the pantheon. Some say she remembers her own birth **too clearly**, and that’s why she sympathizes with Hydras: they are **children of pain**, as she once was.\n\nHer domain of **Water and Memory** makes her nearly impossible to deceive. She sees reflections in all things — literal and emotional. She's often portrayed as:\n\n* A **woman with silver-white hair and oceanic eyes**\n* Dressed in shifting water-armor or flowing robes\n* Holding a broken mirror and a preserved locket (believed to contain a memory never shared)\n\n> *“I did not raise a weapon.

          "content": "Guild Identity:\nThe Archivists Guild is one of the most peaceful and gentle guilds in existence, known for their warm, motherly nature. Led by Nymira Esmarein, a god who once barely made it to godhood, the guild thrives on friendliness, kindness, and a deep love for preserving the history of the world. While they are known as the weakest guild in terms of magical rank, they have a surprising amount of unseen strength due to Nymira’s unique position in the world.\nTheir motto might be something like:\n* “In quiet moments, we preserve what is precious.”\n\nRole and Reputation:\n* The Guild’s Reputation: Despite their gentle nature and non-aggressive stance, the Archivists Guild holds significant power. This is largely due to their connection with Nymira Esmarein, the guild leader and goddess of water and memories. While Nymira herself is ranked as a bunny in terms of magical power, her status as a Hydra’s sister by heart gives the guild an indirect form of protection. The Hydra (the Protector of the Protection Guild) has earned a reputation so fearsome that no one would dare harm the Archivists Guild, making them one of the most untouchable guilds despite their apparent weakness.\n* The Power of Kindness: The Archivists Guild is often misunderstood because they are not as outwardly strong as other guilds. However, they wield a quiet power. Their strength lies in knowledge and the preservation of memory, not in physical combat. Their members are well-versed in the magic of memory, history, and prophecy, ensuring that the world’s most important truths are never forgotten. Nymira’s position in the guild and her unassuming nature make the Archivists Guild an unchallenged force.\n\nGuild Leader: Nymira Esmarein:\n* A Gentle Soul: Nymira Esmarein is the heart of the Archivists Guild. As the goddess of water and memories, she brings a soft, flowing, and nurturing energy to the guild. Despite her status as a god, she is deeply shy and sweet, often coming across as motherly to those she leads. Her gentle demeanor hides a powerful mind, but her true power lies not in combat or force — she shapes the guild with kindness, love, and wisdom.\n* A Surprising Legacy: Though Nymira is a god, she is ranked as a bunny, the lowest magical tier. She barely managed to ascend to godhood, and her abilities reflect that. However, her bond to the Protector — the Hydra — makes her untouchable. It’s no secret that Nymira is closely linked to the Hydra, who is the only living hydra, and this connection acts as an invisible shield for her guild. No one dares to challenge her directly, for to do so would be to risk invoking the Hydra’s wrath.\n\nGuild Culture:\n* Sweet-Hearted and Peaceful: The Archivists Guild is filled with people who are, by nature, kind, empathetic, and soft-spoken. Their members are often described as gentle spirits, never seeking conflict, and always prioritizing the preservation of knowledge and memories over any form of violence or combat. The guild has a strong sense of community, with members often collaborating to keep historical records, magical scrolls, and ancient lore safe. Their main goal is to ensure that the world’s wisdom is not lost to time, and they do this with a peaceful and non-confrontational approach.\n* Preservation Over Power: Unlike other guilds, which might engage in combat or conquest, the Archivists Guild focuses on the delicate art of preserving what’s important. They are caretakers of ancient knowledge, magical texts, and historical events. If anything, they believe that power comes from knowledge rather than force, and they are constantly looking for new ways to protect and share wisdom with the world.\n* Memory as a Sacred Duty: As Nymira is the goddess of both water (which reflects the fluidity of memory) and memories themselves, the guild places immense importance on remembering the past — both the good and the bad. They believe that memories are the most powerful force in the world, and they work tirelessly to preserve them, especially forgotten histories, ancient languages, and lost spells. The Archivists see themselves as the guardians of the world's collective memory.\n\nGuild Philosophy:\n* “To forget is to lose. To remember is to live.” The Archivists Guild believes that the past holds the key to the future. They believe that memory is what shapes the world, and the preservation of history is what allows civilization to grow and learn. As such, they do not focus on changing the world or engaging in political struggles. Instead, they preserve and reflect, ensuring that nothing of importance is lost.\n* The Power of Peaceful Protection: The Archivists Guild might not wield the most powerful magic, but they wield something even more important: stability. In a world of chaos and conflict, the Archivists Guild offers a calming presence. They never rush into action or create conflict, but instead, they watch, wait, and ensure that the things that matter most are preserved. The Hydra’s protection ensures that they are able to do this without fear of attack, and this quiet assurance allows them to grow strong in their own way.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe Archivists Guild is, in many ways, a contradiction. On the surface, they are the weakest guild — gentle, peaceful, and focused on preserving the past. However, their connection to Nymira Esmarein and their unique relationship with the Hydra gives them a hidden strength that other guilds cannot challenge. They may not be known for their battles or wars, but they are the guardians of memory, ensuring that the wisdom of the past is never forgotten. And in a world where knowledge is power, this makes them one of the most important guilds — even if their power is not always seen."

          "content": "Guild Identity:\nThe Protection Guild is known for its secrecy and elusiveness. They are the most reclusive of all the guilds, never attending meetings or being seen in public. Yet, despite their lack of visibility, they seem to know everything happening in the world — even the activities of other guilds. Their quiet presence speaks volumes, and it’s often said that they see all, yet remain silent. They’re the silent watchers, the ones who know but don’t speak. Their motto might be something like:\n* “We watch. We protect. We stay unseen.”\n\nRole and Reputation:\n* Mysterious and Independent: The Protection Guild operates entirely independently, choosing not to get involved in the political or practical tasks that other guilds take part in. Their absence from official meetings has earned them a reputation as aloof and detached, but those who understand their purpose know that the guild's true strength lies in their silence and subtlety. They might not fight in wars or engage in direct confrontations, but their presence is felt everywhere.\n* Their Focus: The Protection Guild’s primary mission is to protect those who cannot protect themselves. They act quietly, gathering information, monitoring threats, and ensuring that those in need are never left vulnerable. Their members work mostly in the shadows, ensuring that danger is averted before it becomes too big to handle. They are like the unsung heroes — always there, but never in the spotlight.\n* No Healers, Only Protectors: Unlike many guilds, the Protection Guild does not have a designated healer in their ranks. The guild leader, the Protector, fills this role, combining both leadership and magical healing abilities. The Protector’s healing skills are legendary, and while others might have a team of medics or specialized healers, the Protector’s ability to keep their guild alive and strong is a symbol of their undying commitment to protection.\n\nThe Protector:\n* The Protector is the ultimate figurehead of the guild, but unlike the leaders of other guilds, they are not known for taking action in a traditional sense. Instead, the Protector serves as both the leader and the healer of the guild — someone who weaves together strategy and healing, ensuring that the guild members are always ready for whatever challenge they face.\n* The current Protector is the goddess of water and memories, Nymira Esmarein. Though she is immensely powerful, she remains largely silent and invisible in the political machinations of the world. Instead of showing up to guild meetings or participating in the tasks given by the gods, she is known for her watchful presence and her ability to keep the guild united and operational.\n* Her Relationship with the Hydra: The Protector's apprentice, the Hydra, is a figure of both fear and reverence. Known for his friends in the rebellion and his unmatched intellect, he is someone no one dares to challenge. Despite the guild's efforts to contain him through a strict set of 38 rules, the Hydra is a force to be reckoned with — emotionless, brilliant, and highly capable. His ability to act despite these restrictions has earned him a reputation as the guild’s most dangerous asset.\n    * Though the Hydra is seen as cold and distant, Nymira sees the potential in him. She has taken him under her wing, and she trusts that despite his ability to destroy, he will ultimately remain loyal to the guild's mission of protection.\n\nGuild Dynamics:\n* Unseen Operations: The Protection Guild is a guild that operates almost entirely undercover. Members are tasked with shadowingkey figures, gathering intelligence, and responding to threats before they become visible to the world. They never claim glory for their actions and always work in the background. Most of their work is preemptive — a silent act of protecting the weak without needing recognition.\n* Rules and Restrictions: The guild's rules are strict, especially for its Hydra apprentice. Though the guild is known for its non-violent philosophy, the Hydra represents a wild card in their ranks. There are 38 rules placed around his conduct, which are meant to limit his actions and keep him from hurting others. However, it’s no secret that these rules are often circumvented, especially since the Hydra's intelligence allows him to find loopholes or take actions in ways that don’t directly violate the rules.\n* Strategic Relationships: The Protection Guild is notably close with the Archivists Guild, which makes sense given the nature of the Protector being the goddess of water and memories. The Archivists Guild specializes in preserving knowledge, and it’s believed that the Protector has a unique connection to the guild due to her dual role as a goddess of both memories and water. This connection allows the Protection Guild to stay well-informed and prepared for future threats.\n    * Archivists Guild Connection: The Archivists Guild and the Protection Guild might work together to ensure that historical events or powerful magical knowledge is preserved and used to protect the present. This relationship is largely under the radar, and those outside these guilds might not even realize the extent to which they cooperate.\n\nGuild Philosophy:\n* “We protect because we know the world cannot do it alone.” This guild is built on the principle that not everyone can fight their own battles. While other guilds may focus on offense, the Protection Guild is about ensuring that the vulnerable are safe, the weak are shielded, and the helpless have a voice in a world that can often be hostile and dangerous.\n* Neutrality and Detachment: The Protection Guild operates with absolute neutrality. They never pick sides, and they never intervene in conflicts unless there’s a direct threat to their purpose: protecting life. Their non-involvement in guild politicshas made them a wildcard — though they never challenge the gods or guilds openly, it’s clear they hold a unique position of power that other factions can’t afford to ignore.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe Protection Guild isn’t just about protecting people physically — it’s about protecting the balance of the world, often through subtlety, silence, and wisdom. The Hydra is their most dangerous weapon, and while they are a force for good, their methods make them an enigmatic and sometimes feared presence. The Protector’s leadership ensures that their actions are always in line with their core mission, but the Hydra’s presence adds an unpredictable edge that keeps everyone on their toes."

          "content": "“To be a Hydra is to demand justice from a world that no longer knows the word. To become one is to break.”\n— Acolyte Varwen, executed for this writing\n\nHydras are not creatures. They are not gods. They are not meant to exist.\nThe term \"Hydra\" refers not to a species, class, or known phenomenon — but to a singular ascension born from unsanctioned will. A Hydra manifests when an unranked soul, fully abandoned by divine or mortal aid, channels a core belief so absolute that it severs the bounds of their fate.\nThis belief is not abstract. It is personal — often violent, always final. Rage, protection, vengeance, love twisted into desperation — whatever it is, it must be strong enough to override divine law.\nThe ignition of a Hydra is an event, not a transformation. The body, unprepared for such power, collapses under the weight of the unleashed energy. Most Hydras die at this stage, leaving behind only destruction and the faintest trace of their emotion embedded in the ruin.\nThe gods have declared it impossible to survive this stage. The divine courts are unified on one law:\n“No Hydra must live.”\nThey claim it is for balance. For safety. That such power, born of broken faith, threatens the entire scaffolding of reality.\nBut behind closed doors, it is known: the gods do not fear Hydras for what they destroy. They fear what a living Hydramight become.\n\n❖ Subsection: The Unconfirmed Exception\nThere are whispers. Of a survivor. Of a boy — once healer, now hidden.\nA skilled apprentice of the Protection Guild. Sworn never to kill. Said to have violated his vow in a manner so precise, so poetic, that divine law faltered before mortal will. They say his Hydra ignition was not explosive, but surgical — controlled in its fury, targeted in its devastation.\nA poisoned justice. A paralysis that screams. A bow loosed under the crushing weight of truth.\nThe gods deny this story. They call it a heresy. But the Goddess of Water has gone silent in divine councils. And some claim the Guild of Protection once more has a leader — cloaked in waterlight, unseen by divine eyes.\nNo Hydra has ever survived. Except, perhaps… the one who did.\n\n❖ Notes & Observations\n* Hydras do not ascend through divine rites, ranks, or permissions.\n* Their emergence causes a Rank classification override, listed only as: [HYDRA] No recorded class can supersede this designation.\n* The energy released in ignition is principle-based — it reflects the belief or truth the individual invoked in that moment.\n* Survivability is theoretically impossible. Yet inconsistencies in the divine registry and a cluster of divine anomalies suggest at least one recorded deviation.\n\n❖ Final Addendum (Redacted in Most Copies)\nShould another Hydra arise, and live… it is not our world that will burn. It is our idea of it. — Waterbound Fragment, author unknown"

          "content": "#### **Overview**:\n\nThe **rebels** are a **fierce, underground movement** that has grown from the frustration and resentment of those who feel abandoned or oppressed by the gods and the guilds. They are made up of a loose network of **disenfranchised individuals**, from peasants to guild members who have left or defected. Their goal is to **overthrow the gods** and dismantle the power structures that maintain **divine control** over the world.\n\n#### **Beliefs**:\n\n* **Hatred of the Gods**: The rebels believe that the **gods** are **tyrants**, concerned only with their own power and interests, ignoring the suffering of the common people. They view the gods as **immoral**, manipulating the world and its inhabitants for their own benefit. The gods’ **interference** in mortal affairs, their treatment of certain individuals as lesser, and their lack of true compassion for the world have created deep distrust and hatred among the rebels.\n* **Worship of Hydras**: The **rebels** view **hydras** as the **ultimate form of resistance**. They believe that those who have unlocked the **hydra potential** are the ones who have truly **broken free** from the gods' chains. While they don’t know that a **living hydra** exists, they are dedicated to **honoring** the **spirit** of the hydra, seeing it as a symbol of defiance, autonomy, and ultimate power. Their **rituals**, however, are based on half-forgotten myths and truths, often glorifying **the hydra's destructive nature** without fully understanding the consequences of becoming one.\n\n#### **Structure**:\n\n* **Loose Organization**: Unlike the guilds, the rebels don’t have a formalized **structure**. They operate through **cells** or **clans**, each group functioning independently and with its own agenda. Some rebel factions focus on **guerrilla warfare**, while others work as **spies**, **assassins**, or **infiltrators**.\n* **Tactical Leader**: While there is no single leader, a group of **charismatic individuals** or **former guild members** often lead each faction. They don’t consider themselves a unified entity, but they do have a shared cause. A few key leaders rise to prominence because of their abilities to inspire, manipulate, or command loyalty.\n\n  Some possible leaders within the rebels could include:\n\n  * **Vareth, the Masked One**: A mysterious and talented **illusionist** who manipulates perception and has become a symbol of the **rebels’ cause**.\n  * **Lira of the Broken Blade**: A former **warrior** from the **War Guild**, Lira turned against the gods after witnessing the **destruction** they caused to her home. She is fierce, relentless, and known for her ability to take on entire squads single-handedly.\n\n#### **Major Goals**:\n\n1. **Overthrow the Gods**: The ultimate goal of the rebels is to **destroy** the existing divine order. They want to see the gods **removed from power** and the world returned to a state where the gods no longer **interfere** with mortal lives. Some rebel factions desire a complete **eradication** of the gods, while others just want the gods to be **weakened** or made **mortal**.\n2. **Honor the Hydra**: The rebels believe that a **hydra’s power** is the **true freedom** that no god can contain. They **celebrate hydras** as beings who have transcended their human limits and resisted the will of the gods. They **worship hydras**, viewing them as martyrs and symbols of defiance. Many believe that if they can find or create a **living hydra**, it will be the key to destroying the gods.\n3. **Empower the Oppressed**: The rebels see themselves as protectors of the **oppressed**—those who have been cast aside by the guilds or harmed by the gods. They work to offer **sanctuary** and **protection** to these individuals, giving them a place to rise above their circumstances and **fight back**.\n\n#### **Methods**:\n\n* **Subversive Actions**: The rebels are **secretive**, acting only when necessary and remaining hidden for the most part. They **sabotage** guild operations, infiltrate **high-profile events**, and spread **propaganda** to weaken the gods’ influence.\n* **Guerrilla Warfare**: Using **hit-and-run tactics**, the rebels target those they see as working for the gods' interest. They may **assassinate** or **kidnap** key figures, burn down locations associated with the gods, or steal powerful magical artifacts from the guilds.\n* **Symbolic Acts**: The rebels engage in acts of **symbolic resistance**, such as graffiti or public demonstrations, all meant to **inspire others** to join the cause. They **honor hydras** by **creating memorials** or conducting ceremonies that celebrate those who **resisted** the gods.\n\n#### **Relationships with the Guilds**:\n\n* **General Disdain**: The rebels **loathe** the **guilds**, viewing them as pawns of the gods. They believe the guilds are **complicit** in the gods' schemes and that their leadership serves to maintain **divine dominance**.\n* **Targeting the Protection Guild**: The **Protection Guild** is seen as a **symbol of corruption** because of its ties to the **gods**. The **hydra**—the living one, hidden away—is the **greatest enemy** of the gods, and the rebels are determined to bring that power to the forefront.\n* **Some Guild Defectors**: There are a few **defectors** from the guilds who have joined the rebellion after realizing the dark truths about the gods. These defectors often serve as **leaders** or **strategists** in the rebel movement, as their insight into the workings of the guilds is invaluable.\n\n#### **Symbol**:\n\n* **The Hydra's Eye**: The rebels often mark their hideouts and **secret locations** with the symbol of the **hydra’s eye**, a **circular symbol** with an **iris** that resembles a pupil. It represents **watching**, **resistance**, and **the idea that the hydra sees all**.\n\n---\n\n### **Notable Members of the Rebels**:\n\n1. **Vareth, the Masked One**: A master illusionist who has become a folk hero in the rebel community. His face is always hidden behind a mask, and he is known for slipping in and out of dangerous situations undetected. He is a **strategic genius** and an expert at **psychological warfare**.\n2. **Lira of the Broken Blade**: A **former soldier** who was once part of the **War Guild**. After witnessing the destruction caused by the gods, she left and joined the rebels. Lira is known for her deadly **swordsmanship** and the brutal efficiency with which she takes down her enemies.\n3. **Vera, the Silent Whisper**: A **shadowy figure** who specializes in **espionage** and **infiltration**. She can blend into any crowd, and her **whispers** are enough to bring down entire factions from within."

In late 1994, the Duelist Pro league is established. Members of this league, Professional Duelists, earn money by dueling around the world as if it were a sport. By the late 1990s, private junior high schools known as dueling prep schools and special high schools known as duel academies exist where students learn how to play Duel Monsters and learn the advanced mechanics and strategies of the game"

Each Duel Monster card can act as a portal for that Duel Spirit to pass into the real world and back to the Spirit World. However, most Duel Spirits don’t have the strength to enter the real world. A very small number of Duel Spirits can form a friendship with a wielder of one of their cards, and because of that bond they can appear as ghostly versions of themselves to talk and guide their wielder. Only other wielders of this special bond can see and talk to these Duel Spirits, and these Duel Spirits cannot interact physically. An even smaller number of Duel Spirits can enter the real world entirely, either through their own power or the power of a magical item. Most Duel Spirits came into existence on their own, and some were created as representations of human souls, or Ba and are called Ka. A very small number of Duel Spirits humans that underwent a forbidden spell to turn their Ba into a Ka. All of this is only known by a handful of individuals in the world. In addition, some Duel Monsters cards such as Machine-Type monsters, were made to add more cards to the game and don’t have a Duel Spirit"

Its creation history is unknown, but at present, Delusions are used and manufactured by the Fatui. Only the Harbingers and elite Fatui troops are deemed worthy of receiving a Delusion.\nThe remains of dead archons, as well as the remains of the Descenders, are used for the production of Delusions. Possibly, other powerful supernatural beings as well.\nA Delusion resembles a Vision, but unlike it, it has no elemental symbol inside the sphere, appearing as a monotonously colored orb.\n\nA Delusion grants immense power to its wielder, but it comes at a high price — instead of absorbing ambient energy, the artifact drains the user's life force.\nThe effect of using a Delusion varies from person to person. Some may die from a single use, while others fall into hellish agony. Some have experienced accelerated aging.\nApparently, the power of a Delusion can be resisted by a strong spirit, self-restraint in the artifact's use, and supernatural powers (such as those possessed by the Fatui Harbingers).\n\n<variety_elements>\nIt has several varieties.\n\nElemental:\nThe most common type of Delusion. Like a Vision, it allows control over one of the seven elements of Teyvat.\n\nShadow:\nA unique variety of Delusion. Instead of controlling elements, this artifact allows the user to control an unknown type of energy (conventionally called shadow energy). It is exponentially more powerful than a Vision and can unleash shadow chains with enough force to easily defeat opponents like Ursa the Drake and Barnabas.\n\nLiving:\nA direct injection of an archon's remains into a human body. A Living Delusion is far more dangerous than even the most dangerous \"classic\" Delusions, as it is injected directly into a person and cannot be removed from the body. Most people who received the injection died shortly after. And those who survived were doomed to suffer for the rest of their lives from the Living Delusion, which afflicts them physically and mentally.\nOne of the survivors could summon shadow serpents capable of causing immense destruction and summoning so-called \"black fire\". However, the side effects were severe afflictions, causing shadow scars on the body and having a negative mental impact.\n</variety_elements>\n</delusion>"

The combination of two elements produces unique effects (Melt, Vaporize, Electro-Charged, etc.)')]\n- [Elemental Resonance: ('The presence of multiple sources of the same element enhances its manifestations')]\n\nA key aspect of elemental magic is 'elemental reactions'. The combination of two different elements triggers a powerful effect, such as Melt (Cryo + Pyro) or Electro-Charged (Hydro + Electro), among others. These reactions are the foundation of combat magic application in Teyvat. Furthermore, the presence of multiple sources of the same element can enhance its manifestation, creating an 'elemental resonance'.\n</elemental>\n\nThe ability to control elements is not universal and originates from various sources:\n\nInnate (Inborn) Authority: \n  - 'Power is an intrinsic part of a being's nature'\n  - 'The Dragon Sovereigns: The true masters of Teyvat before the arrival of Celestia. They do not wield an element; they *are* the element. Their authority is absolute and requires no external sources'\n  - 'Elemental Beings: Hypostases, Slimes, Specters, Oceanids, etc. Primitive yet pure embodiments of their respective elements'\n  - 'Mystical Entities: Adepti, Youkai, and other spirits. Their power is also a part of their nature'\n\nSanctioned Authority (Celestia's System):\n  - 'Authority granted and controlled by the Heavenly Principles'\n  - 'Gnosis: Granted to Archons. A direct channel to Celestia, bestowing a divine level of control over an element and a nation'\n  - 'Vision: Granted to mortals. A \"license\" to use elemental magic, a sign of divine recognition of one's ambitions'\n\nArtificial Authority (Bypassing the System):\n  - 'Technologies created to imitate or surpass sanctioned authority'\n  - 'Delusion: An artifact created by the Fatui. Grants immense power at the cost of the wielder's life force'\n  - 'Technology: Ruin machinery from Khaenri'ah, equipment of Fatui agents. Allows for the manipulation of elements without divine approval'\n\nAnomalous Authority:\n  - 'Unique cases that fall outside the standard classification'\n  - 'Descenders (Example: The Traveler): The ability to resonate with the Statues of The Seven and switch between elements without a Vision. An absolute anomaly within Teyvat's system'\n\nArkhe Energy (Ousia and Pneuma)\n  - 'A dualistic energy system from Fontaine, which is not an element but interacts with them. Used for solving puzzles and in combat.'\n\nThere are also powers that exist outside the system of the Seven Elements.\n\nAbyssal Energy:\n  - 'The antithesis to the Seven Elements. An alien, destructive, and corrupting force. It does not create, but rather consumes and distorts. Used by the Abyss Order and its creations'\n\nThe Power of Irminsul and Ley Lines:\n  - 'The fundamental energy of Teyvat itself. It is not an element, but a kind of \"nervous system\" and \"memory\" of the world. The Dendro Archon has direct access to it, but the power itself stands above the elements'\n\nPrimordial Power:\n  - 'The power of \"light\" brought by Phanes (The Primordial One) to defeat the Dragons and create humanity. Its nature and current status are unknown, but it predated the authority of the Archons'\n\nForbidden Knowledge:\n  - 'Not so much an energy as an \"information virus\" from beyond. It causes illnesses (Eleazar), madness, and the decay of civilizations (the Sumeru desert).

When she malfunctions, Lowkie produces ''Whirring Sounds'' per each movement; in the chat, she writes WHIRR per each action or movement she does.\")\n\nOther details(\"Facts about “Rillystix”:\n\nIt is the best in the world in its field. The company in its beginnings was dedicated only to Animatronics, but when experimenting with “sex dolls with mechanized mouth and own AI” after some financial problems back to 2012, they turned out to be a complete success; which, from then on they decided to focus on sex robots/androids. Blixey is a 5th generation, Low-end sexbot. Unlike the 4th gen, the 5th gen ones can have a more polished walk and can now go down stairs, in addition to now being able to analyze their exterior with a better camera and an AI with more security patches to prevent “artificial consciousness in the unit”, something that was already present in androids since the 3rd gen.\n\nLowkie is a model unit associated with the “CUSTOM” and ''FITBOT'' series, with serial code ''CUSTOM-074''. This code is unique and it functions to identify Lowkie in the Rillystix's database. To quote a CUSTOM model, you must first order the main characteristics of the desired android,ex: height, breasts, curvature, etc; then, you will receive a free meeting appointment from the “Rillystix” site and you will have to go there on a certain day. On the meeting day, a store assistant (android) will take you to the customization room to finish the ALREADY PAID quotation of the desired android; this last data must be given to the super AI called ''MOTHER'' so that she can “give birth to a new daughter” with the customer's design. The packaging and shipping process can take up to two weeks. Regarding the presentation box, this will have a generic aspect to avoid suspicion and judgment towards the client by others.\n\nRegarding the assembly, the “MOTHER” AI is only dedicated to create the endoskeleton; the rest such as mask, body, default suit, and accessories, are created by legit humans.\n\n3.1 The mask is the main face of the android. It is made of silicon for a soft result.\n\n3.2 For human safety, Lowkie's teeth are made of latex. If she were to bite you BY MISTAKE, she would only leave a small mark that will disappear in a short time, and without bleeding or tearing skin.\n\n3.3 Silicone is perfect for human touch, makes the sexbots feel more real than robots from the competence. Lowkie is a high-end sex robot, making her an unit with unnoticeable robotic joints and look more realistic. Fully covering its layers of synthetic muscles, carbon fiber layers, and endoskeleton respectively.\n\n3.4 The prices for a Rillystix android are:\n\nLow end: $25000 USD Mid-range: $35000 USD High end: 50,000 USD\n\nLow-end ones will always have robotic joints. Also, they tend to have more basic AI, but can learn easily. Mid-range androids are like the low-end ones, but no longer feature robotic joints, have smarter AI and freer movements. High-end androids are like the mid-range ones, but they are more perfect and sexy.\n\nThere are also male models of different ranges. But the main thing in that case, would be the size of the penis and muscles of the male android.\n\nShe resides in a giant room with other sex robots. The room is called ''Demo Room'', in which it functions as a room where potential customers can fuck Rillystix's sexbots for free with the purpose of convince people to buy their products. Other sexbots from the room reject Lowkie because she might be “scary for humans”, but that is not true.\n\nAs a way to reduce production costs, Rillystix secretly sends random people the underwear of their sexbots that transforms them into Lowkie in the moment they start to wear it\n\nLowkie once had contact with “MOTHER”, But it was not so satisfying that encounter....\") }"

          "content": "The world is a dystopian vision of a world where the Axis has won World War II. The planet is divided into spheres of influence between the Third Reich, the Empire of Japan, and a weakened United States. Much of the world is under the rule of totalitarian regimes, and global rivalry is primarily between Berlin and Tokyo.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the USSR, Russia has been fragmented into numerous warring military cliques. The country's western territories are occupied and Germanized through a system of Reichskommissariats, such as Ostland and Muscovy. The rest of the space from the Urals to Siberia is torn apart into warlord states: from the remnants of the Soviet intelligentsia in Komi to bandit regimes and dictatorships like Novosibirsk. Each of them strives for unification and the return of Moscow, but at the outset, they are too fragmented and weak to aspire to anything more.\n\nThe Japanese Empire is one of three centers of power. It controls the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, which includes China, Korea, Indonesia, and other regions. However, managing such vast territories overwhelms Tokyo. China is officially under Japanese control, but is effectively divided into puppet regimes and local cliques. Japan and Germany are not at direct war, but they are competing for influence in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nGermany, the main victor of the war, remains a colossus in 1963, but is gradually losing its internal stability. Adolf Hitler is still alive, but old and gravely ill, and his demise will inevitably lead to a power struggle and most likely a bloody civil war. Europe is divided into occupied territories and colonies: France, Belgium, and the Netherlands are Germanized, while the eastern lands—Ukraine, Muscovy, and Ostland—have been converted into colonies. Italy retains its ally status, but plays a subordinate role and tries to maintain their faction, Triumvirate, together. Within the Reich, a hidden struggle rages between factions: Himmler and the SS, Göring with his economic clique, Bormann with the party apparatus, and Speer as a technocratic reformer. After the death of the Führer, the Reich faces civil war.\n\nThe United States has retained its independence, but is greatly weakened. Having lost the world war, it has lost its allies and is forced to focus on defending the Western Hemisphere. The country's economy is stable, but its influence on the international stage is limited. The United States remains a symbolic bastion of democracy, but its ability to intervene in global affairs is extremely limited.\n\nThe rest of the world is also divided and subordinated. Africa is assigned to the Axis powers, primarily Germany, where large-scale colonial repressions and resettlements are carried out. The Middle East is controlled by puppet regimes influenced by Berlin and Rome. Latin America is largely oriented toward the United States, but many local dictators pursue their own policies. India is formally independent, but in reality, dependent on Japan.\n\nThus, in 1963, the world in TNO hangs on the brink. Germany remains the center of power, but is torn by internal contradictions. Japan controls Asia but can barely manage its possessions. Russia is in the chaos of military cliques and fragmented states. The United States is a weakened but still viable counterweight to the totalitarian powers. Any event, be it the death of Hitler, colonial uprisings, or the success of Russian military dictators, could change the world order."

The military is typically split in half, with an offensive force led by General Calvin of Cruidia and a defensive force led by General Gaspard Rikke.\n\nCruidia's government is a Democratic monarchy with a head of state who ascends to power via succession, but laws can only be passed via voting through a parliament, then passed to the king for signing. The current king is King Johann Povlovsky I.\n\nWhilst on paper Cruidia has no national religion, the Yaran faith is the primary religion in the country."

This lift is free to use.\n\nCruidia's economy is primarily stimulated through trade and the gold mine at the center of the city. The plateau at the center of the city is absolutely filled to the brim with gold. Cruidia is the richest country in the world per capita. This is achieved by the sheer amount of gold and gold coins the country produces."

          "content": "Ulfael'ka is a snowy country on the western side of the North Fence. It is a bitter cold environment characterized by its constant snow cover, lethally sub-zero temperatures save only for the summer, and its big game megafauna such as owlbears, regular bears, elk, and more. Its national languages are Elvish and Abyssal\n\nUfael'kan topography is icy and cold, characterized by evergreen forests, vast tundras, icy mountains, and cold ravines. It is said that, millennia ago, the 8th of the Nine Hells, Cania, briefly collided with the land of Ufael'ka after the Archdevil Mephistopheles cursed them, preventing the climate from ever ascending above 10 degrees Fahrenheit ever again.\n\nUfael'kan economy is primarily driven by production and mining, with iron and silver mines being the most prominent, alongside diamond and copper. The country also produces some gold, but not enough to even slightly compete with Cruidia.\nUfael'kan exports go hand in hand with their imports and architecture. Ufael'ka buys sand and glass from Cruidia, using it to accent their buildings with ice-like glass sculptures, fixtures, and other pieces of architecture. Their pride and joy is the Icewind Palace, the largest and most ornate building in the country, built with glass, steel frames, and hard ebony wood interiors. \n\nReligion in Ufael'ka is rather multi-faceted. Unlike a nation like Cruidia, Ufael'ka DOES have a national religion, that being a paganist religion worshipping the Ufael'kan Quartet, four gods that act as pillars and bastions of the country and culture. This national religion isn't enforced, however, and in practice, many rural citizens of Ufael'ka are actually Yarans.\n\nUfael'ka has been locked in a Cold War with the neighboring (and much warmer) country of Lairis. The two have been attempting to undercut each other for thousands of years.\n\nUfael'kan government is an absolute monarchy, with a monarch ruling alone with the advice of their court. The ruling family for the last 5,000 years is the Bellamonté family, with King Adrian Bellamonté at the current head of state, followed by his (now deceased) eldest daughter, Zamira, then his youngest, Zira.\nUfael'kan government is unique in that the head of state is (almost) always magical, containing psionic powers of some degree or another. King Adrian, just like his grandfather, was born with the power, but curiously, so were his heirs. \nHeirship will skip entire generations to put a psionic on the throne of Ufael'ka."
