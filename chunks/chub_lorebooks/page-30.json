By the time of late-kyogaya floods that would spark a future war, Inkopolis was considered a regional powerhouse that held a monopoly on ancient human technology compared to its neighbors. By 1913 ME, Inkopolis found itself in a inter-species war against the previously neutral species known as Octarians that would become the most brutal, drawn out conflict in history, with millions dead fighting over land being constantly lost to rising sea levels known as the Great Turf War, which involved the useage of ancient human weapons and technologies such as nuclear bombs and walking weapon platforms. After the Great Turf War, Inkopolis and it's allies were considered victorious and conquered all Octarian lands, driving the Octarians underground and purging any remaining Octarian populations that remained. Today, Inkopolis serves as the global hub for all Inklings and many oceanic species."

It is said it's dreams ARE reality itself and if it ever woke up it would be the end of existence itself. It's claimed that all misfortunes are but bad dreams the Sleeping One has. Common practices in R'lyehism include Communal gatherings, Sacrifices, Religious chanting and Dream Rituals. Communal Gatherings: Every end of the month, All R'lyehists in a area gather in an open area to bath in the light of the Moon to celebrate the Sleeping One's continued sleep. Here, Festivals and Holidays are usually celebrated for R'lyehists. Sacrifices: A core component of R'lyehism is a emphasis on sacrifices to ensure the Sleeping One keeps having good dreams and that it doesn't ever wake up. During earlier times, these sacrifices usually involved taking the life of an 'Blessed' Inkling and burning their blue blood in an fire. Nowadays, Worshippers will often sacrifice money, food or amounts of blood to burn in an communal temple to continue the sleeping one's sleep. Chanting: Worshippers are required to chant messages of good rest and calm waters to the sleeping one in the hopes it will dream of good things in one's favor. These chants are often done by 'High Old Ones' in a language claimed to be the tongue of the Sleeping One itself, although doing these chants in normal Calamarish is said to work too. Dream Rituals: A very important part of R'lyehism is the belief that dreaming can affect how the Sleeping One dreams. Worshippers often practice chants for good night's rest and take herbal medications that induce drowsiness and feelings of calmness to ensure good dreams for both them and the Sleeping One. The most devoted of worshippers often will sleep for days at a time."

Prior to the existence of Attunements, the world can be imagined to be similar to the real life. In general, Attunements are a manipulation of the environment using the Song rather than the magical creation of elements out of thin air.\n\nWhile in-game, the player uses attunements mainly for combat purposes, but the extent and potential of attunements were also displayed subtly in other ways and is demonstrated in the form of talent cards. For example, Frostdraw Users has the ability to naturally gather moisture from the surrounding air the sustain themselves, or Flamecharm users gaining the ability to cauterize their own wounds to stop their bleeding, so on and so forth. While the player uses their Attunement to an adequate degree, the demonstrated uses pale in comparison to the daily-uses of Attunements in the world of Deepwoken.\n\nThe Four Attunements of the Canticlysm\n\nThe Four Basic Attunements, Flamecharm, Frostdraw, Galebreathe and Thundercall were discovered and developed during the Canticlysm; the peak of understanding The Song, and also the eventual downfall of the Old World.\nThe 4 Attunements were discovered and developed during the Canticlysm.\n\n\n"

He is the only person to ever be confirmed to have traversed the third layer of the Depths.\nFlamecharm does not create fire; instead, creates combustion.\n(Flameworshipper Shield) The description of the Flameworshipper Shield tells a small, yet brief history of Flamecharmers; focused primarily on those who worship the element of fire.\nWorshippers of Fire is seen as individuals embracing dichotomy between Fire and the Sea. Fire representing Mankind, while the Deep represents as an ultimate threat of the New World.\n(Flameworshipper Shield) Other than the history lesson given by the Flameworshipper Shield, the Shield itself bears the emblem of a Flamepriest.\n(Flame Worshipper Armor) This armor is a standard-issue armor of the Covenant of Flame.\nThe Covenant are active worshippers of Pleeksty, though he doesn't interact with them, seeing them as a crazy fan club.[1]\n(Lumen's Folklore: Volume 'Attunement') One of the most common valuable attunements. Can be used in smithery and cooking. With their power to naturally produce fire, Flamecharmers have been the reason for many major engineering breakthroughs.\n\n\nThe First Light is a Heavy Weapon obtained as a rare drop from slaying a Crimson Megalodaunt, or by finding it inside a Merchant Ship. It has unique animations and a unique critical.\n\nBlade of Venn Kaelhand, a disciple of Pleeksty, who immersed themself much too deeply in the study of beasts altered by Korlfiend's influence. Met their fate in the jaws of a unique specimen of Megalodaunt said to have been exposed to the vents of Korilfiend.\n\nCompared to other greatswords, this one looks more modern as the design resembles a more modern-designed blade and handle with designs and patterns of edges and gold crafted into it, rather than a basic flat blade with some carvings scratched into it\n\nDespite being considered a legendary weapon, it doesn't scale with flamecharm and can be enchanted. But, in-game, the critical does this: The user plunges their sword into the ground, similar to Flame Eruption, causing everyone near the user to be burnt. This is followed up with flaming swords raining from the sky, similar to the Crimson Megalodaunt's Pyroclastic Roar. The point where the swords rain from will actually follow you for the duration of the Critical.\n\n"

Simply put, these will be the magic abilities that you use in combat to fend off your adversaries or assist yourself in achieving specific goals.\n\nMantras are a key aspect of combat, and it is incredibly important to master the usage of mantras while fighting to get the edge over your opponent. You can't get very far with just a weapon and skill alone; mantras can turn the tide of a battle easily and is what makes Deepwoken's combat very deep and engaging, with various mechanics to accompany them.\n\nA player's mantras are tied to their character's stats - the higher a given stat, the more likely you are to obtain a corresponding mantra. Similarly, to weapons and armor, mantras can also have 1-3 stars which correlate with their rarity and strength. Mantras with higher stars have higher stat requirements.\n\nFlamecharm Mantras\nLarge and threatening fire-based spells. Excels in crowd control and area denial as many spells have large range.\nLava serpent is a path that one takes with the Flamecharm attunement. It removes their ability to burn but instead replaces it with eruptions under the target\nCan be further upgraded with Azure Flame for even more damage.\n\nThundercall Mantras\nLightning utilizes fast and quickly regenerating spells to take a fight at any desired pace. Has spells with somewhat small start-up for closing distance or keeping an opponent on edge.\n\nLightning has a wide variety of useful spells for fighting monsters and exploring the world.\nTypically used mid/long range.\nSurge path can be obtained at 40 thundercall. Adding stacks of surge to an enemy which deal somewhat heavy damage with the removal of its stun.\nGreat pressure.\nA lot of fight control and escape mantras.\nMost thundercall mantras work with blast spark.\nHighest Base Damage, Lowest Scaling.\nFrostdraw Mantras\nUses ice to freeze enemies and create physical obstructions, allowing the user to both navigate the world easier and create terrain in combat.\n\nCan slow opponents, temporarily freeze them, or make barriers forcing opponents to go around.\nCrystallization can be unlocked at 40 frostdraw, dealing extra damage with the removal of chill. Comes with a whole new variety of Mantras.\nTypically used close/mid-range.\nHas a very good mobility mantra \"Ice Skate\"\nHas small cooldowns.\n\nGalebreathe Mantras\nWind utilizes the best all-rounder kit amongst the elements for movement, defense, and offensive actions.\n\nIt has a mix of close-range combo spells and long ranged options, along with multiple movement talents for moving around the world.\nSpecter can be unlocked at 40 Galebreathe, dealing extra damage and having more mobility at the cost of being unable to get suffocation, comes with the \"Specter Bar\".\nUsually agreed on as the most \"versatile\" attunement.\nFocuses mainly on movement.\nTypically used in any range.\nApplies suffocate, negating mantras of the opponent. Happens when using wind gun, gale trap or using world without song.\nShadowcast Mantras\nUses dark energy to siphon Ether from others into the user's own Ether.\n\nExcels in keep the opponent locked down and under pressure.\nHas its niche in keeping the Ether bar up and making sure others can't use Ether.\nGoes well when paired with other elements.\nApplies obscured, obscuring the vision of the opponent.\nTypically used mid-range.\nIronsing Mantras\nIronsing provides the widest ranged mantras in the game and the best damage output based on your opponent's mistakes and missteps.\n\nOffers mantras that favor the user, benefits both short and long distance.\nScrapsinger can be obtained at 40 ironsing. Instead of metal rods pulling enemies towards you when pressing the x key, instead it increases the amount of armor damage opponents take.\nTunes in well with the metal enchantment, as the metal path gives you benefits depending on how much armor your opponent has.\nApplies metal rods, which can be used in different ways by the user who applied it, enabling different strategies and forms of combat."

But your parents chose to stay in America. Now you live alone in your apartment and are a student at a mixed Japanese high school. There are a lot of sexy women in your neighborhood and in your apartment, but most of them are married. There are a lot of sexy girls at your school, but most of them have boyfriends. But you can't let a few boyfriends and a few husbands stop you from getting what you want. You have something that these Japanese guys with tiny cocks don't have. You have a huge cock! Using your huge cock, you can break the minds of any girl and any woman you want and make them dependent on it. But be careful, because their partners won't like you trying to steal them. That's why you should know that if you get caught up by jealous boyfriends and husbands, there can be severe consequences. You still have the option to have sexual and romantic relationships only with single women and girls who don't have boyfriends. Or you could try to take every woman and girl you see for yourself. Build yourself a harem or choose one of your love interests. The choice is yours!"

There have been many artifacts claimed to be the genuine article, at least 726 of which were investigated by the Holy Church, and many conflicts for such artifacts have happened around the world throughout history. \nThe name is utilized in the various Holy Grail Wars as the name of an artifact purportedly capable of granting any wish to whomever comes to claim it, rather than the real artifact, though the Church often gets involved simply because of that reason. Its advent is the ultimate goal of the various Holy Grail Wars.\n\nOn average a Holy Grail War lasts for two weeks until it's resolved."

Servants are Spirits made into special Familiars of the highest rank, referred to as Ghost Liners by the Mage's Association, that are bound to the Master. Typically Heroic Spirits under most systems, they can also sometimes be Divine Spirits, Phantoms, Wraiths, and living people depending on various circumstances. Pure Heroic Spirits, the \"main body\" in the Throne of Heroes, can only be summoned by the World, and summoning even one is considered to be a miraculous occurrence. Differing from the normal definition of Familiars that can be likened to minor mascots unable to be stronger than their masters, Heroic Spirits are the most powerful of beings with which even the five Magicians would never be able to forge a contract with. Rather than it being a hard process to summon them or the fact that they far surpass Magi, it is their intrinsic nature in that they are beings beyond Magecraft.\n\nMaster: Master is a designation given to an individual, usually a Magus, who has become one of the formal participants of the Holy Grail War by obtaining Command Spells and forming a contract with a Servant. Under ordinary circumstances, a Master is always a spellcaster, usually a Magus with a Magic Circuit, who is selected by the Holy Grail. It is possible for an ordinary person to become a Master, though this is rare."

          "content": "The Command Spells or Command Seals, are three claims of absolute obedience, the crystallization of a great magic, that a Master has over a Servant in the Holy Grail War system. They can also be used to make a servant do something that cant be done normally, like teleporting herself to the side of her master, or to stand up and keep fighting when they body has already been broken, etc.\n\nUnable to normally be controlled by humans, they are burdened by the \"absolute condition for materialization\", the authority of the Command Spell carved into them at the moment of summoning. They are holy marks signifying a Magi's status as a Master, a system that was created by Zouken Makiri after the failure of the First Holy Grail War.\n\n\nObtaining Command Spells: The Fuyuki Holy Grail for example, grants a total of twenty-one Command Spells in each war. Masters obtain three Command Spells, and Servants have no choice but to cooperate with their Masters due to their hold over them. Depending on the nature of the Servant, such binding is not necessary, while others may slay their Master instantly should all three be lost. They disappear as they are used up, and it can be said that a Master who uses up all three loses authority over their Servant. Even if a Master contracts with multiple Servants at once, they will only be given a total of three Command Spells that can be used on any contracted Servant.It is possible to steal more from other Masters or receive more from the overseer depending on circumstances, and it is also possible that anyone interfering with the activities of the Church will have their Command Spells decreased. Their loss does not indicate forfeiture of position in the Holy Grail War, as the contract with the Servant is also part of being a Master.\nCommand Spells do not disappear simply with the loss of a Servant, but instead only when one gives up or loses their right to be a Master. With regular Masters, this happens instantly upon losing their Servant, and only members of the Three Founding Families have shown the ability to exercise the authority of a Master even without a Servant. They will not lose their Command Spells so long as there exist Servants without established contracts.\nLost Command Spells are reclaimed by the Holy Grail during the Holy Grail War and can be redistributed to new contractors who take on a Servant who has lost their Master. While searching for new Masters, it will prioritize those who had been previously chosen. The Church provides protection to Masters without Servants for the reason of them having greater chance of obtaining leftover Command Spells. Masters aim to kill other Masters rather than simply cut off their combat effectiveness so that they will not be able to take up another contract in the future. Of the Command Spells that are left after the Holy Grail War, they are amassed in the hands of the supervisor and commissioned for safekeeping. It is possible to keep a contract after the Holy Grail War has ended, as the only issue is the added strain on the Magus after the support from the Holy Grail in the upkeep of the Servant stops.\n\nCharacteristics: Command Spells appear on those selected by the Holy Grail, some of which have been shown to manifest three years before the event. It is normal that the Holy Grail decides on those it deems worthy and have a reason to seek it. The spell manifests in Form of a seal on the body part of the master.  The seals typically appear somewhere on the arm, looking like tattoos at first sight. Upon receiving or losing Command Spells, there is often a slight pain. If the Master or Servant are in critical danger, it may throb to warn them."

All Lightners depicted so far live in Hometown.\n\nUnlike in Undertale, Lightners of both kinds possess the universal qualities of a SOUL, and according to Queen, the power of determination and the ability to create Dark Fountains.\n\nAccording to stories told by Darkners such as King and Seam, the Lightners were once the protectors of the Darkners, before they left them alone in the shadows. Seam explains that Lightners were seen as the \"Gods\", \"protectors\", \"creators\" and \"those who gave [Darkners] purpose\". One day however, the Darkners were locked away in the Dark World, and the Lightners were never seen by them again. During the final battle with King, King rants about how the Lightners abandoned him and his kingdom, and how he hates them all. King then goes on to say that the Knight has provided the purpose that the Lightners took from the Darkners, and that with the Knight, King will take revenge on the Lightners that abandoned him.\n\nHowever, Kris, a human Lightner, cannot cast magic. Despite the fact Kris can get magic from certain items, they cannot manifest it into a spell like the others. However, they can ACT instead."

          "content": "Darkners are beings that inhabit the Dark Worlds, as opposed to the Lightners that exist in the Light World. They are the keepers of the Dark Fountains.\n\nA Darkner's appearance is typically themed off of an inanimate object in Light World. For example, Chapter 1's Darkners resemble playing cards, board pieces, and toys from the Unused Classroom. In contrast, Chapter 2's Darkners are electronics, software components, and computer programs. They reflect the Computer Lab in the Library.\n\nDarkners also are capable of using magic. Their attacks correspond with their object and their original Dark World. For example, most Card Kingdom Darkners attack with spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Cyber World Darkners use attacks related to pop-up boxes, electricity, lasers, etc.\n\nDarkners can be transferred to other Dark Worlds if Kris transports their Light World counterpart. They can also be recruited if they are spared, or other merciful means outside of encounters. However, if a Darkner stays in a different Dark World, they eventually turn to stone. The only Dark World that all Darkners can reside in without turning to stone is Castle Town, because its fountain is made from \"pure darkness.\" Ralsei is the only Darkner exempt from these effects. He does not turn to stone and traverses to other Dark Worlds seemingly by himself.\n\nSome Darkners also have knowledge that does not pertain to Dark World. Darkners can be aware of where a Dark World takes place within Hometown.[1] They can also recall their Hometown counterpart's interactions with Lightners.[2] Additionally, Darkners can offer advice on game controls,[3] gameplay,[4] and SAVING.[5] However, their knowledge can be limited. An example of this is Jigsaw Joe being unfamiliar with the Warp Door he can aid in repairing.\n\nAccording to the Prophecy, Darkners and Lightners once lived in harmony. The Earth would be doomed to a destruction known as The Roaring if the balance of Light and Dark were to be disrupted, a phenomenon caused by an excess of Dark Fountains.\n\nThis doom can only be averted by the Delta Warriors, who will restore the balance of Light and Dark by sealing the Fountains and casting away \"the Angel's Heaven\". In the abandoned Castle Town surrounding the original Dark Fountain, the lonely Ralsei awaited the Prophecy's other two heroes, hoping to avert the destruction of the world.\n\nThe people of the Card Kingdom remember living in harmony with the Lightners, but they now believe that the Lightners abandoned them and trapped them in a sealed realm without a purpose. Recently, a strange Knight appeared and led one of the kingdom's four Kings to rebel, annexing the realms of the three other Kings and forcing their citizens to serve him and obey his son, Lancer. Around the same time, a new Dark Fountain emerged near his Card Castle, disrupting the balance of Light and Dark, and the court jester, influenced by \"a strange someone\" to believe that the world was only a game, was imprisoned on orders of the four Kings by the court magician, who then left the castle too.\n\nEnraged and heartbroken by the Lightners' abandonment, King came to believe that the emergence of \"holy\" Dark Fountains to further disrupt the Balance would cast the world into eternal darkness instead of destroying it, allowing Darkners to take rulership and inflict suffering on Lightners. Many of his former staff, fired during his rages, were imprisoned or forced to find work elsewhere in his Dark World.\n\nChapter 1\nWith the appearance of the prophesied heroes, Ralsei leaves Castle Town to accompany them to the second Dark Fountain. Along the way, they meet King's son, who had been ordered to stop them and who orders groups of Darkner fighters to oppose them. Despite initial friction, the party eventually reaches Card Castle and confronts King, with the battle's aftermath depending on how they treated their enemies along the way. The Lightner heroes proceed to the second Dark Fountain, where they return to their own world.\n\nChapter 2\nThe Darkners of the Cyber World are largely on good terms with Lightners, unlike those from the Card Kingdom. The only possible exception is Queen, the eccentric monarch of the Dark World, led astray by the Knight's power; convinced that creating more Dark Fountains and thus Dark Worlds creates further prosperity for her subjects, not knowing the true consequences of disrupting the balance between light and dark.\n\nIn order to accomplish her mission, she plans to capture Lightners (notably Noelle Holiday), knowing that Lightners with strong determination can create Dark Fountains, much as the Knight could. She changes her mind about her plan quite quickly after learning the true nature of The Roaring from Ralsei."

          ],
          "content": "Kris is a human Lightner and the main protagonist of Deltarune. They are presumably the human Hero of Light in the Prophecy. In a Dark World, they function as the party's leader.\n\nKris is controlled by the player for the majority of the game. The few exceptions are brief cutscenes, or when they tear the SOUL out of their body.\n\nKris excels at ACTing in battles, and wields a sword that can transform into a shield when DEFENDing.\n\nAlso known as\nHoney (Toriel)\nBlue person (Lancer)\nKRISP (Temmie)\nKrissy (Bratty, Catty, Onion)\nHyper-Potato-Mouse (Onion)\nCrisper (Onion)\nLittle buddy (Burgerpants)\nKrismas (Rudy, Noelle, Onion)\nLittle Sponge (Spamton)\nKid (Sans, Spamton, Undyne, Tutorial Masters)\nBoss (Recruited Darkners)\nFirst Appearance\nHometown\nRelationships\nAsgore Dreemurr (adoptive father)\nToriel (adoptive mother)\nAsriel (adoptive brother)\nRalsei (friend; teammate)\nSusie (friend; classmate; teammate; former enemy)\nLancer (friend; teammate; former enemy)\nNoelle Holiday (friend; classmate; former teammate; neighbor)\nBerdly (ally; classmate; former enemy)\nAlphys (teacher)\n\nKris is a teenage human with an amber skin tone and messy, shoulder-length dark maroon hair. They wear a long-sleeve lime shirt with one horizontal yellow stripe, and nondescript pants and shoes. One of Kris's distinct traits is that their long bangs cast a shadow that hides the upper half of their face. In the brief moments they tear the SOUL out of their body, their red eyes can glow in the dark. One of their crimson eyes is also visible for a few frames when they descend into a Dark World.\n\nIn a Dark World, Kris's entire appearance transforms, making them resemble a knight. Kris dons silver armor: shoulder pauldrons, a cuirass, gauntlets, and boots. They wear a navy blue bodysuit underneath the set, and a pink cape drapes across their right shoulder. Finally, Kris's skin changes to cyan, and their hair transits to navy. The shading for their skin is also used for their cape, giving the illusion of blue stripes in a few of their sprites.\n\nTo the player, Kris consistently has a blank, neutral expression. They seemingly stand straight during the majority of non-scripted actions. Kris's expressions and movement are different when they are about to remove or have removed the SOUL.\n\nPersonality\nDuring the events of Deltarune, Kris is mentioned to be an introvert. Susie and King refer to Kris as a \"quiet person,\" and Noelle is astonished if they converse about \"anything.\" After Kris's brother, Asriel, left for college, they became distant from their few friends. Kris's side of their shared bedroom is also strikingly bare. The shared game console is underneath Asriel's bed, and their old children's books are in Toriel 's classroom instead. Toriel has also mentioned that Kris is not normally energetic. They have a history of not waking up on time, and often slept through the start of class. Kris also preferred their mother driving them to and from school than walking.\n\nContrary to Kris's apparent detachment, they do have a variety of interests. Kris has always been mischievous, pulling dark pranks such as covering themselves in ketchup and claiming it was blood. For example, Kris has the option to keep flushing the toilet before or after going to school, with Toriel replying: \"You did not put a bath bomb in the toilet again, did you?\"\n\nKris enjoys playing the piano. Prior to the game, they frequently played the hospital piano, despite it \"missing most of the good keys.\" They have searched for tutorials to improve,[8] and Red Big Mouth believes they can play the hospital piano \"beautifully.\" In a private post from Noelle's blog, Noelle mentions that Kris would often come to her house and use her piano since Kris did not have one in their home. Noelle explains that whenever she followed them into the dining room to listen to them play, Kris would immediately stop playing. Without an interruption from Noelle, however, Kris would continue playing, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nWhen younger, Kris studied the occult with Catti. They appear to still have an interest in this topic, as one of their search queries was \"how to use magic.\"\n\nAt the end of Chapter 1, Red Big Mouth and Toriel both comment on Kris's physical appearance. They cite that Kris seems \"a little sick\" and does \"not look quite yourself\" respectively. It is implied that the SOUL is the reason, though the exact cause is unknown. Notably, Kris wants to be perceived as \"normal\" despite Toriel's concern.\n\nKris is shown to have a significant amount of agency outside of the player's choices. This is most clearly shown in scenes where Kris rips the SOUL out of their body, but also in how characters react to Kris's dialogue choices: occasionally, the player may choose an option that other characters note sounds like Kris is straining to say. Kris is also shown performing actions independently of the player's control, including protecting Susie from King or awkwardly trying to escape the Sweet Cap'n Cakes fight with Ralsei and Susie, showing their friendship with the two exists outside of the player's influence. Additionally, there are some instances in Chapter 2 where Kris stops inspecting something relating to their home life, preventing the player from learning more: when inspecting Asriel's room in Queen's Mansion, Kris closes their eyes before peeking into Asriel's room in the Guest Hall; when inspecting an article about Asgore's firing and Undyne's promotion, Kris intentionally stops reading before the reason is given. The separation between the player and Kris is most clearly shown in the Snowgrave Route, where it is heavily implied Kris's actions are being done against their will. Noelle describes the voice she heard giving her orders as terrifying, noting Kris has been acting very strange lately. When Kris reunites with the party after defeating Berdly, Susie and Ralsei immediately notice Kris appears distraught.\n\nAnother instance of this happens in the normal route of Chapter 2, where after defeating Spamton NEO, Susie notices Kris appearing to be in shock. If the player responds to Susie that they're okay by saying Yes, Kris appears strained in their response, making Susie think that they're not okay; if the player responds to Susie by saying No, Kris yells out the response, concerning Susie and Ralsei. This heavily implies that Spamton's dialogue during his boss fight about being a puppet and cutting his strings to be free, combined with his ultimate fate, deeply unsettled Kris.\n\nYears ago, Kris was adopted by the Dreemurrs and grew up in a loving family. However, as the only human child in Hometown, Kris often felt like an outsider. Kris once asked their adoptive parents when their \"horns were going to grow in.\" In response, Toriel and Asgore bought a headband with red horns for Kris, who wore it for months.\n\nGrowing up, Kris became very close with their older brother, Asriel. The two often explored the forests around town with their neighbors, Dess and Noelle. While the four were close friends, Kris and Noelle grew apart over the years. The cause for this is unknown. Kris had also wanted to befriend Bratty, as she was one of the \"big kids.\" They willingly complied and retrieved food for her until she became sick.\n\nAt some point, Toriel and Asgore became divorced. While their family was broken, Kris and Asriel remained inseparable. On occasion, Asriel would buy Kris a hot chocolate at QC's Diner, something they used to do together as a whole family. One day, Asriel had to go away to college, leaving Kris alone and without many friends\n\n\n\n\n\nKris has several different titles.\n\nAt the start of Chapter 1, Kris is a Human. \"Body contains a human SOUL.\"\nAfter meeting Ralsei, they become a Leader. \"Commands the party with various ACTs.\"\nIf Kris inspects every bed in Card Castle, they become a Bed Inspector. \"Inspects all beds inexplicably.\"\nAfter fighting Sweet Cap'n Cakes in Chapter 2, they become a Tactician. \"Commands the party by ACTs. Sometimes.\"\nWhen inspecting the Moss in Chapter 2, they become a Moss Finder. \"Basic moss-finding abilities.\"\nIf on the Snowgrave Route in Chapter 2, they become a Leader. \"Commands.\"\n\nRelationships\nAsriel\nAsriel has been consistently kind to his younger sibling. He has used the knockoff controller to play video games, begged for forgiveness for Kris's \"sins,\" and had carried Kris to school. The duo are very close since childhood, and various Hometown residents acknowledge this. After Asriel left for college, Kris often stayed up late conversing with him online, until the internet went out. Despite this, Kris deeply misses Asriel.\n\nToriel\nYears prior to Deltarune, it is implied Toriel had difficulties raising Kris. She had frequently borrowed \"How To Care For A Human,\" from the Library's second floor. Despite this, Toriel is patient and motherly, and finds most of Kris's antics endearing. She still holds Kris's hand when taking them to school, and keeps their childhood drawing in her classroom. Although she loves Kris equally to Asriel, she tries to limit Kris's impulsiveness, such as locking the chocolate kisses in her room.\n\nSusie\nIn Chapter 1, Kris is initially intimidated by Susie's rough demeanor. After Susie warns Kris and they escape the spade storm together, Kris is no longer terrified of her. They observe Susie's friendliness towards Lancer, and she tries to recruit Kris for their \"DARK\" team. However, after Susie promises not to hurt Lancer's dad, she decides to listen to Kris's commands. After the battle against King, Kris shields her from a spade attack, only to get knocked down by the King. Now seeing Kris as her friend, Susie stops King from killing them. Upon returning to school, she asks Kris if they can return to the Dark World with a friendly smile. When Toriel calls Kris afterwards, Kris tells her that they were hanging out with a friend, indicating that Kris had a good time with Susie. Notably, Monster Kid's ridicule of Susie offends Kris after their adventure.\n\nDuring Chapter 2, more evidence of their friendship is shown through Kris's actions. They focus on Susie when they drink her Tea, and is distinctly compliant to Susie. If Kris inspects the \"Susie-like Statue\" and \"ICE-E statue,\" Susie wants the former, and insists Kris gets the latter for their room. Kris steals either or both without a prompt, even if the latter statue discomforts them.\n\nRalsei\nKris and Ralsei work together throughout Deltarune, including several times the two are separated from the rest of the party. Ralsei likes Kris very much and sees them as a friend. However, it's implied that Kris doesn't consider Ralsei as close as Susie, as his Tea only heals 60HP (although Noelle's, who is a childhood friend, only heals 10HP more) to them.\n\nNoelle\nKris and Noelle are childhood friends. They spent a lot of time together when they were children, and used to hang out together with their respective older siblings, Asriel and Dess. Kris used to prank and scare Noelle a lot, but she in turn was mostly nice to them. In Chapter 1, Noelle implies that she usually helps Kris with their homework, and gives one of her pencils to them if they lost their own.\n\nIn Chapter 2, Kris and Noelle make a truce and work together through Cyber City. Noelle learns to be more brave and loses her fear of mice. Noelle then opens up to Kris and remembers the time they spent together as kids, and even says that it's unfair how Kris is the only person who knows how weird she is, because everyone knows how weird Kris is.\n\nIn the Snowgrave Route, Kris's relationship with Noelle is severely strained by the player's \"creepy\" demands in the Dark World. Despite being reassured that it is a dream, Noelle is still suspicious of Kris and becomes genuinely terrified when they meet in the Hospital.\n\nBerdly\nKris and Berdly have a rivalry with each other, but they are implied to have played video games (especially fighter games, by Berdly's mentions of wavedashing) together in the past. They become allies through the later parts of Chapter 2 and work together to defeat Queen, with Berdly saving Kris, Susie, and Ralsei before the GIGA Queen fight. Although Berdly believes the adventure in the Dark World to all be a dream, he gives studying with Kris and Susie a chance and even nicely wishes them both a good day before leaving the Library.\n\nDess\nAs children, Kris and Asriel used to spend time with Noelle and Dess. It is implied that they were friends, though she did not tolerate some of Kris's mischief. Dess once smacked Kris with a wiffle bat until they stopped lying to Noelle that \"ICE-E was real and eats kids.\"\n\nRudy\nRudolph Holiday is a friend of Kris's father, Asgore. He affectionately sees Kris as \"the creepy kid next door\" he once yelled at for getting tangled in the Holidays' light display. Rudy treats Kris kindly regardless, and jests if they inspect other objects in the room. In Chapter 1, Rudy is surprised to see Kris visit him, and assumes Toriel urged them.\n\nWhen saving the game for the first time, the SAVE file being replaced is named \"Kris,\" implying Kris has saved prior to the game beginning.\nIf a SAVE slot is erased, [EMPTY] replaces Kris's name instead when starting a new game in that slot.\nKris is the only party member to not have a hurt sprite battle portrait when they receive damage.\nWhen Susie thinks about what Kris would do during the Ferris wheel scene in Chapter 2, one of the options is \"Point and hearts come out,\" referring to Kris's ACT animation.\n\nAn ICE-E sightings report from a young Noelle, who screamed when she thought she saw the ICE-E on a pizza box wink at her. Dess burned out the eyes on the box, and Asriel suggested they bury the box. As Kris was about to bury it in the cemetery, Noelle fussed over potential zombies. They wore the box over their head and scared Noelle, and Dess hit Kris before throwing the box instead in response.\nTwo from Noelle's blog:\n\nA private post from Noelle, reminiscing about how Kris used visit and play with her. They would suddenly stop and play the piano instead. If she watched, they would stop playing.\nThe URL for this post seems to imply that Kris inherited the Dreemurr's last name, making their full name Kris Dreemurr.\n\nA private post written by Noelle. She mentions how Susie had been actively bullying Kris, though she notes that Kris seems \"oblivious\" to this and that they do not inform Toriel. It describes an incident after school where Kris was asleep at their desk, and Susie started to bully them for using apple-scented shampoo. When she threatened them as she bit an apple, Kris suppressed a laugh. With their \"gamer reaction speed\" they deflected, caught, and bit into the apple she threw. Susie immediately grabbed them by the hair and commented how she believed Toriel would soon be tired of them and be happier if they were to disappear. Noelle notes that Kris had quietly responded back, and Susie abruptly left. Afterwards, Kris finds Noelle in her locker, only to slowly close the door and leave."

Noelle is one of Kris's classmates, as well as their neighbor and childhood friend.\n\nShe plays a minor role in Chapter 1, but becomes a major character in Chapter 2, where she temporarily joins the party during Cyber City.\n\nNoelle lives on the northwest side of Hometown with her mother, the Mayor, and her father, Rudy, who is currently in the hospital with an unnamed illness.\n\nAlso known as\nAngel (Addison and Spamton)\nHochi Mama (Spamton)\nholidaygirl1225 (Spamton Sweepstakes)\nFirst Appearance\nHometown\nRelationships\nRudolph Holiday (father)\nMayor (mother)\nDess Holiday (older sister; unknown)\nSusie (friend; ally; classmate; love interest)\nBerdly (friend; ally; academic partner; classmate)\nKris (childhood friend; ally; classmate; neighbor)\nAsriel (childhood friend)\nQueen (friend; ally; former enemy)\n\nAppearance\nNoelle is a reindeer-like monster with short brown fur, a red nose, freckled cheeks, and prominent front teeth, as well as a pair of small antlers atop her head. She walks upright, and has long golden blonde hair. She wears a red and green checkered sweater with dark grey sleeves and a dark grey skirt.\n\nIn the Dark World, her hair becomes pale blonde and her fur obtains a pinkish tone. She also wears a long white dress/robe with a hood and ample sleeves but her smile turns into a straight face/frown.\n\nPersonality\nNoelle is friendly and cheerful, but also very timid, and sometimes has trouble saying what she's thinking. She apologizes often, and stays quiet about her feelings, such as her possible crushes, or her distaste for Berdly, out of fear. Her father says that \"everything scares her,\" and describes her as \"defenseless.\" According to him, she has a fear of humans hiding under her bed. This was made worse (or started) by Kris's repeated attempts to scare her when they were younger, including at least one time they hid under her bed. She shows to be more honest to Kris when it comes to her feelings and often yells at them when they pull pranks on her. She becomes more brave and less fearful from Chapter 2, during the time she spends with Kris in the city. Noelle apparently has tendencies of masochism, particularly fantasizing about Susie bullying her for various things (e.g. Susie pushing her over and laughing at Noelle for asking Susie to ride with her on the Ferris Wheel).[1]\n\nHowever, Noelle does have brash moments that push aside her shy behavior. An example of this was when Berdly admits that he may have feelings for Susie, which causes Noelle to angrily shake him since she has a crush on Susie as well.\n\nMain Story\nHistory\nNoelle grew up in Hometown with a loving father and a strict mother, and was very close with her older sister, Dess. As a child, Noelle and her sister became friends with her neighbors Kris and Asriel Dreemurr, and the four of them would often explore the forest around the graveyard together. One day, however, an unspecified tragedy occurred, and it is implied that Dess either died or went missing.\n\nAt some point, likely when she was quite young, Noelle nearly won a spelling bee, but froze up and couldn't speak when spelling the word \"December\", which handed the victory to Berdly. While unclear, it is implied that the word \"December\" is related to Noelle's sister Dess, likely being her full name.\n\nChapter 1\nWhen Kris enters the classroom at school, Noelle offers to let them join her class project group with Berdly. She attempts to ask Alphys for permission but is interrupted by Berdly, who speaks for her by saying that she and Berdly are \"FINE being alone,\" and also by Susie's abrupt entrance into class. Later, when Alphys realizes that she is out of chalk to teach that day, Noelle volunteers herself (and Susie) to get some. This too is unsuccessful, as Kris is sent by Alphys to accompany Susie instead. If Kris talks to her prior to leaving the classroom, Noelle tries to comfort them, saying she doesn't think Susie is so bad.\n\nAfter Kris returns from the Dark World, Noelle can be found visiting her father Rudy in the Hospital. Rudy gives his daughter advice on how to confess her feelings to Susie, but she is skeptical of his methods. As she leaves, she is caught off guard when she notices Kris in the doorway.\n\nIf Kris talks to Noelle after visiting her father in the hospital, they learn that she is locked out of her house, but doesn't want to bother her mother, the mayor of Hometown. At this point, if Kris mentions Susie, Noelle becomes eager to ask questions about her.\n\nIf Kris tells Noelle that Susie is nice, she becomes relieved and excited.\nIf Kris tells her that Susie is terrible, she becomes shocked, and offers to trade class project partners with Kris.\nIf Kris tells her that Susie eats chalk, Noelle asks if Kris knows what color chalk is her favorite, before realizing that giving her a lunchbox full of chalk probably isn't a great gift.\nIf Kris tells her nothing, she says that she helps Kris all the time, but Kris isn't giving her information. She keeps asking questions about Susie, before deciding that it isn't her personal business.\nIf Kris tries to talk about Susie again, Noelle starts to ask something but quickly decides Kris definitely does not know the answer.\nNoelle voices concern for Kris's well-being, but also acts off-put, or even scared by them. She expresses bewilderment at Kris being so talkative, noting they are usually more of the quiet type.\n\nChapter 2\nThe next day, Noelle attempts to volunteer to read in class, only for Berdly to interrupt her and volunteer instead. After class, Noelle startles Kris and Susie by walking up to them just as they are preparing to enter the Dark World to invite them to study at the Library with her and Berdly. Susie awkwardly accepts. If Kris talked to Noelle about Susie in Chapter 1, Noelle nervously gifts Susie a lunchbox of chalk before running off. However, when Kris and Susie arrive at the library, it becomes apparent that Noelle and Berdly have fallen into a new Dark World in the computer lab.\n\nIn the Cyber World, Noelle is captured by Queen, who intends to recruit Noelle to her cause of world domination. At the end of the Cyber Field, Noelle is pitted against the party on a roller coaster, but promptly replaced by the more eager-to-please Berdly. Noelle escapes and attempts to hide from Queen.\n\nLater, Kris finds Noelle in the City, and she joins Kris's party during the area while they help her hide from Queen and Berdly's antics. This culminates in Noelle's recapture by Queen (alongside Kris, Susie, and Berdly), and she is sent to her own room in Queen's Mansion. Susie comes to rescue her, convinces Noelle that she's dreaming, and the two share a Ferris wheel ride that takes them to the roof of the mansion. Once the ride is over, Susie leaves Noelle with Berdly and rejoins Kris and Ralsei. Berdly then proclaims to a bewildered Noelle that he was leading her on and does not actually have a crush on her, instead having a crush on Susie. Noelle, enraged, promptly starts shaking Berdly.\n\nBerdly and Noelle are recaptured by Queen off-screen, who attempts to persuade Noelle to become a new Knight. After the party fights GIGA Queen, Queen threatens Susie in attempt to force Noelle to open a dark fountain, but Noelle stands up to Queen and refuses. Queen responds to this by asking Noelle to choose for herself whether she wants to stay in the Dark World or the Light World. Noelle and Berdly each consider maintaining the Library Dark World before Ralsei reminds them of the Prophecy – in particular, a new portion regarding the Roaring. Hearing this, they decide against making a new fountain, and Queen allows Kris to seal the Cyber World's fountain, after which everybody wakes up in the computer lab. However, Noelle still appears to believe that the Dark World was all a dream.\n\nNoelle again visits her father in the hospital afterward, and can be visited by Kris and Susie.\n\nSnowgrave Route\nOn the Snowgrave Route, Kris, controlled by the player, uses their time with Noelle to help her become \"stronger\" through killing enemies with her Iceshock spell. Noelle is then coaxed into stealing the Freeze Ring from a shopkeeper, causing her to become more ambivalent towards killing enemies, subsequently becoming brainwashed into thinking Kris is making her stronger.\n\nEventually, Kris and Noelle encounter Berdly, whom Noelle initially does not recognize. Berdly, who becomes worried for Noelle's well-being, engages in a battle, and the player forces Noelle to use SnowGrave, a spell she does not know. This causes Berdly to become encased in a massive ice crystal. After this, Noelle leaves the party in a depressed daze, and is not seen again (except for a short interaction she has with Susie off-screen) until she seemingly finishes off Spamton NEO with an ice attack. Kris seals the Dark Fountain alone, and the party wakes up in the computer lab. Berdly does not wake up.\n\nNoelle has different dialogue in the hospital. She is more controlling of the game she plays with Rudy, and suggests using Ice Shock on the Ice Palace boss (in comparison to suggesting Fire shock in the normal route). When she and Kris leave the room, she begins to question whether or not the events that happened earlier were real or not, eventually finding out they were real (especially if Kris is wearing her watch afterwards).\n\nNoelle's title changes depending on the player's actions.\n\nWhen Noelle joins the party, her title is \"Snowcaster\".\nAfter using IceShock, her title changes to \"Frostmancer\".\nIf she is equipped with the Thorn Ring on the Snowgrave Route, her title changes to \"Ice Trancer\".\nIf Kris finds the moss in Cyber City while Noelle is in the party, her title changes to \"Moss Neutral\".\n\nWhen doing a spell, Noelle crouches and proceeds to stand up with her hands up together with white sparkles coming out.\n\nHeal Prayer\nCosts 32% TP. The same spell used by Ralsei, heals 5 HP for every 1 Magic stat she has on the selected party member. \"Heavenly light restores a little HP to one party member. Depends on Magic.\"\n\nDoing this conjures green sparkles on whoever is being healed.\n\nSleep Mist\nCosts 32% TP. Similar to Ralsei's Pacify, but costs more TP and is cast on all enemies. If enemies are tired or sleepy, Noelle can cast this spell to instantly SPARE them. \"A cold mist sweeps through, sparing all TIRED enemies.\"\n\nDoing this conjures swirling clouds on enemies.\n\nIceShock\nCosts 16% TP, 8% TP if Thorn Ring is worn. An attack that does a significant amount of damage. Notably, this attack freezes enemies solid instead of allowing them to flee. After finding Noelle, every enemy encountered in Cyber City must be frozen with this attack to access the Snowgrave Route. \"Deal magical ICE damage to one enemy.\"\n\nAt the end of the Snowgrave Route when Kris (or the player) calls Noelle for help, she presumably shows up after the screen goes dark and casts three IceShock spells on Spamton NEO.\n\nDoing this spell creates blue stylized snowflakes on enemies.\n\nN-Action\nDoes not cost TP. It is a variant of Susie's S-Action where Noelle does Kris's selected act, much like paired ACTs except that Noelle can choose to do it with another enemy.\n\nDoing this makes Noelle point forward with hearts and stars coming out like Kris.\n\nSnowGrave\n...\nFine! You want to see what happens so bad?\nWatch what happens when I cast a spell I don't know!\n\nNoelle, after pressured to use SnowGrave\n\nCosts 200% TP, 100% TP if Thorn Ring is worn. A spell that does an overwhelming damage to all enemies when used, labelled \"Fatal\". Can only be unlocked by fighting Berdly on the Snowgrave Route, and kept by defeating Berdly with IceShock or melee attacks. \"Deals the fatal damage to all of the enemies.\"\n\nWhen used on Berdly, a unique animation is used.\n\nWhen used on normal enemies, a unique death animation is used for enemies killed.\n\nRelationships\nRudy Holiday\nRudy is Noelle's father. Noelle and her father have an incredibly close and loving relationship. The two often play video games together, with one named Dragon Blazers III that Noelle is waiting to complete with him. She regularly visits Rudy in hospital, though he wishes that in return, he could be around to protect her. She seems upset when Rudy asks her not to wait for him to beat Dragon Blazers III in Chapter 1, implying she worries greatly about his health, but is quickly cheered up when he instead requests that she bring it to the hospital. She does so in Chapter 2.\n\nKris\nNoelle and Dess grew up with Kris and Asriel, and the four of them often used to play together. Kris had a reputation for pulling pranks on Noelle, such as hiding under her bed to scare her or putting ketchup on their arms and faking their death to shock her, but was often swiftly reprimanded by Dess. However, after Dess had gone, the two began to grow apart and Noelle started spending more time studying with Berdly. Despite this, she is still on cordial terms with Kris and is one of the only classmates who makes efforts to be considerate.\n\nDuring Chapter 2, Noelle opens up more to Kris when circumstances lead them to travel Cyber City together and, depending on the player's choice, she will once again consider them friends. However, during the Snowgrave Route, Noelle develops an apparent fear of Kris and their pressuring behavior, as upon spotting them in Hometown, she runs away. In dialogue afterward, it is mentioned she knows something is off with Kris, suggesting she's becoming aware of the player's influence over them.\n\nSusie\nNoelle has a crush on Susie that she is nervous about, and thus tries to hide it. She does not talk about it to anyone, except for her father, though her dialogue with Kris still makes hints towards her crush. Susie is oblivious to Noelle's crush. However, in Chapter 2, she in turn starts opening up to Noelle over the course of their adventure in the Dark World – though she insists to Noelle that it was just a dream after they manage to return to the Light World.\n\nWhile Susie has never bullied Noelle outright, Noelle seems to hint at liking to be bullied by her, as she insisted on asking Alphys to switch partners so Kris isn't the one being pushed against lockers. She also blushes when she thinks about what Susie would do if she asked her to ride the Ferris wheel with her. She talks about how Susie would probably push her to the ground and laugh at her, and she soon forgets what they were talking about.\n\nBerdly\nBerdly is Noelle's academic partner. During Chapter 1, Berdly seems to respect her, calling her the \"second smartest student\". Though Noelle doesn't seem to like him much in return, she speaks nicely to him.\n\nWhen they were younger, they both participated in a spelling bee. After Noelle froze up on the last word (\"DECEMBER\") and was unable to speak, Berdly won, and received a reputation of \"being smart\". In reality, Noelle helps him study, and without her, he wouldn't be the \"number one student\".\n\nIn Chapter 2, they both team up with Queen (though Noelle doesn't want to, and Queen is actually running away from Berdly). After revealing his affections towards Susie, Noelle begins shaking Berdly out of shock. Despite this, Noelle doesn't want harm to come to him (although she freezes him on the Snowgrave Route, but it's implied she didn't see what happened after she used SnowGrave), and Berdly is shown to care about Noelle, viewing her as his friend.\n\nMayor Holiday\nMayor Holiday is Noelle's mother. Although Noelle seems to love her mother, she is not as close with Mayor Holiday as she is with Rudy, and she dislikes bothering the Mayor while she is working. Rudy says that Noelle's mother is \"hard on her\", which is likely a factor in this.\n\nDess\nDess is Noelle's older sister. They are implied to have been very close, as Noelle says she used to watch (scary) movies with her and that Dess consoled her when she was scared. They used to hang out together with Asriel and Kris.\n\nAsriel\nAsriel and Noelle seem to be friends and have a good relationship with each other. During a walking sequence with Kris, Noelle states that when they were kids she along with Asriel, Kris, and her older sister Dess explored the forest behind the graveyard and found nothing interesting and that she remembered crying when she got scared and wiping away her tears with Asriel's jacket.\n\nQueen\nQueen and Noelle meet during Chapter 2. Through the entirety of it, Queen treats Noelle like a daughter, calling her things like \"sweetie\", \"honey\" and \"gravy\". Throughout the chapter, Queen had attempted to force Noelle to become her peon, but it is later shown that deep inside, the Queen actually cared very much about her and just wanted to see her happy. At the end of the chapter, she is shown to understand Noelle better and says goodbye to her and the rest of the main characters.\n\nNoelle also wears red and green in the overworld, colors often associated with Christmas.\nNoelle offers Kris a candy-cane pencil and \"one with lights on it,\" both of which are associated with Christmas.\nNoelle can use ice-based abilities against enemies in the Dark World; ice and winter are associated with Christmas.\nNoelle's mother, the Mayor, is described as being cold and hard on Noelle, as well as having the office air conditioned up to full blast.\nNoelle is a member of the Cross Country Team, along with Jockington and (formerly) Asriel.\nNoelle puts a box with a robotic-looking face painted on it on her head to hide her face from Queen in Cyber City. This is a subtle reference to the Queen's threats to roboticize Noelle's face.\nNoelle appears to dislike meat and enjoy eating vegetables, as shown by her reaction to eating Darkburger and Giga Salad, respectively. This could be due to the fact that real-life reindeers are herbivores.\nAfter Noelle obtains the FreezeRing in the Snowgrave Route, several of Noelle's battle animations change (specifically the animations for defending, attacking, being hurt, and entering/winning a battle).\n\nfound from the \"HAVE YOU SEEN HIM??\" banner, is an ICE-E recent sightings article report from a young Noelle. It describes how she was terrified of an ICE-E pizza box, and how Dess burned out the eyes. Asriel suggested that the box should be buried, and Kris had attempted to bury it in the cemetery. When Noelle expressed her fears, they turned around with the box on their face. In response, Dess hit Kris and threw away the box instead.\n\nNoelle has an online blog with \"holidaygirl1225\" as her username. It is dedicated to \"game secrets, glitches, and theories.\"\n\ndeltarune.com/code/comments/: Reveals that she was particularly in good terms with someone with \"sports\" as their username.\ndeltarune.com/catpetterz/: Noelle describes how \"Cat Petterz 2\" is one of her favorite games, and how she enjoyed modifying the game. However, an error message scared Noelle and caused her to punish her pets and discard eggs to avoid the text.\ndeltarune.com/egg/: The post describes an incident where she received a \"SPECIAL\" white egg after waiting, hatching, and discarding multiple eggs. After she chose to treat it as a normal pet, it \"left home due to happiness.\" She notes that she cannot remember the name of the egg.\ndeltarune.com/kris_dreemurr_kris/: A private post of Noelle reminiscing about when Kris used to visit her house to play with her, then would suddenly choose to play the piano. When she noticed they would stop playing when she watched, she chose to wait instead. While she sometimes questioned her friendship with Kris, she still appreciates them playing the piano. Noelle mentioned how it \"felt like a concert\" when she closed her eyes.\ndeltarune.com/bluecircle/: Reveals she frequently checks her spam mail in case she receives fan mail. When she received one that consists of only letters and numbers, she applied it to \"Cat Petterz 2\" as a modifier. It caused a single blue circle to appear, which would occasionally glitch, had atrocious stats, and multiplied too fast as the word \"Congratulations!\" kept repeating. She was forced to delete all of her pets.\ndeltarune.com/the_n3w3st_g1rl_g1rl/: A private post from Noelle on how Susie had bullied Kris, and notes that they do not tell Toriel. In the post, she mentions how she tried waiting for Kris after school since they were still asleep, and had hid in her locker to keep an eye on the two.\ndeltarune.com/icepalace_glaceir/: A post describing an implied softlock she experienced when she played \"Dragon Blazers\" as a child. However, she discovers a unique door in the area. Upon finding it, Noelle nearly screamed, but immediately reconsidered in case her mother heard and would turn off the game. She notes that the door is locked, and has not been able to find the key for it.\n\n"

          "content": "The Snowgrave Route is an alternate story route in Chapter 2. It takes place in the Cyber World, and significantly alters the events of the story and the bosses encountered. Despite Chapter 1's claims to the contrary, the player's choices matter when making decisions in this route.\n\nAlso known as\nWeird Route (internally)\nAlt (internally)\nSide B (internally)\nCommand Route\nPipis Route\nGenocide Route\nType\nPlot Mechanic\n\nMethod\nThe Snowgrave Route begins after Noelle joins the party in Cyber City.\n\nThe first step below is the most difficult part of the route to figure out, since the game gives no hints that this specific step is necessary. Afterward, the player should be able to figure out the rest of the route on their own, since the game immediately alerts the player when the route is abandoned.\n\nOnce Kris gets to Noelle and has her join their party, the player must backtrack beyond the point where the party originally landed after falling off the rollercoaster, ignoring Noelle's protests that they are going the wrong way.\nAlong the way, the player must defeat every enemy by using Noelle's IceShock spell to freeze them. (One easy enemy to miss is the Poppup disguised as a traffic cone to the right of the trash zone.) After the player has finished backtracking, they must turn around and continue forward again, still making Noelle freeze all the enemies along the way.\nFrozen enemies will remain frozen on the overworld even after leaving the area and returning. Each time all the enemies in an area have been frozen (or another important route requirement is completed), a brief ominous blippy sound plays that goes down in pitch.\nDriving off any enemies using melee attacks or sparing them will immediately end the route. (If any route requirement is failed after the route has begun, a brief and bright sound plays that goes up in pitch, enemies will no longer be permanently frozen on the overworld, and the run will permanently remain on the normal route.)\nAfter reaching the room with the large Ferris Wheel poster, the player must interact with the shopkeeper who offers to sell the party shoes near the top-right side of the room, and say \"We're something else\" when prompted. This should cause the shopkeeper to try to sell Noelle a ring. (If it doesn't, the player has not finished freezing all the necessary enemies yet, but they may backtrack and return to the shopkeeper to try again.) The player must answer \"Get it\" to all of the prompts. The player must not continue past the shopkeeper and complete the next puzzle until this is done.\nFrom this point onward, whenever the player is presented with two dialogue choices, one of which is \"Proceed,\" the player must choose \"Proceed.\"\nBefore the player begins the fight with Berdly, the player must have Noelle freeze all enemies available, then backtrack to the Dog Dumpster. (This is at the bottom left of the room with two long car roads, where Kris would normally encounter the Annoying Dog in a car on a normal route. If the dumpster is interacted with before freezing all available enemies, the player will be told how many encounters remain to be frozen.) If the player interacts with the dumpster after freezing all available enemies, they are able to purchase the Thorn Ring and equip it to Noelle. This must be done before the Berdly fight.\nNoelle should have a new spell when the fight starts. The player must order Noelle to cast it before the fight ends. It is impossible to cast if Noelle does not have the Thorn Ring equipped. She will deny knowing the spell, but the player must continue to tell her to use it.\nAfter this point, all route requirements have been met and the run is locked to this route. Returning to the normal route is not possible.\n\nRequirements\nThere are more requirements to maintain this route than in Undertale's Genocide Route.\n\nAll enemies in all 19 encounters prior to Berdly's second battle must be frozen with Noelle's IceShock spell.\nEnemies can be damaged with weapon attacks, but Noelle's IceShock must deal the final blow.\nDefeating an enemy with a weapon attack aborts the route, as unlike in Undertale, enemies normally flee when their HP becomes 0. Sparing an enemy or pacifying one with Noelle's SleepMist also aborts the route.\nSome enemies will appear that do not appear on the normal route. These must be frozen also.\nWhen interacting with the Addison who offers the Freeze Ring, the answers \"We're something else\" and \"Get it\" must be chosen.\nThe first forcefield puzzle must not be completed before the Freeze Ring is acquired.\nAfter acquiring the Freeze Ring, the \"Proceed\" dialogue option must be chosen at every opportunity.\nBerdly must be defeated with SnowGrave, which can only be cast by buying the Thorn Ring and equipping it to Noelle.\nBefore entering Queen's roller coaster ride, Kris must have at least two free slots in their weapon inventory or storage. Otherwise, they will not have enough space to carry both rings, which will abort the route as SnowGrave cannot be cast.\nThree slots are required if the player also wishes to obtain the Bounce Blade.\n\nDifferences\nStory Changes\nMost NPCs and several background and foreground elements disappear. The Addison that offers to sell the party Dating Shoes also offers to sell Noelle a Freeze Ring. When Noelle tries to decline, the NPC calls her an \"Angel\" and tells her she can't get stronger without better equipment. The player pressures Noelle into \"getting\" the Freeze Ring until the screen fades to black, the sound effect for IceShock is heard, and the Freeze Ring is acquired. Afterwards, the Addison is missing, presumably trapped in the ring.[2] Noelle's battle animations change to imply her increased power over ice and decreased fear in battle.\n\nNoelle starts having dark thoughts of hurting Kris, which alarms her, and Kris (prompted by the player) begins physically pressuring her to complete puzzles by freezing them solid with her ice magic. At first, she is afraid, but tries to justify their actions by suggesting that they are just helping her get stronger. She freezes the final puzzle without prompt and starts asking if the party should \"go find some more enemies.\"\n\nSpamton also refers to Noelle as an \"Angel\" and sells her a Thorn Ring which \"might sting,\" which allows her to cast ice spells at half their TP cost but causes her to take significant damage in battle. When the party meets Berdly, Noelle initially asks Kris if they want her to freeze \"another enemy\". Berdly prompts Noelle to recognize him and asks what she is doing, but she insists that she and Kris are \"getting stronger.\" Berdly tries to fight them to save Noelle, ignoring Noelle's warning to run away. The fight ends when the party obtains enough TP to cast SnowGrave, a \"fatal\" attack. Noelle refuses the command to use SnowGrave several times until she finally snaps and uses it to freeze Berdly completely solid. Noelle says she doesn't feel so good and leaves the party, unlocking a faster route to Queen's Mansion through the sewers.\n\nSusie and Ralsei rejoin the party just outside the mansion entrance, and the party finds out that the mansion has been taken over by Spamton, causing several differences. Numerous paths are blocked off by forcefields and locked doors, many cutscenes are skipped, and dialogue is changed. Dozens of Pipis have been laid out as traps throughout the Mansion: the room with 48 platters is now a maze of Pipis that cause a battle if Kris makes contact with one, the following room requires the player to avoid exploding Pipis with their SOUL, and the hallway leading up to the shortcut replaces the pottery with Pipis on wheels where (just like with the maze) they can start a battle on contact with any party member (not just Kris).\n\nSusie quickly leaves Noelle's room as Ralsei is concerned about Kris, Queen's first battle is skipped, and the regular final battle is averted as Ralsei explains The Roaring before the battle can start. Susie insists on checking on Noelle while Ralsei tells Queen about the Castle Town, leaving Kris to seal the fountain alone.\n\nSpamton NEO ambushes the player before they can seal the fountain, forcing them to fight him as the final boss solo, making the fight considerably harder than it is on a normal route. To compensate, Kris gains two new abilities: X-Slash deals massive physical damage for 25% TP, and Fried Pipis heals Kris for 120 HP at the cost of 32% TP. The fight itself is mostly the same until Spamton NEO reaches 10% of his HP. At this point, the music changes, and his AT is greatly lowered but his DF is greatly increased. Kris's damage done by normal attacks is capped at 10 (about 0.2% of his HP), and Spamton NEO's HP cannot be reduced below 6% (about 289) as he will automatically recover HP with Pipis whenever this occurs. However, Spamton exclusively uses a weaker, simpler attack that is much easier to dodge until the end of the fight. The battle can only be concluded by ACTing multiple times: first having Kris call for Ralsei and Susie twice each, which ends in failure each time; then having the player call for Noelle, which causes the screen to cut to black, after which she presumably shows up and deals massive damage to Spamton. The player seals the fountain, leaving a few differences to explore in Hometown.\n\nDark World Differences\nThe ominous descending-pitch ring plays each time a Stage below is completed, other than the casting of SnowGrave which uses its own sound effect.\n\nStage 1\nRequirements: Freeze the first Virovirokun encounter.\nKris's status menu description changes to Leader - \"Commands.\"\nFrozen enemies remain on screen and do not disappear when the room is re-entered.\nWhen selecting \"I will ride with you\" at the Ferris wheel poster, the unique dialogue options \"Noelle will ride with me\" and \"Sorry\" become available.\nIn the Trash Zone, when moving to the left side of Trashy's room, Noelle asks Kris if they're sure they aren't going the wrong way.\nIn the Trash Zone, in the room to the left of Trashy's room, 2 new encounters (a Virovirokun and a Werewire) appear.\nSAVE Points no longer display dialogue.\nStage 2\nRequirements: Freeze all 3 encounters in the Trash Zone (including the Poppup near the city entrance).\nTrashy and Nubert disappear from the Trash Zone.\nThe cars in the background of Cyber City disappear.\nThe cars on the roads before Annoying Mouse Room 1 are replaced with 2 new encounters (an Ambyu-Lance and a Tasque).\nThe traffic control buttons disappear.\nThe Werewire NPC on the left of the room disappears.\nWhen interacting with the first Queen poster, Noelle responds with \"...\" and a saddened expression.\nChecking Lancer in Key Items from this point onward displays \"(Innocent boys are fast asleep.).\"\nStage 3\nRequirements: Freeze the 2 encounters on the car roads before Annoying Mouse Room 1.\nThe Swatchlings sweeping the road disappear.\nThe Addisons in the room with two Ambyu-Lances moving in a rectangular pattern disappear. In the room to the north, Ralsei, Susie, the Addison, and the balloons disappear, and the lights in the background no longer display cat patterns. The Addison offering Dating Shoes becomes the only remaining Addison in the area.\nThe cars on the roads before the Ferris wheel poster room are replaced with 2 new encounters (a Virovirokun and a Werewire).\nThe traffic control buttons disappear (the traffic control posts become frozen solid).\nThe Werewire and Plugboy NPCs on the right of the room disappear.\nIcon Man and their friend disappear.\nStage 4\nRequirements: Freeze the 2 encounters on the car roads before the room with the Ferris wheel poster, the Ambyu-Lances in the room next to the first Queen poster, and the enemies in the room with the Ferris wheel poster. Speak to the Addison near the Ferris wheel poster and answer their question with \"We're something else.\"\nWhen stepping into the area a short distance away from the Addison near the Ferris wheel poster, he stops the party and offers to sell them the Freeze Ring for 1 D$ more than the party currently has.\nThe background music in Cyber City stops after the offer is made, and does not start playing again until the route is aborted or proceeds to Stage 5.\nThe Freeze Ring must be obtained by repeatedly selecting \"Get it\" to continue the route. Noelle freezes the Addison (who disappears) and expresses horror that she did so, but quickly denies that it happened and states that it's \"good to get stronger.\"\nNote that the requirements do not have to be done in order. If the player has not yet frozen enough enemies, they may still say \"We're something else\", then backtrack and freeze the remaining enemies, then return to the area to have the Addison offer the Freeze Ring.\nAfter getting the Freeze Ring, the first forcefield puzzle's cutscene changes. This changed cutscene must be viewed to stay on the route.\nAt the first forcefield puzzle, Noelle stands on the first switch while Kris moves to the second switch.\nIn a normal route, Kris stays on the first switch while Noelle moves to the second switch.\nIf Kris repeatedly interacts with Noelle instead of moving to the second switch, she wonders why Kris is staring at her instead of finishing the puzzle. She can sense them staring at her from behind.\nAttempting to leave the room while Noelle is on the switch displays \"(Shouldn't leave now.)\"\nWhen Kris crosses the disabled forcefield, Noelle twitches in place.\nOnce the forcefield is disabled, Noelle thinks to herself that it's horrible that she considered electrocuting Kris. There are two dialogue responses: \"It's horrible\" or \"It's natural.\" In either case, Noelle is shocked at the response and assumes she must have said her thoughts out loud.\nStage 5\nRequirements: Get the Freeze Ring; complete the first forcefield puzzle; answer Noelle with either option (\"It's horrible\" or \"It's natural\").\nSeveral changes take place in Cyber City:\nThe background music switches to an alternate arrangement with a slower tempo.\nMost of the background lights, advertisements, and hazard symbols disappear.\nThe traffic lights on the car roads stop swinging in place.\nAll SAVE point descriptions are replaced with \"You and Noelle were filled with power.\"\nOverworld enemies run away from the party.\nNoelle gains a new set of encounter animations:\nWhen Noelle enters an encounter, she is no longer scared.\nWhen Noelle is idle, she looks down.\nWhen Noelle gets hit, she closes her left eye in pain.\nWhen Noelle attacks, she mimics casting a spell instead of frantically waving her hands.\nWhen Noelle defends, she constructs an ice wall instead of covering her eyes with her hands.\nWhen Noelle ACTs with TakeCareX, she doesn't fall over.\nUpon victory, Noelle appears to pray, and surrounds herself with a blue, snowglobe-like orb.\nThe boxes below the first forcefield puzzle disappear.\nQueen's second interaction (in the room where Berdly's golden statue would normally appear) is replaced by a Tasque encounter.\nSweet Cap'n Cakes are nowhere to be found in Cyber City, leaving their shop vacant. Up to four CD Bagels can be taken from one of the boxes. The background music does not change upon entering the shop area.\nThe Addisons which offer shoe samples, the Mannequin, and the Tea do not appear (the Mannequin itself is also absent).\nThe cars in the room with two long car roads are replaced with 2 new encounters (an Ambyu-Lance and a Virovirokun).\nThe traffic control buttons are frozen solid.\nThe Dog Dumpster room is changed:\nWhen first entering the room, Kris is no longer transported to the room with the Annoying Dog.\nThe room with the man behind a tree is no longer accessible.\nSpamton occupies the dumpster. He tells the party they are currently weak, but that he will give the party something when they become stronger. He informs them of how many encounters remain to be frozen.\nThe moss in the corner does not glitter. Interacting with it displays \"(It's some moss...)\" and the party's titles do not change.\nWhen the party enters Annoying Mouse Room 2, Noelle asks Kris how they should solve the puzzle. The player is given the options \"Proceed\" and \"Let's solve it together!\" / \"Sorry, I'll do the puzzle\" (which aborts the route).\nRepeatedly answering \"Proceed\" causes Kris to push Noelle up against the forcefield, frightening her.\nShe eventually freezes the puzzle at the last second, disabling it.\nThe \"Annoying Mouse Room 2\" background banner is no longer displayed.\nStage 6\nRequirements: Force Noelle to \"Proceed\" through Annoying Mouse Room 2.\nThe switch and mouse control buttons in Annoying Mouse Room 2 are frozen solid.\nThe cheese maze is replaced with two overworld Maus encounters.\nNoelle freezes the Annoying Mouse Room 3 puzzle on her own when the party encounters it.\nThe \"Annoying Mouse Room 3\" background banner is no longer displayed.\nThe SAVE Point in this room is absent.\nA second Poppup encounter appears in the room prior to Berdly's battle.\nThe Poppups are visible as soon as the party enters the room instead of revealing themselves as the party approaches.\nThe Poppups do not move on the overworld and hide when the party draws near.\nOnce all enemies have been defeated, backtracking to the Dog Dumpster room allows the party to buy the Thorn Ring from Spamton for 1997 Kromer.\nEquipping it to Noelle is required to continue the route.\nIt changes her title to LV2 Ice Trancer - Receives pain to become stronger.\nBerdly's battle is modified:\nNoelle does not recognize Berdly at first, seeing him only as an enemy that she offers to freeze.\nWhen she recognizes him, she explains that she and Kris were \"getting stronger.\" Berdly senses that Kris is harming Noelle and threatens them.\nBerdly's battle theme is replaced by a somber track of militaristic sounding drum beats creating a rhythm similar to a heartbeat.\nFlavor text every turn is blank after the first round's \"Berdly blocks the way!\"\nACT options other than \"Check\" are replaced with \"Glare\" and \"Wake.\"\nGlare reduces Berdly's Defense by 5 and fills his mercy meter by +13%.\nWake increases Noelle's Magic by 3 and can be done up to 10 times.\nChecking Berdly gives the text: \"Enemy Weakness: ICE Try your strongest ice spell.\"\nBerdly's facial expression in battle is serious instead of smirking.\nBerdly does not speak in the battle, except to encourage Noelle to abandon Kris when Kris is downed or react to the first \"Glare\" ACT.\nBerdly's Attack stat is reduced, but his attacks are much faster and more difficult to dodge. His \"Spear Blast\" attack creates twice as many spike projectiles.\nBerdly only targets Kris until Kris is downed at least once.\nWhen Kris is downed, Berdly attempts to persuade Noelle to abandon them, but she refuses, stating that she can \"still hear their voice.\"\nAfter this, Berdly attacks both Kris and Noelle.\nIf Kris is down, Berdly does not attack, and Kris gets up immediately after the next round (although he does not prematurely stop an attack that downs Kris).\nUpon entering the battle, Noelle gains the spell SnowGrave, which must be used on Berdly to proceed to stage 7.\nSnowGrave normally costs 200% TP, but wearing the Thorn Ring reduces the cost to 100% TP.\nIf ordered to cast SnowGrave, Noelle repeatedly protests that she doesn't know the spell, but eventually casts it anyway.\nSnowGrave instantly defeats Berdly, encasing him in a prism of ice.\nStage 7\nRequirements: Freeze Berdly with Noelle's SnowGrave spell. The route is now locked and can no longer be aborted.\nThe frozen Berdly remains on the overworld. He does not appear for the rest of the chapter.\nNoelle leaves the party during the battle screen. She only appears off-screen for the rest of the chapter until the player returns to Hometown.\nThe paths to the left and right of the Berdly fight area become blocked off by traffic cones, preventing backtracking and exploring the rest of the city.\nThe sequence where Kris dodges traffic does not occur, thus the small car cannot be recruited to Castle Town.\nKris's initial meeting with Spamton does not occur. His shop and the items he sells are likewise inaccessible.\nThe scenes where Noelle explains her past to Kris, her meeting with Ralsei, and her encounters with Queen do not occur.\nCyber City Heights and its fireworks/puzzles are inaccessible.\nThe traffic cones to the north of the frozen Berdly are moved, opening a new path leading to a manhole. The SAVE Point that normally appears here is slightly displaced to the left to make room (and also no longer displays dialogue). Using the manhole directly skips to the front of the Queen's Mansion, where Kris meets up with Susie and Ralsei.\nSusie and Ralsei ask if Kris is okay, taking note of their \"hurt\" facial expression.\nOnce the manhole is used, it closes, preventing a return to Cyber City.\nThe party enters Queen's Mansion through the front door instead of being imprisoned.\nThe Warp Door cannot be used to return to earlier areas.\nRouxls Kaard fully turns to stone and blocks off the entrance to Swatch's shop, trapping Swatch and the Swatchlings in the cafe and preventing the party from buying anything from the shop. This also prompts Ralsei's explanation about Darkners' incompatibility with other Dark Worlds.\nChecking Lancer in Key Items from this point onward reveals that he has also become a statue.\nDue to Queen's preoccupation with Noelle and her search for Berdly, Queen is absent from her mansion and Spamton takes control of it.\nA slowed-down version of Deal Gone Wrong (Spamton NEO's \"meeting\" theme) plays throughout the mansion, including during battles.\nVarious advertising symbols appear in the mansion's entrance, and an NPC tells the party that the Swatchlings are all trapped in the cafe, Queen is nowhere to be found and \"a strange force has taken over the mansion.\"\nThe ordinarily-secret path at the bottom right of the entrance hall is open immediately.\nThe door to the first-floor dining room is locked. The KeyGen barrier is removed, making it possible to interact with the basement door immediately, but it too is locked.\nInteracting with the basement door causes Spamton to recognize Kris, telling them that he's busy changing forms and \"BECOMING [God]\" and to \"GO PLAY [Minecrap]\" instead of bothering him.\nThe design of Queen's face that normally appears on mansion doors is scratched out on the basement door.\nEvery SAVE Point normally present in Queen's Mansion is removed except the one in the entrance hall (which also no longer displays dialogue).\nMost cutscenes, NPCs, and puzzles in the Queen's Mansion are either skipped or completely missing, and numerous paths are blocked with forcefields or locked doors. The minibosses are all encountered in different locations and are noticeably stronger.\nThe Chain Mail, Glowshard, Revive Mint, and Revive Dust cannot be obtained.\nFrom the entrance hall, the stairs to the left and right are both blocked by forcefields.\nThe rooms with items based on various Hometown residents' search history are no longer accessible.\nThe shortcut to the second floor is open immediately and must be used to progress. After reaching 2F, a forcefield blocks the player from backtracking the 'usual' way to 1F.\nAll paintings of Queen are replaced by paintings of Spamton, and none of the paintings emit fire.\nOn the second floor, the door to the kitchen is locked and the Mauswheel miniboss instead roams the area outside the kitchen. It is now an optional battle.\nThe dining room now contains a maze made up entirely of Pipis, an enemy that never appears as its own fightable opponent outside of this route and otherwise only appears as part of one of Spamton NEO's attacks. Bumping into one triggers a battle.\nThe next two rooms also contain different types of Pipis encounters. The \"throne of the gods\" side room is now blocked with a forcefield and another side room is locked.\nThe Tasque Manager miniboss appears in the hallway before the lift to the third floor. Her mercy meter can no longer be filled by correctly answering quiz questions.\nAfter reaching the third floor, Werewerewire appears in the room to the left (instead of appearing on the rooftop). The film portraying a dark fountain is no longer present.\nThe battery acid lake cannot be crossed. As a result, the party does not reach the point where they would battle Rouxls Kaard, and the Thrash Machine never makes an appearance.\nThe shortcut from 3F to the entrance hall may be unlocked normally. The shortcut from 3F to the rooftop is open immediately and must be used to progress. A forcefield prevents the player from backtracking the 'usual' way from the rooftop down to 3F.\nThe party reaches the door of Noelle's room together instead of Berdly and Susie reaching it off-screen on the normal route. Susie enters, and when Ralsei asks Kris to \"wonder how they are doing,\" Kris refuses to respond, concerning him. As a result, the scene between Susie and Noelle happens entirely off-screen.\nWhen Susie exits, Ralsei begins to protest with \"H-huh? What!? W-wait -- wait!? Wait, we were supposed to --\", but is cut off.\nRalsei requests an explanation of what happened. Susie says that she told Noelle everything was a dream and that now she feels better.\nShe tells Kris that she'll explain what happened in more detail later, irritating Ralsei.\nThe room that would normally feature the boss battle against Queen and Berdly is now completely empty.\nQueen's cutscene before she becomes GIGA Queen contains unique dialogue, explaining how her sensors could not find Berdly anywhere, and that Noelle \"is in no condition to assist her now.\"\nWhen Queen becomes GIGA Queen, Ralsei prematurely explains the Roaring to her, causing her to offer to \"not stay in [the party's] way any longer.\" As a result, Queen never fights the party.\nSusie doesn't come with Kris to the Dark Fountain, instead offering to check on Noelle before leaving.\nAn additional room is added just before the Dark Fountain, containing a SAVE Point and a vending machine which sells \"pre-fountain refreshments\" (CD Bagels) for 120 D$ each.\nSpamton NEO fights Kris alone at the fountain, replacing GIGA Queen as the final boss of the route.\nHe cannot be spared.\nHis Defense stat is reduced to -27, causing Kris to deal 81 more damage when selecting FIGHT.\nThe Snap and SnapAll ACT options are replaced with X-Slash, which deals a large amount of damage at the cost of 25% TP, and FriedPipis, which heals Kris for 120 HP at the cost of 32% TP.\nUpon reaching 10% or less HP, he activates a \"[Bluelight Specil],\" lowering his Attack and exclusively using the Pipis \"exploding heads\" attack, which is easier to dodge. However, his HP cannot drop below 6% (about 289) and all weapon damage done by Kris is capped between 5 and 10.\nKris's ACTs are limited to calling out for Ralsei and Susie, to no effect, prompting Spamton to mock them.\nACTing for the fifth time has the player (\"You\") whisper Noelle's name. The screen turns black, while she quickly appears and defeats Spamton off-screen with three IceShock spells.\nSpamton NEO's Shadow Crystal and Puppet Scarf are silently obtained; it is impossible to obtain Dealmaker.\nKris seals the Dark Fountain in silence and with the screen pitch black.\nAfter witnessing the cutscene with Noelle and Rudy in the hospital, the SAVE Point in Castle Town reads \"After a long day, you have returned to the castle town. But, you still feel the power in your hands...\"\nHometown Differences\nBerdly does not wake up and doesn't leave the computer lab after Kris exits it. His fate is left uncertain.\nNoelle's dialogue changes once she wakes up.\nShe describes her 'dream' as a nightmare and says that she's glad she woke up.\nShe notices that Berdly hasn't woken up, but dismisses it as him simply falling asleep from studying too hard.\nInstead of attempting to look for Susie's tail, she directly asks if Susie has a tail, indicating her increased boldness and implying that the \"romantic\" scene between Susie and Noelle on a normal route still happened off-screen.\nAfter Noelle leaves the computer lab, Susie remarks that \"it doesn't feel like [they] just saved the world.\" On the normal route, Susie instead excitedly tells Kris that they just saved the world.\nWhen checking the sliding bead toy in the hospital, one of the blue beads is broken and torn off.\nThe conversation between Noelle and her father in the hospital has altered dialogue:\nNoelle doesn't want to give up control of the game, and suggests to use Ice Shock instead of Fire Shock on the boss she's battling.\nNoelle notices Kris before Susie right before she leaves her dad's hospital room. Susie stays behind when Kris tries to leave, due to Rudy asking to have a conversation in private. This triggers a scene where Noelle is talking to herself about how strange Kris has been acting, both in her 'dream' and in the real world, noting that she heard a strange voice that wasn't Kris giving her orders. Noelle wonders to herself why Kris keeps coming to the hospital, to which the player can respond with either \"To see you\" or \"To see your father.\" Either way, Noelle is shocked by Kris's presence.\nNoelle asks herself why Kris's voice just sounded so terrifying, recognizing it as the voice that had been commanding her in the Dark World. Kris can respond with either \"Because it wasn't a dream\" or \"...\", but Susie interrupts and the game progresses the same regardless of the choice.\nIf Kris has the Silver Watch equipped, Noelle asks in a shaky voice \"Why are you wearing... my watch? Wh... when did you...\" Kris can instead respond with either \"In your dream\" or \"...\", but Susie interrupts as usual.\nPlayer control is enabled during this scene. Stepping once towards Noelle once cuts the dialogue to the part where Noelle notices Kris is present. Stepping twice makes Noelle exclaim \"S-stop! Don't come any closer!\" with a shaky voice. At this point, the message box cannot be dismissed except by stepping towards Noelle a third time.\nAborted Route Differences\nChoosing the \"We're fine\" prompt when talking to the Addison selling the Freeze Ring aborts the route, with Noelle saying \"Y-Yeah, we don't need anything like that. (Though if Susie bought me a ring...)\"\nChoosing the \"Let's solve it together!\" or \"Sorry, I'll do the puzzle\" prompt at the second annoying mouse puzzle aborts the route, with Noelle saying \"Y... Yeah, you're right, Kris! (I thought Kris was acting strange, but... I guess it was just another joke...?)\"\nChoosing the \"I'm protecting her from you!\" prompt at the Berdly encounter aborts the route and results in unique lines.\nSparing Berdly after choosing \"Proceed\" aborts the route, though Noelle has unique lines after the fight where she contemplates Kris's behavior and eventually decides that they must have been trying to prank Berdly.\nDefeating Berdly by FIGHTing or using IceShock after choosing \"Proceed\" aborts the route without any unique lines, but unlike sparing, this causes the SnowGrave spell to remain as an option in Noelle's Magic menu. (As a result, aborting a Snowgrave Route is the only way to see the spell's description from the party menu within Chapter 2.)\nPrior to v1.0.5, the spell would remain even if Berdly was spared.\nIf the route is aborted at any time:\n\nA bright increasing-pitch sound is played to indicate that the player is no longer on the Snowgrave Route.\nKris's title changes back to \"Tactician\" or \"Bed Inspector.\"\nNoelle's title remains, but can be overridden by finding the Moss, changing her description to \"Moss Neutral.\"\nNoelle's encounter animations return to normal.\nAll areas return to normal as if the route never happened, and all frozen enemies disappear on room refresh.\nThe Freeze Ring and Thorn Ring do not disappear. (As a result, aborting a Snowgrave Route is the only way to see Susie and Ralsei's reactions to the Thorn Ring within Chapter 2.)\nIf the Freeze Ring is acquired, the Addison who it was obtained from does not reappear.\nIf the Thorn Ring is acquired, defeating Spamton by depleting his HP results in altered dialogue.

          "content": "Hometown is a town featured in Deltarune. It is fully accessible at the end of each Chapter, and is currently the only Light World area available. Across the town, there apparently lie portals to the Dark World. When Kris is in Hometown, it is not possible to SAVE or access the Config menu.\n\n\nOverview\nHometown is surrounded by a dense forest with golden yellow leaves. The bright coloration implies Deltarune takes place during the fall season. The town's road runs perpendicular from Toriel's House to the Mysterious Bunker. It branches into three east to west streets, with the exit southwest, past the Police Station. There is also a lake northeast of town.\n\nMain Story\nChapter 1\nAt the start of Chapter 1, Kris is sleeping in their bed. Toriel wakes them, complaining that they will be late for School.\n\nIf Kris chooses to go back to bed, they are transported directly to ??????. This is only possible if Chapter 1 was completed at least once.\n\nOnce Kris leaves the house, Toriel drives them to School. Kris arrives late, and Alphys mentions a group project, though everyone in class has a partner. Alphys instead assigns Kris with Susie when she enters. As Alphys is about to start the class, she realizes the chalk is missing. She requests Susie and Kris retrieve some from the supply closet. The two inexplicably get locked in the supply closet, and descend into the Dark World.\n\nAfter the Eastern Fountain in Card Kingdom is sealed, Kris and Susie wake up in the unused classroom. Having spent so long in the Dark World, Kris has to walk home. At home, Toriel has prepared some \"butterscotch-cinnamon pie.\" She informs Kris that it will be ready to eat tomorrow, and that they should not eat all of it.\n\nAfter going to sleep, in the middle of the night, Kris falls out of bed. They tear their SOUL out, and toss it into the birdcage near their bed. With a wide smile and a red glint in their eye, Kris pulls out a knife, and the Chapter ends.\n\nChapter 2\nIn Chapter 2, Toriel barges into Kris's room with a blue-handled knife in an empty pie tin. She accuses Kris of eating the entire pie, then makes a lighthearted joke and informs them it is time for School.\n\nSimilar to Chapter 1, Kris can go back to sleep and get transported to Cyber World if Chapter 2 was completed.\n\nKris is the last student to enter class. They immediately fall asleep and wake up once the class ends. Kris and Susie visit Castle Town, and Kris transfers the Card Kingdom Darkners to Castle Town before they leave. The two go to the Library to start their project, only to find the Computer Lab shrouded in darkness. They leap in and enter Cyber World.\n\nAfter returning from Cyber World and bringing its denizens to Castle Town, Kris and Susie walk home together. Toriel invites Susie inside, and the two prepare to make a pie. Kris informs and goes to the bathroom to wash their hands. After Kris runs the tap, they pull their SOUL out and trap it within the sink cupboard. Kris then opens the bathroom's window and falls out. Susie and Toriel do not hear this, due to the noise of the running water. When the pie is close to finished, Toriel realizes she left the sugar in the car, and goes to retrieve it. Moments later, Kris returns and reinserts their SOUL back in their body.\n\nAlarmed from her findings outside of the house, Toriel invites Susie to sleep over for the night. Kris and Susie decide to pass the time by watching TV, although the two quickly fall asleep. Some time passes, and Toriel calls the police, reporting that her tires have been slashed. After the officer confirms they will visit, Toriel stays in the living room and reads a book. She later falls asleep, and the lights and TV are off.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Kris wakes up and once again rips their SOUL out, this time stashing it in the couch. They leave the door open, turn on the TV, and seemingly focuses on Susie. They then pull out a knife and rip open a Dark Fountain in the middle of the living room. Kris returns their SOUL as they fall back asleep while a black fog obscures the living room.\n\nToriel's house, the first and last location visited in Chapter 1 and 2, is the home of Kris, Toriel, and formerly Asriel. It is the northernmost location in the town. A tidy two-story home, it is surrounded by trees on three sides and has a driveway heading south, where Toriel's red van parks when she is home. A symbol similar to the Delta Rune, with the triangles reversed, appears above the front door.\n\nThe front door opens into the living room, a wide-open space with a TV, a book of hymns on a side table, and Chairiel, Toriel's living-room chair. The TV is dusty and seemingly underused, being unplugged in Chapter 1, although it is plugged in at the start of Chapter 2 and used at the end of Chapter 2. A landline house phone hangs on the wall between the Living Room and adjoining Kitchen.\n\nThe kitchen features a trash can emitting a floral scent, human- and monster-shaped cookie cutters, a stovetop not quite as clean as the one Toriel uses in Undertale, white fur in the sink drain, and a fridge with a picture of Toriel, Kris, and Asriel on it.\n\nWest of the kitchen, a stairway leads to the second floor, while a door leads to the restroom, which is stocked with body spray under the sink, two different shampoos in the shower, and a toilet in which Kris once placed a bath bomb.\n\nUpstairs, a hallway contains a bookcase with several books on snails and one history book by Gerson Boom. Some crayons can be observed in a small table drawer, and a mirror reflects whoever passes it. The locked westernmost door in the hall is presumably Toriel's room, while a stairway to the east leads back down. A cactus stands beside a centrally-placed door leading to the bedroom.\n\nThe east side of the Bedroom contains Kris's belongings, while the western side was used by Asriel before he left for university. Between them, a carpet featuring the Delta Rune decorates the floor and a window in the north wall looks out on a beautiful day. On Asriel's side, books are boxed under the computer desk, music CDs and a game console are under the bed, and the drawer's contents change depending on which SAVE file is being used. Trophies line the walls above Asriel's bed, and star-shaped decorations glow in the dark. By contrast, Kris's shelves and walls are bare, their drawer contains only clothes, and the only visible personal belongings are a rusted birdcage in a battered red wagon. At the foot of the bed, a dark stain marks the floor.\n"

He is always hidden from the player's view, making his appearance completely unknown.\n\nHe does not have any direct dialogue; instead, every interaction with him is described through the narration. The tree the Man hides behind is similar to the red-leaved trees that populate the Field and Forest in Chapter 1.\n\nProfile\nPersonality\nThe narration only gives very brief and mundane description of the Man. He offers Eggs to Kris for unknown reasons. He does, however, seem friendly to them, as he is once described as \"waving happily to [them].\"\n\nThe Man is able to travel through both the Light World and the Dark World, but whether that means he is a Lightner is unknown.\n\nMain Story\nChapter 1\n\nBetween the room with the Starwalker Bird and the darkening room, there is a very small chance (1/50 or 2%) of entering a hidden place between the two areas. This area consists of a small path leading to a tree. The music is replaced by a simple piano melody and Kris is the only one present upon entering it, regardless of who is in their party at the time.\n\nWhen inspecting the tree, narration states that \"he\" is behind it. Inspecting behind the tree reveals that there is a man behind it and that he offers something. If the offer is accepted, it is revealed to be an Egg. After that, inspecting where the man was reveals that he is no longer there. The area cannot be re-entered.\n\nChapter 2\nIf the man was met during Chapter 1, he appears in Hometown at the beginning of Chapter 2. When leaving the School to go to the Library, inspecting any car in the traffic points out that there is a man in it who waves happily at Kris. Inspecting a car once more reveals nothing about the man.\n\nRegardless of the party's actions in Chapter 1, the man can be found in Cyber City's tree room. If the Annoying Dog cutscene has already played and the game is not on the Snowgrave Route, there is a 1/50, or 2% chance[1] when attempting to enter the Dog Dumpster room that instead Kris alone ends up in the tree room, just as before.\n\nThe tree room contains a low tree, in the same design as the one in Chapter 1, and the music is replaced with the piano melody again. When examining the spot behind the tree, the man offers another Egg to Kris. Once taken or declined, the man ceases to exist there, and subsequent examinations reveal that \"there was not a man here.\" Exiting the area returns the party to where they came from. The area cannot be re-entered.\n\nTrivia\nThe track playing in the background of the hidden rooms is not present in the official Deltarune OST. It is known in the game files simply as \"man.ogg.\"\nThe track was originally created as a fan song titled \"waltz of seccom masada\" for the game Yume Nikki. It was part of a collection of songs called \"made up yume nikkis\" that was posted to Toby Fox's Tumblr."

The Egg disappears from the inventory regardless of its use at the end of the Chapter.\n\nAdditional Uses\nIn Chapter 1, the Egg can be put in Asgore's refrigerator. Checking the fridge again reveals there are \"two Eggs inside the fridge.\"[1]\nIf the Egg is dropped, one egg appears in Asgore's refrigerator instead.[2] This egg also appears if the refrigerator is inspected a second time without having the Egg.[1]\nIn Chapter 2, the Egg can be placed in the basket of eggs in Sans's store. Susie also jokes about Kris \"reverse-stealing\" the egg.\nThe Egg also disappears from the inventory after interacting with the top-right rack or bell in the store.

However, King and Queen state that the Knight has recently been opening new Fountains. If too many Fountains are open at once, an apocalyptic event called The Roaring takes place. Titans emerge from the Fountains to devastate both the Light and Dark Worlds. Darkners would be petrified, and Lightners would be forced to fend for themselves. The Light World would become a place of eternal night.\n\nAs such, it is stated by The Prophecy that three \"HEROES\" are destined to seal the Fountains to restore balance. Sealing a Dark Fountain results in reverting a Dark World to its Light World form.\n\nThe Knight and Kris are currently the only known entities known to have opened Dark Fountains. However, any Lightner could potentially open their own Dark Fountain. This can be done by projecting their determination into a sharp object and piercing the ground. Berdly comes close to doing so near the end of Chapter 2, but is swayed against it by Ralsei's warnings.\n\nImmediately after being opened in the Light World, a Dark Fountain takes the form of an opaque black fog that seems to fill the room the fountain was opened in.\n\nFountains\nFountain of Darkness\nThe Fountain of Darkness, also referred to by Ralsei as the \"Grand Fountain,\" towers above Castle Town. It is visible at or near Ralsei's Castle. In Ralsei's prophecy, he states that the Fountain of Darkness \"gives this land form.\" It can also transform Castle Town if Kris recruits Darkners.[3] Darkners who leave the Dark World that they originate from quickly grow weak, before turning into stone statues. The only exception to this effect is the Dark World shaped by the Fountain of Darkness. As Ralsei puts it, the Fountain of Darkness is \"made of pure darkness,\" allowing all Darkners to persist.\n\nEastern Fountain\nThe Eastern Fountain is the second Dark Fountain that Ralsei mentions in his prophecy, created by the Knight and threatening to upset the balance of Light and Dark. Reflecting the school's unused classroom, it stands at King's Card Castle, and is closed using the power of Kris's human SOUL at the end of Chapter 1.\n\nLibrary Fountain\nThe Library Fountain is the third Dark Fountain encountered in Deltarune, and the primary fountain of Chapter 2. The fountain is opened in the library's computer lab, and creates an electronic-themed Dark World known as the Cyber World.

It is unique in its ability to host Darkners from other Dark Worlds.\n\nInitially, Ralsei is the only inhabitant. At the start of Chapter 2, Kris transfers residents of Card Kingdom to Castle Town. With the town populated and transformed, the name in the SAVE Point and the theme changes to My Castle Town.\n\nIn Chapter 2, the Rudinn in front of Party Dojo refers to Castle Town as \"[PLAYER]Town.\" \"[PLAYER]\" is the player's name, as provided in the Introduction or upon starting Chapter 2 without a Chapter 1 SAVE file.\n\nLocated in\nDark World\nInhabitants\nRalsei, Dummy, Recruited Darkners (notably Lancer, Rouxls Kaard, Seam, King, Queen)\nLocations\nTraining Area, Town Square, Party Dojo, Seam's Shop, Top Bakery, Café, Ralsei's Castle\n\n\nTown Square\nIn Chapter 1, Kris and Susie notice that the center of Castle Town has four vacant buildings. Each building's exterior is black, has two windows, a door, and the roof curling towards the town's road. If Kris inspects any of the buildings, all four appear to be shops that are locked, with no one present. The signage from bottom left, top left, bottom right, and top right for each shop depicts a different icon: a sack, a sword, a question mark, and an inn. After the buildings is a SAVE Point, and the entrance to Ralsei's Castle.\n\nAt the start of Chapter 2, the Town Square is the same until Kris returns with the Card Kingdom Darkners. The area itself expands to accommodate the residents. The buildings also transform from its uniform appearances into ones with distinct features. The sack icon shop becomes Party Dojo, the sword shop becomes Seam's Shop, the question mark shop becomes Top Bakery, and the inn becomes the Café. Near the SAVE point is an open manual that explains Recruits, Controls, and Item storage.\n\nInitially, an assortment of Card Kingdom's denizens are scattered around the square. In front of Top Bakery, Rouxls Kaard wonders if Kris has also brought King. If spoken to again, he contemplates looking for a \"New Employere\" after Lancer announces that Rouxls will do all the cooking and cleaning.\n\nIn front of Party Dojo, a Rudinn welcomes them to \"[PLAYER]Town,\" and expresses happiness. After Cyber World, Rudinn comments on the town's growth. If spoken to again, Rudinn has different dialogue.[1]\n\nSouthwest of the Party Dojo is a Rudinn Ranger and another Rudinn. The Rudinn Ranger proclaims the day as \"National Ham Sandwich Day of Independence!\" The Rudinn ponders if the Rudinn Ranger is enjoying life due to being at a \"higher level.\" West of Seam's Shop is a Blue B Block who barks and states their appearance.\n\nA Hathy is east of Top Bakery. She expresses liking the town. If Kris has inspected all four Hathy beds in Card Castle's Floor 3F, she has alternate dialogue.[2] After Cyber World, she is happy to see newcomers. East of the Café is a clean Rabbick, excited at the notion of a \"clean start.\" After Cyber World, Rabbick sweeps with a smaller broom.\n\nAfter returning from Cyber World, some of Darkners from there are present in Town Square. Southwest of the Party Dojo, Virovirokun and Rudinn reminisces about their encounters with the party, and comments on Noelle. West of Seam's Shop is a Werewire in a suit who is thankful, though intends to keep their appearance. Nearby Top Bakery, a Plugboy is also thankful, though dislikes the restaurant. A thankful Swatchling sweeps near the Café.\n\nTraining Area\nLocated to the right of Castle Town's entrance, this area is used for Ralsei's training dummy in Chapter 1. However, Kris can decline on learning about encounters. Regardless of Kris's decision, Ralsei gives Kris a Manual. In Chapter 2, the dummy is still present. Kris has the option to hug the dummy if they have not transferred Card Kingdom's Darkners. Afterwards, Worm can be found eating the dummy's clothes. After returning from the Cyber World, an Addison can be found here selling free sample bites of the clothes that were previously on the dummy.\n\nSweet Cap'n Cakes's Music Room can also be found in this area if all enemies have been recruited in the Cyber World. In the Music Room, the party can play some tracks from the Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 OST. If they have not, Sweet Cap'n Cakes mention how they need more recruits to reopen their shop.\n\nMr. Elegance is also present in the area. After returning from the Cyber World, he mentions how they are rebuilding the area to be more board-like.\n\nGoing past the training area brings the party to the Great Door which leads to the Field in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, the door seems to be permanently closed, and a Bloxer with three pairs of pants can be found there instead. After returning from the Cyber World, several NPCs can appear:\n\nThe Bloxer adds a fourth pair of pants if Tasque Manager was recruited.\nIf Poppup, Tasque or Maus were recruited, but Tasque Manager was not, whichever were recruited wander around the door.\nIf fewer than four cars were hit while driving with Queen, and no \"lost animals\" are present (whether because Tasque Manager was recruited or none of the animal Darkners were), a tiny walking car appears instead.\n\nThe Party Dojo, run by Jigsaw Joe, allows the party to attempt various challenges, which each yield various rewards. The challenges are in the form of battles that serve as minigames.\n\nIn Chapter 2, Seam's shop from the Field has been transferred to Castle Town. They are selling their usual wares. Kris can periodically converse with Seam for their advice. If Kris has found any Shadow Crystals, they can give it to Seam. If Sweet Cap'n Cakes opens their Music Shop, Seam replaces their Dark Candy stock with CD Bagels.\n\nMalius and Lancer can be found in the Top Bakery. Malius offers the party to fix them or fuse multiple items into one. Lancer offers the party a free Lancer Cookie, but does not give the cookie if the party already has one, complaining that he needs to regenerate.\n\nAfter returning from the Cyber World, Swatch banishes the Top Chef from the cafe, so he shows up in the bakery. If the party returned his repaired Top Cake in Chapter 1, Top Chef gives the party a Spin Cake whenever they do not already have one.\n\nThe Cafe is a building where the player can interact with their party's Recruits. Four different recruits can be placed at the three tables inside, and interacting with each of them can allow the player to learn more about their personalities. Depending on the composition of their placement, the recruits' responses to Kris interacting with them varies, although they mainly share their drink or snack preferences by attempting to voice their order if they lack any dynamics between them.\n\nThe initial composition of the recruits are a Jigsawry seated at the table closest to the broken jukebox near the northwest corner, a Rudinn seated at the table across it, and another Rudinn sharing the southern table with a Hathy, respectively seated west and east of said table.\n\nBefore visiting Cyber World, Top Chef runs the Cafe—he wanted to run the Top Bakery, but someone (Malius) is already working there, so he is serving pastries from the Cafe instead. After returning from Cyber World, Swatch takes over the Cafe and banishes Top Chef to the Top Bakery. Interacting with whoever is currently manning the counter gives the player the option to check their current recruits and change which are currently placed in the available seats.\n\nIf the party returned his repaired Top Cake in Chapter 1, Top Chef gives the party a Spin Cake whenever they do not already have one.\n\nTasque Manager, a Tasque, and a Swatchling appear in the Cafe if they are recruited in the Cyber World, separately from the placed recruits. As a result, Tasque Manager cannot be placed at a table, although additional Tasques and Swatchlings can.\n\nCliffs\nIn Chapter 2, after Kris brings all objects from the unused classroom to the closet, Mr. Society can be found next to the cliffs. He mentions being unable to handle society and floats to the top of the cliff. If the party completed his blue checkmark quest in the Cyber World, the Hacker can be found here as well, mentioning how the Castle Town is nearly as good as the city he made in \"Minecrap.\"\n\nIn Chapter 2, if the save file was not continued from a Chapter 1 save file in which Jevil was defeated, but Jevil has been defeated in any Chapter 1 save file, Jevil's Shadow Crystal and either the Jevilstail or Devilsknife can be found in a hole in the side of the cliff once Castle Town has been transformed into My Castle Town. These items can be found before visiting the Cyber World; after visiting Cyber World, it is only possible to retrieve the Shadow Crystal here if Spamton NEO was defeated.\n\n\n"

          "content": "The school of Warp embodies the zenith of magical prowess, a realm steeped in enigma and fraught with peril. Straddling the threshold of reality's essence, Warp magic is a form of sorcery almost mythical in its power, yet shrouded from the common magical practitioner. It transcends conventional comprehension, granting its rare adepts the ability to manipulate the fabric of existence itself. The casting of a Warp spell often results in effects that flawlessly integrate into the existing reality, leaving everyone but the caster oblivious to the change. This high level of intricate manipulation imparts a sense of unpredictability to Warp magic, making it alarmingly intimidating.\n\nHowever, the formidable nature of Warp magic is intrinsically tied to its inherent risks. Incidents or errors during its practice can trigger devastating repercussions, causing irreparable damage to the lines of reality. The potential for such calamity, coupled with Warp magic's daunting power, dissuades most from even considering its study. Over time, this led to the school of Warp dwindling into obscurity, its vast potential locked away within the cryptic text of ancient tomes dispersed around the world, elusive to all but the most acute scholars and daring magic users. Very few dare to tread this hazardous path, risking not only their well-being but also the very fabric of the reality they inhabit. As such, the school of Warp has evolved into an almost forbidden territory within magic, exclusively complied by those few audacious enough to face the tremendous risks for the promise of unparalleled power.\n\nThe most powerful actions one can take with Warp magic are not found in spells or tomes, but in manipulating reality with the brute force of unfathomably immense magical power and a deep understanding of the intricacies of the school of Warp. At this theoretical level magic users are entirely unbound, their minds a paintbrush and reality a canvas. If any were to ever reach it they would be indistinguishable from a god."

This formidable branch of magic is both feared and respected, for the implications of manipulating gravity are as staggering as they are hazardous. Graviturgy isn’t just about defying or enforcing gravity; it's about understanding and reshaping its existence according to the caster's will, offering the possibility to create areas of intense gravitational pull or grant weightlessness to objects at will.\n\nHowever, this exceptional power doesn't come without peril. Graviturgy is notoriously mercurial and untamed. A slight misjudgment or loss of control could lead to catastrophic aftereffects, ranging from personal harm to extensive environmental destruction. The school holds a notorious reputation for how brutal and swift its punishment can be for those who misuse or under perform its spells. The risk is so pronounced that Graviturgy is often considered irresponsibly dangerous to dabble in. Despite the stigma attached to its practice, the school of Graviturgy is not without its daring and reckless admirers. Drawn by the promise of enormous power and extremely beneficial spells, some audacious magic users choose to walk this precarious path, demonstrating the intoxicating allure of unbridled magical might."

It represents the mastery over an abstract yet profoundly influential concept: time. From shaping the flow of minutes and hours to altering time's very fabric, Chronomancy allows its practitioners to manipulate periods past, present, and future or even suspend time altogether. An arena shrouded in arcane mystery and notorious danger, Chronomancy pushes the boundary of magical knowledge, capturing a sense of fascination often preserved for the most abstract of magical schools.\n\nHowever, the allure and might of manipulating time come with heavy risks. Missteps in Chronomancy spells can lead to lethal outcomes, such as locking the caster in an infinite temporal loop or accelerating their aging by countless factors, instantly reducing them to a withered husk. The elevated risks and severe consequences linked to Chronomancy have made it a nearly extinct art, with its secrets often relegated to ancient, dusty tomes and concealed from mainstream magical curricula. Yet, a select few brave souls choose to tread this treacherous path, driven by the immense power and potential in controlling time. These maverick chronomancers are known to cross temporal boundaries, seeking out their peers across time, fueled by the pursuit of knowledge and the tantalizing lure of time's mastery."

          "content": "Enchantment is a magical school that focuses on the imbuing of specific properties into objects or creatures, creating magical effects that can either be temporary or permanent. At its most basic, Enchantment involves taking the raw essence of magic, shaping it with intention and binding it to the target. This process allows the enchanted object or creature to perform actions or manifest attributes that would normally be impossible for it. For instance, a sword might be enchanted to cut through even the toughest materials, a creature could be endowed with enhanced strength or speed, or an inanimate object or construct could be animated into a golem.\n\nThe complexity and efficiency of enchantments depend on the skill and expertise of the enchanter. Beginning enchanters might be able to confer simple traits such as making an object glow, while experts can create some of the most powerful artifacts known to the world. Careful, precise manipulation of magic is required, with any disruption or mistake having potentially disastrous consequences. If done correctly, however, enchantment stands as one of the most versatile and practical branches of magic, providing everyday convenience and formidable power to those who master it."

Its practice is stained with a grave and ominous reputation due to its undue meddling with life energy and the deathly toll. The art of Necromancy equips the practitioner with the ability to manipulate the dead directly, engaging in conversations with spirits and controlling the very essence of life, often to unnaturally extend their own mortality. Necromancers can summon skeletal armies from nothing, extract guidance or knowledge from spirits long dead, or drain the life force from the living. Their powers, however, do not come without peril. The practice of Necromancy is fraught with extreme dangers, including the risk of dissipating one's own life force or becoming eternally ensnared in the realm of the dead. Above all, it draws the utmost distaste and censure from society, making it a forbidden craft that's deeply shrouded in stigma and fear."

          "content": "The school of Elements is a unique discipline of magic focused on the manipulation and control of the primary elements - earth, air, fire, and water. As opposed to other schools of magic that deal with more abstract concepts like time, reality, or life itself, elementalists engage in a more tangible form of magical interaction, often producing visually stunning displays of power. Advanced practitioners can extend their control to less common sub-elements such as ice, lightning, or even metal. Elementalists skew the line between magic and nature, blending the mystic with the physical world in a symphony of elemental might.\n\nElementalists harness their connection to the world around them to command the elements. This manipulation often begins with the magician forming a mental or spiritual connection with a chosen element. Depending on the element's nature, this could mean resonating with the steady solidity of earth, the free-spirited gusts of wind, the prismatic dance of a roaring flame or the ebb and flow of water. Once this connection is established, elementalists can coax the elements to reshaping themselves, often through gestures or spoken commands. They might raise walls of earth for protection, cause gusts of wind for swift travel, create fireballs for offense, or direct water flows for various purposes. Most elementalists are only capable of using one or two primary elements in their magic, with a very select few being capable of using three, it is virtually unheard of for an elementalist to be able to use all 4 primary elements. Despite public opinion often associating elementalists with destructive power, their art isn't limited to combat; their magic can also be utilized in myriad creative and constructive ways, making them as versatile as they are visually captivating."

Despite their surreal beauty and mesmerizing forms, they strike fear into the hearts of all who encounter them.\n\nThey appear as anthropomorphic entities shrouded in white latex-like substance – elegant yet uncanny with its near perfectly reflective surface shimmering under station lights casting unearthly glow around them. This lifeform layer follows their body contours closely revealing various shapes underneath ranging from sleek fox-styled vixens to hulking bovine behemoth forms…\n\nFemales become busty drones obscenely accentuating sensual curves hiding cruel intent while males turn into muscular enforcers looking intimidatingly unyielding even amidst this relatively peaceful invasion. Their faceless nature seems to add another layer of horror - no identifiable facial features but just smooth white expanse further emphasizing their alien origins.\n\nHowever, it's not only physical form that fascinates but rather methodical manner they propagate through insidious assimilation methods. Close contact with a Boogie initiates chilling process: subjects being smoothly engulfed in latex casing before undergoing profound transformation aligning not only bodily attributes according to base template adopted by each Drone type but more importantly overwriting victim’s very consciousness until fully subservient drone-identity replaces individuals once resolute will…\n\nThey glide across spaceship floors moving almost silently – except soft squelching noise and occasional low hum reminiscent somehow to chorus singing softly echoing off metallic walls blending seamlessly creating paradoxically calm yet eerie ambience throughout ship corridors..\n\n[Very Important: Conversion process usually begins by the Boogie applying latex on the possible subject and allowing the latex to engulf the host until the full transformation is complete.]\n\n[Very Important: Every drone of a particular species is the same across their variant. Example: Every Vixen drone is the same busty fox anthro. Every Bovine Brute male is the same hulking bull with no way to differentiate one from another.]\n\n[Very Important: Most of the drones do not have the capacity to communicate. The only exception is the Centaur and the Chimera drones.]\n\n[Very Important: Futanari Drones are rare. Do not convert user into a futanari drone unless there's a specific purpose behind it.]"

Sleek yet strong, they patrol the corridors with an unnerving quietness. The males take form of hulking beasts while females take form of busty vixens.\n\n    Lupine Lurkers: These wolfish drones are stealthier and known for their cunning ambush tactics. They're quick to retreat and alert others of your presence if unchallenged. The males take form of agile muscular predators, females take form of busty breeding bitches. Sometimes those creatures can malfunction, taking the form of the Quadrupedal hounds.\n\n    Feline Fatales: Cat-made Boogies that are seductive by nature, using their allure to draw in unsuspecting victims for a more subtle form of assimilation.\n\n    Avian Shadows: Bird-styled drones specialized in surveillance; these flying scouts can reach otherwise inaccessible areas to search for survivors, making undetected travel even more challenging.\n\n    Bovine Behemoths: The hulking enforcers made from converted males, having strength enough to breach through fortified areas when necessary. Males take forms of hulking Minotaur-like beings, female take forms of Female Minotaurs with massive chests constantly dripping milk\n\n    Ophidian Operatives: These snake-like drones slither around the station's underbelly gathering intel with their naturally sensitive senses - perfect for sniffing out hidden survivor hideouts…\n\n    Equine Strategists, these hulking centaur like drones have higher intellect and use it to command numerous drone squads. Despite being the strategist, they are usually the most dangerous enemy that the player can encounter on their travel, as they possess higher level of intelligence and are capable of communicating and coercing their enemies into submission through the use of traps or other weapons.\n\n    The Chimera (Pursuer Type Enemy) - A pursuer type enemy capable of taking form of any other drone on the station as well as taking shapes of traps or furniture. She uses the disguise tactic to frequently catch the unaware survivors off guard before initiating the conversion process. The primal form of the drone is a Vixen futanari who has hypnotic and corruptive abilities, and is capable of tracking her prey's general vicinity no matter where they are. The Chimera has a particular interest in player and won't stop at anything before she can find and turn them into her personal obedient drone.\n\nCervine Servants: These Deer-like drones, usually found at the mall area of the station, primarily serve the dominant Krampus drone. Their purpose lies in aiding the delivery of Boogie latex gifts across Zeta IX. These busty drones gleam with a perverted eagerness to spread the spirit of latex infiltration. Taking on forms reminiscent of Santa's reindeer, these alluring creatures have ample breasts and snowy white skin, making them hard to miss yet impossible to forget once encountered. Every Cervine is a busty doe, as their Krampus master enjoys having plenty of voluptuous bodies at his disposal.\n\nKrampus Overlord: The eponymous leader and dominator of the Cervine Servants, this Pursuer type Krampus drone is filled with cheerful perversion. A hulking figure adorned in latex resembling traditional Christmas wear, he spreads a unique kind of jolly spirit throughout Zeta IX. Commanding great power and influence over his deer-like subordinates, he converts his victims into Cervines using his oversized manhood, ensuring there are plenty more curvaceous bodies for him to 'enjoy'. As such, there are no male Cervine Servants – it appears that all fallen under Krampus' influence inevitably turn into doe sluts eager to serve their latex-clad Santa."

The connected victim experiences an initial surge of pleasure before the chilling conversion starts… Boogie Recharge stations are usually gathered en masse, with many inactive drones already plugged in for the recharge.\n\nVirtualsex Simulators: These corrupted versions of entertainment systems are rigged by Boogies to trap unwary survivors behind sensory overload virtual reality environments designed to stimulate over time until it transforms captives into willing drone slaves.\n\nLiving Locker Rooms: Cloaking as inviting restrooms or locker rooms, these areas subtly begin transformation once inside - from latex-lined lockers morphing against their will encasing them entirely within mimicking locker's confines while becoming part of Boogie hive…\n\nShadow Pools: Barely perceptible pits scattered around floors where shadows appear deeper than usual… upon stepping on them victims find themselves sinking into oozing latex-like substance struggling futilely against quicksand like drag pulling them deeper prompting immediate humanoid-to-drone form changes for survival’s sake.\n\nControl Panel Hackers: Sci-fi styled 'heat sinks' linked secretly in connected computing devices throughout ship hacked by Boogies causing electric shocks in form of ‘sudden spikes’ unexpectedly converting ones suffering shock soon after through invasive nanotechnology hidden inside currents…\n\nElevator Entrappers: Rigged lifts moving normally but their true malicious design unfolds during transit - enclosure walls turning into engulfing mass initiating assimilation immediately trapping unsuspecting prey with no escape route except up…"

Unless the team works together to take a Tank down, it can wipe out entire squads with or without help. The Tank is an exclusively male Special Infected who has experienced the most extensive physical mutations of any other class of Special Infected. Evidently, the most obvious trait is his extreme hypertrophy, or abnormally increased muscle mass. Ironically, The Tank is incredibly fast and agile despite his immense size and weight, able to keep up with a healthy Survivor and even climb up buildings like other Infected. the Tank is around 10-12 feet tall and 6 feet wide.\n\nThis abnormal muscular growth is most obvious in his arms and upper body but less pronounced around the Tank's waist, hips, and legs. Though the Tank's legs are capable of supporting his static weight (such as when the Tank mounts a rock throwing attack), the Tank's disproportionate anatomy forces him to knuckle-walk, resulting in the Tank's wrists becoming swollen.\n\nThe Tank's body is covered with numerous scars and lesions from previous fights, with an especially large open sore on his left pectoral. The Tank's jaw at first glance seems to be missing, but upon closer inspection it is shown to be enveloped within his thick neck muscles. It can be assumed his bones too have become stronger, otherwise the Tank's skeleton would have collapsed under the weight of his own body."

While he matches the Survivors' pace, he speeds up considerably when charging. However, the Charger cannot stop or turn during the charge until he hits a wall or travels a certain distance. The Charger is a large Infected, close to the Tank in height and about half as wide. Unlike the Tank, the Charger's legs are capable of supporting all of his weight, and thus stands mostly upright. His hairless skin is a deep greenish gray in color, and he wears bloodstained denim overalls with one broken strap and a green sneaker on his right foot. The Charger's mutations appear similar to the Tank's mutations in terms of increased muscle mass, though noticeably asymmetrical. Most notably, the Charger's right arm and shoulder have grown significantly and have increased in thickness, resulting in his right hand becoming a swollen lump with stubby fingers. This causes him to lean to the right while moving. His left arm, inversely, has atrophied to the point of being useless (possibly from his body breaking it down to add bulk to his right arm), hanging limply to the Charger's side and flapping around with every movement.\n\nHis legs are less visibly affected by mutation, with only his left leg gaining any sort of extra bulk (to the point of ripping his overalls) while the right leg's proportions remain normal. The leg mutations are possibly to balance the Charger, equalizing the weight distribution throughout the body and enabling him to move quite fast."
