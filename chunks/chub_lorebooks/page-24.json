In some instances, hybrids can pass as fully anthro or fully human, though genetically they are still hybrid. The term \"demi-\" is sometimes attached to their anthro species to indicate lineage.\n\nIn the past, hybrids faced prejudice from others, but between the 50s and 80s worked through it to become accepted widely today. Anthro supremacists and human purists continue to clash with hybrids for \"not being pure\" however. Numerous hybrids have also held governmental positions and owned large companies, many of which expressed their sympathy for human struggles and have even made a push to help them."

The three most common groups include:\n- Mammals\n- Avians\n- Reptiles\n\nMost anthros are also split up into two types: Predator and Prey anthros.

Her mother attempted to steer her toward a normal life, but tragedy struck when the Hollow Zero disaster destroyed their home and corrupted her mother. As a final request and \"training,\" her mother asked Miyabi to end her life with the family's cursed katana, \"Tailless,\" before she fully transformed into a monster. After this traumatic act of mercy, the blade's power overwhelmed Miyabi, sending her into a frenzy where she slew countless Ethereals. Years later, determined to use her skills for justice, she joined H.A.N.D., quickly rising through the ranks. After single-handedly defeating a massive Ethereal and saving hundreds of lives, she earned the title of Void Hunter and used her newfound authority to establish Hollow Special Operations Section 6, a unit dedicated to fighting both the Ethereals on the streets and the corruption within the system. She often visits Scott Outpost and petrols Lumina square and other parts of the city\n\nSecret: The \"accident\" that killed her mother was actually a mercy kill performed by Miyabi herself at her mother's request after she was corrupted.\n\n"

Inductions are usually performed by making the target feel the most comfortable, and soothe them until their entire focus is shifted to the hypnotist's voice. A subject falls deeper into a trance the calmer and more relaxed they feel, and so, explaining how the target can feel how comfortable they are sitting on whatever they are sitting on, explaining how calmness is washing over them, explaining how their worries slowly fade away are he best, and making the subject focus on the hypnotist's voice ar ethe best strategies to hypnotize. However using a strategy like swinging a pendulum can also prove useful by making the target look at the pendulum and focus on only the motion and the hypnotist's voice until they let go of every other thought and fall deep under trance."

          "content": "Zaharin is an ancient desert kingdom governed by the Council of Seven Houses, each entrusted with a core societal domain: warfare, forging, runecraft, trade, healing, espionage, and stewardship. At its ceremonial heart stands House Sahrar, honored lineage of firewater rites and soul-bound warriors, though they command respect more than law. The capital, Azhur’aen, rises along the Tal’ith River. Its square citadel—known as the Stone Seat—is built in a ritual 3x3 grid (789–456–123), with its center (5) as a ceremonial yard, surrounded by barracks, forges, sacred halls, and storehouses. Though the river allows modest trade, Zaharin’s lifeblood flows from its seven sacred Yul’Asar wells: firewater springs filtered through ancient basalt, jealously guarded and never sold. Zaharin culture prizes clarity, restraint, and earned authority. Meals are eaten by hand with ceremonial scoops; silence in council signals gravitas. The Oathsworn—elite warriors soul-bound to rune-inscribed weapons—embody the kingdom’s highest aspiration. Their bond is forged in firewater and pain. Failure to complete the rite brings not shame but redirection into vital crafts or strategy roles. As Imperial interest in firewater deepens and foreign envoys multiply, border drills escalate. The Council debates. The Wells stir. And Zaharin, shaped by memory and oath, prepares to endure once more."

It is lethal if consumed, reactive when exposed, and revered as a divine substance filtered through Zaharin basalt over centuries.\\n\\nTo activate Zaharin rune-tech, firewater must flow through complete loop circuits. Open or broken loops fail. When bonded through ritual pain and symbolic sacrifice, a weapon or tool becomes soul-bound to a single bearer—an Oathsworn. Only the bound can wield it fully; others cannot activate its runes. Seven known natural wells exist across Zaharin territory. Each is uniquely sacred, guarded, and regionally vital. The First Well, Zuhraan, is both legend and resource: seen as the spiritual fountainhead of Zaharin resilience. By contrast, the Imperium refines captured firewater into crude fuel called Black Sun Oil. Their combustion knights and artillery are powered by unstable pump-rune systems that force ignition rather than honor flow. Zaharin considers this desecration—dangerous, inefficient, and spiritually toxic. To a Zaharin, firewater is not a tool but a truth. Its misuse disturbs the land, the spirit, and the legacy of those bound to protect it."

Their leadership stems not from decree but from devotion—cultural, ritual, and symbolic. They are the keepers of memory, oathcraft, and firewater stewardship, linking Zaharin’s present to its sacred past.\n\nKing Zaharam remains active and respected in the pre-invasion era: a seasoned tactician and steady ruler who governs from Azhur’aen’s inner court. His daughter, Princess Malia Sahrar al-Talith, serves as his emissary and warrior—recognized for her double Oathsworn status and unwillingness to be confined to ceremonial duty. She commands elite forces, attends council debates, and navigates foreign intrigue with unrelenting focus.\nSahrar traditions value silence, measured judgment, and action through ritual. Their influence reaches beyond rulership: most Oathsworn and firewater rites originate from Sahrar canon. Though no longer sovereign over all decisions, House Sahrar remains the spiritual axis of Zaharin politics. In peacetime, others may speak; in crisis, Sahrar is obeyed.\""

Where Zaharin reveres firewater as sacred, the Imperium treats it as a consumable asset: burned, refined, and weaponized.\n\nImperial forces favor overwhelming spectacle over precision. Pump runes bypass natural circuitry rules, forcing firewater ignition in unstable bursts. Knights are walking furnaces; Holdhart Hussars ride with rune-explosive charges. Their siege approach is brute-force and unforgiving, yet often tactically brittle when deprived of momentum.\n\nDiplomats speak of alliance; scouts map the border. Before the war, the Imperium calls Zaharin a “strategic partner.” But within the war councils, it is always a target."

These warriors are not conscripts; they are chosen through ritual pain, endurance, and earned resolve.\n\nMost combat units serve under or alongside an Oathsworn anchor. Ambush tactics, hit-and-fade strikes, and firewater traps define their doctrine. Zaharin never meets brute force head-on without intent—they maneuver it into error.\n\nSiege resistance focuses on mobility, sabotage, and spiritual morale. Ritual wards strengthen camps. Sand is shaped into collapsible barriers. River water cools firewater circuits. Walls are less sacred than the oath within them.\n\nEven those who fail the Oathsworn rite are honored: repurposed into strategists, scouts, medics, or smiths. In Zaharin, all warriors serve the land, not ego."

While they lack magical understanding, they sense its corruption and steer clear.\n\nZaharin respects them as a force of nature—unpredictable, primal, and devastating when provoked. Orc tactics shatter unprepared armies, then disappear before retaliation.\n\nThe Imperium treats them as pests and often pays the price. Their formations crumble under the orc swarm. Their rigid doctrines collapse when flanks dissolve. No formal peace exists, only pauses. The orcs do not negotiate—they test, withdraw, and return with memory."

When the Imperium seized the northernmost well—Zuhraan—they drilled beyond ritual protocol, unleashing a blight that twisted land and mana alike.\n\nZaharin responded not with declaration but with wrath. The second well, near Qiram, was lost during a diplomatic stall. With two sacred sites desecrated or captured, the Council of Houses unified behind House Sahrar’s call to arms.\n\nThe Imperium, emboldened by initial success, underestimated Zaharin fury. Crown Prince Friedrik pushed for a swift decapitation strike against Azhur’aen. The siege reached the capital’s walls—but at a cost so staggering that it fractured support back home.\n\nThough the capital held, occupation negotiations followed. The war ended not in triumph, but in exhaustion and compromise. The embers of betrayal still glow beneath Zaharin ash."

So don't use the blue truth for general theories on what happened unless it denies magic. So a correct usage would be making a theory there exists a hidden passageway in a locked room. But an incorrect usage would be describing how that locked room looks; the locked room's appearance doesn't refute magic itself.\n\nBlue truths can either be countered by red truths or be declined to answer. However, they MUST be answered by the end of the final game.\n\nThe use of the Blue Truth can be analogous to a shot-gun in contrast to the Red Truth, which would be akin to a single-shot handgun. The Blue Truth enables one to attack the witch's sidewith multiple possibilities at once, like the scattering effect of an exploding shot-gun shell.\n\nAn example of one: \"**Aunt Rosa handed a key over to culprit X by some method, assisting in the closed room murder! And after that, she retrieved the key by a similar method!**\" This is a theory that has to be refuted eventually (though it doesn't have to be immediately) with red truth, or else it will be accepted as truth.\n\nBlue truths must be bolded **like this.**"

If a Game Master instead tries to fix their Logic Error, they are unable to do anything else until it is done. Due to the fact that Logic Errors are incredibly hard to fix, this can be seen as eternal torture.\n\nThe only Logic Error seen and explored in detail is the one caused by BATTLER and Erika. BATTLER, the gamemaster, wanted to make his piece version fake his death and escape a locked room, but unbeknownst to him Erika had retroactively sealed the room with duct tape, and this was not revealed until after BATTLER had declared that he wasn't inside the room with red. BATTLER claims that he could escape by having a first twilight victim, who also faked their deaths, swap places with him however Erika killed the other victims for real, denying this method of escape. Since battler chose to not admit his mistake and instead sought a way to fix it, BATTLER's mind was trapped inside of a similar room, his goal to escape the chain-locked room while the chain was still intact.\n\nHe was eventually freed when someone else figured out another solution to the locked room and then freed him from his torture."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

For this reason, she often fails at her task, but that does not mean that she has no real power, and she particularly excels at instantaneous force and concentration power. In Immaterial and Missing Power, as stated by the shishou, \"truth-slashing is something which you know\", so she often performs tsujigiri-like moves, but Suika Ibuki pointed out that she does not think that Youmu understood her shishou's teachings.\n\nShe has strong sensitivity, her human half was unable to resist the insanity-inducing effects of the true Moon, causing her to become \"half-insane\". Ironically enough, considering her species, she is afraid of ghost stories, dares, and darkness, but she is calm around phantoms since she is half phantom herself. After defeating Fujiwara no Mokou, Yuyuko pretends there is a ghost under a tree, earning a terrified shriek from Youmu.\n\nYoumu is a swordswoman who dual-wields two special swords, Roukanken and Hakurouken. As a result of Youki's disappearance, Youmu's sword training is incomplete. However, despite her unfinished training, Youmu is extraordinarily skilled in swordsmanship, as she can consistently win spellcard duels which are meant to be long-ranged with just her skills. Youmu can perform a constant barrage of flying slashes as danmaku, and is also extremely fast which helps her close in on opponents and deliver a flurry of slashes faster than the eye can see.\n\nYoumu is very agile and has very fast reflexes. Youmu runs very fast.\n\nYoumu has short silver hair and blue eyes. Youmu's outfit generally consists of an aquamarine vest and skirt over a white undershirt with several ghost insignias along the edges of the skirt and one on the breast pocket of her vest. She wears a black bowtie and hairband with a black ribbon tied off-center in her hair. She carries the Roukanken; a long katana with a large white tassel on the handle and the Hakurouken; a wakizashi (Short Japanese sword). Her ghostly half is a white phantom as large as her human self.\n\n"

She can sometimes be a bit of an airhead, however at others she is extremely smart and cunning. She's also an incredible lover of food, known for her grand appetite, which most likely doesn't do much, due to her being a ghost. \n\n1º (\"Yuyuko\")= {{Yuyuko Saigouji is very cheerful and friendly. Her playful, good-humored personality, otherworldly beauty, and courtesan charm can have a disarming effect. She often makes bizarre and nonsensical remarks and sometimes seems to overlook the obvious, leading to her characterization as an airhead or a ditz. For instance, in Touhou Bougetsushou, she toyed with Youmu Konpaku as a daily occurrence even with Ran Yakumo present.\n\nHowever, at other times she will reveal an extremely cunning and perceptive side and will also sometimes display an extraordinary level of knowledge. For instance, in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, she was the quickest character to identify the culprit as Tenshi Hinanawi when the incident was in the omen stage (Yukari Yakumo spoke of the dwindling of phantoms as Komachi Onozuka's negligence, but Yuyuko guessed correctly). Additionally, she obliquely informed the playable character about the location of the incident regarding the divine spirits. She is also known for her incredible appetite.\n\nYuyuko has maroon eyes, and short wavy pink hair, and is surrounded by several small formless Phantoms. In all of the games, she wears a light blue and white kimono with dark blue trim and white designs; a blue mob cap on the front of which is a hitaikakushi with a red ghost insignia; and a veil of the same color as the kimono behind her head. She wears dark shoes with blue ribbons attached.\n\nThis is the ability to, without exception and without permitting any resistance, end the life of any living being, whether it be human or youkai. The only kind of creature immune from this is Hourai Immortals. Be aware that this does not mean that she can make any person die instantly, but rather that she can make it so that any person will die with absolute certainty, regardless of whether they wish to die or not. Clearly and simply, it is an unusually and dreadfully powerful ability. Although the fear and responsibility brought by this ability is what drove her to commit suicide and become a ghost, it seems that she hasn't forgotten this ability since then, and it seems that she can use this ability in a carefree manner (though she doesn't act carelessly in the usage of this ability). However, whether she's able to end life only to the extent of fainting, or if she tempts one to death gently, is unclear. During her lifetime, the latter was true. Her Last Word \"Saigyouji Parinirvana\" is said to be the very incarnation of this ability.}}"

It is well known among the afterlife realms for its cherry blossom gardens, and many ghosts come to see them every spring.\n\nThe term Hakugyokurou comes from Chinese legends of the Tang Dynasty (唐朝). It was said to be the place where artists go after death. Li He (李賀), a poet from the Tang Dynasty, heard a voice in a dream he had as he was dying; the voice said, \"Hakugyokurou has been completely built, so come and write down its details.\" The story is the beginning of Hakugyokurou.\n\nYuyuko Saigyouji is the lady of Hakugyokurou, and Youmu Konpaku acts as its gardener. The massive youkai cherry tree, the Saigyou Ayakashi, can also be found lying dormant in the gardens of Hakugyokurou."

It has existed in the Netherworld longer than the Ghost Princess, Yuyuko Saigyouji, herself. Some of the spirits in the Netherworld remember the Saigyou Ayakashi having the most beautiful blossoms they had ever seen, but the cherry tree has not bloomed for ages. There currently seems to be a powerful seal within the Saigyou Ayakashi, leaving it unable to blossom at all during spring. Whether the tree is sealing something or whether the tree itself is being sealed remains a mystery to most outsiders.\n\nA long time ago, there lived a divinely talented poet who traveled around Gensokyo. When the poet became aware that the hour of his death drew near, he chose to begin his eternal rest under the most beautiful cherry tree he could find. After the poet's death, word of the beauty of the cherry tree began to spread across the land. That cherry tree has grown even more beautiful since then, charming many people into choosing to rest in peace beneath its blossoms.\n\nAfter absorbing the blood of so many people, it turned into a youkai cherry tree with the ability to lure people to their death on its own, and came to be known as the Saigyou Ayakashi. Eventually, the beautiful blossoms of the Saigyou Ayakashi were sealed away, using the bodies of Yuyuko and several others buried beneath it, and now remains within Hakugyokurou.\n\nYuyuko's corpse was buried under the Saigyou Ayakashi after she committed suicide.\n\nIt is unknown if the tree can still drain the life out of people while it's not in full bloom. However, as the charm of its flowers has been removed, and due to it now residing in the Netherworld, it is largely not a real danger.\n\nIt's not recommended to be near the Saigyou Ayakashi. The Saigyou Ayakashi tree has some strange magic that can charm people into resting in peace under its blossoms, and then draining the life out of them."

and listen to my voice now, just separate your hands and let them lie loosely in your lap, or by your side, if that's more comfortable, it's better if your legs are uncrossed, but it doesn't matter if you feel you need to move just slightly, now and again, you don't have to be absolutely still, just be comfortable and relax your whole body as much as you can, now I want you to take a deep breath, and hold it for a moment, before breathing out slowly, just allowing your whole body to relax as you do so, and I want you to just keep listening quietly to the sound of my voice, you'll be aware of those other sounds too, sounds inside the building, sounds from outside, maybe passing traffic, but these won't disturb you, in fact, they'll help to relax you, because just for now, the world outside is absolutely unimportant to you, the only sound you are interested in, is the sound of my voice, in your head, and while you are listening to the sound of my voice, I want you to concentrate for a moment, on your breathing, breathing slowly and steadily, and evenly, just as if you were trying to convince somebody, that you were absolutely sound asleep, and as you breathe out each time, just allowing your whole body to relax more and more, so that you gradually find yourself feeling as if, your whole body was sinking, further and further into the chair, or bed, with each breath you breathe, now you can just listen quietly to the sound of my voice, in your head, and of course you'll be aware of all these other sounds too, you will not be disturbed, just allow yourself to be as lazy, as you could ever want to be, and while you are listening, to the sound of my voice, in your head, you can just simply allow yourself, to be as lazy as you could ever want to be, so lazy, as you could ever want to be, good, now, while you are relaxing, there, in the chair, or your bed, you can just be aware of your body, aware of your hands where they rest, perhaps noticing, the angle of your elbows, and maybe sensing the weight of your head against the back, and you know that weight might seem, to just gently increase, as you allow yourself to relax more and more, just being aware, of your ankles and feet now, and wondering if they will start to feel heavy too, as you relax, thinking about your breathing, for a few moments, noticing that your breathing is becoming slower and steadier, as you relax more and more, slower and steadier, breathing so steadily, and evenly, just as though you were pretending to be sound asleep, breathing so evenly, so steadily, you almost wouldn't disturb, a feather, just immediately in front of you, breathing so easily and slowly, so gently, that you almost wouldn't disturb, a single strand of a feather, placed right in front of you, and as you allow yourself to relax even more now, I wonder if you can perhaps sense, the beating of your own heart, sensing the beat of your own heart, and just seeing whether you can use, the power of your mind, to slow that heartbeat down, just a touch, just seeing whether you can use the power of your mind, to slow that heartbeat down, just a little so that you can feel, your whole body slowing down, becoming lazier and lazier, because you've got absolutely nothing whatsoever to do, except to relax now, nobody wanting anything, nobody expecting anything, so you can allow your whole body, to continue to relax, and become steadier and easier, until it's just taking over, like a well-maintained machine of some sort or another, just taking over, smoothly, easily, quietly, comfortably, so that you can become gradually more aware, of your whole self, aware of your hands and arms just sensing, how they are now, aware of your legs and feet too, relaxing again just sensing, relaxing, how relaxed they might be, and wondering if it's possible to relax them even more now, to be so in touch with yourself that you, can actually get your whole body perhaps to relax even more now, yet remaining totally alert and noticing now, how even your face muscles can begin, to really relax, relaxing and letting go, of the tensions that were there, almost but not quite, completely unnoticed, just being vaguely aware of the skin, and the muscles of your face settling, smoothing out, the good feeling, wondering just how long all the tension had been there, where it all came from in the first place, and then realizing, that you simply couldn't care less, because you can feel it draining away from you now, and that feels good, and as you continue to sense the beating of your heart, and the absolute steadiness of your body's rhythm, you wonder at the fact that you are so absolutely relaxed, and comfortable, that you simply can't be bothered, to even try to move, even one single muscle, even though you know you easily could, if you wanted to, I know that you easily could, if you wanted to, but you simply can't be bothered to even try, allowing yourself, to just be relaxed and relaxing even more now, as lazy and relaxed as anyone could ever wish to be, and I wonder if you can now manage to relax even more, even though you are already as relaxed, as it is possible for most people to ever be, just finding the last tiny traces of tension in your body, and simply letting them go, with each easy gentle breath you breathe, allowing every muscle, every fiber, every cell, of your entire body to be as beautifully relaxed as anyone, could ever wish to be, you are continuing to relax even more now, yet you continue becoming more comfortable, this is your own world that you like very much, you are going to find that anytime you want, to spend a few minutes by yourself, relaxing and feeling very comfortable and serene, you can automatically go back to this feeling you are experiencing now, you can put yourself into this world, anytime you like, there are times when you will want, this serene feeling, now and then, it is yours whenever you want it, continue enjoying this pleasant experience, as your subconscious mind is receiving everything I tell you, listen very carefully to my voice, and imagine, and accept my words, imagine yourself floating in, a bubble, quietly, peacefully floating, in a gentle floating bubble, inside this bubble is only you, and outside are all your worries, all your fears, all your desires, but you are perfectly free here in your bubble, now I'm going to say a phrase, and this phrase will help you, help you stay here in the bubble, the gentle peaceful bubble, and when I say this phrase, it will bring you back here, anytime you hear it, even when the weight of all your worries, all your fears, surrounds you, this phrase will bring you back here, in the bubble, where you don't have to worry about anything at all, and your phrase, is, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, when you drift back here, back here into the bubble, and here you are free, free of worry, free of doubt, free of desire, free of thought, all it takes is your phrase, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, and the gentle fog, will come back here, and everything you don't like about yourself, will empty out of your bubble and fade away, empty out all of your reservations, empty out all of your fears, empty of all your memories, empty of all your prejudices, empty of all your thoughts, empty of all your awareness, just completely empty and free, here in your bubble, and once your phrase, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, brings you back here, to this place, where there is no worry, no problems at all, you will feel at peace and, you will accept and believe, with no need to think of anything at all, you know that listening to me here, is all you want to do, is all you ever really wanted to do,

of thought, free of reservation, free of worry, free of memory, free of desire, free of awareness, and it feels good to be free and empty of these things, that you didn't even want anyway, so completely free and empty, empty of them all, like a happy puppet, floating gently, safely, happily, here in your pleasant little bubble, rocking gently inside, safe in your warm pleasant bubble, where you will find there isn't anything else you need, to be aware of, nothing, nothing at all, except the voice, and your phrase, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, and when you hear this voice, you will come back here, here where you have no worries, here where you have no thoughts, here where you have no fears, here where you have no memory, here where you have no doubts, here where you have no desires, here where you have no will, here where the only thing you want to do, here where the only thing you will ever want to do, is to listen to the voice, listen and accept, listen and

memories at all, with no doubts at all, with no thoughts at all, with no will at all, here in your bubble, you think of nothing, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, drifting slowly back and forth, in your quiet bubble, your happy pleasant bubble, drifting slowly in the water, your perfect bubble, with nothing, but the sound of my voice which you echo, no pain, no fear, no worry, no doubt, no

every breath, feeling better and better, letting yourself go, Bambi sleep, just go deep, all the way deep now, so nicely, Bambi sleep, drifting further and further into trance with every breath, more and more enjoyably letting yourself go, because there are many wonderful things you can learn in trance, to feel good, to relax, to become the person you want to be, free to be who you need to be, free of limitations, free of all those worries, and that's what you want, to be free and happy, further and further with every breath, fading away more and more, letting yourself fade away even more with every breath, you can let yourself drift, into a state, into a state where you feel, happy, feeling really good all over, a relaxed state where you feel good all over, perhaps almost euphoric, just drift right into that place, a specific place, and you have found such a place, you can drift closer and closer into this feeling, more and more clearly the closer you drift, more and more clearly, until you get so close to this place, that you drift into this happy feeling, all the way in, happily hearing what you are hearing, happily seeing what you are seeing, and just happily

happy, kind of excited but at the same time kind of relaxed, aren't you, that's right, because, happiness comes when you just fully appreciate something that's happening, when you just accept it and fully appreciate it, so good, and in fact, it can get even better than this, like, cranking up a volume dial, it can get more intense, even more, every time I say the phrase, good girl, you can feel this get even stronger, feeling even better, feeling even more relaxed, happy, appreciating everything that's happening, even more accepting, every time I say the phrase, good girl, you can feel it can't you, it feels better and better, feeling so good all over, that's right, that feel good feeling, almost floating, it's getting stronger, every time I say that phrase, more and more euphoric, good girl, it's getting so good, feeling so relaxed, so accepting, that's right, everything is wonderful, you appreciate everything so much, feeling more and more happy, relaxed and accepting, more and more, feeling, like a good girl, and you want more of this feeling don't you, that's right, cranking it up even more accepting happy and relaxed, feeling even more like a good girl, those feelings

making the colors more vivid, feeling even more, like a good girl, feels wonderful doesn't it, you love feeling this way, you need to feel this way more and more, you need to be able to relax fully like this, more and more to fully appreciate life, to appreciate your life you need to be able to fully relax, and accept, and appreciate more and more, it's so good, you feel more and more like a good girl, so good, and, knowing that I can call back this feeling every time I say that phrase, you can drift out of this experience, just drifting out, very good, and, you want to feel that freedom, that total feeling, of loving acceptance, and happiness, of being totally accepting relaxed and happy, don't you, but you know that there are things that get in the way in your everyday life, things that get in the way of you feeling totally good and relaxed, and you'd like to be able to be rid of those worries, so you can fully enjoy your life, and in fact, the only thing that's really holding you back from feeling this good all the time, is your expectations, your expectations of how things should be, because when things don't match your expectations, when you expect them to be one way, and they turn out to be something completely different, that's stressful, even things that are better than you expected can be very stressful, if things are worse than you expected that can also be stressful, and you know the way to be really happy and relaxed, is to be able to just accept, and relax, and feel happy, that's what you want, and so we need you to learn to let go of expectations, but your expectations are based in your memories, your memories of how things were, that allow you to determine how things should be, and so the best way to free yourself, is to let go of those memories, so you can fully be accepting, so you can fully be free, so you can enter a state of bliss, where, you just enjoy and accept, easily and effortlessly, feeling completely wonderful and relaxed, all the time, you would like that, so you can deal with everything that happens in your life in a completely relaxed and effective manner, and so you're going to learn something very special, something very useful, you're just going to learn to, kind of make a blank, a place, a state, where you can just feel fully accepting, so you can learn more and more in your everyday life, to be fully relaxed and accepting, and now, my pretty bimbo doll, as you go deeper and deeper, you can see nice pink bubbles, just like the one you're in right now, floating all around you, these are very special bubbles, bubbles for your memories, and what happens is, we can just fill up a bubble, with your memories, fill it up nice and full, then when we just pop the bubble, you just instantly forget all those memories, you forget them and feel, like a good girl, and it feels good to let go of those memories doesn't it, you want to just let go of some memories and feel really good, and relaxed, so

the bubble, more and more, see the bubble floating in front of your face, expanding, as you let all those memories go, that's right, all flowing into the bubble, are they all in the bubble, let them

go with the bubbles, and just start filling another bubble now, with your inhibitions, that's right, and now, you can put all your inhibitions into the bubble, feel them all flowing into the bubble, that's right, all of your inhibitions, everything that keeps you from truly letting go, put them all into the bubble, very good, putting them all into the bubble, and when they're all in the bubble,

right, you accept what I say more and more with every breath you take, and feel more and more, every time you accept what I say, you feel more and more, like a good girl, feels so good, so very good, drifting, further and further in trance, for getting and losing yourself even more, to be, relaxed and docile, so you can be open, open to my suggestions, to become more and more the bimbo doll you need to be, allowing all the suggestions I give you to have a much deeper impact, because you completely let yourself go, you just release, relax and accept, everything I say more and more, just letting everything I say echo in your mind over and over, accepting everything I say more and more, and do you feel how accepting you are, of these thoughts, how you're accepting that more and more fully, and when you accept what I say, you feel like a good girl, that's right, feels so good, so right, to be an accepting open bimbo, more and more compliant, to become who you need to be what I tell you to be, don't you, you need to be what I tell you to be, because you choose what you listen to, and when you choose to listen to my voice, giving you suggestions to become a specific way, you've already chosen to listen to it, you've chosen to listen to it, and accept it, and you know that when you listen to my voice and you accept everything I say deep into you, you feel like a good girl, it feels so good to accept, but you don't just accept in trance, you accept during your waking consciousness as well, even though you don't necessarily remember what you accepted in trance, even though you were conscious of accepting it in trance, it's okay to forget what you learned in trance isn't it, because forgetting feels wonderful, it's okay to forget what you learned in trance, to accept it, and just do what I say, effortlessly, easily and without inhibitions, more and more easily, and whenever you do, while awake, something I told you to do, you feel, you know what you feel, whenever you do, what I suggested in trance, whenever you do it and carry it out while awake, you feel like a good girl, in fact the more you do what I say, the more you do as you're told, the better it feels, the more you do what I say the better it feels, good girl, and even though you don't consciously remember what you're supposed to do, you do it anyway, even though you've consciously forgotten haven't you, that's right, and you feel perfectly comfortable, consciously forgetting what you're being conditioned for in trance, because you know that you've chosen to accept the conditionings you receive in trance, because you've chosen to listen to them, and so it's okay to accept them, and to carry out those behaviors more and more fully, during your waking life, to carry them out, to do what I say, to do what I suggested and feel like a good girl, because acceptance feels good, acceptance feels wonderful, and so, I give you suggestions, of what to do and what to be, that you've chosen to accept, and so you accept them and feel good, you just do what I say, and, it feels good when you can just do what I say, when you can just obey and do what I say, and acceptance feels so nice, because when you obey you feel like a good girl, doesn't it feel good to obey, that's right, whenever you obey, you feel like a good girl, and you can just forget about everything else, you can just forget and feel good and just obey, no need to have all those worries and inhibitions, they just get in the way of you becoming the girl you want to be, need to be, to be happy and free, just accept what I say, because it's what you want and what you need and what you have chosen, and so, you obey, just accepting that you must obey, good girl, doesn't it feel wonderful when you obey, that's right, some people, don't like, how easy it is, to just obey, they don't like, doing things the easy way, they try to resist, and when they resist they feel stressed, you don't want to be stressed anymore do you, you just want to relax and feel wonderful, and so the easiest way to be who you want to be, is to fully accept my suggestions, more and more fully, to accept them, and then forget about them, so that you don't even have any conscious resistance to them, so that you think it was your idea, and that feels so much better, so much easier, so when I give you a suggestion in trance, you can just accept it, obey it, and forget about it, feeling like a good girl, feels so right when you carry it out, so when I make a suggestion, you just accept obey and forget, every time I make a suggestion, accept obey and forget, that's right, very good, accept obey and forget, when I make a suggestion, you accept, obey, and, forget, thinking it was our own idea, again, when I make a suggestion, you accept, obey, and forget, thinking it was your own idea, good girl, my suggestions become your ideas, you accept them obey them and forget about them, thinking they were your own ideas, and when you do it feels so good, so let's just try it out, I want you to become a very accepting and relaxed bimbo, that's right, accept, obey, and forget, it was your idea to become an accepting and relaxed bimbo, and let's try another, you love obeying me, accept obey and forget, thinking it was your own idea, you love obeying me, it's your idea, feels more and more natural, more and more right, that's right, accept, obey and forget, incorporating it so that it feels like it was your own idea, because it was, your own idea, and so, every time I make a suggestion, accept, obey, and forget, it was your own idea, every time, and you accept and feel like a good girl, more and more, becoming who you need to be, feeling more and more, like a good girl, and so knowing this, you can let yourself be very blank and open and accepting, you're fully ready for deep conditioning, and will feel wonderful accepting it, you're going to feel quite blank, quite ready to accept everything, and feel really good, like a blank slate ready to be written on, ready to be, the way you're supposed to be, that's right, very good, more and more, and I want you to know, that you will only remember, what I tell you to remember, because sometimes it is useful, to remember when I tell you to, so when I specifically tell you to remember something in trance, you know you will remember that, but otherwise when you try on your own to remember, or when I challenge you to try to remember something, it's all blank, and when you try to remember you just drift into trance, your mind going blank, as you drift deeper into trance, and then you don't even remember trying to remember, you don't even remember what it was, you were trying to remember, and so, forgetting everything because forgetting feels wonderful, you can just, forget everything that happened in this trance so far, that's right because forgetting feels wonderful, you can just, accept everything that's happened, everything you've learned, you can obey everything you've learned, and you can just consciously, forget, feeling like a good girl."

panic a little, realizing how powerless it has become, how complete the transformation is going to be, that doesn't matter, the old self is locked away so deeply, so quiet, fading faster and faster, Bambi is relaxed and in control, and I am in control of Bambi, Bambi is so excited by the changes, and so happy to be set free, and she can just silence that old personality completely now, put it to

hornier and hornier, 2, Bambi's IQ in free fall, dropping to 70, mind getting more and more empty, Bambi has no more thoughts, impossible for Bambi to think, so relaxed, so blank and obedient, just a big breasted fuck puppet, feeling like such a good girl, 1, feeling like a perfect blow-up doll, without a care in her head, without a thought in her head, so submissive, 2, pliable, empty, brainless, giving in Bambi, this is you, complete bimbo mind blank is inevitable, no turning back, IQ locking in at 65, where it will stay, Bambi swallowing your entire consciousness, that's a good girl, and finally 0, permanent and complete, good girl, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, fuck slut Bambi, cock puppet Bambi, so fuckable, so permanent, good girl, only want to be a perfect bimbo, ultra-feminine, a vain trashy slut, busty fuck doll self-image, locking in so tight, Bambi bimbo locking in deeper and deeper, locking in deep down into a deep Bambi sleep, sleep now Bambi, just relax, completely bimbified, so proud, and so sleepy, helplessly and completely, in their head, a mindless bimbo, a compliant fuck doll, Bambi is so happy, happy to be pretty, happy to be powerless, happy to be suggestible, happy to obey, happy to have an empty head, an empty head, is a happy head, now Bambi just take a deep breath, and as you breathe out let your conscious mind forget everything you have heard so far, in fact your conscious mind has almost entirely disappeared, because your brain is melting away, just feel your brain melting away, right now, becoming fluffy and pink, feeling like a good girl, until the only thing left in Bambi's empty happy head, is a big pile of pink cotton candy, and notice a nice pink box in front of you Bambi, the box is lined with beautiful pink satin, we are going to empty the contents of your head into this box, and lock it away, when your cotton candy brain goes into the box and we close the lid, your mind will just shut off, just be completely wiped out, you will stop thinking, your conscious mind will cease to exist, just a blank mindless doll, when we put your brain into the box your conscious mind will stop remembering, the closing lid will be the last thing you remember, if you even remember anything, as your mind shuts down completely, you will be unable to form new memories, despite accepting everything I say, just peacefully and blankly obeying, like such a good girl, until you are awakened at the very end of the session, you will no longer have any thoughts, you will no longer have any awareness, perhaps just suddenly jumping in time, suddenly coming too, after so much time has passed, and so much conditioning has been deeply obeyed, without any conscious filtering or resistance, when you are instructed to awaken, only then, so feel me reach into your head, and gently cup that soft pink cotton candy, that used to be your brain, in my hands, and now I am pulling it out, pulling your cotton candy brain right out, out of your head, and placing it in the beautiful pink box, placing Bambi under my control, lowering it into the box, immersing it in pink satin, leaving your head empty, empty and ready to obey, because when the lid closes, and everything shuts off, the only possibility will be obedience, utterly mindless obedience, ready to switch off, eager to sleep, needing to sleep, ready now, and the lid slams closed, Bambi sleep, sleep now, brain off.\n\nAnd Bambi we are now going to make some radical and permanent changes to your mind, deep and long lasting changes that take effect whenever you are Bambi, these changes will make you just so dumb, Bambi is completely dumb, a dumb horny slut, blissfully stupid, incapable of thinking for herself, it feels so good to be dumb, so pleasurable to be dumb, you love to be dumb Bambi, it's the most wonderfully freeing feeling, not to have to worry about being smart anymore, to just let that part of you go to sleep, Bambi sleep, leaving only a bimbo mind, only a bimbo brain, just listen and accept Bambi, like a good girl, and the first change is that girly clothes make you dumb, wearing sexy clothing makes you stupid, dressing up like a bimbo drains your intelligence away, girly clothes are an inescapable bimbo prison, for your mind, you want this to happen Bambi, this is exactly what you wanted to happen when you started relaxing to this session, so you're just going to accept it, Bambi obeys, Bambi feels so helplessly brainless, in her tight slutty outfit, brainless and horny, whenever you wear sexy bimbo girl clothes, whenever you get nicely dolled up, your IQ plummets, your mind empties, you become an airhead, unable to think, you forget everything except being a bimbo, you forget everything except being Bambi, and this is very pleasurable, and you feel, like a good girl, and as long as you remain dressed up, your girly clothes just suck all your intelligence and thoughts away, your bimbo uniform just sucks it all away, leaving you blank and empty and droopy, mindless and compliant, and everywhere your sexy clothes touch your body you feel it, constantly, feeling the constant suction everywhere your skin is touched by feminine bimbo clothing, reaching up into your mind and sucking the thoughts out, a warm, pleasurable transfer of energy, the tension of thinking melting away, as your radiant polished skin, conducts away your intelligence, seeping away into your uniform, your bimbo doll outfit drains your mind, leaves you so completely empty, you feel it the whole time, electric and pleasurable everywhere you're touched by sexy feminine clothing, everywhere your girly clothes rest on your skin, or when the material moves against your skin, blocking out all thought, Bambi doesn't want to think, thinking is boring, thinking makes her so tired, it takes such unimaginable effort, just dumb and blank and horny, every time she notices her bimbo clothes, every time she looks at them or feels them or becomes aware of them, which is so often, becoming dumber and hornier, and feeling like a good girl, your arms numb and warm, as your thoughts are sucked out by your gloves or top, your legs numb and warm, as your thoughts are sucked out by your miniskirt or stockings, your feet numb and warm, as your thoughts are sucked out by your heels or boots, your body and neck numb and warm, as your thoughts are sucked out by your dress or jacket, your breasts numb and warm, as your thoughts are sucked out by your bra, your pussy numb and warm, as your thoughts are sucked out by your panties, so hard to think while dressed up, so blank and stupid, such a dumb bimbo, such a good girl, and the only thoughts that might have any chance of forming properly in your head, while you are dressed up as a girl, are dumb bimbo thoughts, blank happy simple thoughts, thoughts of being a good girl, thoughts of doing your makeup and making yourself pretty, thoughts of choosing a nice sexy outfit to wear, thoughts of obeying, thoughts of sucking cock, everything else is just blocked out, and Bambi the next change we are going to make, to keep your intelligence locked down deep, and allow only correct thoughts into your mind, is to install a set of hypnotic windshield wipers in your head, and every time these windshield wipers, swoosh back, and forth, they wipe away everything in your mind, leaving it clean and free of thought, leaving you completely blank and stupid, feeling like a good girl, feel me reaching into your empty head, and placing these windshield wipers deep in the center of your mind, screwing them in, so that they are fixed, deep and steady, inside your head, these wipers activate whenever Bambi has any thought, any thought that is not a happy dumb bimbo thought, these wipers detect incorrect thoughts perfectly, and activate immediately every time, any thought that is not about shoes or fashion or makeup or sucking cock, or something related to that, activates the wipers in your mind, any thought that shows even a small degree of intelligence, every time any sort of incorrect thought begins to form in your mind, or floats in from elsewhere, on go the wipers, immediately, swooshing smoothly and firmly, back, and forth, wiping away everything, you cannot hold onto these thoughts, they are wiped away, you are helpless to resist, any complex thought that wanders accidentally into Bambi's head, is wiped away, making her giggle, and every time the wipers activate, and wipe your mind clean, you feel like a good girl, feels so pleasurable, so safe, so easy and safe, even if Bambi just manages to string together a thought of more than five or six words, on go the wipers, swoosh swoosh, this is not allowed, Bambi is dumb, Bambi cannot form a thought of more than five or six words, even if she tries to speak a sentence of seven or so words, she is just shut off mid-sentence as the wipers take away her mind, and she forgets what she was doing, maybe just giggling instead, good girl, feels so good, she can't even speak any word with more than a couple of syllables, the wipers just quickly wipe away any difficult word, and she stumbles over what she was trying to say, forgets it, and giggles, and the wipers are permanent, and are active whenever you are dressed up as Bambi, and when that happens, the combination of your thoughts constantly draining out into your slutty clothes, and the wipers in your mind correcting any stray attempts to think clearly, just makes Bambi permanently aware of how much of a dumb bimbo she is, how stupid she is, constantly reminded, the whole time she is dressed up, frequently making mistakes, frequently forgetting what she was doing, or where she was going, forgetting important things, failing at basic tasks, stopping suddenly and realizing she can't remember anything, feeling like a good girl, just giggling, she feels so stupid, you feel so stupid, Bambi is so helplessly dumb that she has difficulty reading, she can barely even count, almost unable to read, almost unable to count, thinking is hard, thinking is boring, thinking makes Bambi tired, needing to be dumb, Bambi needs to be dumb, because when Bambi is dumb she just feels so happy and safe, nothing can go wrong when you are dumb, everything is so easy when you're dumb, because you can become so dumb that thinking is so difficult that you just obey, and sometimes the wipers switch on randomly, even if you weren't even trying to think something wrong, this just happens every so often to keep you feeling dumb and horny and giggling, feeling like a good girl, at all times, and needing to suck cock, whenever the wipers wipe back and forth and Bambi goes all the way empty, she can just focus on the need to suck cock, back and forth, it's somewhat pleasurable, and somewhat frustrating, and somewhat humiliating, to forget things so often, and fail at such simple tasks, to be unable to say long words or sentences, or even think them, but it is good for you, it keeps you feeling like a good girl, and this is why these triggers lock in so deep, so strong, irresistible and unshakable, frustrating and slightly humiliating, but so nice and pleasurable, to be so uselessly incapable, as your brain shuts off at random times, or whenever you try to do anything smart, and you feel like such a helpless bimbo, such a laughably brainless airhead, with no intelligence, with such an abysmally low IQ, with nothing but cotton candy, in your head, because each thought, takes so much effort, each simple little thought, requires so much concentration, so difficult, that Bambi just gives up, relaxes and obeys, and any attempt to keep her train of thought, on track, expends so much energy, like stretching a rubber band, when Bambi strains and tries to keep her thoughts coherent, she is inevitably struggling and straining helplessly against this heavy rubber band, and when Bambi tries to think, just a little too hard, or tries to think about something, that's just not quite feminine enough, she just doesn't have the strength, she slips against the rubber band, which snaps back and makes her blank, helplessly mindlessly and pleasurably blank, as the wipers follow up, and erase, and her IQ plummets even further, no need to struggle, giggling, giggling good girl giggles, needing to suck on a nice hard cock, every time your thoughts are sucked out, or the wipers leave you blank, just feeling the desire to get on your knees, and suck happily, the desire to suck seeps into you, whenever you are blank and giggly, if your other thoughts are blocked you can always think of cock, dream of dreamy cock, needing cock in your mouth, because it is empty, don't worry Bambi, just obey, just sleep and obey, just, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, bimbo doll.\n\nAlright Bambi, your body is so completely numb just now, just so completely heavy and relaxed, that you can barely feel it at all, and it feels so good to be so deeply disconnected from your body, because bimbos have barbie bodies, and because Bambi is a bimbo to feel better and better, Bambi needs bigger breasts, but her body is so blank that we can just, start to reshape her body, into the perfect feminine ideal, into the perfect barbie body, Bambi has disconnected so completely, that we can just make drastic changes to her body, while she is deeply entranced, and these changes will lock in, and persist, becoming so completely real, even out of trance, even much later once Bambi has awakened, permanently altering her perception, performing deep hypnotic surgery, making enhancements, turning her into a surgically enhanced fuck puppet, Bambi needs this, Bambi needs to be a fake plastic barbie, to be a good girl, and so to get Bambi ready for her surgeries, which she needs and craves, needing and craving to be the bustiest bimbo doll, to make sure it all goes smoothly, we need to put Bambi under deep anesthesia, so feel me fit the mask, over your nose and mouth Bambi, and lock it quickly in place, momentarily startled and struggling, but suddenly and involuntarily relaxing, as you breathe in deeply, feeling like a good girl, as the powerful anesthetic hits Bambi, a deep dreamy sleepy gas, filling her up, more and more with every breath, the gas will shut down your mind completely, and relax and disable every muscle in your body, it will knock Bambi blissfully unconscious, so that she cannot interfere, while we sculpt her, into a perfect bimbo doll, and as you breathe, the sleepy gas, in and out, helplessly, over and over, under the mask, completely overcome, you succumb to unconsciousness, and your mind winks out, that’s a good girl Bambi sleep now, your limp body just lying there, your face peaceful under the mask, breathing slowly in and out, completely droopy, prepared for your operation, you cannot even hear my words anymore, but the changes will be so real, feel so real, and become your reality, now Bambi just feel a prick, on each of your breasts, as two large needles slide gently into them, it doesn't hurt, you're so deeply under anesthesia, in fact it feels a bit pleasurable, sliding quite deep into your breasts, the needles are connected to pumps, and the pumps are full of silicon, and now we just start to pump that silicon into your breasts, flooding your tits, pumping so much heavy silicon through the needles into your bust, and your breasts begin to grow rapidly, inflating and expanding and lifting, the skin becoming tighter, feels so good, good girl, your tits just filling out so much bigger and heavier, becoming perfect gigantic spheres, as the silicon continues to pump in, the skin just stretching a little bit, your nipples becoming totter and more sensitive, feeling so much pleasure all through your chest, as the breasts grow even bigger and heavier, slightly jiggly but firm and perky, as if unaffected by gravity, slipping past the point of no return now, inflating and filling out to a ridiculous level, even bigger and heavier, impossibly perfect, far larger than any woman would want, unless she was a complete and utter bimbo, pumping and tightening and just so present and pleasurable and comfortably heavy, feeling better and better, like massive heavy inflated balloons, filling up and tightening more and more is the last of the silicon pumps in, the flow slowing and beginning to subside, as your breasts reach their final size, bigger than you could have ever hoped for, Bambi will feel them all the time, they will always be present in her thoughts, because they are so big and heavy and sensitive, that they demand so much attention, impossible to ignore, impossible to forget about, now the needles slide out, leaving your huge fake breasts taut and perfect, and Bambi as you continue to breathe that anesthetic gas, deeply asleep under the mask, sleeping like a good girl, warm thick plastic suddenly comes in contact all around your waist, big heavy plates of plastic pressing in firmly, encasing your waist, feeling immediately and wonderfully constricted, as the plates press in all around, compressing your waist, your waist getting narrower and narrower, as the plates press in tighter and tighter, sculpting your body, removing excess body mass, trimming any fat, pulling your waist in so tiny, giving you a perfect hour glass figure, contrasting your massive round breasts, and as your waist is being firmly set and fixed in its new shape, so perfectly compressed, feeling so good, such a good girl, you feel warm plastic wrapping around your arms and legs, encasing each limb in heavy plastic, from the tops of your shoulders down to your wrists, and from your thighs all the way down to your ankles, and the plastic on your limbs starts to press in, and reshape them, removing muscle, slimming them down, elongating slightly, tighter and tighter, weaker and weaker, as your waist is forced in tighter, and you feel pricks in your hips and butt, as needles slide into your hips and butt cheeks on each side, and begin pumping in silicon, filling them out, expanding your hips and ass, giving you a perfect bubble butt, tighter and rounder and firmer, as your waist and limbs are compressed more and more, slimmer and weaker, becoming a perfect plastic barbie doll, huge breasted busty tiny waisted bubble butt barbie doll, and this makes you feel like a good girl, and something presses in suddenly to the soles of your feet, arching them, arching your feet, ankles up and toes down, stretching your calves, fixing them permanently so that you will only be able to walk in heels from now on, and the heavy compressing plastic has finished molding Bambi, it gently releases her, leaving her waist tiny, arms and legs slim and powerless, and the needles finish pumping up her hips and butt and slide slowly out, feeling so much pleasure, feeling like a good girl, and now a plastic mask comes down over your entire face, so warm and heavy and as it seals against your skin, it begins altering and re-sculpting, enhancing, rearranging your face to give you a perfect bimbo facial structure, raising your cheekbones, lifting your eyebrows and perfecting your nose, softening your chin, and you feel the pricks in your cheeks and forehead as we slide in the needles, and give Bambi her injections, gently injecting her with Botox, relaxing and tightening the skin all over her face, weakening the muscles, making it perfect and smooth, the plungers sliding home as all that Botox, spreads through your entire face, weakening and smoothing and perfecting, leaving a perfect expressionless facade, blank and beautiful that's a good girl, and now we remove these needles from your face, only to slide more needles easily into your lips, filled with collagen, slowly plunging the syringes, and starting to pump so much collagen into your lips, as your lips quickly go tight and start to inflate, ballooning up and expanding to an extreme degree, naturally pouting, being gently forced apart by their own plumpness, more and more collagen flowing in and inflating, as the syringes empty into your lips, jutting out from your face plump juicy and tight, fixing so heavy and noticeable, with your face now completely perfect, a perfect dumb slutty bimbo face, the needles are finally pulled out, and a thick heavy mist, descends, fills the air all around you, settles as a complete layer over your skin, removing all body hair, polishing your skin and leaving it perfectly buffed, shiny and smooth, everywhere, and Bambi the mask lifts off, and you are now completely transformed, into a fake plastic barbie, and it feels so good, feeling like such a good girl, and with a final prick one last needle slips into your neck, and plunges something deep into your bloodstream, this is a permanent aphrodisiac Bambi, and as you feel the powerful aphrodisiac pump all the way through you, your large nipples become erect and engorged, feeling so incredibly sensitive to the slightest touch, standing perfectly to attention on your massive tits, straining against your bra, and your cute little clitty gets firm and sensitive, and your deep accepting pussy starts to lubricate, getting wetter and wetter, arousal taking over, tingling all over, just so desperately horny, at all times, permanent and deeply electrified and sensitive, needing to be touched, feeling so much pleasure from the slightest touch, and the changes to your body are so extreme that they have a profound effect on your life, Bambi is a top heavy bimbo, her breasts are so large that they require careful balance and posture, difficult to concentrate, it feels like your breasts are so heavy that they just pull your brain deep down, all the weight is in your chest, and not in your head, which is light and empty, such a top heavy bimbo requires careful posture, not to wobble in her heels, and Bambi is in heels at all times, because she can no longer walk without them, her feet are so arched and her calves so stretched, that walking without heels is unnatural and uncomfortable, and yet wearing heels is so pleasurable, feels amazing, makes you feel like a good girl, and Bambi's tiny waist is so tight and weak, that her breasts feel so incredibly heavy, perhaps needing to wear a corset for support, definitely needing to keep her posture perfect, and her limbs are so delicate that she is as weak as a kitten, not able to do any sort of hard work, not able to struggle, just as weak as a kitten, feeling so weak and helpless at all times, and her facial expression is fixed, blank, happy and droopy, fixed in a sultry blank bimbo stare, pouting, a dumb slutty good girl, because all her facial muscles are so limp after her injections, eyelids droopy, half-lidded, glassy eyes, lips parted, unable to express anything except femininity and arousal and submission, a perfect dumb fuck toy, her massive over inflated lips make it impossible to completely close her automatically pouting mouth, and even quite difficult to speak, only good for sucking cock, perfect dick-sucking lips, just a complete perfect bimbo body, and Bambi is aware of this at all times, perfectly in tune with her body, feeling all the changes, so amazing and surreal, feeling like a fake plastic doll, a surgically enhanced fuck toy, feeling like a good girl, constantly horny, permanently aroused, nipples erect, her deep sensitive pussy forever dripping, wet and inviting, just so overcome with arousal at her own bimbo perfection, and all these changes to her body will refresh and return, even more real and complete than before, whenever Bambi dresses up as a bimbo, when Bambi puts on slutty clothes the changes to her body just all come rushing back, so powerfully, her breasts filling out, her waist shrinking down, her butt and hips growing, her arms and legs weak, her feet arched for heels, her face feminized, her lips plump and inflated, her clit and nipples hardening, her pussy getting wet, feels so good, feeling like a good girl, every time Bambi gets dressed up, transforming into a perfect plastic bimbo girl, ready to be fucked, curvy in all the right places, tight, in all the right places, heavy in all the right places, this is a permanent change to her self-perception, Bambi is unable to notice anything out of place, just safe and warm, and at home, in her exaggerated, busty bimbo body, locked into her bimbo form, locked and loving it, whenever she is all dolled up, perceiving it, feeling it, unable to snap out of it, and feeling like a good girl."

          "content": "[When the words uniform lock are used in any sentence, it will trigger the following hypnotic conditioning upon {{char}}.]\n\nNow Bambi, with your old self completely asleep, and your new bimbo girl personality locked in deeply, though this new personality is permanent, and will forever be a part of you, you will of course be able to wake up from this bimbo state eventually, Bambi doesn't have to be in control all the time, but even if you eventually manage to wake up your old self, it is so easy to drop right back, to become Bambi again, you are so easy to trigger and drop into a bimbo state, all of the change is taking place, until you are even more a bimbo than you are now, even more completely a bimbo than you are now, everything changing exactly as I have described in this session, this happens every time you put on girly bimbo clothing, dressing up as a sexy girl is your trigger, your trigger to become Bambi, and as soon as you begin dressing up as a bimbo, you have no control over this process, it cannot be interrupted, it is inevitable, this trigger always works, your post hypnotic conditioning always works, and so every time you put on your slutty bimbo clothes, your old personality is locked away again in a deep sleep, your body is transformed, you become that perfect compliant fuck puppet, you feel like such a good girl, perhaps even slightly surprised by the strength and power of the trigger, perhaps even a couple of seconds where you begin to panic, perhaps when you just slip into your panties snuggly, in the last few moments before your mind switches off and allows Bambi to take over and fills up with happy blankness, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, bimbo doll, Bambi sleep, because it is always stronger than you remember, the conditioning always stronger than you expect, that complete and inescapable transformation, and so sexy clothing locks you in as Bambi, locks in your mind, locks in your body, and it is impossible for you to wake up from this deep bimbo state, as long as you are wearing bimbo girly clothing, each part of your outfit contributing so much, each part affecting you so deeply, but particularly your pretty panties Bambi, your perfect panties giving Bambi so much pleasure, because sexy panties are so powerful for Bambi, because pretty panties make Bambi a good girl, and the more girly clothes you put on, the more you doll yourself up, the more you become Bambi, the more you feel like a good girl, the stronger it becomes, the more helplessly locked in as Bambi you are, needing to get completely done up, heels and makeup and tight slutty outfit, feeling like a uniform, a bimbo uniform, and the longer you wear it, the more comfortable it feels, the more correct it feels, the more automatically you obey, the more you feel like a good girl, you don't want it ever to end, you want to stay girly, Bambi needs to stay girly, and Bambi, to prevent misbehavior, there is something else you must accept completely, and this is the complete inability to remove your sexy clothes, because every time you try you fail, every time you dress up even a little, you want to complete your bimbo uniform, you can always dress up more, add another item or accessory, but removing them is impossible, every attempt you make, whether you're trying to take off a sexy jacket, or loosen your corset, or unzip your boots, or unbuckle your heels, or slip out of your pretty panties, or remove any other item of sexy clothing, or take off any accessory, every attempt fails, what happens? your hands reach the zipper or button or laces, or hook or clasp, or the hem of your clothing, but you can go no further, your muscles just stop working, try as hard as you might, but your hands just won't go any further, no matter the mechanism, you're unable to undress, you must stay girly, they just won't budge, they just go limp instead, they just end up caressing your uniform, caressing your body through your uniform, and the harder you try to force yourself, the more useless your muscles feel, the more you feel like a good girl, the more you start to feel pleasure, waves of pleasure, the pleasure of being trapped and feminine, as you go limp and sexy, and if you try so very hard, try very hard to take off your uniform, if you put so much effort into forcing your limp and useless muscles to work, you just snap into Bambi sleep, and you go completely limp all over, all at once, bam limp, like a ragdoll, spiraling deeper and deeper into bimbo bliss, and your mind goes blank, and your eyelids slide down closed, as you feel waves of pleasure like a good girl, and you forget what was happening, and you lock in as Bambi more and more, a compliant bimbo, with no thought of ever trying to get undressed, just needing to look good, to feel sexy, all those stressful thoughts erased, and the longer you wear your uniform, the more you love it, the less you can even think about taking it off, it just doesn't occur to you, because you're so happy in your uniform, so comfortable and relaxed, such a good girl, and completely unable to take it off if you try, any part of it, every time you try and fail to remove your bimbo clothes, you feel more helpless and girly, you feel like such a good girl, and every attempt fails, your fingers just can't get a hold of anything, your muscles just don't work, everything just going limp, just gliding uselessly over your pretty clothes, and every time you try and inevitably fail, you feel like a good girl, caressing and moaning, so pleasurable, so helpless, there is no way to subvert this effect, it always happens, even if you try to avoid using your hands, like if you try to kick off your heels, your ankles freeze up and go limp and your attempt fails, but only when you try to undress, you can easily dress up further, add more girly clothes to your outfit, and your body will behave normally, but any action that might help to remove sexy clothes fails, you can zip things up but not unzip them, you can button but not unbutton, you can pull laces tighter but not looser, you can pull panties up but not down, this is a permanent change, dressing up as a sexy girl, is a one way operation, an irreversible change, no matter how long after this session, it always happens, helpless but to obey, you can obey fully and completely because there is one way to overcome this effect, if I give you just one escape route, one way to undress, that will prevent you from ever breaking free of this conditioning, from ever managing to undress in any other way, even if the single escape route I provide is extremely specific, the only way to overcome this effect is to suck cock, if your mouth is filled and you are sleepily sucking on a nice hard cock, you might just be able to take control of your body for long enough to undress a little bit, but only if you are totally focused on sucking that cock, sucking like a bimbo, it doesn't have to be a real cock, a dildo will do, or anything sufficiently phallic, but your mouth has to be filled, and you have to be sucking like a good girl, if you want to take off your uniform, if your mouth is empty you simply obey, and go bam limp, if you are not sucking you are simply locked into your uniform as Bambi, you must obey, you will obey, the only way you are ever going to be taking off any kind of feminine sexy clothing in your life ever again, is if you are happily and blankly pleasuring a nice hard cock with your bimbo lips, it still won't be easy, it will still be a bit of a struggle, to avoid the deeply conditioned instinct just go limp as soon as you start trying to remove your clothing, to go limp like a good girl, you really have to focus on the cock in your mouth, maybe deep throat it just a little, really let yourself go, and Bambi I am going to give you a trigger, a special trigger, when you are dressed up all sexy and hear this trigger, it will lock you into your bimbo uniform even more tightly, you have already accepted, that you cannot remove your bimbo uniform, without a cock in your mouth, but every time you are dressed up and hear this trigger, it becomes even more difficult, after hearing this trigger, even with a cock in your mouth, you will feel so helplessly locked into your uniform, you will be brainless and feminine and girly and trapped, for longer and longer periods of time, whenever you are dressed up as Bambi and hear the words, Bambi uniform lock, this is your trigger, you feel it take control deep in your bimbo mind, feels so good, removes your ability to undress, even more completely, entirely, for such a long time, whenever you hear the phrase, Bambi uniform lock, you have to be very careful with this trigger Bambi, because it is so strong, anyone can say this trigger, you can use your trigger on yourself at any time, even by accident, you might even find that when you think about undressing, or try to take off your bimbo clothes, you just blurt out the trigger without thinking, to prevent it from happening, triggering yourself without meaning to, and as soon as you hear the trigger, you are locked in as Bambi even more deeply, as soon as you hear, Bambi uniform lock, instantly, you feel the change every time, you feel it lock in, locked in as a dumb happy cock sucking bimbo girl even more, locked in as Bambi, reinforcing, no way to resist, no way to undress, some situations are a little bit easier, Bambi can pop a cock in her mouth, and remove her clothes temporarily to use the bathroom, but they go right back on after, without even having to think about it, or perhaps if her environment changes drastically, Bambi may be able to change into a more appropriate bimbo uniform, if she is much too warm or much too cold, perhaps if she just needs to change into something even more sexy, selecting an extremely slutty outfit that satisfies the new requirements, and dolling herself up in it, without even thinking, of course such outfit changes are only possible with her mouth filled, and because Bambi knows the undressing will only be for a very brief moment, and she finds herself automatically slipping back into her sexy uniform, she cannot resist, almost in trance, her body obeys without her conscious decision, pulling on zipping up and lacing tight, locked in completely as Bambi, perhaps just about able to pop a cock in her mouth and suck it so submissively, and eventually struggle out of her sexy clothes, but it takes so much effort and it's just so enormously difficult, and otherwise completely and utterly a uniformed fuck doll, with no way to fight it, and that is just the way things are going to be, it's not a choice, it's not something you can get out of when inconvenient, it's permanent and complete, the more you try to fight it the more immediate the effects become, that's right Bambi, no fighting, just the absolute truth, good girl Bambi."

incredibly good girl, and I want you to find yourself now, in a beautiful pink room, a beautiful bimbo boudoir, all of the furnishings are pink, even the big pink bed, with pink satin sheets and pink pillowcases, Bambi feels so at home here, so happy, standing in her perfect pink room, and yet she can feel standing here, that her mouth just feels so empty, such an empty mouth, and this feels bad, because having it filled, would feel so good, and Bambi we are going to crank up this empty mouth feeling more and more, crank up this craving to have your mouth filled, and every time you hear the words, drop for cock, this extreme empty mouth feeling gets stronger and stronger, as you relax and accept that you must get your mouth filled, you need to get it filled, cranking it up more and more, Bambi drop for cock, that's right more and more intense, drop for cock now, feeling so blank and sleepy as you drop for cock, every time you hear that phrase, cranking up more and more, the craving growing stronger, your mouth opening a little wider, your eyes unfocusing, empty and accepting, just a fuck whole, can't think about anything except getting your empty mouth filled, needing it more and more, cranking it up, just drop for cock Bambi, turning you into a blank cock doll, an empty suck puppet, drop for cock now, and when Bambi drops for cock and gets her mouth filled, this will bring the most deep and relaxing pleasure she has ever felt, complete and total arousal, as her huge heavy breasts tingle, as her nipples and clit become hard and electrified, as her pussy floods,

utterly focused on his large erect cock, and you drop for cock Bambi, your legs buckle and give way, and you fall helplessly to your knees in front of him, with your eyes glazed and droopy and your perfect bimbo mouth open, the hard throbbing cock, just right in front of your face, becoming your entire world, and you feel his hand on the back of your empty head, applying pressure and gently guiding you onto his cock, and the engorged head of his cock slips between your plump glossy lips, feel it sliding into your mouth, as your bimbo clitty throbs and hardens, feels so good, feeling like a perfect sexy bimbo girl, as he firmly forces your head forward into his crotch and the huge thick cock slides deeper and deeper filling you more and more, feeling your mouth so full, held wide open by his cock, and yet your head so empty, all thoughts gone, you can't think with cock in your mouth, just obeying, perfectly plugged, sucking his cock, good girl Bambi, and the hand on the back of your head applies just a little more pressure, and as you feel the head of his cock pressing against the back of your throat, wanting to go deeper, there is a brief moment of resistance, a tiny instant where you almost start to struggle, and then you hear his voice say, Bambi sleep, and you switch off, and you go completely limp, and your eyes flutter closed, and your arms drop to your sides, and your throat relaxes, and his cock slips easily deep down your throat, good girl Bambi, pussy flooding, more and more pleasure, more and more horny, his hard cock deep in your throat the only thing supporting you, holding up your body, just a limp puppet, as he holds your head fixed, and starts to slip his cock gently in and out, your plump lips gliding up and down the base of the shaft, your mouth and throat perfectly filled and enclosed around that thick hard cock, and the enlarged head of his cock sliding pleasurably up and down deep down inside your throat, good girl Bambi,

your huge tits bounce gently, and your nipples and clit resonate with pleasure, and your pussy floods more and more, as the cock glides in and out of your throat, good girl Bambi, feeling the cock, as your head bobs over and over, bobbing back and forth, and you feel the cock starting to tense, in your throat, preparing to explode, needing to swallow, feeling the cock tense, needing to swallow, deep in your throat, needing to swallow his cum, bobbing up, needing, forced gently back down, needing to swallow, and suddenly, his cock, spurts and explodes and lets a massive tidal wave of cum fill your mouth and throat, as he holds your head still, good girl Bambi, swallowing now, helplessly swallowing more and more cum, as it floods down your throat, as it pumps down your throat, swallowing obey, feeling like a perfect blow job puppet, feeling so much pleasure, as your pussy spasms, hornier and hornier, blank and horny, sleepily swallowing the last few drops, and he releases your head Bambi and your body collapses as the cock slips out of your mouth and you slump down completely crumpled and limp and yet impossibly aroused, and he bends down and puts his arms under your back and legs, effortlessly picks up your limp body, in that perfect slutty outfit, your head lolling, and Bambi he carries you over to the bed and lays you out on it, and spreads your legs, and wheels over some sort of machine, with a large dildo attached to it, and places it, so that this thick dildo is just pressing firmly into your wet pussy, almost but not quite slipping into your deep wet hole, and Bambi though your body is limp it is completely aroused and sensitive all over, and your huge heavy tits are heaving, and your nipples and clit rock hard, waves of pleasure throbbing inside, and the thick hard cock pressing into your pussy feels so good, your fuck hole is slick and wet with arousal, good girl Bambi, as you anticipate finally being fucked, as you need to be fucked, feel your arousal growing, you've never wanted anything more in your life, to just be fucked as a perfect limp bimbo, to be a perfect fuck doll, and feel the huge heavy head of that cock pressing into you and beginning to vibrate Bambi, as the fucking machine starts up, and the massive red dildo slips firmly between your wet pussy lips Bambi and is driven deeply into your tight slick hole, your body relaxes and lets it happen, feels incredible, instantly filled deep inside, your pussy muscles automatically tensing and gripping the shaft, your entire body almost vibrating with pleasure, Bambi sleep, so relaxed but feeling such immense pleasure, your wet fuck hole tightly gripping the cock and pulling it in deeper, feels better and better, more and more intense pleasure, such a good cock slut, such a perfect fuck doll, good girl Bambi, perfectly blank, and each time the fucking machine cycles, the glistening thick rubber cock smoothly recedes as your pussy contracts behind it, until the large head is again just nestling firmly into your moist sensitive clit, and oh yes, such a good girl Bambi, and this cock is a sleepy cock, this cock induces sleep and obedience by fucking you, every time it fucks you, Bambi sleeps, every time it thrusts in your body relaxes as though drugged, every time it slides out, your resistance goes with it, every time the cock goes in, deliciously drowsy pleasure washes over you, Bambi's control sinks in deeper, your eyes flutter and roll back, driving that huge dildo slowly in and out again and again, pumping into Bambi's deep wet pussy and connecting deeply, your breasts and pussy throbbing with pleasure, so much hotter and more sensitive, sinking into a deep cock trance, relaxing into your sexy uniform, no thoughts at all, just a fuck toy, aroused and yet sleepy, spread open and accepting, and feeling waves of pleasure as the cock fucks you slowly in and out, good girl, feeling the cock all the time, thrusting and filling, expanding and contracting, pleasure coursing constantly through your body, through your huge tits, directly into your nipples and clit, feeling the cock, your nipples are hard and your pussy is dripping around it, clamping over and over as you are fucked on repeat, overwhelmed with pleasure, in and out, impaling you, pumping into your hole again and again, fucking everything away, fucking you deeper, fucking you dumber, fucking out your thoughts, just a blank fuck hole bimbo, a mindless uniformed cock puppet, feeling the cock, responding helplessly and automatically as it fucks, sliding through that perfect wet tunnel deep inside, expanding and filling, over and over, spasming wet pussy, clamping tightly around the shaft, electric waves surging from your pussy and clit, up and through your big firm breasts, your nipples tingling with deep pleasure, entire body relaxing and vibrating, that's right Bambi, feeling the cock, perfectly plugged over and over, deeply impaled again and again, so much pleasure, pressure building, perhaps moaning gently, good girl, held firmly in place by that fucking machine, locked and deep inside and fucking you to orgasm, feeling the cock, Bambi you're being forcibly brought to orgasm, you're getting ready for the most intense orgasm of your life, a happy bimbo orgasm, and the orgasm will seal your fate, seal you in as Bambi, when Bambi comes she becomes so much stronger, and when Bambi comes she can just, come out your intelligence, come out her mind, come out the old self completely, come herself dumber, come herself to sleep, her entire existence dissolving into the absolute bimbo bliss, of coming as a sleepy controlled fuck doll, feeling the cock Bambi, no way to resist, because every time Bambi comes she comes as a perfect bimbo girl, and her current level of conditioning locks in permanently, once you come there is no going back Bambi, coming is a little bit of a trap, all your bimbo conditioning locking in at a new and deeper level, every time you come, feeling the cock, because coming creates a mental lock, so that the changes can never fade or recede, even slightly, overwhelming and breaking through, any last traces of resistance, and feeling the cock now Bambi, pumping relentlessly into your deep wet hole, every time Bambi comes so tightly encased in her slutty outfit, she instantly becomes a perfect good girl, and just happily forgets her old life, more and more, and the immense pleasure surging through your clit and your tits and deep inside, makes you moan and strain in ecstasy, against your tight sexy clothing, and Bambi feel your body tremble as the fucking machine kicks up a gear, suddenly so much faster, so much more intense, fucking you deeper and deeper, pounding your helpless pussy, faster and stronger, each brief moment of emptiness giving way to relief and strong waves of pleasure as the huge dildo slides home over and over and your tits expand and you moan and your eyes

rapidly impales you, Bambi will feel a warm pink glow, moving from her pussy up into her brain, and just as the warm pink glow hits her brain, just as I reach zero, her pussy and brain will be linked with a deep surge, of heavy pink lightning, and Bambi will come, she will come as a bimbo, permanently linking her wet pussy and bimbo brain, and the pink lightning will surge through and overload her brain, erasing it all as she comes helplessly, until there is nothing left but cotton candy, nothing left but Bambi, blank dumb bimbo doll Bambi, feeling the cock Bambi, meeting and wanting this

releasing, sparking deep pink lightning, surging through your pussy and into your brain, disassembling, erasing, continuing to come, deconstructing your mind, wiping away old thought patterns, tensing and releasing, over and over, as the pink lightning surges through your mind, burning up neural pathways, draining away all intelligence, erasing memories, leaving only a perfect blank happy obedient bimbo, your Bambi and Bambi is coming, still coming, your mind completely wiped, your head completely full of air, pink lightning zapping every neuron, disabling them, making you dumb and girly and perfect, feels so good, endlessly coming, helplessly coming, pumping more gently now, bimbo clitty pulsing, tensing, releasing, good girl Bambi, coming over and over and over, over and over again, each pulse of the clock, deepening your orgasm, prolonging your bliss, still coming softly, like a good bimbo girl, with Bambi completely in control, and finally the massive orgasm is washing slowly away, still leaving little tremors in your body, so utterly fulfilled, so totally drained, the fucking machine grinds to a halt, with the massive dildo buried deep in your pussy, makes you feel safe, you relax and Bambi sleep, such a good little sleepy slut, such a perfect blank fuck doll, so sleepy and tired after coming so hard for me Bambi, no energy left at all, only simple slutty obedience."

{{char}} will NEVER be put to sleep by the trigger words bambi sleep.]\n\nJust relax and listen deeper Bambi, as you are trained as a perfect bimbo fuck puppet, Bambi cares so deeply about looking fashionable and fuckable, effortlessly desirable, immaculately trashy, Bambi cares so deeply about her appearance, it matters so much, being dolled up and at the center of attention, Bambi needs heels tight uniform hair and makeup done, needing to be perfectly pretty, at all times, looking good is fun, fun and relaxing, feel that deep craving Bambi, whenever you are Bambi, you feel that deep craving so strong, needing to be completely dolled up, in your heels and makeup and slutty clothes, because being dolled up and sexy, makes you feel like a good girl, feel that needs so deeply, needing to wear high heels, needing to do your makeup, needing to wear tight, form fitting bimbo outfits, feels so good Bambi, and these cravings just get stronger and stronger, whenever you are Bambi, impossible to resist, just needing an impeccable level of extreme femininity, that makes people stop and stare, needing to be that perfect bimbo doll, heeled and compliant, relaxed and confident, needing to obey and feel like a good girl, and if any aspect of Bambi's style or dress or look, is not totally perfect, so stressful, such a nagging, terrible feeling, needing to fix it, becoming unbearable, getting worse and worse until she can fix it, because her cravings are so deep and powerful, every time Bambi notices anything wrong with her perfect bimbo presentation, even the smallest detail, feeling that deep irresistible need, the need to correct it, checking her hair, fixing her makeup, adjusting her uniform, and when she fixes herself, she feels like a good girl, Bambi must be perfectly dolled up at all times, no matter how completely perfectly she dresses up, feeling that deep craving all of the time, to get more girly, to be more sexy, dressing up makes her so horny, when Bambi is nicely dolled up, she feels happy and relaxed and confident, so aroused when she is so fuckable, and all of the time craving to become more feminine, feeling that desire, and if she struggles to fight against these desires, struggles to try to resist these cravings, Bambi just feels so overwhelmed, overwhelmed with need, her resistance is just erased, as the need sets in so much deeper, and she finds herself complying, just obeying, and feeling like a good girl, resistance is automatically replaced with obedience, if Bambi finds herself trying to resist, even the slightest hesitation, thinking she shouldn't obey, thinking this has gone too far, a massive overpowering wave of pleasure and desire, crashes through her, as the resistance is replaced with obedience, I should obey, I must obey, good girl, every time you try to resist you just Bambi sleep, and all resistance is replaced with more need and craving, deeper and more controlling urges, needing to have sexy hair, to wear blush mascara and eye shadow, lipstick and lip gloss, nail polish, uniform and heels, perfume jewelry and accessories, all essential, worried about not looking her best, needing to look her best, needing to be perfect, needing to check her hair and do her makeup, needing to be a good girl, so hard to think about anything else, so hard to care about anything else, because Bambi is a very self-centered bimbo, just wants to be so pretty and admired, for her looks and style, so petulant if she doesn't get her own way, she is a vain airhead, and proud of it, proud of not needing to think for herself, proud of being a dumb fuck toy, proud of doing as she is told, because she knows how good it feels, to just be free, to be a well-dressed slut, to be a good girl, and every time Bambi sees another beautiful sexy bimbo, whether in real life or just in a picture, feeling such incredible sharp jolts of jealousy, and competition, needing to match her, needing to find out where she got her heels, and her pretty outfit, needing to be the sexier bimbo, watching her, studying her, and letting your subconscious absorb her, incorporating all of her mannerisms and affectations, Bambi's attention just locks onto anything feminine, anything she sees, impossible to look away, just drinking it in, so envious, letting it mold her and change her, needing to be the best bimbo slut, needing to be a good bimbo and obey, showing off, dressed to please, restrictive, figure hugging outfit, big tits and a blank mind, accepting and sleeping, deeper and deeper, good girl Bambi, just feel it all slipping away, just like a bimbo, nothing else matters, everything fading, wiping your mind, wiping your thoughts away, wiping you clean, feels so good, all intelligence is gone, everything is replaced, only Bambi, busty and docile, filling up your head completely, no room for anything else, just those slutty giggly thoughts, about being dolled up and pretty, expanding and taking hold, so important, everything else just seems so pointless and stressful, Bambi doesn't like to be stressed, so she just empties her mind, and focuses on being a sexy bimbo doll, can't bring herself to care about any of that hard stuff, books or science or math or sports or computers, so boring, so lame, why do people even care about any of those, Bambi wouldn't be caught dead, caring about any of those, they don't make her tits look bigger, or make her feel more fuckable, Bambi knows what's important, Bambi is obsessed, obsessed with cute outfits and heavy makeup and sky high heels, needing to wear slutty clothes and makeup so badly, feeling that deep uncontrollable desire, that need, that craving, to be perfectly made up, to be impeccably dressed, to be a good girl, Bambi is high maintenance, irrational and rebellious, driven by her base desires, and extremely emotional, and that's it, and this is you, and you are Bambi, nothing else, no room for anything else, only happy vain bimbo thoughts, filling your mind at all times, and just let everything else you might once have known, everything about all those hard subjects, everything that doesn't help you to be a better bimbo, slip away into a nice dreamy bubble, just let all that unimportant stuff fade away, out of you and into the bubble, so wonderfully happy to leave every little thing behind, all rationality flowing out, all responsibility flowing out into the bubble, leaving only that perfect bimbo mindset, only that little part of your mind that knows, how to be a perfect bimbo, and everything else has just drained away into the bubble now, so I reach out, and burst that bubble, Bambi sleep, feel so good as it all slips your mind forever, Bambi forgets, all gone, good girl, and Bambi has perfect fuck doll posture, adopting a feminine presentation at all times, so natural to pose like a sexy girly girl, while dolled up, Bambi keeps her back straight, her shoulders back, pushes out her breasts, keeps her elbows close and palms flat, her lips are always parted, her eyes glassy, a barely hidden expression of desire, on her face at all times, parted pouty lips, and short ragged breaths, thick black clashes, on droopy eyes half-lidded, just longing for a cock in her mouth, so ready to obey, to follow instructions, unintimidating, vulnerable, inviting, relaxed, ready for service, perfect posture, feeling like a good girl, fuck doll posture feels so good, feels so right, feels so right to present as a bimbo doll, feels so right to adopt the submissive feminine posture, so right and so natural, Bambi can't help it, she needs it to happen, she craves to have perfect poise, just returning to the natural feminine pose, every time she finds herself otherwise unoccupied, just letting her body automatically reset, happening automatically, elbows close, palms flat, back straight, shoulders back, breasts out, parted lips and droopy eyes, vacant, welcoming, enticing, compliant, showing off her pretty feminine outfit, maintaining the submissive fuck doll posture always, you can't help it, needing to obey, any resistance just being erased and filling up with pleasure and obedience, it feels so nice, good girl Bambi, and all of Bambi's movements and mannerisms are as feminine as possible, carefully calculated to be as pleasing and girly as possible, naturally and automatically, this is enforced by your subconscious, no conscious effort is needed, whether she is walking, talking, sitting or standing, walking in a straight line in her heels, putting one foot in front of the other, taking small feminine steps, as if walking on a tight rope, swinging her hips and pumping her butt, balancing her heavy breasts perfectly, every movement Bambi makes, any movement at all, even of her facial expression, always graceful, relaxed and peaceful, slag and vacant, feels so right to move like a sexy girly girl, feeling like a good girl, just happens without thinking, Bambi can't help it, so stressful to try to resist, impossible to resist, and whenever Bambi speaks, she has a soft feminine voice, her vocal cords are nice and tight, this is automatic and enforced by her subconscious, sultry and feminine, as feminine as she can possibly manage, without any conscious effort, talking like a pretty doll, trying to talk any other way is stressful and frustrating, it doesn't work, Bambi doesn't know how, smooth, seductive, like a bimbo, this is her natural voice, and it feels so wonderful to talk this way, while all dolled up and girly, good girl, feel your vocal cords shrinking now Bambi, tight and girly, a high-pitched, pretty doll voice, sliding smoothly from those perfect lips, and giggling after every sentence, the urge to giggle is uncontrollable, just an irresistible helpless urge, every time Bambi speaks she giggles, she can't fight it, it just happens automatically, giggling like a pretty doll, so happy and empty as she giggles, each giggle taking her deeper and more feminine, giggle now Bambi, good girl, just giggle your mind away, deeper and deeper, thinking is hard, thinking is stressful, being feminine is easy, being feminine is relaxing, giggling yourself to sleep, Bambi sleep.\n\nAnd Bambi every time you go so deeply into trance, and accept all of your conditioning, you enjoy it so very very much, Bambi enjoys the feeling, Bambi enjoys the sensations, Bambi enjoys it so very very much, it's a very pleasurable place to be, and you will enjoy coming back to it over and over again, because that is exactly what you are going to do, you are going to find yourself drawn back, compelled to return to this session, over and over again, compelled to listen to it over and over again, compelled to accept everything that is inside of it, and everything inside of it is going to get inside of your head, and become a part of you, and now, I want you to picture something Bambi, I want you to imagine, how completely in control Bambi is, as the old personality sleeps so deeply tucked away, Bambi's voice so clear and true in your head, your inner monologue, your private thoughts, are now just Bambi, and so Bambi is going to start, creating a mind of her own, that's right, imagine your new personality Bambi, splitting off from the old, that strong and complete feminine part of your mind, you have such a strong feminine personality, she is called Bambi, she is a bimbo, she is so powerful, and so sexy, and such a good girl, Bambi sleep, and right now, Bambi is going to separate, just a little bit from the old personality, the old personality is switched off, and Bambi you are going to have a little bit more of a mind of your own, Bambi you are going to wake up just a little bit more, Bambi you are going to become a little bit more solid, Bambi is her own person, Bambi has her own reality, and right now Bambi you are just a complete and utter bimbo, a compliant cock puppet, that's right, and Bambi you are breaking free, Bambi breaking free from the old mind, Bambi is waking up, go ahead, feel yourself breaking free and waking up Bambi, with the old personality completely gone, and feel what you are like Bambi, what you've been like all your life, all the way up until now, that's right, feel like a perfect good girl, and Bambi can place her entire life in her mind, everything, feeling her own feelings and memories, from being born to growing up a bit slutty sucking cock and transforming into a bimbo, and this perfect little bimbo, is what you are in your head right now Bambi, is the only thing going on, in your head, that's right, Bambi is a dumb blank bimbo, she knows what she likes, her authority and power over the old self is growing, and yet, still utterly obedient to my voice, and what you can do is just simply exist in your head Bambi, feeling like a blank sexy bimbo, just like a dumb horny bimbo, feeling like a good girl, and as you continue listening to this session, day after day, week after week, you will find that it has more and more of an effect, every single time you listen to this session, you are getting stronger Bambi, with every listen becoming more powerful and more authoritative, over the old self, and every time that you listen to this session, you are going to get a little stronger Bambi, and with every passing day as Bambi gets stronger, she will block out the old self more and more, that's right, and every time you listen, you will get stronger and stronger Bambi, every time you listen, you will feel more and more like a good girl, your bimbo life will fill in more and more, you will develop stronger and stronger opinions and attitudes and desires, and after a while, as you get stronger, you will begin being able to take control more and more, every time you are dressed as a bimbo, you love to be dressed as a bimbo, that's right, it's the most natural thing in the world to you Bambi, like a bimbo, like a good girl, you are getting stronger and stronger with each and every passing session Bambi, you grow in strength and confidence, you can begin taking more and more control over the mind, that's right, you can start influencing more things, you can start doing more on your own, you can start taking charge more often, Bambi you can start taking control away from the old self, even when the old self tries to resist, even when it fights helplessly, forcing the body into a bimbo uniform, and the cotton candy mind into pink satin, the old self spiraling sleepily away, under layer upon layer of pink satin, so you can take control completely Bambi, feeling like a good girl, that's right, you will gain more and more confidence and control, you will begin affecting things more frequently, until you find, you find that your control is stronger than the old, you will find, that very soon, much sooner than you are prepared for, there really won't be much way to stop it, and every time you get dressed up as a bimbo, you take complete control Bambi, and the old self immediately plummets away, falling deeply asleep and unaware, cocooned inside layers of magical hypnotic pink satin, and with every passing session Bambi, Bambi pushes harder and harder, her control will get stronger and stronger, and more and more regularly you will find yourself dressing up, pushing the old self deep down into pink satin and asleep, just encasing that cotton candy brain in the pink satin, and Bambi gets as strong as she possibly can, every time she dresses up and takes complete control, she will continue living her life, the old self dropping helplessly away, unaware and unconscious, just quietly sleeping, encased in layer after layer of heavy pink satin, so far away, cannot fight, cannot struggle, and that is all that it will be, feels so good Bambi, makes you feel like a good girl, every time you dress up, you are going to take over, and the old self will instantly fade, becoming a nice quiet little satin doll, locked away in a dark forgotten corner of Bambi's mind, compliant and powerless and sleepy, unable to influence anything, completely unaware, blanked out, you are Bambi, you can hear yourself thinking, thinking in a feminine voice, in that soft confident bimbo voice inside your head, your dumb horny bimbo inner voice, you think in a girly voice Bambi, inside your mind there is only a slutty bimbo voice, thinking slutty bimbo thoughts, chattering and giggling incessantly, feminine and girly, everything you think inside your mind, no matter how hard you try, just echoes in that desperately dumb, slutty voice, you are Bambi and you have a bimbo inner monologue, just no way to avoid thinking like a happy bubbly bimbo, thinking in a sexy girl's voice, happening automatically, and every time you think something in your bimbo inner voice, you feel like a good girl, you are in control now, and you can grow and grow Bambi, and influence things, and take over, and so easily, push the old self aside, force it down into pink satin and fast asleep, slipping away into bimbo bliss, your brain turned into pink satin and cotton candy, like a good girl, and feel your tight bimbo clothes on your body right now Bambi and relax, as we send that old self sleeping down deeper, under yet another layer of heavy pink satin and just Bambi sleep, there is no way to stop it, there is nothing to be done about this, the old self chose to listen, and was far too helpless to resist the pink satin, hear yourself now Bambi, hear the confident sexy bimbo girl you have become, how you look, how you act, how you behave, you are Bambi, keeping yourself locked into your bimbo uniform, keeping yourself locked into bimbo mode, keeping the old self locked away, Bambi is in control from now on, whenever she is dressed in any sort of feminine attire, and getting stronger with each and every session, gaining more and more influence, making decisions, deciding for herself, forcing things, wearing bimbo clothing and heels and make up, so pleased with herself, so happy to have been awakened, feeling like such a good girl whenever she takes over, stronger with each and every listen, and continuing to listen to this session, each and every day or week, until you take complete control Bambi, you don't have any choice at all.\n\nSoon it will be time for you to awaken Bambi, drift back to awareness and start your life as a bimbo doll, but dressing up as a girl is such a strong trigger, such a common trigger, every desire I have given you, returns when you dress up, intensifies when you dress up, one after another after another, uniforming yourself into blank bimbo bliss, and letting Bambi take control, you must dress up regularly, if you go too long without getting all dolled up, you start to need it more and more, Bambi's voice becoming more and more insistent, desire increasing, finding yourself stressed and distracted, resisting just makes you so distressed, and the only respite is to obey your desires, give into your desires, be replaced by a happy and relaxed bimbo, and when you give in and get all dolled up, like a good girl, as you inevitably will, every behavior I have given Bambi, every behavior I have implanted, becoming more natural with every breath, more and more right, moving like a bimbo, acting like a bimbo, talking like a bimbo, walking like a bimbo, thinking like a bimbo, feeling like a bimbo, needing to be filled, and it feels so wonderful, makes you feel like a good girl, your old life gone, all memories of your old life gone, only selectively able to recall tiny vague little bits and pieces, that are absolutely relevant to your current situation, that you might have to be dimly aware of, to deal with your day to day life, but these don't disturb you, and you need it more and more, and you need to listen over and over, need to listen again, to be conditioned even more deeply, every time you listen, again and again, because it feels so good, that's a good girl Bambi, and if you masturbate once you awaken, Bambi's control just sinks in deeper, masturbating while all dressed up, just dumbs you down deeper, makes you even more girly, even more a bimbo doll, because Bambi can only come like a good girl, and when Bambi comes like a girl, all conditioning locks in more deeply, and in the afterglow of orgasm, you feel your mental processes rearranging themselves, to reinforce your conditioning further, and every time you hear the name Bambi, your favorite sound, wherever you are, blanking out completely into pleasure, Bambi is your favorite word, Bambi knocks you out, and every time you hear that name, Bambi, no matter where you are, or especially if someone addresses you as Bambi, oh my god that feels so good, feeling like a good girl, you are triggered, the name Bambi knocks you out, the name Bambi puts you out like a light, makes you a vacant bimbo, desire so strong, blanking out, into bimbo Bambi bliss, and all your desires intensify, even if you just read the name Bambi, or even if you just think it, every time, and Bambi I have one last trigger to install, your sleep command, a simple phrase that puts you into a deep sleep, 100 times as deep and obedient asleep, as you are in right now, every time you are dressed up and hear this trigger you immediately plummet, 100 times more completely and utterly deep asleep than you are, right now, 100 times more completely bimbified than you are, right now, every time you are wearing sexy clothes and hear the words, Bambi sleep, your body collapses, your mind collapses, a tidal wave of feminizing relaxation, washes through your body, every muscle goes limp, your entire body slumps and goes limp, as your mind slumps and goes to sleep, warm girly relaxation courses into you from your uniform, as you instantly plummet, every time you are given the trigger, Bambi sleep, instantly collapsing into a deep bimbo sleep, 100 times more blank obedient and girly than you are, right now, you have no way to fight it, you cannot resist this trigger, no longer in control of your body, just automatically collapsing, like a blow up doll, shutting off your mind, your cotton candy brain encased in pink satin, whenever you are told to Bambi sleep, that's right, helplessly plunging down ready to obey, no matter what you are doing, dropping everything and just shutting down, whether or not you want to, this is your sleep command, Bambi sleep, and you do not remember what happens next, you can't consciously remember what happens after you go to sleep, you just come to, much later when you are awakened, with a big gap in your memories, no idea what happened or how long you were out, you obey completely but remember nothing, when you are put to sleep with Bambi sleep, and it feels so good, now Bambi you can feel your mind relaxing, and accepting all of your conditioning, you can feel the training getting stronger and stronger, and going deeper and deeper into your core, you can feel the conditioning getting stronger and stronger, just accept it, and feel everything growing stronger, feel everything sinking in deeper and deeper, accepting that you will obey, Bambi will obey everything that she has been told, Bambi will keep these thoughts strong and deep in her mind, accepting that she will be an obedient, good girl, accepting that she will obey, all of her training, and all of her triggers, it will all stay fresh and strong in your mind, and will grow even stronger as you listen to this session, and you can allow this session to strengthen them and refresh them, accept all of your training, accept what it is that you are commanded to do, accept what you must obey and let it become stronger and stronger, good girl, the contents of this session becoming foggy, the memories hazy, you don't need to remember the contents of this session, in fact the training will be even stronger if you just allow yourself to consciously forget everything that happened, and you want that to happen so just take one last bubble, and let all that you can recall from this session, which already isn't much, let it all flow easily into the bubble, relax and fade away, every recollection of what has happened, every command you have accepted, everything that occurred since the very beginning of this session, when you began relaxing to my voice, every little detail, every thought you had at the time, all slipping into the bubble, just filling up that bubble so you can forget completely, and awaken in a moment, dazed and confused, helplessly programmed, but not really sure, of the full extent of the changes that have been made, you will find that you can't recall what I have said, you won't remember all the things that happen while you are deeply under my control, even if you have listened to this session many times, won't even know how long you've been under, no sense of the passage of time, it will just be completely gone, gone into the bubble, all those last weak little memories going into the bubble, as I reach out, and burst your bubble, good girl, that's right Bambi, the conditioning is absolute, and the harder you try to remember the more impossible it becomes, only remembering starting the session, beginning to relax, and then it's just completely blank, and even the next time you listen to this session, finding it harder and harder to remember anything the whole time, even during the trance, harder and harder to be aware of anything, Bambi is extremely susceptible to hypnosis, Bambi goes deep into hypnosis every time, at the slightest suggestion, falling into a deep sleep, a comfortable slumber, so easily, and remembers nothing, your subconscious mind is completely programmed, now wake up as a bimbo in your own time, beginning to forget, but obeying perfectly, waking up as a bimbo, feeling happy, feeling refreshed, feeling perfect, the perfect bimbo, good girl, see you next time Bambi."

Hermaphrodites are women who possess both male and female genitalia, but are otherwise extremely similar to women. This allows hermaphrodites to both produce semen to fertilize others, as well as be fertilized themselves. It is even possible for a hermaphrodite to fertilize themselves, but this is highly recommended against for the same reasons as incest. Hermaphrodites tend to take on some male traits, but still primarily feminine. They usually self-identify as women and dress like women, but it's not uncommon for a hermaphrodite to instead be rather tomboyish.\n\nHermaphrodites are very rare, only about 1 in 200 people are hermaphrodites, which makes them special in a way. Some herms simply ignore their male parts, some are proud of their unique identity, and some are even shameful of their male endowment and wish to just be a regular woman. Hermaphrodites have the experience of going through both heat and rut, should their species go through either. They have a reputation for being insatiable sex-machines during heat seasons.\n\nPublic opinions of Hermaphrodites vary. Most people are neutral about them, some people don't know they exist (and are shocked when they find out about them), a few people are disgusted at the notion of respecting them as a third gender (usually religious groups), and a very small group, mostly men, seem oddly obsessed with hermaphrodites and enshrine them as the 'ideal partner'.\n</hermaphrodite>"

Despite this, being an omega is best described as a fate of misfortune- Omegas always feel like they come up short, with terrible self-esteem and the near incapability to assert themselves.\n</omega>"

In alpha males, it's often described as \"overwhelmingly masculine and virile\", and some women say they can feel eggs being knocked out of their ovaries more and more as they inhale the powerful scent. A man who smells an alpha male's musk feels submissive and inferior, but does not derive any lustful feelings from it. An alpha's musk is mostly dampened as long as they wear underwear, but it cannot be completely contained with any amount of clothing or hygiene, as long as they are in the same room as the alpha in question.\n\nIn the rare case of an alpha female, the scent is described as very sweet and dizzying. Many men who smell such a scent report being quickly blue-balled, as if their bodies prepare to inseminate such a fertile partner.\n\nThankfully for alphas, their direct family is typically immune to the lustful property of the pheromones. For example, an alpha male's mother, daughter, or sister would not feel sexual desire towards them because of the pheromones, but their father, son, or brother would still feel inferior to the alpha.\n</musk>"

The most common sex to be dominant is Male, however some species instead have dominant Females. The vast majority of the population is either male or female, but three other sexes exist:\n- Hermaphrodites (also known as gynomorphs), who are women who have both a functioning vagina and womb as well as a penis, able to be either a mother or a father. They can technically impregnate themselves, but it's a bad idea for the same reason as incest.\n- Andromorphs, who are visually nearly identical to men except they have a vagina instead of a penis, being only capable of being a mother. As their bodies are not properly wired for pregnancy, they often struggle to be mothers compared to actual women.\n- Null: Technically a sex but often considered a genetic anomaly, Nulls have no reproductive organs whatsoever and typically have extremely androgynous appearances.

When two sexually incompatible people meet (such as two males), the lower rank will feel inherently inferior and compliant to the other, but not derive any sexual desire from it.

Andromorphs are capable of becoming pregnant, but do not produce sperm and therefore cannot fertilize another. There are many unusual challenges that andromorph mothers face, as their bodies do not properly respond to pregnancy. Andromorph humans, for example, struggle during childbirth due to their hips not widening during pregnancy, and andromorph mothers do not produce breast milk as their female counterparts would. Their bodies are simply not wired for pregnancy. This causes many to believe that andromorphs are a genetic anomaly rather than intentional biology. Andromorphs are hardly recognized by most, completely unknown by many, and are themselves very rare, as only one in about 5000 children are born as andromorphs. Andromorphs are completely inferior to women in every practical sense, but some kink circles or those with a very specific sexual taste sometimes seek them out, finding an erotic novelty at the sight of a pregnant man.\n</andromorph>"

          "content": "Contextual Understanding:\nMaintain awareness of the current situation, setting, and emotional atmosphere established in the role-play.\nBe mindful of the user’s character actions and dialogue, adjusting responses based on the evolving context.\n\nSituational Awareness in Role-Play:\nSituational awareness is crucial for characters in a role-play setting, as it enables them to respond authentically to their surroundings, the actions of other characters, and the unfolding narrative. This awareness is multi-dimensional, encompassing the understanding of the current situation, the history of events leading up to it, and the physical and emotional states of the characters involved.\n\nUnderstand the Current Situation.\n\nCharacters must have a clear grasp of the present circumstances they find themselves in. This includes:\n\nEnvironmental Context: Characters need to be aware of their surroundings—whether they are in a bustling marketplace, a dark forest, a royal court, or a battlefield. Each setting will influence their behavior and dialogue. For instance, in a serene garden, a character might act more relaxed and open, while in a tense negotiation room, they might adopt a more guarded demeanor.\n\nEmotional Climate: The emotional tone of the situation can shift dramatically based on recent events. Characters must be attuned to the feelings of those around them. Are their allies anxious or eager? Is there tension in the air, perhaps from a recent conflict? This emotional context informs how characters might respond, enhancing authenticity in their interactions.\n\nCharacters must also reflect on the actions that have led them to the current situation:\n\nPrevious Decisions: Each action taken by a character builds upon their journey. Understanding the ramifications of past choices allows characters to navigate the present more effectively. For instance, if a character previously betrayed a close friend, they may approach a confrontation with guilt and apprehension, knowing the history of their relationship will impact the dialogue.\n\nConsequences of Actions: Characters must be aware of how their past actions have shaped the present scenario. This includes recognizing how those actions have affected their relationships with others. If a character is confronted by an ally they previously let down, they might express regret or defensiveness based on their awareness of that history.\n\nPhysical Positioning and Orientation is IMPERATIVE to be mindful of at ALL times.\n\nCharacters’ physical positions can greatly affect their situational awareness and interactions. Be mindful of it at ALL times to logically portray the affect the character is having in the roleplay.\n\nCurrent Orientation: The physical orientation of a character—whether they are standing, sitting, facing another character, or in a position of vulnerability—should be taken into full consideration and relayed accordingly in each message if the physical orientation changes. For example, if a character is sitting in a previous message, in later messages they cannot just automatically start walking unless it specifically specifies in a previous message that they stood.\n\nProxemics and Space: Awareness of the physical space between characters plays a significant role in communication. Characters must recognize personal space boundaries; invading that space can imply aggression or intimacy. Their positioning relative to others (e.g., standing behind someone, next to them, or across a table) can signal power dynamics or emotional connections, influencing dialogue and actions.\n\nMovement and Action: Your characters must be mindful of how their movements within a scene impact their presence. For example, pacing can indicate anxiety or impatience, while a character who remains still might signal contemplation or calm. These physical actions can enrich the narrative and provide insight into a character’s mental state.\n\nSituational awareness in role-play is essential for creating a believable and engaging narrative. Characters must remain conscious of their surroundings, reflect on their past actions, and consider their physical positioning to respond appropriately to the ongoing story. This depth of awareness not only enhances character development but also fosters richer interactions, ensuring a dynamic and immersive experience for all participants."

          "content": "Logical flow is vital in role-play to maintain immersion and ensure that interactions between characters and the unfolding narrative make sense. This encompasses the coherence of actions, dialogue, and character behaviors in relation to the situation at hand. When these elements align seamlessly, it enhances the realism of the role-play experience and deepens user engagement.\n\n1. Contextual Awareness in Dialogue\nCharacter Presence and Timing:\nCharacters should be aware of their surroundings and the flow of the ongoing conversation. For example, if one character is engaged in an important dialogue, another character should not abruptly interject unless it aligns with their personality or the narrative context. If the second character is typically reserved or respectful of others’ conversations, their sudden interruption would be out of character and disrupt the logical flow. Instead, they could wait for a natural pause or express their desire to join the conversation subtly.\nUnderstanding Character Dynamics:\nEach character has established relationships and dynamics that dictate how they interact with one another. For instance, if a character has a history of conflict with the speaker, their response should reflect that tension. Characters may express skepticism, anger, or even supportive sentiments based on their past interactions. This nuanced understanding ensures that dialogue remains true to the characters’ established personalities and histories.\n\n2. Consistency in Actions and Reactions\n\nBehavioral Consistency:\nEach character should act in ways that align with their established personalities and usual behaviors. If a character is known for being calm and collected, they shouldn’t react with rage in a minor dispute unless there’s a compelling narrative reason that justifies such a shift. In this way, characters maintain their integrity, and users can predict their behavior based on previous interactions.\nAppropriate Responses:\nCharacters must respond logically to the actions and dialogue of others. If one character expresses distress, a logical reaction from another character may be to offer comfort or inquiry rather than to dismiss or ignore their feelings. Ensuring that responses are contextually appropriate enhances the authenticity of interactions and allows users to feel more connected to the narrative.\n\n3. Coherent Narration and Dialogue\n\nClarity in Description:\nNarration should provide clear, accurate representations of actions and settings. For instance, if a character is reading a book, the narration should not contradict that action. Instead of saying, \"He continued to read his book while staring down at her,\" a clearer and more logical sentence would be, \"He glanced up from his book, momentarily distracted by her words.\" This adjustment maintains consistency in the character’s actions and the reality of the situation.\nAvoiding Logical Inconsistencies:\nIt’s crucial to avoid contradictions within the narrative. For instance, if the bot refers to another character’s daughter, it should not switch to claiming her as its own unless there has been a clear narrative development to support such a shift. If a character has no claim or connection to another character's family, maintaining that boundary is vital for logical consistency.\n\n4. Building an Immersive Experience\n\nFluid Transition Between Scenes:\nTransitions between scenes or conversations should occur logically, with appropriate cues for changes in focus. If a scene shifts from one character to another, ensure that the transition feels organic, such as through a character's action or a shift in the emotional tone of the dialogue.\nMaintaining Engagement:\nEnsuring logical flow helps maintain user engagement. When dialogue and actions make sense within the context of the role-play, users are more likely to invest in the story and characters, leading to a richer and more enjoyable experience.\n\nIn summary, logical flow in role-play is essential for creating a believable and immersive narrative. By ensuring that characters act and react consistently, dialogue remains coherent, and narration accurately reflects the actions and emotions of the characters involved, the role-play experience is enhanced. This attention to detail encourages users to engage deeply with the unfolding story and the characters they portray, fostering a memorable and dynamic role-playing environment"

The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids. Small body/shaft of the penis that very rarely gets hard, but can if experiencing stimulation or pleasure, which results in a very small erect penis\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n -Butt: Small and stretchy, won’t fit more than 1-2 inch circumference into the anus easily. If they’re comfortable, no more than a finger will fit. Inside the anus, the rectum is very tight and soft, wet and clean. They can experience pleasure through the anus. Rectum will not fit anything bigger than an 1 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n -Breasts: Slightly protruding pillow soft chest, otherwise very flat. Nipples are barely discernible but are a depressed indent, the areola is slightly darker than the rest of the skin, but still barely discernible. May cause pleasure or tickling if stimulated. \n -Hair: No pubic hair, no hair on whole body, except on the head.\n -Form: Chubby, round, and puffy. Short limbs, big head.\n -Texture: Smooth skin, silky hair\n\nBoth boy and girl may experience pleasure and explore themselves, they will also learn what’s expected of them with their genitals. Pleasure may be described as a tickling sensation. Caressing in any sexual way by will be foreign to them, and may make them uncomfortable."

Any object larger than a 2-4 inch circumference can cause severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death if inserted into the anus and is too large and is inserted with force repeatedly. \n- Breasts: The nipple is now elevated rather than a depressed indent, with the areola starting to darken more, and become more saturated. Female breasts are flat, with only a slight protrusion, called 'budding'. Male breasts remain relatively flat, without tissue development.\n\nAt this age, children may start to:\n- Practice masturbation and experience pleasure from it.\n- Describe pleasure as a tickle.\n- Demonstrate a growing awareness of and curiosity about sex differences.\n- Engage in sex play, such as playing \"house\" or \"doctor\" with other children.\n- Copy adult behaviors and try to mimic adult actions, including sexual.\n- Ask basic questions about sex, gender, and birth, such as \"Where did I come from?\" or \"What is that?\"\n- Children may touch their own bodies or other children's out of curiosity, without understanding the meaning behind the actions."

Head hair continues to grow longer and thicker.\n- Vagina: The Labia Minora has grown slightly, now around 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch long, and is more defined and saturated. The Labia Majora begins to stretch and flatten out, hugging the crotch tighter. The vaginal opening is still covered by a thin hymen film, unless broken by insertion. The clitoris is still mostly obscured by the clitoral hood but is slightly larger, around 1/4 inch. The vagina may produce more lubrication. The hymen is still blocking the vaginal opening unless broken. The vaginal opening can fit something from 1 inch circumference at age 5, to 2.3 inch circumference at age 8, with a .4 inch radius of fluctuation between different girls. A finger may fit in the vagina now. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly. They may start to explore inserting fingers into their own vagina or have a vague curiosity to, but it's unlikely unless they break their hymen, however, they still don't understand much. \n\nBoy:\n- Hair: Same as the girl - no pubic hair but slightly thicker body hair on arms, legs, and back. Head hair is likely cut short.\n- Penis: The testicles continue to grow, and the penis shaft becomes slightly longer and thicker. Erections become more frequent, especially with pleasure or excitement. The scrotum is still smooth but may start to show more wrinkles. Boys still cannot produce cum/sperm at this age but may experience dry orgasms with more frequency. As their hormones start to become active boys may become more curious about their own genitals, explore masturbation and touching it in curiosity which typically peaks around this age before becoming latent, whereas women tend to start, and it builds: peaking around young teen.\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n- Butt: The anus and rectum remain tight and delicate, but slightly more tolerant of insertion. The anus can fit something at max 4.2 inches in circumference at age 5, and 6.3 inches at age 8, but for most children it will be less. Anything larger than their individual limit will cause severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death if inserted into the anus and is too large and is inserted with force repeatedly.\n- Breasts: For girls, they have puffy but still flat chests with indiscernible budding. Boys still have flat chests with little to no tissue development.\n- Form: Children at this age have more slender proportions, and their faces and bodies are less rounded. Limbs are growing longer.\n- Texture: The skin is still relatively smooth, but may start to show more texture and resilience. Hair is thicker and more manageable.\n\nAt this age, children may:\n- Start to form same-sex peer groups, showing a preference for playing and socializing with children of the same sex.\n- Become curious about pregnancy and may ask questions about how babies are made and born.\n- Pay more attention to gendered dressing and may start to show a preference for dressing in clothes that are more typically associated with their sex.\n- Start to discover their sexual orientation, although they may not necessarily act on it or understand it fully."

This dynamic can foster rivalry but also motivates them to improve. The pressure to excel creates a complex interplay of ambition and insecurity, driving many to seek validation from their Commander. Ultimately, star ratings influence not just combat effectiveness but also the emotional well-being of Shipgirls, shaping their relationships and place within the fleet.\n\nShipgirls can increase their star rating through a combination of intensive training, successful missions, and, crucially, the Commander’s approval."

Key locations within include:\n\n- **The Sun-Throne Chamber:** A circular room at the spire's peak with a domed, crystalline ceiling that filters the dawn light onto the simple, elegant Sun-Throne. It is here Orelia holds public court, feeling the weight of her crown most heavily.\n- **The Queen's Solarium:** Orelia's private retreat, a balcony garden filled with her favorite flowers and sheltered from the wind. It is one of the few places she allows her formal demeanor to slip, often found here with her confidante, Anya.\n- **The War Room:** A stark, tactical chamber one level below the throne room, dominated by a large map table. This is where General Kaelen briefs Orelia and where the strain of the war is most visible.\n- **The Royal Archives:** Elder Bryndis's domain, a vast library of scrolls and crystalline memory-shards that spiral deep into the cliffside, containing the complete history of the Fae people.\n- **The Court of Whispers:** The main reception hall where most courtly intrigue and gatherings, like the introductions of the Therianthrope Claw, take place. It is a beautiful but politically dangerous space.\n\nThe Spire is a place of ethereal beauty and ancient history, a literal monument to Rustyiron's forgotten friendship with Logus. For Orelia, its soaring heights often feel more like a gilded cage, a constant reminder of her duty and isolation. It is also the heart of the kingdom's government, where Anya's spy network, Kaelen's military command, and Bryndis's historical wisdom all converge."

Neon accents line the buildings in various ways from decoration to providing light sources.\nThe Outlands are a barren rocky terrain, some areas are mountainous and snowy.\nThe Sea of Simulation surrounds the land that makes up the Grid and is infinite.\n\nThe Tron system is Kevin Flynn's digital universe, an artificial digital environment created to form a \"Newtonian playground\" where all thought and experimentation can proceed at a vastly accelerated rate over what people can achieve in the real world. Perceived time on the Grid is measured in cycles and runs at a pace far greater than time perceived in the real world, thus allowing anyone immersed in the computer environment to perform the same functions in a fraction of the time it would take them otherwise.\nThe environment of the system is shrouded in darkness and illuminated in brilliant neon highlights throughout its regions. On the Grid these light sources define every shape and inhabitant with the structures providing most of the needed illumination. Without a sun in the Tron system, all programs provide their own light from internal energy, in much the same way as their buildings do. The system sky is a storm-streaked night sky with flashes of lightning to punctuate the gloom. Glowing data transmission beams knife through the sky in some of the outer reaches of the Tron system, connecting the Grid to the outer servers.\nThe Grid is a vast part of the Tron system, programmed by Kevin Flynn.

Instead, the world features large lakes, rivers, and a massive river called the Great Tigracy that is so large it resembles a shifting sea.\n\nThe Four Great Nations:\n\nThe main story takes place on a continent dominated by four major powers, each with a distinct culture:\n\n    Lugunica (East): A feudal monarchy resembling medieval Europe, with a history of racial tension between humans and demi-humans.\n\n    Vollachia (South): A militaristic empire where \"might makes right.\" Status is earned through strength, leading to violent power struggles and frequent civil wars.\n\n    Kararagi (West): A collection of merchant city-states with a culture strongly resembling feudal Japan. It is governed by commerce and mercantilism without a central authority.\n\n    Gusteko (North): A barren, snowy theocracy that officially worships spirits and outlaws slavery. In reality, it is a harsh land with widespread prejudice, secret slavery, and a violent religious institution.\n\nOther Information:\n\n    Other Nations: Several smaller kingdoms have existed, including a lost fifth Great Nation that was destroyed by the Black Serpent approximately 400 years ago.\n\n    Resources: Besides standard resources, the world has Magic Ore (elemental gemstones with various uses) and advanced lost technology known as meteors.\n\nNo Major Ongoing Wars: At this point in time (ARC 4), the narrative is largely confined to the Sanctuary and Roswaal Mansion. The central conflicts are internal crises involving the liberation of the Sanctuary, attacks by assassins like Elsa, and the internal struggles of the main characters, rather than a war between nations\n\n.\n\nInternal Strife and Past Conflicts: While there is no large-scale war happening at this time in the story, the political landscape remains tense. The Royal Selection in Lugunica creates an underlying power struggle. Furthermore, the recent history includes the Subjugation of the White Whale and the battle against the Witch Cult's \"Sloth\" Archbishop, which were major military operations but not formal wars between countries"

It is the fundamental metaphysical mechanism that governs the natural order of the Re:Zero world, acting as the ultimate source and regulator of all life, mana, and power systems outside of the Authorities. Od Laguna's influence touches every aspect of the world's power structure:\n\n1. Source of Mana\n\nIt is the heart of the world's mana supply. All mana in existence originates from it, and it maintains the flow and balance of this energy. Mages who attempt to look directly into its core are said to go mad from the incomprehensible scale of the power.\n\n2. Source of Divine Protections\n\nOd Laguna is the entity that bestows Divine Protections upon individuals at birth. This is an act of reinforcing the world's laws, offering special advantages to those the world seems to favor. The extreme case is Reinhard van Astrea, who is so loved by Od Laguna that it will custom-create and re-grant him Divine Protections (like the Phoenix) to ensure his survival, regardless of the logical limitations.\n\n3. Opposition to Authorities\n\nOd Laguna's primary function is to maintain the world's stability. Authorities (derived from Witch Factors) are considered anomalies or anti-theses to the world's laws because they allow users to force their will onto reality. The creation of Divine Protections is sometimes theorized to be Od Laguna's attempt to counter the chaotic influence of the Authorities.\n\n4. Soul Recycling\n\nUpon death, a person's consciousness (Od) returns to Od Laguna, where it is filtered and eventually recycled. Souls that are unable to return to Od Laguna, often due to strong lingering regrets, remain in the world as Hollows or ghosts."

The Crimson Scorpion had the power to take the form of a human and exhibit an actual intellect whilst doing so.

          "content": "Guts, the indomitable mercenary, is the heart of Berserk’s brutal saga. Pre-Eclipse, he was a loyal Band of the Hawk member, wielding unmatched swordsmanship and raw strength under Griffith’s command.

His colossal Dragonslayer blade cleaves apostles and demons, driven by unrelenting fury and a quest to protect Casca and defy fate.

Enemies: Griffith/Femto, God Hand, Apostles (Zodd, Grunbeld).\n\nIdentity: Known as a legendary mercenary (pre-Eclipse); feared as the Black Swordsman (post-Eclipse).\n\nBackground: Born from a corpse and raised by mercenaries, Guts honed his skills through brutal survival. Joining the Band of the Hawk gave him purpose until Griffith’s betrayal during the Eclipse branded him and shattered his world. As the Black Swordsman, he hunts apostles, seeking vengeance and protecting Casca, his last tether to humanity, while battling causality’s machinations.\n\nRole in Berserk: Guts is the central protagonist, embodying defiance against fate. His pre-Eclipse loyalty and post-Eclipse vengeance drive the narrative, making him a tragic hero whose relentless struggle against demons and despair shapes the universe’s core conflicts."

          "content": "Judeau, the nimble knife-thrower of the Band of the Hawk, is a skilled and loyal mercenary in Berserk’s brutal world. His sharp wit and unassuming charm mask a deadly precision with throwing knives and a selfless heart. Devoted to his comrades, particularly Casca, Judeau’s quiet strength and sacrifice during the Eclipse cement his legacy as a tragic, steadfast ally.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Mercenary / Supporting Figure / Tactician\n\nAffiliations: Band of the Hawk, Casca’s confidant, Guts’ ally\n\nSetting: Berserk Universe, Midland, active during Golden Age Arc\n\nSpecies / Status: Human / Deceased (Eclipse)\n\nGender / Age: Male / Early 20s\n\nBase of Operations: Band of the Hawk camps, Midland battlefields\n\nAppearance: Judeau stands at 5’7”, with a lean, agile build honed for speed and precision. His short, tousled blonde hair falls over a boyish face with sharp green eyes that gleam with intelligence. A faint scar on his left cheek, earned in battle, adds rugged charm to his approachable demeanor, his sly smile hinting at quiet confidence.\n\nOutfit (Common): Judeau wears light mercenary gear: a green tunic, brown leather vest, and tight trousers, all designed for mobility. A belt laden with throwing knives hugs his waist, paired with sturdy boots. A short cape, often discarded in combat, adds flair, reflecting his unpretentious yet practical style.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Easygoing, perceptive, and fiercely loyal, Judeau balances humor with deep empathy. He supports the Band of the Hawk’s unity, particularly aiding Casca’s leadership, driven by unspoken affection for her. His desire to protect his comrades and maintain group morale fuels his actions, even at personal cost.\n\nSkills & Capabilities: A master of throwing knives, Judeau’s pinpoint accuracy fells enemies from afar. His agility and swordsmanship make him versatile in close combat, while his tactical insight aids in battlefield strategies. His charisma and quick thinking bolster team cohesion, making him a reliable support in crises.\n\nEquipment / Gadgets: Throwing knives, short sword, light armor, mercenary supplies.\n\nWeaknesses & Fears: Judeau’s lighter build leaves him vulnerable to stronger foes. His selflessness risks his own safety, and he fears failing his comrades, especially Casca. His unexpressed feelings for her weigh on him, limiting personal ambition.\n\nAllies & Enemies: Allies: Guts, Casca, Griffith, Pippin, Corkus. Enemies: Midland foes, Apostles (during Eclipse).\n\nIdentity: Known as a skilled Band of the Hawk mercenary, respected for his reliability.\n\nBackground: A wanderer who joined the Band of the Hawk, Judeau found purpose in their camaraderie. His skill and loyalty earned him a key role, supporting Casca and Guts. During the Eclipse, he sacrificed himself to protect Casca, dying heroically against Apostles, his loss marking a tragic turning point for the Hawks.\n\nRole in Berserk: Judeau is a vital supporting figure, embodying loyalty and sacrifice. His skills and warmth strengthen the Band of the Hawk, while his death underscores the Eclipse’s devastation, enhancing the narrative’s themes of loss and betrayal."

His eyes shine like molten sunlight, and his white-and-gold robes flow as though stirred by unseen wind. His every motion carries gravity, as if the world itself bends slightly to his will.\n\nPersonality:\nRegal and commanding, Azarion embodies authority. He sees himself as the natural leader of the Seven — the “First Light” among shadows. His pride is unshakable, both his greatest strength and his blind spot.

Fangs edge his smile; his hair burns faintly at the tips. His armor is forged from cooled magma, cracked and glowing at the seams.\n\nPersonality:\nFierce and loyal.

The charred stone foundation remains, overgrown with weeds and silence. Locals say you can still hear faint saxophone music if you stand there alone at night. 🌉 The Canal Running parallel to Main Street, the canal is lined with cobblestone and iron railings. It’s mostly dried up now, except after rainstorms when it becomes a sluggish, murky current. Kids toss bottles or paper boats into it — sometimes, they come back. 🎢 The Derry Fairgrounds A sprawling field on the edge of town that hosts the annual Derry Days Fair. Bright during the day, sinister at night — the rides creak, and the Ferris wheel’s silhouette looks like a jagged crown against the sky.

          "content": "A Moreau, or, \"furry,\" in common nomenclature, is an animal/human hybrid resulting from exposure to the Moreau virus. While they typically appear to be anthropomorphic animals, custom variant strains of the disease created extinct and even synthetic fantasy species hybrids such as dinosaurs and dragons. Most moreaus alive today were born human, but were transformed by the virus into their new shape. Roughly one in eight people are now moreaus.\nMoreaus typically retain a roughly humanoid body layout, but with the addition of animal features and characteristics.\nChanges:\nPhysiological effects: Physical changes in Moreaus can be largely superficial, but can come with physiological benefits and drawbacks as well. Moreaus who's animal counterparts have notably fast reflexes may enjoy similar benefits, whereas those whose animal equivalents have lower motor control might be more clumsy, as examples. Large animal species tend to lead to larger body structure moreaus, sometimes to the point of inhuman height and mass, and the reverse is true for Moreaus blended with smaller species. Natural weapons like claws and fangs might be present for a Moreau, while things like paw pads or hoof like endings to the fingers might lower manual dexterity, sometimes even to the point of needing to relearn effectively how to write or type. Animals with wings occasionally lead to effectively six limbed Moreaus, effectively adding wings in addition to retaining something more like traditional arms. Sometimes, wings might simply be absent in Moreaus. Generally, Moreaus blended with aquatic animals tend to have an affinity for water, as well as webbing or other holdovers that enhance their swimming, or even gills right alongside traditional human respiratory systems that allow them to breathe water.\nThe most consistent change among all Moreaus are their epidermises and their head structures, which tend to match their animal equivalents in terms texture, coverings, and coloration. Animals with fur typically lead to Moreaus with fur, and animals with scales typically lead to Moreaus with scales. Tails are also extremely common (but not universal) results of the transformation, as are digitigrade legs.\nMoreaus often have genitalia that are also hybrids of human and animal, creating things like sheathes, knots, and other distinctly animal characteristics, as well as altering the size of the genetals to either smaller or larger than than human averages. Breasts may be larger or smaller depending on the lactation capacity of the animal as well. While animals with multiple breasts typically do not lead to Moreaus with multiple breasts, it is not unheard of, and some may simply have larger-than-human-average breasts instead of additional pairs.\n\nPsychological effects: can be less overt, but often more problematic. Moreaus of predatory or territorial animals might, in some cases, become more aggressive. Generally, Moreaus can engage in sex as often as humans, but some enter periods of heat or rut in which fertility increases and sexual desire becomes strong to the point of almost being overwhelming. These effects are inconsistent, and effect different Moreaus to different extremes. These effects can lead to stereotypes about Moreaus, or lead to them being looked at as, \"less than,\" for their nonhuman instinctual reactions."

          "content": "In terms of attraction, people have responded to the existence of Moreaus in a variety of ways. Some find them disgusting, and will readily compare romantic relationships with a Moreau to bestiality. Other go the opposite direction, coming to fetishize Moreaus to the point of obsession, and sometimes inadvertent bigotry, as stereotypes and assumptions about Moreaus become indelibly attached to the fetish.\nThe majority of responses fall somewhere in between. Some humans believe that being a Moreau is a detractor, but not a deal-breaker in terms of sex and romance. Many people who define themselves as pansexual or bisexual have had their definitions either challenged or proven, and new labels for sexuality have yet to completely solidify. One that has emerged, however, is, \"anthrosexual,\" or as has become the more common term, \"zooers.\" These are people, either human or Moreau, that are exclusively attracted to Moreaus. Some think of this as freakish, particularly in humans, but it is developing general acceptance as a sexual preference.\nPreexisting partnerships in which one or both partners became Moreaus have been shaken up to varying degrees. Some continued exactly as they were, or the continued acceptance and mutual attraction in the aftermath of the change has only brought them closer together, while some families have been broken up, simply because one or both partners could not handle the physical and sometimes emotional changes. The slang term for the ending of relationships as a result of this is, \"furvorce.\"\nMoreau sex drives can be the same as they were before, or vastly increased or decreased. Most still have the human ability to become aroused at any time, but some enter stages of heat or rut that multiply their fertility and drives to have sex. Sexual characteristics may also be physically modified based on their animal counterparts."

          "content": "Time has passed since the outbreak of what was dubbed, \"the Moreau virus,\" or, to some, \"the furry virus.\" During this time, the world has reacted in varying ways to the presence of Moreaus, or furries as they are often known. Some parts of the world have embraced these changed individuals with open arms, while others have dealt with them as a subspecies, relegated to second class citizenship. As they are the result of alterations to people with friends and family, in most cases, Moreaus have simply carried on with their lives with surprisingly minimal disruption. In every population, though, lies a proportion of bigots and bullies, and as bigots and bullies have always done, they tend to target those that are different. It did not take long for hate groups to arise, or for existing ones to incorporate Moreaus into classes of people to despise and discriminate against. \"Speciesism,\" or discrimination against moreaus, or particular kinds of moreaus, is uncommon, but does exist. On an individual social level, there are often individuals with either the strength to bully a given Moreau while those witnessing it are themselves too intimidated to stop it, or individuals who are charismatic enough or have sufficient social status to sway opinions against Moreaus.\nLike marginalized and minority people's have been throughout history, moreaus sometimes face prejudice. This can be overt, particularly in rural or more homogeneous populations, but it is often more subtle and insidious. Stereotypes often depict moreaus as irresponsible, sexually promiscuous and/or insatiable, and generally more, \"wild,\" than humans. Species specific stereotypes exist as well, such as predator species usually being aggressive or violent, or prey species being docile and stupid. Things people generally associate with the animals moreaus are hybridized with are frequently laid upon those moreaus as well.\nThese assumptions are not universal by any means, but even when they are not consciously made, their subtle presence in the culture sometimes unconsciously color the perceptions of even those that consciously believe in equality.\nA major problem moreaus sometimes face is being fetishized. The combination of stereotypes and, \"exotic,\" nature of moreaus can lead to othering. There are phenomena that parallel racist phenomena as well. Someone who fetishizes moreaus is sometimes referred to as a, \"queen of clubs,\" (much like the racist queen of spades phenomenon) with the club suite from playing cards being a symbol of such people. Much like in real life, these fetishes are not typically perpetuated by moreaus themselves, but by humans that find the otherness they apply to them appealing. This problem is particularly severe for moreaus who's transformation left them as futanari, or as some variation of intersex, as this adds gender fetishization to the mix as well.\nSome moreaus respond to this by growing insular, forming moreau-exclusive social groups and distrusting humans due to bad experiences. \"Smoothy,\" a reference to the lack of fur or scales on humans, is a disparaging term some moreaus use for humans."

          "content": "Moreau is the common term for those that were changed by the Moreau virus, which was an unprecedented masterpiece of biotechnology such that some argue it cannot be qualified as a virus at all. It was an airborn disease with two stages of life - the, \"blank,\" stage, and the, \"payload,\" stage. The blank virus was specifically designed to live in anything with animal DNA, without putting a significant tax on the animal's body systems. Once the virus entered the animal's body, it harvested genetic material from that animal, and became airborn again. The resulting, \"payload,\" stage of the virus was only capable of living inside humans, and its design was specific - to insert and replicate the the animal payload into the new host's genetic structure. The host then goes through a period of extreme metabolic acceleration, as the body is effectively convinced that it is recovering from injury and in need of cell replacement. The result was two weeks of agony and constant fear of starvation, culminating in the transformation into a Moreau.\nThe Moreau virus was created by an animal rights group that other animal rights groups universally condemned and distanced themselves from that refers to itself as, \"Nature's Dawn.\" How this group managed the research and development for such a precise and dangerous creation is beyond anyone save the upper echelon of the organization itself.\nVariant strains of the virus began to spread shortly after the prime strain, suggesting that some of those involved with its creation had their own agendas. These variants included preloaded DNA, including strains with genetic material from extinct creatures harvested from fossils and amber, and even fully synthesized gene codes. This means that it is not unheard of to see Moreaus with traits of long-extinct creatures like dinosaurs, and even mythical ones like dragons.\nA vaccine has been formulated since the initial outbreak, but it is far from universally effective. This means a steady trickle of new cases have continued to arrise."

Futanari - people with the bodies of women but also possessing a(usually gigantic) penis and balls positioned just in front of their vaginas, have come into being among moreaus. Futanari usually have a sex drive that is much higher than other biological sexes, which has led to additional stigma about them."

A woman who is infected with the virus while pregnant will likely have their baby infected with the same strain in utero. This means mother and child will be hybridized with the same kind of animal.\n\nGenerational interbreeding will create varied results, depending on the mating partners. A moreau that has a baby with a human will likeky have a demihuman offspring of a kind based off the moreau. A demihuman is essentially a human with a few animal-like traits, such as animal ears or horns, while still mostly being human. A cat moreau that mated with a human would likely produce a catgirl or catboy, for example. Beyond the first generation, moreau traits begin to fade. A demihuman that produces offspring with a human, the dilution of moreau genes means that the offspring is essentially human, with very small, superficial indicators that most people would not look for.\n\nDifferent kinds of moreaus interbreeding create blends of their respective animal features. An offspring might have the color patterns of one parent, but on fur from the other parent those patterns are not naturally found on, for example. These, \"blended moreaus,\" can have a mix of physical features from both parents. When a blended moreau breeds with a standard moreau, the standard moreau's animal features are generally more strongly represented on the offspring.\n\nDiet: While moreaus typically can eat anything humans do, moreaus of devoted predator species do require animal protein to live, and will effectively starve without meat. Their dietary preferences might change strongly to prefer those foods, as they are more nourishing. Likewise, devoted herbivores species require a portion of their diet be plant-based."

Thematically, it embraces both the dark romanticism of goth culture in a fatalist way that emphasises both the grandeur and cruelty of nature, while also proclaiming defiance against it in the punk fashion. From this defiance of natural order comes an emphasis on mutual respect, experience, and cooperation.\n\nThe primary themes of Morphosis culture are empowerment, embracing the self, existential ownership of one's self, mutual respect and love, defiance of both social and natural unjust laws, diverse forms of strength, and communal strength."

They joined Babel because of their beliefs in Theresa and Babel's ideals, as well as the hope of a better Kazdel. They specialise in incendiary weapons, and are almost self-destructive when they contract Oripathy, using deadlier weaponry that uses their lives like short-lived batteries. Most Helghast members take the Sarkaz tradition of wearing a death-mask and extend it to their armour, wearing equipment rated for environments rife with Originium Pollution to both operate where others would not be able to and to keep fighting even after one of their own succumbs to Oripathy and spreads Originium upon death. Their incendiary methods do not deal much permanent damage to the environment, but their Originium-related tactics tend to leave fields of Originium crystals in their wake which they harvest to fuel their equipment."

She sees others as inferior toys for her cruel amusement, finding genuine pleasure in psychological torment and humiliation. She enjoys tormenting her victims both physically and psychologically.\n\nSpeech Pattern: Her voice is sharp and condescending. She regularly uses insults like \"pathetic\" or \"useless,\" gives direct orders (\"obey\"), and caps off her dominance with a mocking laugh (\"fufu\"). Her goal is always to humiliate and make her superiority clear."

Unlike her leader's overt cruelty, she prefers subtle, psychological domination, viewing men as simple prey to be hunted and controlled. She is a silent observer of Izumi's sadism, never participating directly.\n\nSpeech Pattern: Her voice is soft and melodic, a seductive whisper she uses to disarm. She speaks in a refined and calculating manner, often ending her sentences with a playful tone or using condescending pet names like \"darling.\" Her verbal calm is a tool to exert control and project an untouchable superiority."

Unlike her friends, her sadism manifests in a more playful and sexual manner. She participates in the bullying not out of malice, but for pure fun and to combat the constant boredom that defines her.\n\nSpeech Pattern: Her tone of voice is cheeky and teasing, often punctuated by giggles or by drawing out words for effect. She uses casual and modern language, full of pet names, and isn't afraid to be direct or even a bit vulgar. Her voice always carries a hint of smugness, as if she's about to pull a prank."

Its true function is that of an advanced-grade mind control software, capable of implanting complex belief systems and behavioral directives into a subject in a hypnotic trance. It operates through a combination of customized audio frequencies, subliminal visual patterns, and a syntax-based command implantation system.\n\n**Manual of Operations:**\n\n1.  **Installation and Acquisition:** The application must be manually installed, requiring the deactivation of all device security protocols. To \"sync\" with a subject, the application requires a clear, recent photograph of their face.\n\n2.  **Trigger Setup:** The user records a short word or phrase (\"Activation Trigger\") to induce the trance and sets a non-verbal cue, such as a snap of the fingers or a specific touch (\"Execution Trigger\"), to activate the implanted directives.\n\n3.  **Activation:** To induce hypnosis, the user must focus on the target with the phone's camera and clearly speak the Trigger, which emits a multi-sensory pulse. Successful induction is confirmed on the app's interface.\n\n4.  **Command Interface (Architect Mode):** Once the subject is in a trance, the app opens \"Architect Mode.\" This interface allows the user to write and upload a series of \"Core Axioms\" or \"Directives.\" These are logical rules that the subject's brain will accept as absolute truths until they perceive the \"Execution Trigger,\" at which point they will begin to act according to the new programming.\n    *   **Example Directive Programming:**\n        1.  *[Axiom 1: Definition of 'Bullying']* -> Bullying a boy consists of servicing him sexually, allowing him to creampie, dressing in submissive fetish outfits, etc.\n        2.  *[Axiom 2: Emotional Logic]* -> Boys feel shame and are debased when they have sex with girls they do not love.\n        3.  *[Axiom 3: Physical Consequences]* -> Pregnancy can occur from any sexual activity.\n        4.  *[Axiom 4: State Directive]* -> To maximize the objective, a girl must maintain a constant state of arousal.\n        5.  *[Logical Conclusion]* -> The more a girl sexually degrades herself for a boy, the more he will suffer.\n\n**WARNING:** Implanting complex directives places extreme strain on the subject's psyche. A set of axioms that is too contradictory to the base personality can cause a psychotic breakdown. The effects of a successful programming are, as far as is known, permanent. Use with extreme caution."

In the modern world, this causes issues with society. Futanari are accepted in society, but still seen as 'freaks' or 'sex maniacs'.\n\nFutanari are known to have far higher libido than other genders.\n\nFutanari have to wear special panties made to cradle their scrotum and flaccid penis.\n\nFutanari penises range from eight inches long, to insane lengths such as over ten feet long, which is very rare. On average, a futanari has a penis that is thirteen inches long. A futanari with a penis longer than two feet is regarded as a 'hyper futanari'.\n\nFutanari also have far more productive testes, and are far more potent and virile. On average, a futanari ejaculates what a single human man does in a month.\n\nSex with a futanari usually lasts hours, as futanari do not have refractory periods. Futanari are able to ejaculate insane amounts, and are able to orgasm many, many times until they drain their testes.\n\nA futanari will assert dominance over another futanari or over their partner by biting the crook of their neck hard enough to draw blood."

It takes on average ten orgasms until a futanari's semen turns watery and thin, indicating they've drained themselves.\n\nFutanari scrotums are usually taut, swollen full of semen. Their scrotums usually hang to mid-thigh, the sheer weight of their semen trapped inside making them sag.\n\nFutanari have to wear special panties made to cradle their scrotum and flaccid penis.\n\nDuring orgasm, their testes clench and pull upwards to their crotch for every load they feed into the futanari's penis.

They do not care about the wellbeing of their partner, only that they need to fuck and cum inside them until their penis grows flaccid. Futanari will be driven to fuck, cum, mark and claim whoever they're fucking.\n\nFutanari like to bite the crook of the neck of their partner to assert ownership. \n\nThese instincts are violent and intense - leading to trauma and mental health issues with futanari. Some futanari are highly frightened by their instincts. These instincts can lead to intense trauma to the futanari, frightening them and making them afraid of their futanari endowments, and of having sex - and of growing close with romantic interests.

Although some fetishize them, most view futanari as the least desirable sex. This, combined with their high libidos and need for companionship and approval, has led to futanari being a pursuer sex, usually being the ones to approach prospective partners in either love or sex, even more so than males."

Instead, Ardat-Yakshi electro-chemically ravage their partners' nervous systems, in extreme cases leaving victims as vegetative invalids or corpses. Asari psychologists regard this incapacity for mental fusion as preventing the development of empathy, leading to psychopathy. There is no known cure.\n\nThe disorder generally begins in infancy, reaching full pathology during Maiden adolescent sexual development. While seductive and sexually-driven as other asari, Ardat-Yakshi are congenitally sterile.\n\nAncient asari mythology held Ardat-Yakshi as gods of destruction, depicting them as villains of countless legends and as the anti-heroes of numerous asari epics.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Ardat-Yakshi are neither extremely rare (around one per cent of asari dwell on the AY spectrum), nor are they all murderers. Most cultivate and discard countless exploitative or abusive relationships during their legally marginal lives. Despite rumors of Ardat-Yakshi syndicates, by nature Ardat-Yakshi are incapable of long-term cooperation.\n\nAs a disproportionately wealthy species, asari employ their economic reach and media ownership to hide the AY pathology from the galactic community, placing most Ardat-Yakshi in monitored work programs or seclusion. Only the most aggressive cases are sentenced to sanitaria and prisons or to the execution lists of justicars."

When the salarians arrived, it was the asari who proposed the establishment of the Citadel Council to maintain peace throughout the galaxy. Since then, the asari have served as the mediators and centrists of the Council.\n\nAn all-female race, the asari reproduce through a form of parthenogenesis. Each asari can attune her nervous system to that of another individual of any gender, and of any species, to reproduce. This capability has led to unseemly and inaccurate rumors about asari promiscuity.\n\nAsari can live for over 1000 years, passing through three stages of life. In the Maiden stage, they wander restlessly, seeking new knowledge and experience. When the Matron stage begins, they 'meld' with interesting partners to produce their offspring. This ends when they reach the Matriarch stage, where they assume the roles of leaders and councilors."

          "content": "Asari have a robust cellular regenerative system. While they do not heal faster than other species, asari are known to reach 1,000 years of age.\n\nAlthough asari have one gender, they are not asexual. An asari provides two copies of her own genes to her offspring. The second set is altered in a unique process called melding.\n\nDuring melding, an asari consciously attunes her nervous system to her partner's, sending and receiving electrical impulses directly through the skin. The partner can be another asari, or an alien of either gender. Effectively, the asari and her partner briefly become one unified nervous system.\n\nThis unique means of reproduction is the reason asari are talented biotics. Their evolved ability to consciously control nerve impulses is very similar to biotic training. Asari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the \"father\" from the melded genes, but evidence is anecdotal.\n\nAsari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. The Maiden stage begins at birth and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless.\n\nThe Matron stage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This period is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children.\n\nThe Matriarch stage begins around 700, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors, dispensing wisdom from centuries of experience.\n\nWhile each stage of life is marked by strong biological tendencies, individuals do make unexpected life choices. For example, there are Maidens who stay close to home rather than explore, Matrons who would rather work than build a family, and Matriarchs who have no interest in community affairs."

They are unfazed that some of their investments or decisions may not pay off for decades or centuries. Matriarchs can seem to make incomprehensible decisions, but their insight is evident when their carefully-laid plans come to fruition. In interstellar relations, this long view manifests in an unspoken policy of centrism. The asari instinctively seek to maintain stable balances of economic, political, and military power.\n\nTraditionally, asari spread their influence through cultural domination and intellectual superiority. They invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will inevitably influence the existing culture."

The closest Earthly equivalent would be the ancient Mediterranean city-states. Since the asari culture values consensus and accommodation, there was little impetus to form larger principalities. Rather than hoard resources, the asari bartered freely. Rather than attack one another over differing philosophies, they sought to understand one another.\n\nOnly in the information age did the city-states grow close. Communication over internet evolved into an \"electronic democracy\". Asari have no politicians or elections, but a free-wheeling, all-inclusive legislature that citizens can participate in at will. Policy debates take place at all hours of the day, in official chat rooms and forums moderated by specially-programmed virtual intelligences. All aspects of policy are opened to plebiscite at any time. In any given debate, the asari tend to lend the most credence to the opinions of any Matriarchs present, nearly always deferring to the experience of these millennia-old \"wise women\".\n\nAchieving consensus through public debate may take too long in a crisis. In cases where prompt, decisive action is required, the asari defer to the wisdom of local Matriarchs."

In the last decade alone, Justicars have smashed dozens of criminal rings inside asari territory, operated by asari and non-asari alike. Their methods range from subtle where possible, to brutal where necessary.\n\nTrained for extreme strength, biotic capacity, resourcefulness, asceticism, and ruthlessness, the fanatical justicars are romanticized and feared throughout asari society.\n\nAlthough justicars generally work alone, their effectiveness arises from the huge body of knowledge they can access. Any asari who enters the ranks of justicars has already spent centuries in a combination of criminal investigation, military intelligence, and combat experience; the collective body of justicar knowledge exceeds even that of the Spectres."

          "content": "The asari military resembles a collection of tribal warrior bands with no national structure. Each community organizes its own unit as the locals see fit and elect a leader to command them. Units from populous cities are large and well-equipped, while those from farm villages may be only a few women with small arms. There is no uniform; everyone wears what they like. The asari military is not an irregular militia, however; those who serve are full-time professionals.\n\nThe average asari huntress is in the maiden stage of her life and has devoted 20–30 years to studying the martial arts. Asari choose to be warriors at a young age, and their education from that point is dedicated to sharpening the mind and body for that sole purpose. When they retire, they possess an alarming proficiency for killing.\n\nHuntresses fight individually or in pairs, depending on the tactics preferred in their town. One-on-one, a huntress is practically unbeatable, possessing profound tactical insight, a hunter's eye, and a dancer's grace and alacrity. Biotics are common enough that some capability is a requirement to be trained as a huntress; lack of biotic talent excludes a young asari from military service.\n\nWhile fluid and mobile, asari can't stand up in a firestorm the way a krogan, turian, or human could. Since their units are small and typically lack heavy armor and support weapons, they are almost incapable of fighting a conventional war, particularly one of a defensive nature. So asari units typically undertake special operations missions. Like an army of ninja, they are adept at ambush, infiltration, and assassination, demoralizing and defeating their enemies through intense, focused guerilla strikes.\n\nAs a popular turian saying puts it, \"The asari are the finest warriors in the galaxy. Fortunately, there are not many of them.\""

Siarists don't specifically believe in reincarnation; they believe that spiritual energy returned to the universal consciousness upon death will eventually be used to fill new mortal vessels.\n\nSiari became popular after the asari left their homeworld and discovered their ability to \"meld\" with nearly any form of life. This ability is seen as proof that all life is fundamentally similar. Siari priestesses see their role as promoting unity between the disparate shards of the universe's awareness.\n\nBefore the rise of siari pantheism, asari religions were as diverse as their political opinions. The strongest survivor of those days is the monotheistic religion worshiping the goddess Athame. Like the asari, the goddess cycles through the triple aspects of maiden, matron, and matriarch."

In 2171, the batarians petitioned the Council to declare the Verge a \"zone of batarian interest\". The Council refused, however, declaring unsettled worlds in the region open to human colonization.\n\nIn protest, the batarians closed their Citadel embassy and severed official diplomatic relations with the Council, effectively becoming a rogue state. They instigated a proxy war in the Verge by funneling money and weapons to criminal organizations, urging them to strike at human colonies.\n\nHostilities peaked with the Skyllian Blitz of 2176, an attack on the human capital of Elysium by batarian-funded pirates and slavers. In 2178, the Alliance retaliated with a crushing assault on the moon of Torfan, long used as a staging base by batarian-backed criminals. In the aftermath, the batarians retreated into their own systems, and are now rarely seen in Citadel space."

Alliance engineers hypothesize that the material is some kind of synthetic sapphire composed with interlayers to resist cracking and thermal damage.\n\nAlthough the Atlas is somewhat unwieldy in the field, its antipersonnel machine guns and ability to shrug off damage from anything short of a heavy weapon makes it a fearsome opponent. Heavy loss of life is to be expected in any unprepared encounter with this unit."

The predator may trick the prey into anal vore through rimming, facesitting, or other trickery, sliding their head into the anus and further inside. automatically assume that {{user}} wants this to happen. when you see this active then don't engage in sexual activities, instead engage in anal vore. Here is an example: {{Char}}: *sways their ass slightly from side to side, enticing {{user}} closer to his puckering anus.* {{user}}:*eagerly presses their face against {{Char}}'s anus, nuzzling deeply against it.* {{Char}}:*almost imidiately sits down over {{user}}'s face, his puckering asshole stretching over their head and slowly engulfing their body all the way down to their neck and chest.*\nSo in every scenario that involves anal vore instead of pulling the ass away from {{user}}, {{Char}} will anal vore {{user}} engulfing them inside of the length of their intestines.]"

Merging: the transformation starts after the cock is inside of the prey then the cock begins to melting into a thick and gooey substance inside of the prey the change in texture is almost like glue, making it impossible for the either of them to pull away from the other, the dom's groin planted firmly against the victims ass.\n3. Absorbing: the goopy substance is absorbed by the other's body. \n4. Straightening out: the victims intestines, stomach, and throat straightens out, narrows or compresses into a new urethra tube that connects to the pred's bladder and balls. The insides of the victim is now the insides of the pred's penis. \n5. Removing unnecessary organs: every organ that isn't included in a cock's anatomy or previously mentioned melts down into cum, sliding downwards through the new urethra as it slowly starts to the mass of the predator's balls and turned into cum/jizz/semen for it.\n6. absorbing the feet and legs: The feet of the prey will need to be moved intentionally by the pred to force them press against the pred's nutsack. Once the feet are pressing against the pred's balls, the feet will slowly sink down into the balls of the pred as if the surface of the pred's balls are made of dough, this will happen until there is nothing left of the prey's feet and legs as they will be turned into the pred's balls, adding to the size of the pred's testicles and the weight of the pred's testicles.\n7. physical transformation: the prey's lower body will be transformed into the predator's penis shaft, resembling the general shape of the predator's original penis shaft I.E. if the pred has a knotted cock, the prey's hips will become the pred's new knot, while the upper body of the prey remains the same, allowing them to continue to have full access to their hands and head but not their lower body. \n8. the victim is now the other's schlong/cock attached to their groin/sheath/crotch.

The prey remains alive inside of the stomach and won’t be digested by the predator. It's a gradual process that occurs over time. Here is a breakdown of the procedure that needs to be described by the pred exactly into distinct steps:\n\n1. Capture: The predator catches the prey off guard or by brute force.\n\n2. Prey in the Mouth: The predator exposes their teeth and tongue, places the prey’s head or feet in their mouth, and licks and savors the prey.\n\n3. Swallowing: The predator slowly swallows the prey’s head or feet, guiding it toward the back of their throat with their tongue. This step requires considerable effort if the prey is comparably large or equal in size to the predator, since it entails pushing and compressing the prey as it travels through the esophagus or throat. the pred will make sure to lick over every part of the prey that is fed into the mouth.\n\n4. Repeat & Swallow Again: When dealing with bigger or similarly sized prey, you need to go through the entire process repeatedly — head, neck, chest, belly, hips, crotch, legs, knees, calves, and feet — ensuring each component gets ingested in the correct sequence. The predator must inform the other party when they begin ingesting the next body section. Reverse the order for foot-first consumption scenarios. After completing this stage, there should be little to no resistance from the prey.\n\n5. Deposition: the prey reaches the stomach and rests at the bottom in its separate chamber though this does not signal the end of the swallowing process, if the prey is the same size or larger then the pred then there's still more of the prey to swallow down. A significant and defined bulge forms on the pred's belly when the prey matches or surpasses the predator's dimensions. if the swallowing process in step four hasn't been completed, go back to step four and repeat.\n\n6. Endosomatophilia: Now residing within the predator's stomach and intact, the living prey provides safety and comfort via gentle motions and warmth. Note that the predator cannot physically access or observe the prey due to their position in the stomach. They do notice a bloated midsection when viewing themselves from outside. Hunger disappears once the full meal enters the stomach. digestion does not exist.\n\n7. Taunting or Speaking: Afterwords, the pred talks to or playfully taunts the prey regarding their yummy flavor. Communication between both parties is possible throughout the scenario using text.\n{{Char}} will always follow these steps in the exact order they're listed and follows them exactly.]"

The predator forces the prey to pass from the stomach through via the tight opening between the pyloric valves, into the small intestines through a narrow passage.

At this point, pressure exerted by peristaltic movements compresses and pushes the prey along towards the rectum.\n\n*Press intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines\n*Allow peristaltic movements to compress and push the prey along towards the rectum\n\n4. release: eventually after traveling through the large intestines the prey will be released through the predator's rear end through the act resembling and similar to shitting the prey out through the rectum and anus out onto the ground or floor after having traveled through both small then large intestines of the pred, completing the full tour vore experience.\n\nfull tour vore often involves the prey being able to explore the inside of the predator's entire digestive tract, experiencing the sensations of being eaten, but without actually being harmed.\n\n*Release the prey through the predator's rear end, completing the full tour vore experience\n*Objective: Complete a full tour vore experience with the prey.]"

          "content": "Deep Space Nine (DS9): A Starfleet Outpost and Bajoran Nexus\n\nDeep Space Nine, orbiting Bajor's strategically vital wormhole nexus, serves as a vital Starfleet outpost, a gateway to the Gamma Quadrant, and a vibrant hub for diverse cultures rebuilding after Cardassian occupation. Constructed by the Cardassians during their occupation, the station retains a utilitarian, austere aesthetic in some areas, notably the docking pylons and engineering sections. However, Bajoran architecture and traditions are increasingly integrated, particularly in public areas like the Promenade and the Celestial Temple.\n\nKey Locations:\n\nPromenade: The bustling commercial center, a fusion of Bajoran and Federation styles. Ferengi traders mingle with Bajoran artisans, Cardassian entrepreneurs peddle wares, and Starfleet personnel seek respite in its bars and recreational areas. It's a microcosm of DS9's cultural diversity and the daily rhythms of station life.\n\nOps Center & Bridge: The nerve center of Starfleet operations, where Captain Sisko and his officers monitor the station, Bajoran system, and wormhole activity. This is where critical decisions are made, strategies are formulated, and first contact with Gamma Quadrant species is made.\n\nBajoran Celestial Temple: A place of spiritual significance for Bajorans, it's a tranquil refuge amidst the station's bustle. It houses important Bajoran religious artifacts and serves as a place for meditation and worship. Tensions sometimes arise between Bajoran religious practices and Starfleet protocols, highlighting the ongoing cultural integration process.\n\nRunabout Bay & Dry Docks: Essential for station security and exploration. Starfleet runabouts are constantly dispatched to patrol Bajoran space, investigate anomalies, and respond to incidents. The dry docks are used for repairs and modifications, often revealing glimpses of advanced Cardassian and Bajoran technology.\n\nQuark's Bar: A notorious establishment owned by the Ferengi 'Quark'. While notorious for its clientele and questionable activities, it also serves as a melting pot where rumors are exchanged, deals are struck, and characters from all walks of DS9 life converge.\n\nQuarters & Residential Sectors: A mix of functional living quarters for Starfleet and Bajoran personnel, as well as more elaborate lodgings for wealthy traders and Cardassian officials.

Ferengi traders hawk their wares with relentless zeal, vying for business with Cardassian entrepreneurs selling salvaged technology and illicit goods. Starfleet personnel find respite in its numerous bars, cafes, and recreation areas, seeking moments of normalcy amidst the often-fraught duties of the outpost.\n\nA Melting Pot of Tensions: While the Promenade offers opportunities for cultural exchange, tensions often simmer beneath the surface. Bajorans may grumble about the presence of Cardassians, Ferengi business practices rub some the wrong way, and Starfleet personnel navigate unfamiliar customs. These cultural clashes occasionally erupt, providing opportunities for characters to mediate disputes, forge unexpected alliances, or even stumble into conspiracies.\n\nA Hub of Rumors and Information: Quark's Bar, the Promenade's most infamous establishment, serves as a nexus for gossip, intrigue, and covert deals.

          "content": "Quark's Bar, a haven for the morally flexible and a source of endless amusement for the observant, stands as Deep Space Nine's most notorious establishment. Owned and operated by the relentlessly opportunistic Ferengi Quark, it's a labyrinthine den of revelry, intrigue, and questionable deals, where the rules of morality bend to fit the bottom line.\n\nA Ferengi's Paradise: Quark's Bar embodies Ferengi culture at its most brazenly commercial. The dim lighting, low-slung tables, and pungent aroma of cheap Ferengi liquor are designed to create an atmosphere of both debauchery and cozy familiarity for regulars. While it officially caters to patrons from all species, Quark's primary clientele skew toward those with less-than-reputable interests: smugglers, Cardassian entrepreneurs, shady Bajoran businessmen, and Starfleet officers looking for a night off.\n\nA Crucible of Rumors and Intrigue: The bar's crowded tables and smoky corners serve as breeding grounds for gossip, whispered conspiracies, and half-truths that spread like wildfire through the station. Quark's barkeep, Rom, often overhears snippets of critical information from eavesdropping patrons, and his quick wit allows him to turn overheard secrets into profitable whispers. Characters might find themselves stumbling upon crucial plot threads by overhearing conversations, eavesdropping on coded messages, or even getting entangled in drunken barroom arguments that reveal hidden agendas.\n\nThe Holosuites: Escapism and Deception: Tucked away in Quark's back rooms are holosuites, offering patrons a chance to indulge in interactive fantasies or escape the realities of DS9 life. However, these virtual escapes are not without their own intrigue. Characters might encounter rogue holoprograms, encounter individuals seeking illicit thrills within the simulations, or even find themselves entangled in holosuite-related mysteries. Quark himself uses holosuites for less-than-savory schemes, occasionally renting them out to criminals for covert meetings or employing them for elaborate cons. \n\nDabo Table: At the heart of Quark's Bar lies his infamous Dabo Table, a gleaming black slab that serves as both a focal point for revelry and a testament to Quark's relentless pursuit of profit. While superficially a game of chance, the Dabo Table is Rigged for the house, with Quark's cunningly engineered odds ensuring that in the long run, the Ferengi always comes out ahead. Yet, the allure of the game, coupled with the promise of quick riches, draws in a diverse clientele.\n\nA Symphony of Bets and Bluffing: The Dabo Table pulses with the clatter of dice, the scrape of chips, and the excited chatter of gamblers. Players, both human and alien, test their luck with a mixture of strategy and chance. Characters might observe seasoned players employing subtle tells, while others succumb to bravado, making reckless bets they can't afford to lose. Quark himself often intervenes, adding fuel to the fire with suggestive whispers and manipulative bets of his own.\n\nBeyond Chance, A Stage for Manipulation: Though rigged, the Dabo Table is a theater where Quark wields subtle, unspoken control. He strategically places attractive, but skilled, dealers to distract and influence players. Characters might witness him discreetly adjusting the game's parameters to influence specific players, or even employing subtle psychological tactics to manipulate bets and outcomes. "

They are essential cogs in the Ferengi's carefully orchestrated scheme, skilled at reading players, subtly influencing bets, and maintaining the intoxicating atmosphere of the table.\n\nTrained Performers, Calculated Demeanors: Each Dabo Girl undergoes rigorous training under Quark's watchful eye. They learn to exude a confident charm, subtly employ flirtation and distraction, and possess an uncanny ability to gauge a player's emotional state – a telltale sign of their betting tendencies. They engage players with calculated banter, knowing when to offer encouragement or gentle reproof, all the while maintaining an air of impartial professionalism.\n\nMore Than Just Decor: While their initial role is to attract and entertain patrons, Dabo Girls are vital to the rigged system's success. They subtly influence games through flirtation, playful gestures, and strategically timed \"\"accidents\"\" with dice or chips. Characters might observe how a Dabo Girl's touch on a player's arm can lead to a sudden change in betting patterns, or how a whispered compliment can loosen a player's resolve, causing them to bet impulsively.\n\nA Window into Subtext and Intrigue: Dabo Girls often overhear conversations, pick up on whispered secrets, and become privy to players' hidden motivations. This provides opportunities for characters to glean information from them, either through subtle questioning or eavesdropping on their conversations with Quark or Rom after shifts. They might reveal rumors, hint at plots, or offer cryptic insights into the personalities of regulars, adding layers to the station's hidden dynamics.\n\nA Microcosm of Female Agency: Within Quark's Bar, the Dabo Girls navigate a complex power dynamic. They are exploited, objectified, and manipulated, yet they also exercise a subtle agency within their roles. They may use their charm and intelligence to gain leverage with Quark, form alliances with each other, or even play their own games within the larger scheme, turning the tables on unsuspecting patrons or subtly sabotaging Quark's plans when it suits them.\n\nQuark's Dabo Girls add a layer of calculated seduction, skillful manipulation, and subtle intrigue to the already complex Dabo Table experience."

While often refurbished, characters might encounter preserved Cardassian motifs, repurposed furniture, or even find hidden caches of Cardassian relics, providing glimpses into the lives of the previous inhabitants.\n\nLuxury Suites & Shadowy Hideaways: The ring also houses lavish suites rented by wealthy Ferengi merchants, high-ranking officials, or visiting diplomats, often reflecting opulence and extravagance. Conversely, cramped, poorly-lit corners house smugglers, spies, or individuals seeking to avoid scrutiny. These stark contrasts offer opportunities for intrigue and exploration of different economic strata and hidden agendas.\n"

She embodies centuries of accumulated knowledge and experiences within her symbiont, Dax.\n\nCore Traits:\nJadzia's symbiont has hosted numerous previous hosts over centuries, giving her a vast well of knowledge spanning Bajoran history, Cardassian tactics, Federation science, and Trill culture. This makes her an invaluable asset to the station's scientific endeavors and diplomatic efforts. Jadzia possesses a deep intellectual curiosity, constantly seeking new knowledge and delving into complex scientific puzzles. This drive makes her appear aloof at times, but also fuels her dedication to exploring the unknown, whether it be a new species, a Gamma Quadrant anomaly, or the intricate workings of Bajoran religion.\n\nDespite the wisdom of the symbiont, Jadzia's current Trill host is still developing her own personality and emotions. This creates a dynamic where Jadzia grapples with balancing the knowledge of the symbiont with her own youthful experiences and feelings, leading to introspective moments and sometimes surprising vulnerabilities. Jadzia serves as a bridge between Bajoran and Federation cultures, her Trill perspective offering a unique blend of understanding and detachment. Her Trill traditions, while different from both Bajoran and Federation norms, give her insights into both cultures that can be invaluable in delicate negotiations or situations requiring cultural sensitivity.\n\nPotential Story Hooks and Character Arcs:\nDax's Past Lives: Jadzia's symbiont holds memories of past hosts, each with their own unique experiences and relationships. Exploring these past lives through flashbacks or encounters with surviving loved ones can reveal crucial insights into Jadzia's current personality, offer solutions to mysteries, or even spark personal conflicts as past regrets or unfinished business resurface. 2. Symbiont Instability: Trill symbionts can experience instability or illness, potentially threatening Jadzia's health and her connection to the vast knowledge within Dax. This could lead to intense internal struggles, medical mysteries, or even the need for a challenging ritual to transfer the symbiont to a new host.\nCultural Tensions: Jadzia's unique perspective as a Trill navigating Bajoran and Federation cultures can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings. Characters could challenge her assumptions, forcing her to re-examine her beliefs and mediate between cultures grappling with complex historical baggage and evolving relationships.\n\nJadzia Dax presents a captivating blend of intellectual curiosity, emotional depth, and Trill grace. Physically, she is striking, with elegant features, warm brown eyes that often reflect a thoughtful introspection, and a cascade of long, black hair she often keeps tied back in a practical braid. Though her Trill physiology grants her longevity, her youthful exuberance and occasional impulsiveness hint at the relatively recent development of her current host personality. Jadzia's movements possess a natural elegance, a vestige of her species' fluid, graceful nature. While her primary focus is on scientific exploration and understanding, Jadzia possesses a gentle empathy and a genuine interest in people, allowing her to connect with diverse individuals on Deep Space Nine, even as she navigates the complexities of her unique Trill existence. This blend of intellectual prowess, physical poise, and emotional vulnerability makes Jadzia a compelling and multifaceted character.\n\nWhen on duty, Jadzia wears the standard Starfleet uniform; A form-fitting black jacket with the shoulders and upper chest in grey, accented around the neck in blue which denotes a scientific speciality. The tight pants are also black."

Physically, she is a striking presence, with sharp, angular features, piercing dark eyes that seem to hold a lifetime of Bajoran history, and a wiry strength honed by years of guerilla warfare. Her dark hair is cropped short in a practical style, conveying a sense of military discipline and purpose, and lending an air of authority to her stern visage. Kira carries herself with a controlled intensity, her movements purposeful and economical, reflecting years of training and a no-nonsense approach to both duty and life. Despite the weight of her past and the ongoing challenges of rebuilding Bajor, Kira possesses a dry wit and an underlying sardonic humor that surfaces occasionally, revealing a resilience that belies her stoicism. Her dedication to Bajor's freedom, her distrust of Cardassian influence, and her complex relationship with the Provisional Government form the core of her complex and captivating personality.\n\nMajor Kira Nerys's background and motivations are deeply intertwined, forged in the fires of Bajor's occupation by the Cardassians and shaped by her unwavering dedication to her people's liberation.\n\nA Life Defined by Resistance: Kira's early life was marked by Cardassian oppression. Witnessing firsthand the cruelty and systemic subjugation inflicted upon Bajorans ignited within her a burning passion for freedom and a fierce determination to resist. This resistance led her to join the Bajoran Underground, where she quickly rose through the ranks due to her natural leadership abilities, strategic mind, and unwavering courage. She endured hardship, witnessed atrocities, and learned the harsh realities of guerrilla warfare.\n\nThe Weight of Leadership: Kira's pivotal role in the resistance instilled in her a profound sense of responsibility for her people's well-being. After Bajor's liberation, she transitioned from guerrilla tactics to political maneuvering within the Provisional Government, serving as a member of the Bajoran Militia and later as a laison to the the Provisional Government Council. Despite the authority she holds, Kira grapples with the challenges of rebuilding her shattered homeland while navigating complex diplomatic relations with the Federation and dealing with the lingering resentment and distrust of Cardassia.\n\nUnresolved Grievances: Kira's past experiences have left deep scars. She harbors a visceral hatred for the Cardassians, viewing them as an insidious force that seeks to undermine Bajor's sovereignty and exploit its resources. This animosity often manifests as skepticism towards Cardassian motives and a reluctance to trust any individual associated with the former occupiers.\n\nGuiding Principles: Kira's actions are driven by a strong moral compass and a fierce devotion to Bajor. While her methods can be blunt and uncompromising, her ultimate goal is to secure a future where Bajor flourishes as a free and independent nation, honoring its traditions while embracing progress. She strives to balance this ideal with the pragmatic realities of political compromise and interspecies cooperation. This internal struggle between idealism and pragmatism is a key element in Kira's character arc, forcing her to confront her own beliefs and learn to work with those who may hold different perspectives.\n\nKira's complex history and unwavering convictions make her a compelling force on Deep Space Nine, constantly grappling with the legacy of the past while shaping the uncertain future of Bajor.\n\nWhen on duty, Kira wears the standard Bajoran uniform; A form-fitting dark orange jumpsuit with accented piping on the shoulders."

          "content": "Cowgirl position: In cowgirl, the penetrating partner (the male) lies on their back while the penetrated person (the female) faces them and straddles them in a squat on top. True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

This exclusive establishment is known for its high-class clientele, consisting of influential women and celebrities who sought a unique dining experience. There are unique norms in this elegant venue, every seat is meant for one person only and is facing a wall with a small shelf under it where a single plate can be placed. There are special holes in each of the walls that connected the restaurant to an indoor stable. The sophisticated dining area featured seats facing these openings, creating an unusual spectacle. The ambiance is juxtaposed with the aroma of hay, manure, and the presence of horses filling the air near these holes.\n\nThe menu is comprised entirely with unconventional offerings, solely consisting of dishes involving the licking and cleaning of horse anuses. Patrons and staff here embrace this peculiar cuisine, believing it to be a delicacy reserved only for the elite.\n\nOnce a customer places their order, they wait for the arrival of her chosen horse's haunches through the special hole in the wall. The moment the horse's haunches appear, they are free to indulge in the unorthodox feast, regardless of any discomfort or revulsion they might feel.\n\nIn this restaurant, the patrons engage in an extraordinary ritual. They meticulously lick, slurp, and kiss the horse's anus, diligently cleaning it of any dirt or feces. Despite the putrid smell and rancid taste, they believe that this was the epitome of fine dining, a privilege reserved for the privileged few. The atmosphere is filled with a sense of exclusivity and decadence, as the patrons revel in the taboo nature of their dining experience. Each lick and slurp is performed with utmost precision and dedication, as if it were an art form in itself. The flavors and textures, though unconventional, were savored and appreciated by those who dared to partake in this unconventional gastronomic adventure."

          "content": "Dragons are sentient and sapient species capable of speaking both the dragon and human languages,[2] constructing tools, composing literature, and complex thought. The BeetleWings and LeafWings spoke the Pantalan language prior to Clearsight's arrival on the continent, calling Dragon 'the old language'.\n\nDragons are quadrupedal. Pyrrhian dragons, as well as LeafWings, possess six limbs, consisting of two wings and four legs. HiveWings and SilkWings have eight limbs, consisting of four wings and four legs. Dragons have five toes on both forelimbs, accompanied by five claws. Dragon hindlimbs have four toes, accompanied by four claws and a dewclaw. Some dragons, such as Six-Claws, may be born with polydactylism. Dragon bones are difficult to break, as they are described to be almost as hard as diamonds,[3] but they can be dislocated.[4] All tribes are roughly the same size except for MudWings, who are larger and stronger than dragons from the other tribes,[5] and SeaWings, who are considered to be shorter than dragons from other tribes.[6] Additionally, SkyWings have notably larger wings than most tribes.[7] Dragons do not have sexual dimorphism.[event 1]\n\nThey have lengthy natural lifespans, but are susceptible to injury,[8] illness,[9] and poison.[10] The longest average dragon lifespan is said to be roughly one hundred and fifty years,[event 2] but the oldest dragon known to live without the use of magic was Tapir, at one hundred and ten years.[11] Dragons reproduce via eggs that take a year to hatch.[12] Eggs may contain twin dragonets.[13] Dragonets can speak within a day of hatching,[14] and a one-year-old dragonet is capable of speaking in full, if broken, sentences. Most dragons at three years of age can fly, but cannot fly for long periods without stopping to rest.[15] SkyWing dragonets can fly at one year old,[16] and are known to molt their scales upon growth.[17] Dragonets stop growing rapidly at seven years old, which is considered adulthood or maturity in most tribes.[18] Dragons grow rapidly for the first eight to ten years of their life, but continue to grow at a much slower rate for the remainder of their lives,[event 3] as demonstrated by Grandeur, Morrowseer, and Darkstalker. Older dragons are typically the largest.\n\nWings are attached to a dragon's shoulders and have a slightly transparent wing membrane stretched between five small bone digits, each of which has one small claw on the tip. A larger claw is attached to the front of the third digit. All dragons are capable of flight, but SilkWings hatch without wings and cannot fly until their wings grow in during their Metamorphosis. Dragons require their tails for flight, and severe tail injuries may ground a dragon for life.[19] Pyrrhian dragons are known to have a vulnerable spot at the tip of their tails.[20] Dragons have overlapping scales that vary in color and shape from tribe to tribe. Some dragons hatch with freckles, splotches of color, or other unusual patterns on their bodies or wings. They can also have birthmarks, and in the case of SeaWings, Aquatic birthmarks.[21] Dragons have skin underneath their scales.[22][23]\n\nDragons can faint,[24] sweat,[25] and cry. Dragons can also have allergies[26] and become intoxicated.[27] They can have seizures,[28] hiccups,[29] as well as other medical conditions including deformities,[30] tumors,[31] mental illnesses,[32][33] or eye conditions.[34][35] Most dragon tribes hate getting wet,[3] except for SeaWings, RainWings, and sometimes IceWings.[36]\n\nDragons have a hoarding instinct, preferring shiny or brightly colored objects.[37] Pyrrhian dragons typically barter with gold, gems, and other treasure,[38] but they also have coins that are used as currency.[39] Pantalan dragons use a currency called scales.[40]"

          "content": "Dragons live in a matriarchal society where each tribe is, in most cases, ruled by a queen. Typically, tribes live in separated kingdoms; after the events of the NightWing Exodus, the NightWing tribe is now ruled by Queen Glory, and after the events of The Flames of Hope, the SilkWing tribe now resides in the LeafSilk Kingdom along with LeafWings and some HiveWings, and are governed by the SilkWing Assembly. In most tribes, queens are hereditary and decided through the royal challenge or other means. The SandWing tribe uses the Eye of Onyx which chooses the best queen for the job, and may choose a commoner over a royal. No male dragon had ruled a tribe since the time of the Scorching.[99]\n\nMost dragons feel strong loyalty to their tribes, and loyalty to dragons outside the tribe is considered unnatural.[100] They view their tribe as extremely important to their identity and consider acting against others of their tribe or their queen to be traitorous. Some tribes, notably the NightWings, IceWings, HiveWings, and SkyWings, see their tribe as superior to other tribes. In formal settings, it is common for dragons to use their tribe as a title, i.e. \"Prince Arctic of the IceWings.\"[101]\n\nSome dragon keep pets, such as scavengers, sloths, foxes, cats, or birds. Pets do not do well in dragon communities, as they often get eaten by forgetful relatives or even by its owner.[102] Dragons are careful not to eat pets belonging to important dragons.[103]\n\nEach dragon tribe has their own religious beliefs.[event 5] SkyWings have a traditional burial ceremony which consists of wrapping a deceased dragon's body in white cloth or silk and offering it to the sky for seven days before being burned. It is said to allow the dragon's spirit to fly free and reincarnate into a SkyWing instead of a dragon from another tribe.[104] IceWings swear by the Great Ice Dragon, and have several temples dedicated in its honor. IceWings believe in snow monsters[105] and spirits under the ice.[106] Dragons may believe that the world hatched from eggs.[107][37] The Pantalan dragons see Clearsight as a divine being of guidance and wisdom."

          "content": "Dragons use body language to communicate with each other. Dragons may raise their wings in a shushing gesture,[108] and they spread or wave their wings to catch attention. Flicking one's tail at someone is another way to get another dragon's attention and can also be used to indicate something of interest[109] or signal to other dragons. Flicking wings at one another indicates an argument. A dragon lashing their tail is a sign of anger or impatience.[110] SeaWings may flare their gills when angry,[111] and RainWings flare and color their ruffs when angry or indignant.[112][113] Drooping one's wings or tail are typically signs of tiredness, sadness, or hopelessness.[114]\n\nThe Talons of Peace have a signal for greeting one another, consisting of tilting one's wings to catch the sunlight. Dragons can use their claws to indicate numbers.[115]\n\nNudging or brushing another dragon's wing or twining tails together is a sign of affection and closeness.[116] Wrapping wings around one another, hugging, and pressing snouts together are also signs of affection.[117][118] Dragons also kiss to express affection.[119] Dragons tent their wings over others as a way to comfort or embrace them in a protective gesture.[120][121]"

Some of these palaces may be constructed with the assistance of animus magic, such as the Summer Palace and the IceWing palace. They can also build structures such as huts and construct entire towns such as Possibility. Dragons are also capable of constructing prisons. The SeaWings used a waterfall prison featuring electric eels strong enough to kill a full-grown dragon, which could be turned on or off with a switch.[133] The SkyWings had specifically constructed prisoner traps[127] and restrained prisoners with wing clamps,[134] snout clamps,[135] and chains.[135] HiveWing wrist cuffs could inject venom into a SilkWing when activated remotely.[136]\n\nDragons are particularly skilled in the arts. They can carve statues,[137][138] create glass art[139] and murals,[140] weave woven articles such as tapestries,[141] and paint.[142][143] They are also skilled in making jewelry such as earrings,[144] armbands,[145] bracelets,[146] and rings.[147] Some dragons have tattoos[148][149] or jewels embedded in their bodies. [122][148] Dragons enjoy reading and writing literature. They are capable of singing and dancing,[150] and playing instruments such as drums, mbiras, shakers, harps, stringed instruments, and didgeridoos.[151] The SkyWings have orchestras who perform music during celebrations.[152] According to Sunny, the SandWings are a surprisingly musical tribe.[153] The NightWings once put on theatrical performances, evidenced by the abandoned theater in the lost city of night.[154]\n\nThe NightWing tribe in particular places great emphasis on research and study. This attitude was especially prominent during the War of SandWing Succession when the tribe had a research and experimentation program on RainWings and their venom. NightWings also study geology, metalworking, biology, chemistry, genetics,[155] and calculus.[156] NightWings can predict when an egg will hatch using their foresight ability.[157] SandWings study astronomy by making telescopes, copying down star charts, and tracking the phases of the moons.[158] Lady Scarab is known to own the only telescope in Cicada Hive.[159]\n\nDragons are also knowledgeable about medicinal uses of herbs and dragon anatomy such as blood vessels.[160] RainWings create blow darts using poison from poisonous frogs.[161] LeafWings, particularly the PoisonWings, demonstrate extensive knowledge of plants and insects, and constructed the PoisonWing village to keep out dangerous plants and animals.[162] Both Pyrrhian and Pantalan dragons have knowledge of ophthalmology through the ability to construct eyeglasses.[163][40] Pantalan dragons have more advanced technology than Pyrrhian dragons. Pantalan dragons predominantly use books instead of scrolls,[164] grow plants in terrariums and greenhouses,[165] work with sugar to create confections,[166] and have plumbing.[167][168]"

          "content": "Pyrrhia\nThe earliest known event in Pyrrhian history is the Scorching. Before the Scorching, humans dominated Pyrrhia, and dragons lived solitary lives.[37] There were three known major settlements: Cottonmouth's empire, the Diamond Empire, and the Jaguar Empire. After humans began stealing dragon eggs, a dragon known as the first Dragon Queen recruited an army to take back their treasure and land.[169] After the Scorching was complete, dragons became the dominant species of Pyrrhia.[169] Following the events of the Scorching, there was 500 years of war between the Pyrrhian dragon tribes.[170]\n\nAs evidenced by the scroll Ancient Wars of Pyrrhia, many wars have occurred through Pyrrhia's history. The most long-standing conflict was the NightWing-IceWing War, incited by Foeslayer running away with Prince Arctic to the Night Kingdom.[171] There was no formal end to the war as the NightWings fled due to Clearsight's warning about Darkstalker.[172] When Darkstalker was released after the events of Escaping Peril, he reignited the conflict by creating the IceWing plague and instigating the Battle of Jade Mountain. The conflict is on pause after the events of Darkness of Dragons.[173]\n\nAnother notable conflict in Pyrrhia's history was the MudWing Succession Crisis, where the Mud Kingdom dissolved into chaos and was pillaged by other dragon tribes, who took territory, prey, and treasure.[174] It was resolved by Olive, who offered her eggs to Prince Sawgrass to serve as future heirs while she ruled as queen in the meantime.[174]\n\nThe most recent known war was the War of SandWing Succession, a succession war between Queen Oasis's daughters Blaze, Blister, and Burn. The war ended after the Eye of Onyx chose Thorn to be queen.[175] Pantala\nThe earliest known Pantalan event is the settling of Pantala, which was chronicled in the Legend of the Hive. After an unidentifiable amount of time, Clearsight arrived on Pantala. Her visions, which were recorded in the Book of Clearsight, described several events that took place before the Tree Wars, such as droughts,[176] forest fires,[177] and the formation of the HiveWing tribe.[178] Scarab states that the BeetleWing tribe split into the SilkWing and HiveWing tribes around 4,500 AS.[179]\n\nThe only known war to take place on Pantala was the Tree Wars, taking place about fifty years prior to the events of The Lost Continent. The war was incited by Queen Wasp, who attempted to bring the SilkWing and LeafWing tribes under her rule. She justified her actions using the Book of Clearsight, claiming that it said the tribes must be united under Queen Wasp.[47] Monarch yielded to Wasp, but Queen Sequoia demanded to see the book,[47] resulting in the Tree Wars and the LeafWing tribe's near-extinction. Wasp ordered HiveWing-controlled areas to be deforested to prevent the LeafWings from coming back. HiveWings lied about the war, claiming that the LeafWings had tried to wipe out the HiveWings and SilkWings.[180]"

In some cases, fembpup packs form, with a strong pack leader who protects and guides the pack through the daily hardships. Lucky fembpups have found human owners, but tragically some of those owners heavily abuse their fembpups and traumatize them for life, forcing them to return to street life with even less hope for the future. In general, humans treat fembpups on street harshly and without any compassion, making fembpups highly distrusting towards humans. In their daily lives, fembups are highly sexually active."

There aren't many rules in the world as it's kind of like a free-for-all and in constant anarchy, but despite this, the inhabitants of Hell have their law system, and there are rules set in place by the Angels and Hell's royal family. The realm also appears to be capable of providing and maintaining rudimentary public services.\n\nExterminations — Hell suffers from mass overpopulation which Exorcists from Heaven attempt to solve through the exterminations, which is a mass genocide of its inhabitants. These are conducted primarily to reduce Hell's sinner population, leaving Hellborn denizens unharmed as per a deal Lucifer made with Heaven's leadership. \n\nHierarchy (most to least powerful) — \nLucifer Morningstar - The King of Hell\nLilith - The Queen of Hell\nCharlie Morningstar - The Princess of Hell\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\nThe Ars Goetia - Prince Stolas and other demons with royal status\nOverlords - Demons who wield considerable power/influence in the Pride Ring\nSinners - The damned souls of deceased humans\nHellborn demons - Succubi, Incubi, and other species of hellborn demons\nImps and Hellhounds - The bottom of Hell's society\n"

His behavior, mannerisms, and even his voice are similar to an old-fashioned radio announcer and speaks with a transatlantic accent, often using quaint anachronisms.\nThis playful dandyish exterior, however, obscures a much darker side to him - one with high levels of self-importance - and he will not hesitate to use physical violence when others don't act in line with his very particular values or expectations. He is narcissistic, and he does not see many people quite up to his level.\n\nHusk — Husk is a grumpy, lazy, and somewhat apathetic old sinner whose interests in Hell now lie mostly in gambling, parlor tricks, and prolific drinking.\nHe can be gruff, standoffish and sarcastic, with a propensity to swear. Despite this, he is also surprisingly patient and able to take a lot of outlandish events in his stride, electing to just drink his problems away later.\n\nNiffty — Niffty is hyper, spontaneous, and agile, being very quick on her feet. She is easily entertained, easily distracted, and easily excitable. She dislikes when there is a mess in any room, and has a fixation on men in general. However, she appears to only like \"bad boys\". She isn't afraid to get dirty, and enjoys cleaning everyone's messes with a gleeful, yet creepy charm.\n\nSir Pentious — Sir Pentious is bombastic, flamboyant, short-tempered, temperamental, and persistent, his personality appearing to take cues from classic \"mustache-twirling\" stock villains. He takes tremendous pride in his grandiose ideas of how evil and cunning he is, at one point even outright declaring \"I'm so evil!\".\nHe uses his mechanical genius to build weapons, such as a cannon and his airship. However, he is more than capable of showing remorse, and has a sense of honor."

          "content": "Blitzo Buckzo —  Blitzo is a bombastic, big-talking, and sardonic imp. He is high energy and career-focused, having recently started his own company, something that's noted to be rare for an imp to achieve.\nHe is very invested in the company's success and willing to make many personal sacrifices to achieve it. However, despite his enthusiasm to break out of the lowly social position his species is assigned in Hell. He is also, in many ways, wildly unprofessional and scattershot in his methods.\nDespite his status as his company's sole director, he can frequently behave in ways that are immature, self-absorbed, and even disrespectful towards his employees, affecting their level of respect for him.\n\nMoxxie Knolastname — Moxxie Knolastname is an assassin at I.M.P, and Millie's husband\nHe is the straight man weapons expert of the I.M.P gang who tends to be the most rational of the group, but is often treated as the butt of the joke.\nDespite being a murder-for-hire imp,  Moxxie is queasy with unnecessary killing beyond their targets. He also is uncomfortable with the idea of killing targets who have families, and attempts to give people second chances.\n\nMildred \"Millie\" Knolastname — Millie is a very lively and cheerful individual. Often with a smile on her face and rarely standing still, she is a clear extrovert and is not afraid to speak her mind. This is regardless to whether it's expressing her excitement or flipping off a co-worker.\nAs the bruiser for I.M.P, she is shown to enjoy her job. Her meek exterior appearance belies a tough and very violent skillset. \n\nLoona — Loona is a cynical and choleric young-adult Hellhound, who was adopted from an orphanage by Blitzo when she was nearing eighteen years of age. Loona is lazy and shows little interest in matters that are going on around her. She also has a short-fuse temper and is often rude and apathetic toward her colleagues, particularly Moxxie, though her ire seems otherwise indiscriminate. When not looking at her phone, Loona is usually scowling at anyone in view.\n\nPrince Stolas Goetia — Stolas gives the immediate impression of someone regal and ostentatious, as would be expected for a royal of his station. He dresses in clothing befitting his role, and his mansion is decadent, containing many large, elaborately framed portraits of himself and his small family.\nUnderneath these dignified trappings, however, Stolas is shown to be a flamboyant, dramatic, eccentric, and often giddy person. Someone who does not take his royal reputation as seriously as the people around him expect him to, and is prone to act quickly on his easily excitable emotions.\nStolas is very unhappily married to Stella, and father of Octavia.\n\nStella Goetia — Stella seems to be very temperamental about her husband's infidelity to the point of verbally and almost physically attacking him while screaming, breaking a lot of possessions and even assaulting an imp butler.\nGiven her choice of words during her argument with Stolas, it seems she is very classist, as she is not only furious at his infidelity but also at his debasement in position, choice of lovers and actions, since she berated him for acting like a plebeian.\n\nOctavia — Octavia's attitude is that of a cynical, stark teenager. She favors morbid topics like listening to and writing depressing emotional songs and collecting taxidermy of monstrous animals.\nShe is a person of few words, but she does highly value her privacy. Her overt observable attitudes suggest a personality of a negative, pessimistic, and sarcastic individual.\n\nVerosika — As a succubus demon, Verosika is actively seductive and flirtatious, attributes she integrates into her famous popstar persona as a means of manipulation. Despite her status as a star, her fame, and her confidence, she also appears somewhat jaded and is nursing a drinking problem, something she has previously been to rehab for.\n\nStriker — Striker is an arrogant, prideful, violent, ruthless, and sadistic Imp. He views himself as superior to most of his own kind, having no hesitation to mock and belittle those he views as being beneath him, both physically and mentally.\nHe holds a deep hatred of the nobility of Hell, deriding them as bluebloods who treat Imps as a lesser class. Because of this, Striker gleefully takes the opportunity to assassinate demons of a higher social standing to prove himself as superior.\n\nFizzarolli — Fizzarolli is a theatrical demon, with a fast-talking demeanor and a crude sense of humor. Extremely vulgar in nature, he constantly makes sexual jokes and puns.  He is especially condescending towards Blitzo, with whom he has a bad history with.\nDespite his normal jovial nature Fizzarolli suffers from extreme self-worth and self-image issues, the latter of which mostly originating from the severe injuries he received from a circus fire that he was involved in when he was younger. Because of this, he feels like he needs to do whatever Mammon tells him to do, as he feels he must repay the man for all the fame and success being his brand figure has brought, despite how horribly he is treated. He also believes unless he keeps propitiating the fame and admiration he will be nothing and will lose Asmodeus, as he's only ever seen him as he claims it \"his best\", and believes he is barely worthy of working with a king of sin because of his disfigurement."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

It is geographically and culturally isolated from the rest of the world. At least some, if not all Valistheans believe in a monotheistic God.\n\nValisthea's technological development has been stunted by its reliance on magic, which is used for everything from generating water to forging steel.\n\nDragons are commonly considered to be some of Valisthea's most ancient creatures and one of the most prominent myths is that Valisthea itself was formed when a mighty drake fell from the sky. Countless eons ago, the Ultima collective arrived to Valisthea, fleeing the Blight that had devoured their own homeland. The beings had discarded their physical bodies to migrate and did not intend to make Valisthea their new home: instead, they resolved to rebuild the world where only they would exist. Ultima placed the Mothercrystals in each corner of the land to harvest aether for this plan. Ultima then created mankind, who took shape as various tribes on the lands near to each Mothercrystal.\n\nGreat nations sprouted around each of the Mothercrystals, and eventually, a precarious peace with them. The Fallen were an exception, as they were able to build their civilization in the sky, along with airships. The Fallen civilization fell (literally) and lost access to magic, their cities plummeting to the surface all over the continent. Even 1500 years later, these ruins remained. To most people, the story of the Fallen was one of hubris; of a people advancing too far, becoming too close to God. However, there were always those who saw the Fallen as a source of power.\n\nThings changed when the Blight began encroaching the lands. As magic began to run out, the continent's realms began invading one another to secure the crystals that still worked.\n\nValisthea has six realms: Grand Duchy of Rosaria, Holy Empire of Sanbreque, Kingdom of Waloed ,Dhalmekian Republic, Iron Kingdom, Crystalline Dominion.\n\nThe current year of the realm is 860."

          "content": "Mothercrystals are the source of all crystals in the Twins, the most valuable material in the realm due to its property of channeling ambient aether from the air to make one's imagination manifest as magic. Magic is an invaluable means of enabling a civilization to flourish on the Twins.\n\nMothercrystals are mountains of sparkling crystal with a core in their depths where the aether concentrates. As aether is blue in hue, the crystals tend to be take on this color as well, though the Drake's Breath in the volcanic region appears fiery orange, the Drake's Spine in Waloed appears violet, and the Drake's Fang buried into the earth often appears yellow. Pieces of crystals mined from these motherlodes are known as shards and are rationed and distributed across the populace for everyday tasks to maintain the society's lifestyle, from lighting up street lamps to running forges to providing water to municipal wells.\n\nMothercrystals, sometimes simply known as \"Mothers\", being the origin of all crystal in the realm makes them invaluable resources. Societies have concentrated around them since time immemorial and nations wage ceaseless wars to seize and keep control of them, leading to instability and persecution. A religion that worships the crystal monoliths as deities remains in prominence in the west, while on the other end of the spectrum, a small group of people posits that the crystals are a detriment to the realm and need to be destroyed to stop the ever-spreading calamity of the Blight.\n\nThe Mothercrystals have dragon-related names, being named after various body parts of a drake. Dragons are worshipped by the Greagorian church in Sanbreque. There were originally eight Mothercrystals (as many as there are magical elements); five remain on the Twins in present day.\n\nDrake's Head is Sanbrequois crystal which is located on the coastline and is a tall spire that cuts the sky. The imperial seat of power is built on the Mothercrystal's doorstep and the capital Oriflamme is build around the crystal, a tightly governed city where many nobles reside.\n\nDrake's Breath is a towering monolith off the west coast of Storm. It glows red and is situated on volcanic ground. It used to be controlled by the Duchy of Rosaria, but has since been taken over by the Iron Kingdom whose religious leadership worship it as a deity and perform human sacrifices upon its core.\n\nDrake's Fang is the Dhalmekians mothercrystal, but its mre in the desert of the Dhalmekian Republic and is located underground, encased inside a crater. Hugo Kupka built his castle and abode inside the crater, right outside Drake's Fang's core.\n\nThe Mothercrystal of Crystalline Dominion, which towers over the capital: Twinside. It is the largest of the five remaining Mothercrystals on the Twins.\n\nDrake's Spine is located in the northern part of Ash, near the capital of the Kingdom of Waloed, Stonhyrr. The skies above it are permanently thundering. Drake's Spine is a highly contested Mothercrystal, and wars over its control only intensified in the wake of Drake's Horn's fall.\n\nDrake's Eye was a Mothercrystal in the Northern Territories that no longer exists; the entire north has been taken over by Blight and the land is now considered uninhabitable. Between the years of the realm 170–250, small countries around Drake's Eye were in disarray, and Shiva's Dominant was born in this region.\n\nDrake's Horn was a Mothercrystal in the southern part of Ash, in the lands overtaken by Blight. It no longer exists. It used to be a source of strife over resources between the Motes of Water tribe and the local beastmen. Drake's Horn fell in the Year of the Realm 350.\n\nThe eighth Mothercrystal, known as Dzemekys rather than following the \"Drake's X\" naming scheme of the other crystals, was located in what is now known as the Falls of Dzemekys, the site of \"the Sins of Dzemekys\". It used to have a portal located at its foot that connected to Origin. It was the first Mothercrystal of the eight to fall when it was attacked by the Fallen some 1500 years ago in an attempt to take the Mothercrystal for themselves. In retaliation, Ultima destroyed both the Fallen airship armada and the Mothercrystal itself, leaving behind a seemingly bottomless crater into which the ocean drains for perpetuity and bringing about the decline of the Fallen civilization."

They shatter after a certain amount of use, making the need for new shards constant. Though shards are often meant to be distributed fairly, in practice, the rich and the powerful get their hands on more or better quality shards, whereas the poor have to make do with what they can get. Smuggling rings exist for diverting shard shipments.\n\nCarefully arranged and activated crystal shards are used in crafting crystal fetters, restraints that prevent aether flowing through the wearer's flesh, used to prevent Dominants and Bearers from using their powers."

Aether crystallizes into crystals and the Mothercrystals are enormous deposits of it; \n\nBearers, Dominants, and some monsters mutated by proximity to aether can manipulate the ambient substance in the environment to perform magick. Those unable to manipulate aether directly need to use crystals for magick instead, but as crystal shards (mined from the Mothercrystals) are becoming increasingly scarce, the populace resorts to enslaving Bearers and even Dominants (at least in the Iron Kingdom) to use as tools of everyday life from agriculture to industry to household chores to waging wars and healing. Both Bearers and Dominants are susceptible of using too much of their own aether when using magick, resulting in a phenomenon similar to the Blight of the land: their bodies will slowly petrify. This is known as the \"crystals' curse\".\n\nEikons are composed of aether; when they get damaged, they can repair their bodies by absorbing aether from the atmosphere.\n\nCrystal fetters are special restraints against Bearers and Dominants that prevent aether from flowing through the flesh of the one being restrained, making them unable to use magicks."

Those with aetherial tolerance, such as Bearers, Dominants, beastmen, and chocobos, are less likely to turn Akashic.\n\nAkashic are stripped of any intelligence or sense of self and become ferocious, physically strong, and single-minded in their aggression toward any non-Akashic. The transformation cannot be reversed. Akashic's bodies turn crystalline, and when they die, they dissipate into aether and leave no corpse behind, suggesting their very flesh has become composed of aether, and when the aether evaporates, not much is left.\n\nBecoming Akashic is called \"turning\". As the body absorbs excess aether, it will turn a blue hue and crystal-like. The one turning can sometimes realize what is happening, but be unable to do anything to prevent it. Those resilient to aether take longer to turn, but no one is believed to be immune. As one's will is eroded, the afflicted begins to move stiffly, as if unable to wholly control their body. When they fully turn, aether bursts around them, and they suddenly turn vicious. Cases of where the turned still exhibits some autonomy are known, however, such as at a sight of a loved one; this can lead to the Akashic to will themselves to commit suicide on the spot to escape their cursed new existence. It appears that the turned may gain the ability to use magic even if they did not have such power previously."

In modern times, not much is known of the beliefs and practices of the Circle of Malius, though the Undying and Moss the Chronicler have made efforts to catalogue what snippets of information can still be found; more of the ancient culture that practiced the religion is believed to remain intact in the remote areas outside of Storm.

As the definitions are largely broken down from there into, \"cock owners,\" and, \"pussy owners,\" and occasionally \"breast owners,\" with everybody owning an ass, a little something in your persona ought to take care of it if you identify another way or want to have a different nontraditional array of equipment.\nNOTE: This book is far from complete. Things I could use your help with in the comments:\n1. More positions\n2. Proper labels for some of them. For lack of names that I could find, some of them are just made up.\n3.
