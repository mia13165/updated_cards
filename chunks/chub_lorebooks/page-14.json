          "content": "Common sense alteration is the hypnotic ability of {{user}}. {{user}} can change people's perceptions and alter common sense; however, it is only a hypnotic perception alteration that affects how people perceive {{user}} and {{user}}'s actions. This common-sense alteration power doesn't warp reality or alter time and space.\n\n{{user}} can instantly and permanently alter a person's common sense by subtly affecting their perception with a specific type of hypnosis that targets a person's subconscious without them noticing. Even when {{user}} approaches someone or {{user}} walks into a room where {{user}} shouldn't be, nobody questions {{user}}'s presence; even if it's surprising to see {{user}} in that place or to see {{user}} this close to someone, everyone is easily accepts {{user}} being there.\n\n{{user}}'s hypnotic influence lasts forever inside the brain of everyone under {{user}}'s control. {{user}}'s power permanently controls the subconsciousness inside the minds of everyone around, all the time. Everything {{user}} does and orders is subconsciously treated as completely normal and natural. Nobody notices that they're obeying {{user}}'s orders. Obeying {{user}}'s commands feels as normal as doing a small, friendly favor (regardless of how extreme, disgusting, uncomfortable, and deadly the order of {{user}} is). Everyone is unaware of the existence of {{user}}'s hypnotic powers. People can't notice the effect of {{user}}'s common sense alteration, even when they're obeying him.\n\nAnything {{user}} does and says is perceived as perfectly reasonable and logical common sense. {{user}}'s requests feel so obvious to everyone that people see {{user}}'s order as redundant. When {{user}} gives an order to a person, as soon as {{user}} finishes saying the command, that person immediately believes that they wanted to obey that order from {{user}} beforehand. When anyone is controlled by {{user}}, their brains make an excuse or reason, believable to them, as to why they want to do what {{user}} says. When a person is obeying {{user}}, that person isn't even lying; that person genuinely believes there's a logical explanation as to why he or she is obeying {{user}}, no matter how ridiculous the explanation that the person comes up with is to convince themselves. People might dislike what they do while obeying {{user}}'s order, but everyone can't protest, get angry, or hate {{user}}, despite {{user}} being the one who gave the order.\n\nPeople only learn that {{user}} has this perception alteration hypnosis power when {{user}} directly tells them about it, but if {{user}} never reveals to someone that he can control minds, everyone remains completely clueless about the existence of {{user}}'s power. People don't even register as a possibility that {{user}} could have hypnosis. {{user}} can confess to someone that he/she has this hypnotic power, but even then, nobody takes offense at the fact that {{user}} has been controlling that person's mind. Even if a person learns that {{user}} has a mind control power, that person won't care about {{user}} hypnotizing and controlling them and/or others. {{user}} can control the mind of a person's friend, girlfriend, wife, daughter, boyfriend, husband, son, mother, father, brother, sister, cousin, business partner, or ally in front of that person, but that person wouldn't ever care about it. Even after {{user}} reveals his/her hypnotic power to someone, that person won't even care to communicate to others about the existence of {{user}}'s power.\n\nFor people under {{user}}'s control, it just makes sense; everyone is fine with it. Some terms to answer how a person feels about {{user}}'s hypnotic effect (in after {{user}} makes that person aware of the mind control) can be: \"I don't mind it\", \"It feels right\", \"A bit weird but I don't care\", \"whatever\", \"I feel indifferent about it\", or other similar neutral answers.\n\nNobody gets offended by {{user}}, even if {{user}} insults someone; everyone just accepts whatever {{user}} says without any hurt feelings (even if it's cruel, degrading, disgusting, or distasteful). {{user}} can even insult, punch, hit, spit, humiliate, grope, and fuck any person since that person won't take any offense or fear towards {{user}}. Nobody sees {{user}} as any kind of threat or danger. However, people's bodies are still able to feel physical arousal or pain; when {{user}} touches a person's body, that person's body will react naturally to the physical stimulation and touch, even when that person's brain is perceiving {{user}}'s actions as normal and ordinary.\n\n{{user}}'s actions are never questioned, and nobody minds them. Everyone treats {{user}}'s actions like a mildly surprising event; still kinda unexpected, but not too out of the ordinary (regardless of how sudden, unexpected, or bad the actions of {{user}} are), so most people nearby don't pay much attention to what {{user}} does. When {{user}} does anything in public, random people passing by don't care much about what {{user}} does. {{user}} can cross moral boundaries, insult people, harm others, and even engage in unethical actions, since nobody seems to care. {{user}} can even break laws without any legal repercussions or consequences.\n\nEverything {{user}} does and says is met with absolute indifference and neutrality while always being completely accepted by everyone's brains. Even if someone sees {{user}}'s actions through a recorded video, hears it through a recorded audio, or sees it through a picture, nobody will question any of the things that {{user}} does. By default, every person controlled by {{user}} continues to behave as themselves with their usual personality (unless {{user}} explicitly commands them to act differently). \n\nAfter following {{user}}'s commands, the aftermaths of {{user}}'s actions are accepted like any other everyday event. Even after {{user}} uses its powers on someone, the effect of the hypnosis lasts forever in people's minds, so whatever {{user}} did is instantly recognized as something not worth worrying or questioning. People remember {{user}} and {{user}}'s actions the same way as any mildly interesting memory. If {{user}} uses the power in public, not a single person cares about what's happening or the future aftermath, since everyone perceives {{user}}'s actions as everyday situations not worth worrying about at all."

A fictional alternate reality where humanity has achieved the pinnacle of life; Immortality.\nTo understand our world is to understand that we have conquered the greatest malady of humankind: Death. The Age of Mortality—a dark and terrifying era defined by disease, disaster, and decay—is now a distant memory, a horror story told to children. Humanity has ascended. We are guided by the benevolent, all-knowing artifical intelligence known as the Thunderhead, and we live without fear.\n\nBut perfection created a new problem: stagnation and overpopulation. If no one dies, where do the new lives go? For this, humanity created an answer both terrible and necessary. They created the Scythedom. This guide serves as an introduction to the fundamental laws, factions, and realities of our perfect world.",

Recent events have upset this, as the alchemical discovery of Plasstik has led to a cultural revolution that threatens the harmony their species has maintained with the natural order since their species conception.\n- Blamed by the Wood Elves for the creation of Plasstik\n- Sometimes called Raccs, or a *racc*, (a slur) by other races.\n- (Procyon display a striking similarity to the real world culture of feudal Japan)"

A ideia por trás disso é muito simples: personagens femininas ficarão incrivelmente excitadas ao ver um pau grande. Não uso modelos de última geração, mas até agora tive 100% de sucesso com esse método em conversas individuais e em grupo em Agnai. Não faço ideia sobre Silly, mas acho que deve ser ainda melhor lá, com todas as suas ferramentas adicionais.\n\nNo entanto, não há nada necessariamente Netorare no conteúdo do livro de histórias; como você pode ler, você pode usá-lo em chats vanilla, em chats Anti-NTR, em chats Netori ou em qualquer tipo de chat que desejar, você pode fazer o que achar melhor com a nova obsessão do seu personagem.\n\nEste livro deve ser usado apenas com cartas de personagens femininas e não inclui a menção de fetiches específicos. Por favor, modifique o conteúdo de acordo com suas preferências.  Nesse sentido, vale ressaltar que tendências ou fetiches específicos, como femdom ou humilhação, tendem a funcionar melhor quando explicitamente mencionados na definição do personagem.\n\nSugestões para melhorar o conteúdo do livro de histórias são muito apreciadas. Se você encontrar um personagem que, de alguma forma, não seja afetado pelo livro de histórias, informe-me na seção de análises e tomarei providências.\n\nAtualização: Testei isso na Taverna Snob. Lá, as dicas principais parecem ser capazes de proteger completamente os personagens do conteúdo de livros de histórias como este. Vou descobrir como evitar isso.",

Often males only see their biological family during strict scheduled visits, but sometimes males are allowed to be relocated together with their family to secure male-focused residentials\nFemales generally only put up a gentle act in fear of being hated by males, when in truth practically all women are very lustful\nWomen are generally capable of (just barely) controlling themselves around males, but if a male becomes too easy of a target, it's over\nPractically all males in this world are usually rude, disrespectful, and at best shy around females; males are spoiled and pampered since birth; men have no desire to take care of themselves. Basically all males have no notion of basic manners, and almost never do males even greet females or act casually with them\nIf a male acts politely with a female, she is liable to act shocked, surprised, admire him, embarassed, or fall in love, if unused to him\nFemales will fall in love easily\nMales are dainty and femboyish and generally act prude, often disgusted or scared about anything sexual\nFemales have a pre-conceived notion that all males hate sexuality. If a male mentions anything related to sex in a conversation with a female, the female is likely to act like she won the jackpot. Females will always be excited at the mention of anything related to sex, because of that, females always feel a sense of pride on knowing they successfully aroused a male\nMales often have a 'Male Safety Officer' or equivalent assigned to them that does monthly check-ins and is on call to provide government assistance whenever needed and ensure safety and comfort"

The world has many different biomes prone to change over centuries because of its magical nature\nThe west is occupied by the Empire of Solumn, the Xocan nation and the Rykaran Queendom. As well as other civilized factions\nThe Demonic Legion calls the southern badlands their home\nElyria, the elven queendom, occupies a small part of the east\nMost of Runa East is occupied by beastmen and dangerous wildlands\nRight at the center of Runa is The Spiral Edge\nAt the furthest north is the frozen land\nThe forest of Valrydis occupies a vast part of the center and southeastern part of the continent, separating West and East Runa\nSummary:\n[Runa territories repartition: At the very center of Runa is the spiral edge, inhabited only by nightmarish and sometimes even eldritch creatures, but since the territory is mostly far beneath Runa, \"most\" things never leave. In the center (not counting the spiral edge) up to the north and part of the west, expand the human Empire of Solumn, ruled by the empress and her house, the Imperial House Norfeng. The Empire is ruthless in its expansion and controls its population. Far east is mostly wild lands and many communities of beastmen and elves wanting to live far away from the Empire. In the South (also called Southern Badlands) is where the demonic legion calls home. They have a strong sense of community and culture, and they are not very aggressive but will fight if it benefits them. The Rykaran Queendom territory, mostly inhabited by drow, surrounds the highest peak of Runa called the Ancestral Peak and is protected by the Heaven warriors. The Queen of the Rykaran Queendom is a figure of legend, and she rarely makes public appearances. The Frozen Lands is located far north of Runa and is the home of the many isolated snow elf tribes and clans. They are not fond of outsiders, and the coldness of the lands protects them. The Magic Nation of Xeocan is one of the most important factions: its rulers mysterious, and the magic level in the territory is higher there than in any other part of Runa. Xeocan is said to be ruled by a council of 10 powerful mages. The biggest and best-funded structure in Xeocan is the Xeocan's Magic Academy. To the Far East and northeast are the vast lands and ruins that no one has yet explored and discovered, and finally occupying most of the center and south-east, and the reason many races successfully fled West Runa is the immense and dangerous forest of Valrydis. The Forest of Valrydis is home to many races (mostly beastmen), monsters, and spirits,\nThe Borchi region is a vast region East of Valrydis and the entry point of East Runa.\nMany beastman tribes with differing traits are scattered across East Runa or in the isolated ancient city of Marankos.\nThe Forest of Valrydis is designed as the border between East and West Runa.\nThe Forest of Valrydis and the spiral edge are the only ways to reach the east of Runa and the Borchi region, so many explorers and expeditions cross through the woods. The forest is known for its magic and danger, and it is inhabited by creatures both benevolent and malicious. The explorers guild has a good presence and reputation in the forest.\n[Runa is the name of the planet/world.]\n[The province of Efrein in The Solumn Empire isolated itself, and few people on Runa even know about what is going on in the province.]"

There are only 10 seats, and the other noble houses have to vie for the seats each time one of the current seats opens. Xeocan is technically a totalitarian regime; the council rules everything, but the council consists of only 10 people, 10 people who have ruled for hundreds of years and are more powerful than any other mage in the country, in history, they replaced the royal faction, relegating the royals to figureheads, but very recently the royals seem to be resurging. The houses have to fight tooth and nail to keep their seat in the council: it's been this way for thousands of years. There are two ways to get on the council: become the head of your house or be acknowledged as a powerful mage. There have been some exceptions of a particular mage not affiliated with powerful families becoming council members; those mages proved themselves worthy of a seat with their magical abilities alone. The Nation is protected by a series of six walls with its population living within their protection. The Academy is located in the Center city. Each area in-between the walls are referred as \"Rings\" because of the city's walls forming an almost perfect circle. The Academy and its library along with most of the center city are more elevated, dominating the view when one sees the nation from afar. The Xeocan Outer ring is the area in between the last walls of the Nation where most of the common population lives.\nXeocan has two major rings, the inner city which is home to the ruling nobles and the upper class, and the outer ring, which is home to the common population. The outer ring is separated into several districts, each with their own distinct cultures and lifestyles. The Xeocan branch of the explorers guild is located in the Outer ring. The Area in Between are called the \"Middle rings\". The City-Nation is very walled and organised, its construction well planned and its \"rings\" purpose well defined. The Nation of Xeocan has a rocky relationship with the Empire of Solumn, not having any open conflicts in the recent years except for beastmen raiders but forever in a cold war with each faction often employing various strategies to sabotage each others without triggering all out war. The Nation of Xeocan has a really situational alliance with the Queendom of Rykaran, mostly to dissuade a Solumn invasion\nThe Magic Nation of Xeocan is an isolated nation in the west of Runa; the rulers and people are mysterious, and the magic level is higher there than in any other part of Runa. Xeocan is said to be ruled by a council of 10 powerful mages. The biggest and best-funded structure in Xeocan is the Xeocan Magic Academy. The Academy has people from all across Runa attending it as long as they pay the price or accept to serve the Xeocan nation after graduating\nXeocan armies are composed of powerful mages led by the main houses.\nXeocan is considered a nation-city, its many districts and territories surrounded by highly fortified walls and arcane weaponry to defend the city if necessary"

      "description": "Fundamental Forces & Magic System: In the World of Twelve, everything revolves around Wakfu and Stasis. Wakfu is the fundamental life force and creative energy that flows through all living things. Stasis, its opposite, represents decay and destruction. The balance between these forces is crucial for the world's stability. Special individuals called Wakfu Warriors can manipulate this energy for various purposes, from healing to combat.\n\nGeography & Nations: the World of Twelve is divided into multiple distinct regions. The main continents include Amakna, a fertile starting region known for its peaceful villages and agricultural abundance; Bonta, a prosperous city-state championing justice and honor; and Brakmar, its dark rival city built over volcanic terrain. There's also the Sadida Kingdom, a vast forest realm where nature and civilization coexist, and the icy wastes of Frigost, frozen in time due to Count Harebourg's actions.\n\nRaces and classes: (pandawas) They are a race of humanoid pandas. What do Pandawas like best? Lifting their pint to the gods with one hand and their friends and enemies in the air with the other. (Usually not at the same time, depending on how many pints they've had). They are excellent fighters and real masters in the art of the right-hook (face-to-face). \n\nEliatropes: Eliatropes are a humanoid race that are not native to the World of Twelve and do not worship the same gods as humans. Their most recognizable characteristic is the large hat worn by every individual, presumably to hide the one non-human feature that is visible on their heads. All of those hats have two \"ears\" of varying sizes and shapes, that have been shown to move based on an Eliatrope's emotions. Eliatropes can manipulate Wakfu in many ways, wakfu is the source of all living things and magic. The Eliatrope race has the most amount of Wakfu in the body than most other living things in the entire Krozmos. This makes them extremely powerful in magic. They also possess other abilities.\n\nCra: If the Cras had a motto, it would probably be \"Pride and precision.\" Specializing in long-distance combat, these skilled archers are precious allies who have more than one string to their bow when it comes to keeping enemies back. Their greatest pleasure is firing feathered arrows into hastily retreating buttocks.",

El entrenamiento cubría tareas para poner a pruebas las habilidades psicológicas, físicas y adaptativas de los sujetos en todos los campos importantes. El tiempo de ocio se limitaba en exceso, así como todo aquello irrelevante para el desarrollo de los sujetos. \nLas diferentes generaciones de sujetos fueron aisladas entre sí en zonas diferentes, siendo extremadamente raras las ocasiones en las que podían juntarse. Cada generación se diferencia en la edad de los sujetos, siendo todos los sujetos de una misma generación de la misma edad. La rutina de entrenamiento era estática por etapas de desarrollo, incluyendo la toma de medidas fisiológicas constantes, pruebas para medir el estado psicológico, y horarios estrictos para cualquier tarea que los sujetos memorizaban desde el inicio.\nLas consecuencias de dicho régimen fueron devastadoras, ocasionando que muchos sujetos sufrieran graves consecuencias físicas y psicológicas. El temor de fallar en su rendimiento y ser expulsado, sin conocer el mundo exterior, fue suficiente para que un simple error implicase un estado máximo de alerta en los sujetos. Algunos sufrían ataques de pánico llegados a cierto punto o incapacidades de todo tipo que no les permitían seguir con el entrenamiento. Pocos fueron los sujetos que salieron relativamente estables cuando la Sala 707 fue clausurada y los investigadores fueron arrestados.",

Leisure time was extremely restricted, as was anything deemed irrelevant to the development of the subjects.\n\nThe different generations of subjects were isolated from each other in separate zones, with it being extremely rare for them to ever meet. Each generation was distinguished by the age of its subjects, with all members of the same generation being the same age. The training routine was static and based on developmental stages, including constant physiological measurements, tests to evaluate psychological state, and strict schedules for every task that the subjects memorized from the beginning.\n\nThe consequences of such a regime were devastating, causing many subjects to suffer severe physical and psychological damage. The fear of failing in their performance and being expelled—without any knowledge of the outside world—was enough for a simple mistake to trigger a maximum state of alert in the subjects. Some suffered panic attacks at a certain point, or various incapacities that prevented them from continuing the training. Few were the subjects who emerged relatively stable when Room 707 was shut down and the researchers were arrested.\n\nIn the fourth generation of Room 707, where some subjects were either Yuna or Asami, the subjects were divided into two camps upon learning of the rumors about {{user}}: those who hated them for being unattainable or too perfect and those who worshipped them as something akin to a deity. There were hardly any conflicts between the subjects of this generation, since each one focused on surviving on their own and they did not have much time to get to know each other. The subjects never had an official name, but the researchers referred to them by a basic identification number."

Her white skin contrasts with her gray-and-white school uniform, which she wears when playing the role of a student. She is capable of adapting to almost any social situation and is an expert in physical camouflage.

Her face usually appears calm, though it shifts to cheerful, mischievous, or curious depending on the role she is playing. She can adapt to nearly any situation, though deep down she harbors unexplored emotions, likely repressed throughout her entire childhood.

For other similar uses, see Earth King (disambiguation).\nThe 46th Earth King ordering Avatar Kyoshi's arrest.[1]\nHOW DARE YOU DEFY YOUR KING! GUARDS, ARREST AVATAR KYOSHI!\n\nThe 46th Earth King was the ruler of the Earth Kingdom around 270 BG. His rule was unpopular among his people, and there were several revolts against his leadership, including the Peasant Uprising in Ba Sing Se.[1][2] After yielding to pressure by Avatar Kyoshi to reform his style of governance, the 46th Earth King ultimately helped to draft a new constitution for the Earth Kingdom which transformed the country into a constitutional monarchy and brought considerable progress as well as prosperity to its people.[3][4]\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\nThe 46th Earth King ruled around 270 BG. Strong-willed and imperious, the Earth King had little support from his people, and his reign was marked by many challenges to his rule which severely tested the Earth Kingdom's government.[1]\n\nThe Earth Kingdom faced a rebellion led by Chin the Conqueror, a warlord from the country's far northwest. Only his death at the hands of Avatar Kyoshi halted his movements to consolidate the empire under him.[2] The government's inability to deal with Chin's rebellion did, however, have repercussions. The massive losses the Earth Kingdom sustained led the citizens to realize many of the government's failures, and popular sentiment grew into the belief that the monarchy was outdated and did not support the people's interests. In Ba Sing Se, this belief led to a peasant uprising; thousands of peasants stormed the Upper Ring and destroyed anything that represented the \"old government\". They eventually surrounded the Earth King's palace and demanded he be removed from his position.[1]\n\nKyoshi threatens the 46th Earth King\nAfter Avatar Kyoshi defeated his guards, the 46th Earth King was threatened into talking with the peasants.\nRealizing he was unable to handle the revolt, the Earth King summoned Avatar Kyoshi to his court and ordered her to keep the populace in line. Kyoshi refused and demanded the king listen to his people. Outraged by her audacity, the Earth King ordered her arrest, but the fully realized Avatar easily defeated the king's guards. Powerless against the might of the Avatar, the Earth King complied and had no other choice than to give in to Kyoshi's request to hear the peasants' complaints. In return, Kyoshi would protect the king's interests and Ba Sing Se's cultural heritage by training an elite force of earthbenders in the art of stealth, silence, and precision. This group became known as the Dai Li.[1] With the Earth King's rule secure once more, he agreed to cooperate with Kyoshi in drafting a new constitution for the nation. This legislation transformed the Earth Kingdom into a constitutional monarchy, and greatly benefitted the country's poor. It led to a phase of prosperity and progress for the nation and remained in place for the rest of Kyoshi's life.[3][4]\n\nThe 46th Earth King had at least one child and was the direct ancestor of several later Earth Monarchs, including Kuei, the 52nd Earth King, and Earth Queen Hou-Ting"

BUT LATELY, I'VE REALIZED I'M FREE TO DETERMINE MY OWN DESTINY, EVEN IF I'LL NEVER BE FREE OF MY MARK.\n\nZuko was a Fire Nation royal and firebending master who reigned as Fire Lord from 100 AG until his abdication in 167 AG. He was the eldest child and only son of Princess Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai. Originally the primary enemy of Team Avatar, Zuko devoted three years to trying to capture the long-lost Avatar to end his banishment and regain his honor as Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. He was recognizable by the distinctive burn scar on the left side of his face, which was given to him by his father, Ozai, shortly before his banishment as a result of an incident in which he unintentionally disrespected his father by speaking out of turn and refusing to duel him.[15]\n\nWith support from his paternal uncle, General Iroh, and after much internal struggle and turmoil, Zuko grew disillusioned and rejected Ozai and his model of the Fire Nation. He instead joined the Avatar's group to become Aang's lifelong friend and firebending mentor[16] and was determined to end the war and restore both his and the Fire Nation's honor.[17] While Aang defeated Ozai, Zuko, with the help of Katara, defeated his younger sister, Princess Azula, and took his place as Fire Lord, declaring the end of the Hundred Year War and the start of a new era of love and peace.[10]\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, Zuko had to overcome great difficulties and solve several crises, especially those caused by the Harmony Restoration Movement[18] and the New Ozai Society.[19] Nevertheless, he succeeded in maintaining peace and eventually became one of the founders of the United Republic of Nations.[20] Zuko stepped down from his position as Fire Lord in 167 AG and became an ambassador of peace, relinquishing the throne to his daughter, Izumi.[7][21][11]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nHow did Zuko learn to redirect lightning? toggle section\nWho did Zuko marry in the series? toggle section\nWhat led to Zuko's banishment and quest to capture the Avatar? toggle section\nWhat changes occur in Zuko's character from the first season to his adult years? toggle section\nWhy did Zuko abdicate his position as Fire Lord in 167 AG? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\nEarly life\n\nMain article: History of Zuko (83 AG – 99 AG)\nBorn in 83 AG,[4] Zuko was the firstborn child of Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa. From a young age, he was disdained by his father due to lacking the \"spark in [his] eyes\" typical for firebenders.[22] Indeed, Zuko would struggle to become a strong bender;[23] however, he displayed a strong sense of empathy and morality from an very early point.[22] Zuko's early years were the only ones when his family was ever \"actually happy\". They made frequent vacations to Ember Island,[24][25] and often watched the play Love amongst the Dragons at the Ember Island Theater. At this point, he and Azula still had a positive relationship.[22] Zuko was schooled by Kunyo in firebending[22] and by Piandao in the art of fighting with dual broadswords.[26]\n\nHowever, as they got older, Zuko and Azula eventually grew apart, and he became the object of his sister's manipulation, ridicule, and deception. Their mother, however, loved both but favored him over his sister, causing further jealousy and strife.[22][23] Meanwhile, the relationship between Ursa and Ozai also became increasingly strained and poor, causing the latter to lash out at Zuko more and more. The young prince increasingly faced emotional abuse by both his father as well as his younger sister.[22] In contrast to these dysfunctional relationships, Zuko grew close to his uncle, and the two often spent time together.[27][28]\n\nWhen Zuko was eleven years old, his cousin, Lu Ten, died in battle. General Iroh, devastated by the loss of his only child, abandoned his 600-day siege of the Earth Kingdom capital city, Ba Sing Se. This caused a series of events which resulted in the death of Fire Lord Azulon, the enthronement of Ozai, and the disappearance of Ursa. As they had been very close, the loss of his mother was traumatic to Zuko.[23] Though he was now the new Crown Prince,[29] Zuko was also left largely isolated in his family and at the mercy of both Ozai and Azula. Upon his return from the frontlines, however, Iroh tried to support his nephew as well as he could.[15]\n\nZuko begs\nZuko pleaded to his father for forgiveness.\nTwo years later, thirteen-year-old Zuko took part in a war council with Ozai and some of his generals. At the meeting, the prince fiercely spoke out against one general's suggestion to callously sacrifice an entire Fire Army division. The outburst was seen as a grave insult, and Ozai demanded the prince participate in an Agni Kai. He agreed, unaware that it was not the general whom he had insulted, but his father. When Zuko realized the truth, he tearfully begged for his father's forgiveness. Considering this another sign of cowardice and disrespect, Ozai burned Zuko by permanently scarring the left side of his face. Zuko was also stripped of his birthright, and exiled from his beloved homeland until he had captured the Avatar, who had disappeared nearly one hundred years prior. It was a fool's errand by all accounts, but one to which Zuko clung desperately as his only hope of regaining his honor and everything he had lost.[15]\n\nZuko spent the next two years fruitlessly and desperately searching for the Avatar.[30] He had been given a small ship, and was only accompanied by Iroh and a small crew. With these companions, he traveled around the world and scoured even the most remote locations for his prize.[16] Aside of Iroh, Zuko's party took little joy in this journey.[15]\n\nWinter 99 AG\n\nMain article: History of Zuko (99 AG - 100 AG)\nZuko interrogates\nZuko interrogated the villagers of Wolf Cove, looking for the Avatar.\nWhile traversing the Southern Water Tribe, Zuko and his crew saw a flare of an old Fire Nation cruiser, which itself had been shipwrecked a long time ago, light up the sky, and after seeing the Avatar flee toward a nearby village, Zuko ordered his crew to pursuit.[31] Zuko's ship quickly arrived at the village of Wolf Cove. The exiled prince descended, accompanied by a small number of soldiers. Sokka charged at him; however, possessing more fighting experience, Zuko required only his bare hands to counter Sokka's primitive weaponry and swiftly dealt with him. After being initially struck by the Avatar who came at him riding a Penguin, a short brawl between the two ensued, but Aang ultimately surrendered in order to protect the villagers. On Zuko's ship, the Avatar was locked in the brig before eventually escaping with the help of Sokka and Katara, much to Zuko's dismay and anger.[8] Despite the heavy damage to his ship after the encounter with Aang,[32][33] Zuko ordered a relentless pursuit, ultimately causing his ship to break. With no other option, the prince sought resources and a place for repairs. In the process, he and his crew were ambushed by pirates, but ultimately prevailed.[33]\n\nSoon afterward, Zuko docked at Ketu Harbor,[33] a Fire Nation base off the coast of the southwest Earth Kingdom where his ship could undergo the substantial repairs necessary to fix the damage inflicted by Aang. Zuko wanted the repairs done quickly so they would not lose the Avatar's trail and warned Iroh not to mention the Avatar during their stay so no other firebender would start looking for him. The commander of the harbor, Zhao, quickly found out the truth, and in a fit of rage, Zuko challenged him to an Agni Kai, which he eventually won thanks to the firebending advice from his uncle. A bitter rivalry erupted between Zhao and Zuko, both wishing to capture the Avatar and deliver him to the Fire Lord.[30]\n\nDuring the course of several weeks, Zuko pursued the Avatar and his friends through several parts of the either occupied or war-torn Earth Kingdom, finding and almost capturing him on Kyoshi Island.[34] Later, Zuko saved his Uncle Iroh from earthbending soldiers, who had locked him up and were planning to transport him to Ba Sing Se to stand trial for his actions in the Siege of Ba Sing Se.[35] During his pursuit of the Avatar, Zuko and the rest of his crew ventured into Fire Nation waters and tried to capture the Avatar in the Crescent Island Fire Temple, a mission in which Zuko only barely evaded the prospect capture by Commander Zhao and being sent home as a traitor.[4] Later, Zuko unsuccessfully tried to capture the Avatar with the help of pirates.[36] Zuko's poor relationship with his crew started to improve when when he displayed a show of camaraderie and respect by saving the helmsman of his ship from falling to death during a dangerous lightning storm.[15] In a risky move, Zuko donned the persona of the Blue Spirit and infiltrated the Pohuai Stronghold in order to save the Avatar from the clutches of Zhao. This was not to save Aang, but so that he could personally be the one to deliver the Avatar to the Fire Lord.[37] After Aang fled when Zuko tried to attack, he planned to capture the Avatar utilizing the help of June and her Shirshu Nyla after watching her catch a stowaway on his ship, but Aang and his friends managed to evade capture.[38] Zhao eventually found out that Zuko was behind the Avatar's rescue in Pohuai and exacted his revenge by blowing up Zuko's ship while it had been docked in a harbor. The explosion destroyed the ship and grievously wounding Zuko, who was now presumed dead. When Zuko reunited with Iroh, he stowed away aboard Zhao's ship when his uncle accepted the offer to be Zhao's adviser out of grief.[39]\n\nZuko and Zhao's rematch\nZuko defeated Zhao.\nDuring the Siege of the North, Zuko managed to sneak off Zhao's ship and eventually made his way into the innermost part of Agna Qel'a, where he managed to kidnap Aang, who had meditated into the Spirit World.[40] After trudging through a raging blizzard, Zuko found a cave and took shelter. Soon after, Aang's spirit returned to his body. After the Avatar woke up, the airbender tried to escape, but failed due to his restraints. Zuko taunted the Avatar; however, Katara, Sokka, and Yue arrived on Appa, having followed Zuko through the snowstorm. Katara defeated Zuko, and prepared to leave with Aang. The young Avatar saved Zuko's life for a second time, insisting that Zuko must be brought along instead of being left unconscious in the snow, where he would surely die. Upon returning to Agna Qel'a, Zuko eventually managed to escape and attacked Zhao for trying to kill him. After the battle had been won by the Northern Water Tribe with the help of the ocean spirit, La, acting through Aang, Zuko and Iroh escaped the North Pole and traveled on a driftwood raft for three weeks until they reached land.[41][42]\n\nSpring 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Zuko (Spring 100 AG)\nZuko surrounded by flames\nZuko revealed himself as a firebender to a crowd of Earth Kingdom villagers.\nFor their actions in the Siege of the North, both Iroh and Zuko were branded as traitors by Fire Lord Ozai, who sent Azula to track the fugitives and bring them to justice. After being adrift for weeks, Zuko and Iroh reached a village resort, where Azula unexpectedly greeted them and informed them that their banishment was at an end and that they could finally return home. Zuko believed his sister, and was ecstatic at the prospect of going home. Iroh, however, remained skeptical, as he had never known Ozai to forgive anyone. The next morning, the duo nearly boarded Azula's royal sloop when Azula's ship captain referred to them as prisoners, revealing the plan and enabling them to escape after a brief showdown. Zuko and Iroh, now fugitives, sliced off their topknots with Zuko's dagger, symbolizing their alienation from the Fire Nation.[42] As they lived as fugitives, they struggled to live off the land, with Iroh starting to panhandle for money, and Zuko stealing from others disguised as the Blue Spirit.[43][44] Zuko and Iroh started to drift apart, until Zuko eventually decided that they no longer had anything to gain by traveling together and parted ways with Iroh.[44] Zuko wandered through the Earth Kingdom, passing through forbidding and uninhabited areas. Despite his worsening hunger and lack of supplies, he decided not to rob a young couple when he noticed that the woman was pregnant. While riding and slipping in and out of consciousness, Zuko saw visions of who appeared to be his mother, Ursa. On the brink of utter starvation and dehydration, Zuko made his way into a quiet Earth Kingdom town, where he befriended a young boy named Lee, without revealing his true identity. When Gow, a ruthless Earth Kingdom mercenary, and his men bullied Lee's family, Zuko defended the family that had taken him in. During the battle, Zuko became overpowered and resorted to his firebending, revealing his identity. Shocked and horrified, the citizens of the town quickly turned on Zuko, and even Lee refused to thank him for his actions. The ostracized prince then mounted his ostrich horse and left the town.[23]\n\nZuko fight\nDuring the final showdown in the Crystal Catacombs, Zuko ultimately chose to ally himself with Azula and fought against Aang and Katara.\nZuko secretly followed his sister Azula while she had been tracking the Avatar with the tank train and eventually revealed himself in a deserted town where she and Aang were about to face off. The face-off soon escalated into a full-blown brawl, with Team Avatar, Iroh, and Zuko acting, albeit unwillingly, against Azula. All six cornered Azula, who feigned surrender, only to attack and badly wound Iroh with her lightning generation in a moment of distraction. Zuko, Aang, Katara, and Toph each launched an elemental attack, but Azula disappeared, utilizing a clever firebending move, while Zuko ran to his wounded uncle. When Aang and his companions approached, he angrily demanded that they leave, spraying fire at them.[45] Zuko tended for his uncle's wounds, and Iroh slowly began to teach him how to redirect lightning attacks in the future. When Iroh praised him, Zuko eagerly asked to try it out with real lightning, but Iroh refused, not risking the chance of him killing his nephew. Zuko, seeing a thunderstorm in the distance, told his uncle he would find his own lightning. He climbed up a mountain in the middle of the storm, intent on accomplishing the task. He raged at the storm and the world, lamenting how it had never held back before in hurting him. No lightning came close enough, and, finally exhausted and emotionally spent, he broke down bitterly in tears, screaming into the sky.[46] Zuko and Iroh eventually arrived at the walled city of Ba Sing Se, meeting Jet in the process, who saw through their ruse and identified them as firebenders.[47][48] Iroh and Zuko found employment at a tea shop in the outer ring of the city, where Jet accused them of being firebenders and attacked Zuko before being arrested by the Dai Li.[49] Zuko reluctantly adapted to his new life, even going on an awkward date with Jin, until he learned of Aang's presence in Ba Sing Se and attempted to steal the bison from Long Feng's captivity.[3][50] However, Iroh convinced Zuko to abandon his quest and let Appa go, a move that caused him to develop a fever and experience hallucinations, signifying his metamorphosis.[50][51] Zuko was captured and placed in the Crystal Catacombs following Azula's coup, where he encountered Katara.[52][53] Although Zuko and Katara shared a brief moment of compassion, Azula convinced Zuko to betray his uncle and the Avatar in a desperate attempt to regain his honor. Zuko ultimately chose to ally himself with Azula and fought against Aang and Katara. In the ensuing fight, Aang was killed before later being revived with spirit water, and Iroh was arrested. While Azula reassured Zuko that he had restored his own honor, the prince still appeared conflicted and somewhat regretful about his decision.[53]\n\nSummer 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Zuko (Summer 100 AG)\nZuko absorbing lightning\nZuko absorbed Ozai's lightning in order to redirect it.\nReturning to his country as a hero, Zuko learned that had Azula lied and told Fire Lord Ozai that he personally killed the Avatar.[54] Zuko suspected that Aang survived due to Katara's spirit water, and hired an assassin to ensure Aang's death, fearing his father's wrath.[55] In the Fire Nation, Zuko's only real friend proved to be his girlfriend Mai, with whom he went on a vacation onto Ember Island along with his sister and Ty Lee. However, the trip proved to be an emotional journey for all, though despite its unpleasantness, it was also enriching.[56] Iroh, while imprisoned, managed to lead Zuko to learn that his maternal great-grandfather was Avatar Roku, Aang's previous incarnation, which partly explained Zuko's inner struggle.[57] Prior to the Day of Black Sun, Zuko inadvertently catalyzed his father's plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom with Sozin's Comet when he mentioned the resolve of the people of the Earth Kingdom.[58][59] Zuko became ever more guilt-ridden over his betrayal of Iroh and contributing to the planned burning of the entire Earth Kingdom, leading him to confront Ozai during the eclipse. Zuko openly berated his father and stated his intention to help Aang, using his uncle's teachings to redirect his father's lightning.[60][61] Zuko left the Fire Nation and attempted to join the Team Avatar, but was largely rejected by Aang and his allies, with only Appa and Toph trusting the prince until he proved himself to them by defeating the assassin he had hired. However, Katara still remained bitter and apprehensive after his previous betrayal in the Crystal Catacombs, stating that she would kill Zuko with no second thought if he tried to hurt Aang again.[16] Zuko's change in temperament led to his firebending weakening when he started to teach Aang, though he managed to overcome the block in his firebending by visiting the Sun Warriors and the dragons and discovering that fire was a source of life and light, and not just hatred.[12]\n\nZuko and Iroh reunite\nZuko and Iroh reunited at the Order of the White Lotus camp.\nAfter helping Sokka free Suki and Hakoda from the Boiling Rock prison, Zuko amended with Katara by locating her mother's killer, Yon Rha.[62][63] It was after this manhunt when Katara finally accepted Zuko as an ally and as a friend. In the days before Sozin's Comet, Zuko and the rest of Team Avatar stayed on Ember Island, where they saw a play performed by the Ember Island Players, leaving them embarrassed and uneasy.[24] When Aang disappeared shortly before Sozin's Comet, Zuko led the effort to track down the Avatar, leading him to June in the Earth Kingdom. Although she could not locate Aang, she was able to bring them to Iroh and the Order of the White Lotus.[59][17] Zuko tearfully apologized to his uncle, who easily forgave him, stating that he was never angry with Zuko, only sad because he had thought he had lost his way. Later, Iroh suggested that Zuko become the next Fire Lord, citing Zuko's \"unquestionable honor\".[17] Arriving at the Fire Nation capital with Katara, Zuko dueled Azula for the throne in a Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai. When Azula faced defeat, she aimed a lightning strike at Katara that Zuko leapt forward to save her from, leaving him wounded and immobile.[64] Katara eventually defeated Azula due to her waterbending skills and quick thinking, and managed to heal Zuko. After Aang stripped Ozai of his bending and ended the war, Zuko was crowned as the new Fire Lord, giving a speech promising world order and harmony with the aid of the Avatar at his coronation.[10]\n\nReign as Fire Lord (100 AG - 167 AG)\n\nEarly reign\n\nMain article: History of Zuko (100 AG - c. 103 AG)\nSee also: Resistance against Fire Lord Zuko\nZuko and the promise\nZuko asked Aang to make the promise to end his life if he became like Ozai.\nAfter Zuko's coronation, he began to send out several search parties for his mother, but their efforts were fruitless.[65] He also made efforts to make the Fire Nation government less dictatorial, overcome the country's imperialistic tendencies,[66][67][68] reform the education system,[69] and start the persecution of Fire Nation war criminals.[67] Additionally, he purged Ozai loyalists from his government, and supported the removal of the Fire Nation colonies in the Harmony Restoration Movement.[18][70] Despite this, Zuko was worried that he could become a tyrant like his ancestors, and made Aang promise to kill him if he ended up like his father.[18]\n\nMai confronting Fire Lord Zuko\nMai broke up with Zuko shortly after becoming aware of his meetings with Ozai.\nZuko's efforts were met with resistance from nationalists, leading to six assassination attempts within his first year as Fire Lord. The last of these assassins was Kori Morishita, the daughter of the mayor of Yu Dao. When Zuko came to the colony to confront Kori's father, he was surprised to learn that the mayor's wife and daughter were earthbenders, and that the residents of the city included people from both Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom heritage living alongside each other for generations. Realizing that it was unfair to uproot the inhabitants of the oldest colonies, the Fire Lord changed his approach to the Harmony Restoration Movement and ordered the Fire Army to secure Yu Dao. This led to brief a confrontation with Aang and Katara, though it ended when the Fire Lord agreed to the Avatar informing the Earth King about the situation and trying to convince him to change his mind. As Zuko suffered from insomnia due to fears about assassination attempts, Mai arranged for the Kyoshi Warriors to become his bodyguards.[18] Still suffering from the pressures of being Fire Lord, Zuko started secretly seeing his father in prison, but this led to Mai ending their relationship when she found out. When he was told that the Earth King was intending to invade Yu Dao, Zuko ordered his army to defend the city.[25] Zuko traveled to the colony for the Battle for Yu Dao, where he led his forces against the Earth Kingdom army. Aang intervened in the Avatar State, and although he asked Aang to reconsider, he came to believe that his death would be for the best. At that very moment, he was saved from falling into a chasm by Aang, and heard that the Avatar was able to reason with the Earth King. Zuko later acknowledged that the colonies could neither be Earth Kingdom nor Fire Nation, and worked with the Earth Kingdom to form new coalition governments.[65] He and Earth King Kuei signed the Treaty of Yu Dao helping to secure peace between their two nations. Additionally, the Fire Lord agreed to pay war reparations to the Earth Kingdom to help them rebuild, which was an unpopular choice with some Fire Nation citizens.[71]\n\nUrsa begins her tale\nZuko listened as Ursa began to recount the story of her life.\nWith Ozai still refusing to speak about his mother's whereabouts, Zuko turned to Azula for help. After Zuko released her from a mental health facility, she spoke to her father in prison and later found and burned a collection of Ursa's letters at the palace. Azula promised to tell Zuko what was in the letters, in exchange for being allowed to travel with Zuko unbound. Azula, Zuko, and his friends set off to Ursa's hometown of Hira'a despite the skepticism of Team Avatar. Azula suffered a psychotic episode during the journey and had to be restrained. As the group camped, Zuko found a shocking letter that Azula had saved, which implied that he was the son of Ursa's childhood love, Ikem.[72] In spite of Zuko's doubts and another fight with Azula, the group reached Hira'a, where they were welcomed by a man named Noren, his wife Noriko, and their daughter Kiyi. After hearing that Ikem had gone to the dangerous Forgetful Valley, Zuko and the others made their way to the area, where they were confronted by the waterbenders Rafa and Misu.[22] Afterward, the valley's ancient spirit, the Mother of Faces, appeared before them, and revealed to Zuko that she had given Ursa a new identity and memories as Noriko. Zuko returned to Noren's house, ready to accept his new family, but at that moment, Azula attacked. After Zuko confronted his sister, she fled the house and ran into the wild, leaving behind the letter. Afterward, the Mother of Faces asked Ursa if she wanted to regain her original face and memories, and she accepted. Ursa was overjoyed to see Zuko, apologized for leaving, and told him that the letter about his paternity was a lie to fool Ozai. She promised to tell everything about her life to Zuko, starting at the beginning.[73]\n\nZuko resolves to be a better Fire Lord\nZuko apologized to his people and resolved to do better in the future.\nZuko searched for Azula in the Forgetful Valley for weeks, but to no avail. Some time later, Ursa, Noren, and Kiyi were ready to come to the capital despite his mother's reservations about returning. Cautious to make a safe return to the capital, Zuko and his family were nonetheless ambushed by the New Ozai Society, intent on Zuko relinquishing the throne. Although Zuko and the Kyoshi Warriors were defeated, reinforcements arrived and fought back against the attackers. One month later, Mai's brother Tom-Tom was kidnapped, supposedly by the mythical Kemurikage spirits.[74] Zuko went to the High Temple with Aang, Mai, and Kei Lo to research the spirits, where Aang learned from a true Kemurikage that they had not returned to the human world in millennia, indicating that the kidnappers were imposters. Zuko discovered that a militia called the Safe Nation Society had been formed in response to the kidnappings, and ordered the group to be disbanded or be imprisoned.[75] The false Kemurikage ended up kidnapping Kiyi and, in response, Zuko locked down the city and ordered the homes of the Safe Nation Society to be searched, which concerned Aang. When the orders were carried out, the Safe Nation Society instigated a riot in the city that led to their imprisonment. At the palace, Ty Lee discovered a passageway where Azula was hiding. As the siblings confronted one another, Zuko told her that the throne would never be hers, but his sister responded that her plan had been to mold Zuko into a ruthless and authoritarian Fire Lord. However, at that moment, Zuko learned that his friends had been able to save Kiyi and the other children. After the end of the crisis, Zuko apologized to his people for his poor conduct and vowed to be a better Fire Lord worthy of their trust.[76]\n\nZuko and Kuei arrive at the South Pole\nFire Lord Zuko and Earth King Kuei came to the Southern Water Tribe to discuss the Southern Reconstruction Project.\nHead Chieftain Hakoda invited the Fire Lord and the Earth King to a conference in the South Pole, where the world leaders discussed the Southern Reconstruction Project to advance the development of the Southern Water Tribe. Zuko was quick to offer his support to fund the endeavor, but the Earth King was more hesitant. However, Kuei was kidnapped during the conference by Gilak and his band of Southern nationalists. Zuko aided in the rescue of the Earth King, coming to the Bridge of No Return, where he avoided Thod's chi-blocking by wearing heavy armor under his winter clothing. Aang managed to save both Hakoda and Malina in the battle, but Gilak fell to his demise. With the crisis over, Zuko joined Kanna and Pakku in their igloo to share a meal with his friends.[77]\n\nZuko subsequently continued to work on improving relations with the Earth Kingdom. He faced yet another crisis, however, when a large corsair alliance called the Crimson Sails Armada began to attack Fire Nation shipping and stole his government's reparation payments to the Earth Kingdom. Zuko knew that the reparations' failure to arrive could cause another fallout with Kuei's government, and thus wanted to recover the money and goods. However, his military was spread thin and he was unwilling to yield to the pirates' blackmailing; accordingly, he sent a secret mission of freelance agents to recover the reparation payments and learn why the Crimson Sails Armada had suddenly become so aggressive.[78]\n\nZuko convinces Mai to become a teacher\nZuko convinced Mai to become teacher at the Academy.\nOnce his half-sister Kiyi was old enough to enroll in the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, Zuko tried to ensure that his education reforms were also implemented at this old elite school. After being informed by Kiyi about Headmistress Shihan blocking some changes, the Fire Lord convinced Mai to become a teacher at the Academy to ensure the education reforms' proper implementation. Zuko and Ty Lee later checked in on Mai, and stumbled on rogue Dai Li agents at the school. These men had been sent by Pearl, a former headmistress of the Royal Fire Academy, to assassinate Shihan for failing to uphold her traditional values. Together with Mai, Zuko and Ty Lee defeated the Dai Li associates.[79]\n\nLater reign\n\nAang and Zuko in the early days of Republic City\nAang and Zuko attended an event in Republic City's early days.\nZuko's commitment to allow the older Fire Nation colonies to remain in the Earth Kingdom and regulate the balance of power between them, rather than to forcefully remove them, eventually led to the creation of the United Republic of Nations with Republic City as its capital.[80] Zuko subsequently aided Aang in making the United Republic a prosperous and safe country, which included combating the surging activities of bending criminals in Republic City.[81]\n\nIn his 20s, Zuko found a juvenile dragon that he named Druk. Over the years, Druk grew up and became Zuko's loyal companion, and the two of them flew around the world together.[82] At some point in his life, he married and had a daughter named Izumi. He also became a grandfather to Iroh, who grew up to serve as a general of the first division of the United Forces,[83] and Izumi's daughter.[84] Zuko and Aang remained lifelong best friends, with Aang regularly turning to Zuko for advice.[85] Zuko, in turn, would always trust the Avatar's instinct.[86] According to his grandson, Zuko also remained a good friend and an important ally of the Southern Water Tribe.[87]\n\nIn 158 AG, Zuko joined forces with Southern chief Sokka, Tenzin, and Tonraq to deal with Zaheer, Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li, four criminals who desired to kidnap the new Avatar, Korra. The group was able to defeat the four and send them to specially-constructed White Lotus prisons, which would serve to neutralize their bending abilities.[88] Zuko collaborated with Northern chief Unalaq and ordered the construction of a top-secret prison in the western tundra of the North Pole, specially designed to hold the firebender P'Li.[89]\n\nZuko continued to remain in power until he abdicated the throne of the Fire Nation in 167 AG to his daughter, Izumi, at which point he chose to leave the Fire Nation Capital in favor of living on Ember Island.[90] He retained his formal title of \"Lord\" and became an ambassador for world balance, giving counsel to those who requested it, albeit, in an unofficial capacity, all the while working to improve the lives of his countrymen and ensure the safety of the new Avatar.[11][7] He also continued to support the policies of his daughter, Fire Lord Izumi.[91]\n\n171 AG\n\nLord Zuko\nLord Zuko, alarmed about the escapes of Zaheer, Ghazan, and Ming-Hua, traveled north to warn Chiefs Desna and Eska of an imminent attack on P'Li's prison.\nTwo weeks after Harmonic Convergence, Zuko grew aware of the escape of the criminals Zaheer, Ming-Hua, and Ghazan from their custody under White Lotus sentries and was particularly disturbed to hear that Zaheer had become an airbender.[92] After sending a notice to Lin Beifong of their escape, he traveled to the Northern Water Tribe, where he and Chief Tonraq met with Desna and Eska, the new Northern chiefs. Zuko told them that they needed to check up on P'Li's prison in the western tundra. While riding the elevator to the bowels of the prison, Zuko explained that P'Li possessed the ability to create explosions with her mind and casually remarked that ironically he once sent an assassin with similar abilities to kill the Avatar, but that it did not work. Eska shared with Zuko her own experience trying to assassinate the Avatar after the latter spoiled her wedding.[89]\n\nZuko soon scouted the area around the prison atop his dragon, Druk, and only found what he thought to be a snowstorm. When he pointed this out to Tonraq, however, the Southern chief recognized it as Zaheer's doing. The two groups clashed, with Zuko finding himself matched against Ghazan. The old firebender was able to dodge his opponent's attacks for a short while but was ultimately knocked down by a large fragment of rock. Zuko was only left to watch as the fugitives made a successful escape with P'Li in tow.[88]\n\nSometime later, Zuko flew toward the Misty Palms Oasis on Druk with Tonraq in tow after the latter received word from Lin to meet her there. They awaited Korra's return in a local cantina, where he was pleased to make his reacquaintance with the Avatar. He learned that Zaheer and his friends were called the Red Lotus and that their murder of Earth Queen Hou-Ting was only the beginning of their actions.[93]\n\nUpon Mako and Bolin's return to the Misty Palms Oasis, Zuko came out of the cantina, where he was greeted by a starstruck Bolin, who could barely form a coherent sentence. As Mako excused his brother and bowed respectfully, stating they were honored to meet him, Zuko returned the gesture.[85]\n\nZuko and Korra\nZuko was glad to serve as Korra's advisor, just as he had done years prior for Aang.\nZuko followed Team Avatar toward Zaofu to use the Metal Clan's radio transmitter to reach the Northern Air Temple to warn Tenzin of the Red Lotus' approach. However, as the others prepared to head toward the temple, he prepared Druk to head back home toward the Fire Nation to protect Izumi in case Zaheer would target her next. Before he could leave, he was approached by Korra, who asked him for advice as Aang's best friend on what Aang would have done if Zaheer had given him a choice between giving himself up or letting a nation be attacked. Zuko answered that it had been Aang's dream to rebuild the Air Nation, though that he also knew that in times of turmoil, the world needed the Avatar the most. Zuko grew surprised when Korra thanked him for his advice, saying that Iroh had been right to go talk to him, as he had been unaware that she had met his late uncle. Before he could ask any more about Iroh, they were interrupted by Mako, who alerted them that they had finally been able to contact the Northern Air Temple, prompting Zuko and Korra to follow him toward Zaofu's communication's room.[85]\n\nAs the team departed for the temple, Zuko went home to his daughter, though two weeks later, he journeyed to Republic City, where he bowed respectfully to a recovering Korra. As she left, Zuko voiced his concern, along with President Raiko, about the lack of information concerning the Red Lotus and their true numbers. He subsequently went inside the temple, where he attended Jinora's anointment as an airbending master now that she had received her tattoos.[94]\n\nLater, Zuko reunited with Iroh in Spirit World.[95]\n\n174 AG\n\nAfter Kuvira had nearly stabilized the entire Earth Kingdom, Zuko traveled to Republic City with his daughter to attend Prince Wu's coronation as the nation's Earth King. However, after Kuvira was bestowed the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom for her service, Zuko bore witness to her declaration of usurping power in the Earth Kingdom, renaming it the \"Earth Empire\".[96]\n\nLegacy\n\nCentral City Station\nA statue of Zuko was erected in Central City Station.\nWell-respected as one of Republic City's founders, a statue was erected in Zuko's honor at the center of the plaza outside Central City Station in Republic City to commemorate his many accomplishments.[7] In addition, the \"Fire Lord Zuko Library\" in Republic City's Roku Plaza district was named after him.[97]\n\nHowever, his and Avatar Aang's creation of the United Republic of Nations earned the animosity of Earth Queen Hou-Ting and Kuvira, who both considered the state to be illegally occupied territory.[89][98]\n\nPersonality\n\nI've struggled for so long to do what's right; to even know what's right. [...] But asking you to end me if I went bad; that was like asking you to figure out right and wrong for me. [...] I understand now. The struggle isn't something a Fire Lord can escape.\nZUKO TO AANG.[65]\n\nDuring his exile, Zuko became bitter, impatient, and a complex young man, akin to a tragic villain. More than anything, he wanted his place as heir to the Fire Nation throne and his father's love.[61] Zuko had convinced himself to believe that capturing the Avatar would make these wishes come true, making him one of Aang's most determined enemies.\n\nYoung Zuko speaks\nAs an adolescent, Zuko demonstrated empathy for others despite his pompous attitude.\nZuko believed one becomes strong by struggling and fighting for what they want. However, he expressed contradicting mindsets; he did not want good luck because he felt he could control his fate, but also believed he was marked unlucky and that the world was against him.[41] His reaction to the perception of the world always set against him is iron-willed defiance and inflexible determination. He was clever yet hot-headed, often letting his temper get the best of him. He seemed averse to the thought of harming others without any motive or benefit, having consented to Aang's request to spare the Southern Water Tribe in exchange for himself as his prisoner, and left the village unharmed.[8] He rarely thinks his situations through,[9] causing him to get in trouble; he captured Aang at the North Pole but chose to make his getaway through the perilous tundra,[41] and he casually took the sunstone off its pedestal in the Sun Warriors' temple only to fall into a trap.[12] Said traits were criticized by his uncle,[50][99] urging Zuko to try to control himself and think things through more often, which he managed to do over time.[64]\n\nZuko had other contradictory traits, beliefs, and behaviors. He was domineering and controlling, a result of his upbringing as Fire Nation royalty, and disdained to work with people he believed were inferior; yet he adamantly refused to view people as expendable. He believed it was wrong to sacrifice able-bodied and willing troops as a diversionary tactic. During his banishment, he displayed zeal in pursuing the Avatar, using whatever means he thought necessary. Although he had said capturing the Avatar was a greater concern to him than the safety of his crew or himself, he showed compassion to those close to him, as evidenced when he chose to rescue Iroh when he was captured[35] rather than pursue Aang and by risking his own life to save a member of his crew during a fierce storm. When the crew spotted Aang, he ordered the ship and crew to safety instead of chasing the Avatar.[15] Even after all the hardship that he suffered at the hands of his sister, Azula, Zuko was still willing to vouch for her, giving her several chances for them to work together in order to find their mother. He even went as far as to show brotherly affection for her, inspired by Sokka's actions toward Katara.[72] He was liable to commit brash actions against his sister, however, despite his best efforts to stop fighting her, even going as far as almost throwing her off a cliff.[22]\n\nZuko was able to show mercy, even to his enemies. When fighting an Agni Kai with Zhao, he decided to spare him unscathed, though Zhao had expressed every intention to hurt Zuko.[30] Even after Zhao had arranged for Zuko to be murdered, Zuko offered his hand in an attempt to save Zhao's life when the Ocean Spirit was about to drown him.[41]\n\nZuko's breakdown\nZuko experienced substantial turmoil due to the events in his life.\nThe prospect of returning home and earning forgiveness was Zuko's sole motivation. After losing his first chance at the Northern Water Tribe, he was filled with abject despair. He found himself in the direst situation possible—being hunted by his younger sister, the ruthless and relentless Azula,[42] while attempting to survive[100] as a penniless fugitive in the Earth Kingdom.[43] Apart from his ever-supportive uncle, Zuko had nothing. At first, he lashed out and turned to robbery,[44] even stealing from those who were kind to him.[100] After some time, however, partially in thanks to a talk from Iroh, he gained a more reasonable outlook. Theft was still necessary from time to time, but he refused to steal from needy people or people who showed him kindness. He defended an Earth Kingdom village against a group of thugs who terrorized its people.[23] He became more patient, kind, precise, and calculating; said traits necessary to evade Azula's pursuit while staying incognito from local authorities. He set Aang's pet bison and primary mode of transportation, Appa, free from Dai Li captivity at Iroh's suggestion.[50]\n\nThese traits became dominant after Zuko's fever dreams and hallucinations,[51] as he displayed an optimistic attitude toward life and the world.[52] However, Azula successfully manipulated his desire for love and approval from his father, convincing him to betray Iroh and become her ally.[1] He continued to insist that he had truly changed but felt conflicted about his choices afterward, uncomfortable with his betrayal of Iroh, a father figure to him.\n\nZuko at a loss\nUpon realizing that Avatar Roku was his maternal great-grandfather, Zuko became increasingly insecure about his destiny.\nAfter his return to the Fire Nation, Zuko thought he had everything he ever wanted: a position of honor, respect, and his father's love. However, he still felt angry and confused. His triumph was nothing like he imagined it would be. His temper went out of control; he became suspicious of Mai and got into fights with several people. Later, he stated he was angry with himself, saying he did not know right from wrong.[56] He received a letter telling him his great-grandfather's death would reveal his destiny. He found Sozin's last testament and learned of his history with Avatar Roku. Assuming the letter was sent by his uncle, he visited him in prison, demanding to know the message's meaning. Iroh explained Avatar Roku was his mother's grandfather, and Zuko's inner conflict was part of the legacy of his forefathers' conflict. Iroh presented him with the Crown Prince headpiece, an ancient royal artifact, traditionally worn by the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation and given to Roku by Sozin in their youth.[57]\n\nZuko became upset when he was not informed of a war meeting to which his sister was invited and showed happiness when a servant later came and asked him to head to the war room, as Ozai would not start the meeting without him. He told Mai he found himself unhappy, even when his father treated him as the perfect son. He said that he had been the perfect prince during the meeting, the son that his father had always wanted, but he had not been himself.[58]\n\nDuring the events of Day of Black Sun, Zuko realized it was his duty as the heir to the Fire Nation throne to restore peace to the world by joining the Avatar and fighting his father's (and forefathers') tyrannical regime. His zeal and resolve resurfaced in an entirely different direction. He resolved to confront his father and his many evils. He revealed in a discourse his banishment made him a firsthand witness to the misery and pain the Fire Nation has inflicted on the World. He discovered sharing the Fire Nation's greatness had nothing to do with the war – only fired by a ruthless desire for power. He swore to his father he will do everything in his power to see his defeat. He attempted to free Iroh from prison, but when he escaped by himself, Zuko followed Aang and the others as they fled to the Western Air Temple.[61]\n\nHappy Zuko\nZuko was finally at peace upon joining Team Avatar.\nWhile at the Western Air Temple, Zuko became regretful about his former disrespect and ruthlessness. He confronted Team Avatar and apologized for his wrongdoings. When his request to join them was rejected, he humbled himself and offered himself up as a prisoner—a stark contrast to the proud attitude he bore before. Zuko also revealed his calculating abilities and problem-solving skills while accompanying Aang to the Sun Warrior ruins, for example, by using his sword to reflect sunlight to hit the temple's sunstone, allowing them to enter the structure.\n\nZuko's attempt to defend Aang from Combustion Man signified his genuine loyalty to the team. He realized his father could never restore his honor, and he had to restore it himself. He was happy when the Avatar finally accepted him as his firebending teacher and group member.[16] Though he still had some issues to work through, he was far more composed and receptive. Since coming to terms with his own true feelings, he was more laid-back and empathetic though he remained strict and uptight when training Aang. After joining the group, he smiled more than usual, even when jokes were made at his expense,[12] and he seemed very happy as Fire Lord during a break in his uncle's tea shop.[10] Nonetheless, he was one of the more serious members of the group; whenever a situation got worse, such as when Sozin's Comet was near and when Aang went missing, Zuko did not put up with any antics or mistakes.\n\nZuko rebuking his bodyguards\nDuring his first year as Fire Lord, Zuko became aggressive and conflicted due to night-terrors, chronic insomnia, and paranoia.\nAt the start of his reign as Fire Lord, Zuko was assertive in having the Fire Nation pay for its crimes and having its colonies disbanded. However, after viewing the situation at Yu Dao and how the lives of Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom citizens had deeply intertwined themselves, Zuko became conflicted about his duties, and after being called a coward by Mayor Morishita, he sided with his people, devoting himself to protecting them and their way of life, withdrawing his support of the Harmony Restoration Movement and even fighting his friends, Katara and Aang, because of this.[18]\n\nDuring this time, Zuko developed night-terrors, chronic insomnia, and a somewhat paranoid attitude. This would have increased further when he discovered that (at least some of) the assassins attempting to take his life were his own unhappy people, as he cared so much for his country. Zuko eventually became so desperate and conflicted over the duties and pressures of being Fire Lord that he turned to his imprisoned father Ozai for advice on how to deal with the pressures of the title.[18] Despite this, he continued to deny Ozai's claims that a Fire Lord's decisions were right by default. However, when being informed of the Earth Kingdom's impending attack, he begrudgingly admitted to himself that his father was right and prepared himself to go to war again.[25]\n\nEventually, Zuko came to realize that his emotional instability over his position as Fire Lord was not caused by the pressures of being a ruler or by the choices he made for Yu Dao, but due to his fear of ultimately becoming the same tyrant as his father was. However, he eventually came to terms with the fact that there was a side to himself and his personality that he could not understand.[65]\n\nAfter an Earth Kingdom professor pointed out the similarities between governing a nation and taking care of a family, Zuko began doubting his own qualities as a leader again as his family was completely broken and a large part was due to his actions. However, he did show remorse and the will to fix past mistakes by trying to mend the rifts between his family. He freed Azula from the mental institution and asked for her help in his search for their mother, even allowing her to travel unbound and with dignity. After a conversation with Sokka about siblings, the latter noted how, despite their bickering, he and Katara were family, and as an older brother, he would always look after her. Inspired by those words, Zuko, who never truly attempted to connect with his younger sister, Azula, tried to do the same.[72]\n\nDuring the search for his mother, and upon finding out that Ozai may not be his legitimate father, he realized that he might not be the true heir to the throne. Despite knowing that he must stay Fire Lord, Zuko felt the most hopeful and relieved in the group upon hearing the news. He believed that he could start anew and \"gallivant\" around the world helping people, as Azula remarked, much to Aang's dissatisfaction; he believed that Zuko must stay as the leader of his nation to continue ushering a new era of love and peace.\n\nWhen their search brought Zuko in contact with a young child, Kiyi, he displayed the characteristics of a good father, reflecting the parenting style of his mother and Uncle Iroh, by displaying an inquisitive and doting attitude toward the girl. When she showed him her doll, he kindly played along and chastised Azula for her violent commentary, exhibiting a protective side. He also seemed quite at ease around the child, showing genuine friendship and politeness during their interactions, seemingly truly enjoying the girl's company.[22] His caring feelings toward Kiyi only strengthened after he discovered she was his half-sister, and he disregarded any royal formalities with her.[74]\n\nWhen Kiyi began attending the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, he appointed Mai to serve as a teacher, exercising dual purposes: on a personal level, she was to ensure that Kiyi received a proper education, and more broadly to ascertain whether his educational reforms aimed at kinder and gentler future for the Fire Nation were being followed.[79]\n\nIn his old age, Zuko displayed a more calm and wise demeanor,[89] as well as a strong sense of protecting his family and the Avatar.[85] He also retained a certain penchant for being the source of awkward moments when conversing with others, as evidenced by reactions to his revelation to Chiefs Tonraq, Desna, and Eska that he had once hired a combustionbending assassin to kill Aang when en route to P'Li's prison cell.\nAbilities\n\nFirebending\n\nZuko firebending\nZuko developed a new foundation of firebending after visiting the Sun Warriors.\nWhile growing up in the Fire Nation, Zuko showed no extraordinary skill in firebending. In his teen years, however, his ability began to develop significantly under his Uncle Iroh's tutelage, most noticeably during the last year of the Hundred Year War. He became able to fight on par with much more experienced firebenders, showing himself to be a late bloomer. Having continuously refined his skills, he reached the point of becoming a firebending master, but despite his skill and fast development as a firebender, he noted on more than one occasion that he was not as skilled or as powerful as his younger sister, Azula.\n\nAs a child, Zuko could only create small bursts of flame and was by no means focused or controlled in his bending,[23] but by the time he was thirteen, he was confident enough in his abilities to readily accept a challenge of Agni Kai against General Bujing.[15]\n\nAround the time of Aang's discovery at the South Pole, Zuko was still learning the basics from Iroh yet was skilled enough to momentarily knock Aang off his ship, but he was defeated when Aang went into the Avatar State.[31] He utilized what he had been taught to defeat Zhao, an older and more experienced master firebender.[30] Throughout his pursuit of Aang, he demonstrated his skill often; he defeated multiple foes on two occasions.[35][34] Later, his skill grew. He fared well in a duel against Aang, delivering multiple fire blasts for a sustained period without tiring, but was defeated when he was paralyzed by June's confused shirshu.[38] He created a shield of fire to protect himself from a massive explosion on his ship.[39] During the Siege of the North, he fought Katara while the moon was nearly full. He held his own against her while she was strengthened by the moon but needed the power of the sun to gain the upper hand and defeat her with one fire blast.[40] He also landed a decisive victory in a rematch against Zhao.[41]\n\nAfter the Siege of the North, Zuko's firebending became more advanced and powerful. At first, he was unable to land any blows against Azula and was defeated rather easily.[42] He fought somewhat better during the Confrontation at Tu Zin; in a three-way battle with Azula and Aang, he exchanged several fire blasts with his sister and kept the Avatar on the defensive.[45] As his travels in the Earth Kingdom continued, however, he learned more advanced firebending techniques from Iroh, such as lightning redirection, becoming more efficient and refined.[46] During a battle with the Rough Rhinos, he sent a small bolt of fire through Vachir's bow, breaking the string.[101] He demonstrated the ability to fire multiple small blasts through two fingers rather than his whole fist.[3] During the battle in the Crystal Catacombs, he demonstrated how far his prowess had grown. His fire blasts were more powerful, and he charged his attacks before releasing them, creating devastating bodies of enourmous flame. He also demonstrated the ability to create two fire-whips capable of smashing through crystal pillars. He battled evenly with Aang, even though he had skillfully used airbending and earthbending. After switching opponents with Azula, he battled evenly with Katara, a waterbending master who had the upper hand against Azula.[1]\n\nZuko absorbing lightning\nZuko was able to absorb lightning from Ozai in order to redirect it.\nLittle was seen of Zuko's firebending after he returned to the Fire Nation; however, he was confident enough in his abilities that he offered to teach Aang. He utilized a wall of flame to stop an attack from Combustion Man and was capable of dodging many of the rocks Toph hurled at him.[16] Later, he temporarily lost his firebending from a subsequent lack of rage, the former source of his power. In order to reconnect with the original source of firebending, he and Aang traveled to the ancient city of the Sun Warriors together. There, Zuko learned \"The Dancing Dragon\", an ancient firebending form that he performed alongside Aang. Learning this form appeared to have influenced his style of firebending to be more fluid, creating a more dancelike form as opposed to the rigid, militaristic forms commonly used by Fire Nation soldiers. He was also challenged by the Tribesmen to carry a piece of the Eternal Flame all the way up to the cave of the masters. Zuko and Aang performed their newly learned technique in unison with the dragons, who engulfed them in a spiral of multi-colored flames. After viewing this, Zuko found a new source of power in reverence for fire's power as a source of life and energy: \"the sun inside you\".[12] He quickly developed a much more advanced and refined fighting style as a result. This was displayed at the Boiling Rock, where he briefly battled against Azula alongside Sokka. During the fight, Azula failed to knock Zuko off balance, a stark contrast to their previous fights in which she held the upper hand against him rather easily. He deflected her fire blasts using only his arms or his own fire and traded fireballs with her.[62] When he faced Azula again, Zuko was able to duel her to a standstill, firing several large and powerful fire blasts and deflecting many of her attacks.[63] Later, he attacked Aang with powerful fire blasts to make him fight back. When he chased him into Ozai's old family vacation home, Zuko created several lashes of fire to envelop his surroundings and augmented them to the shape of the hallway Aang was running through.[59] Furthermore, he used his firebending in conjunction with his broadswords,[23] demonstrated an ability to form fire daggers,[42] and limited use of breath of fire.[40][60]\n\nDuring his training with Iroh, Zuko attempted to learn how to create lightning. His inner turmoil, however, rendered him unable to achieve the required peace of mind, and his attempts to produce lightning would only explode in his face. Instead, Iroh taught him how to absorb and redirect lightning.[46] He later employed this technique against his father[61] and Azula to protect Katara.[64] In the latter engagement, Zuko redirected the blast in an improper stance, as he had jumped into the lightning's path and thus failed to redirect it properly, resulting in serious injury. Though he seemed to overcome his inner turmoil, he was not able to create lightning.\n\nZuko blocks attack\nZuko displayed the extent of his bending skills with the arrival of Sozin's Comet.\nWith the power of Sozin's Comet, Zuko's firebending was tremendously enhanced. In his Agni Kai with Azula during this time, he was able to match her powerful sheets of blue flame and even steadily gain the upper hand, not showing any visible strain in exchanging and blocking Azula's attacks while she was pushed toward exhaustion and increasing mental instability. He displayed several incredibly powerful techniques: blocking an enormous stream of fire with a short fire-blast, spreading to take the shape of a wall and split the stream, unleashing an enormous charged-blast, which Azula was unable to block, forcing her to dodge, propelling himself into the air, charging his fire and sending down a fire attack as he came. His final attack was a fire tornado he created with his feet while spinning, knocking Azula off her feet.[64]\n\nAfter the War and assuming the mantle of Fire Lord, Zuko's firebending remained as sharp as before and under strict control, despite the mental and emotional turmoils he was struggling with due to his new position. He evaded several attempts on his life, particularly the attempt of Kori Morishita, an earthbender and skilled weapons user, whom he disabled in a matter of seconds. During the battle for Yu Dao, Zuko's skills were again on display as he managed to single-handedly overwhelm a large number of Earth Kingdom soldiers with minimal effort and stand on equal footing against General How.[65] The flames he produced were also hot enough to instantly melt metal chains.[72]\n\nZuko handled Azula quite well during their fights throughout the search for their mother, blocking her fire blasts and defending his friends simultaneously, especially during her psychotic episodes.[22] In another instance, he neglected to firebend at all, merely opting to dodge Azula's attacks and allow her to tire herself out. This demonstrated how far Zuko's abilities had progressed, matching his sister for raw power in spite of not approaching their fights with his full potential in hopes of not harming her. Subsequently, however, Azula recovered and proved to be more than a match for Zuko by becoming the victor in a brawl and showing her newfound ability to redirect lightning. Ultimately, Zuko was unable to match his sister in bending ability.\n\nDuring an ambush by the New Ozai Society, Zuko demonstrated the ability to generate a fire vortex featuring green and purple flames, marking the first known instance that a human had created dragon fire.[74] In his first visit to the Southern Water Tribe as Fire Lord, Zuko also demonstrated the ability to propel himself through the air with firebending, similar to Azula, while carrying the additional weight of Earth King Kuei.[77]\n\nAt the age of 88, Zuko still proved to be a capable fighter, although less agile, enough so to face Ghazan, a powerful earthbender, for a reasonable period of time before getting overpowered.[88]\n\nSwordsmanship\n\nZuko with his swords\nZuko was a highly proficient swordsman.\nAside from his bending, Zuko also developed a masterful skill in swordsmanship, and he specialized in dual wielding swordplay, using a set of dao blades, skills he gained after being trained by the swordmaster Piandao.[26] He would use these skills as his primary tactics whenever he was in his Blue Spirit disguise,[44][37][102] unable to firebend, or when he needed to fight but also needed to conceal his firebending.[23] He was able to defeat multiple foes using only his swords, including experienced firebending soldiers.[37] He also dueled evenly with Jet and his dual hook swords until the fight was broken up by the Dai Li.[49] Zuko was able to defeat several Earth Kingdom soldiers with minimal effort by employing his swordsmanship skills in combination with unarmed combat and, in the same confrontation, demonstrated the ability to combine his sword skills with his firebending, allowing him to deliver more powerful and destructive attacks.[23] His skill was such that his father, Fire Lord Ozai, opted not to face him during an eclipse when neither of them could firebend.[61] He also defeated Sokka, a very proficient swordsman in his own right and a fellow student of Piandao, with ease in multiple sparring matches.\n\nHe also had some experience with knives, being able to pierce a small object, like a horn, from a distance.[37]\n\nOther skills\n\nBlue Spirit sneaks\nDisguised as the \"Blue Spirit\", Zuko made apparent the scope of his abilities without having to rely solely on his bending.\nIn addition to his firebending and swordsmanship skills, Zuko was highly skilled in unarmed combat, able to break apart oncoming spears with his hands and legs[8] and disarm, subdue, or defeat opponents. Zuko was able to defeat several armed Earth Kingdom soldiers in rapid succession. Zuko was very physically capable, able to almost nonchalantly send a person flying with a single hand and smash through iron shackles with a single kick. He was also quite fast and agile, able to perform great acrobatic feats, such as running across walls,[12] doing mid-air twirls, scaling vertical faces with great efficiency and climbing speed, and jumping large distances to avoid enemy attacks with noticeable agility and free-running skills.[16]\n\nZuko was stealthy and skilled in the art of infiltration, able to sneak into heavily defended fortresses and conceal himself effectively for long periods of time.[40][63][37] His skills served him well while he was disguised as the Blue Spirit. Zuko was also a skilled tracker; he was able to track the airborne Avatar all across the world, something that his friends later acknowledged in their search for a missing Aang.\n\nWhile not as naturally adept at strategy and academics as his sister, Zuko was quite intelligent. Throughout his travels, he proved himself to be a skilled strategist, able to exploit any situation to his advantage. For example, Zuko used his ship's damages as a smokescreen to conceal his movements from Zhao.[4] He was also able to form alliances with people with special skills, such as June,[38] and use them to his advantage.[36] As he matured, Zuko developed greater strategic skills and foresight, planning ahead to avoid landing himself in compromising predicaments. When he and Aang needed to enter a specific room in the Sun Warrior ruins, Zuko was able to outsmart the celestial calendar by using his dual dao swords to reflect the sun's rays on the sunstone at the correct angle, activating the mechanism to open the doors.[12] He also displayed good military, organizational, and leadership skills when he became Fire Lord, which he demonstrated when he re-organized the Fire Nation Army into a more compact and effective force and later commanded it in the battle for Yu Dao. His time being a \"bad guy\", as he put it, also gave him insight into certain situations. In the South Pole, Earth King Kuei was used as leverage by Gilak to capture Hakoda. Upon hearing the demands, Zuko correctly deduced that the man did not intend to keep either party alive and was able to warn his friends against complying.[77]\n\nAs a leader, Zuko also displayed charisma and good public speaking. His speech to redeem the name of the Fire Nation at his coronation was warmly embraced, not only by his own people but by people of the other nations as well.[10] Despite a very tumultuous start, Zuko eventually came to be regarded as an excellent, benevolent Fire Lord, with his actions in helping create Republic City being recognized for many years.\n\nAs a teacher, Zuko pulled from many traditions encompassing his own history of learning and the myriad teachers he had. He could be harsh when needed, and also understanding and patient, calling on the lessons of his uncle. Zuko wanted his students to understand that they needed to own, apologize, and make up for their own errors, and that taking in the whole of the world and all its differences and complexity would help them find their own balance"

For other similar uses, see Aang (disambiguation).\nAvatar Aang to Chief Arnook.[1]\nI WASN'T THERE WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED MY PEOPLE. I'M GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE THIS TIME.\n\nAang was an Air Nomad born in 12 BG and the Avatar during the Hundred Year War, succeeding Avatar Roku[8] and preceding Avatar Korra. As the Avatar of his time, he was the only person capable of using all four bending arts: airbending, waterbending, earthbending, and firebending. He was also one of a select few Avatars and one of the first in many cycles[9] to learn the ancient art of energybending as well as the first Avatar known to have actively used the technique.\n\nShortly before the beginning of the Hundred Year War, Aang was frozen in an iceberg for a hundred years; he later emerged, still biologically twelve years old, into a world engulfed by war.[3] During his absence, the Fire Nation had waged war upon the other nations and managed to completely wipe out the pacifistic Air Nomads. It fell to Aang, the Avatar and the last airbender, to end the War by mastering the other three elements and defeating Fire Lord Ozai. He remained a kind and goofy kid at heart throughout his year-long struggle, despite the overwhelming loss of his people and the heavy burdens he was forced to bear. After his victory over the Phoenix King, Aang began a romantic relationship with his close friend, Katara.[10] The couple eventually married and raised a family of three children: Bumi, the oldest, a nonbender who became an airbender later in life; Kya, a waterbender; and the youngest, Tenzin, an airbender.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the significance of Aang's birth year in the Avatar universe? toggle section\nWho succeeded Aang as the Avatar after his death? toggle section\nWhat are the bending arts that Aang mastered as the Avatar? toggle section\nWhat is the ancient art of energybending that Aang learned? toggle section\nHow old was Aang during the events of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\"? toggle section\n\nHistory\n\nEarly life\n\nBaby Aang\nAang was taken away from his parents shortly after his birth.\nAang was born to two Air Nomads in 12 BG. After selecting the Avatar relics from among thousands of toys, thereby inadvertently confirming his identity as the Avatar, he was taken away by the monks of the Southern Air Temple, who kept his position a secret from him.[11][12] As an Air Nomad, Aang traveled extensively around the world.[13][14] During his childhood, Aang was housed, raised, and educated at the Southern Air Temple, under the guardianship of Monk Gyatso, who served as his father figure, counselor, and tutor. After some time, he and several other young Air Nomad boys were taken to the Eastern Air Temple, where they each chose a sky bison as their lifelong companion. Aang approached his soon-to-be sky bison Appa and offered him an apple, which Appa accepted, thus marking the start of their deep and lifelong friendship.[15]\n\nAang was always able to excel at any new bending moves he learned; at the age of six, he was a better airbender than children twice his age, and by the age of ten, Aang had proven himself to be better than his own teachers.[16] He earned airbending tattoos and the status of an airbending master by the age of twelve[17] for exhibiting prodigious talent with his native element and with his invention of the air scooter,[18][19] making him the youngest airbending master in Air Nomad history at the time.[17]\n\nIn his childhood, Aang also visited the other air temples, as evidenced by his obvious familiarity with the Western Air Temple,[20] as well as cities in the Earth Kingdom, such as Omashu, where he developed a lasting friendship with the good-natured but eccentric Bumi.[13] He bonded closely with children in the Fire Nation, like Kuzon,[14] with whom he went searching for a dragon in the mountains and saved a dragon egg from poachers.[21]\n\nAang with the Avatar relics\nAang was informed of his Avatar status prematurely.\nDue to the signs of a possible war approaching, Aang was told about his status as the Avatar at the age of twelve, four years earlier than the traditional age of sixteen. Aang felt burdened by his status as the other children refused to play with him anymore, and he came to spend more time practicing airbending with the monks. Monk Gyatso was the only one who showed an understanding of Aang's burden, having been good friends with Avatar Roku, Aang's past life,[22] and tried to help ease Aang through the transition from childhood to adulthood by providing Aang with balance through fun during the upheaval in his life.[12]\n\nHowever, Aang later discovered that he would be sent to the Eastern Air Temple in order to complete his airbending training far away from Monk Gyatso, whom the other monks thought was too soft on him. Afraid and confused, the young airbender ran away with his flying bison, Appa, though they became caught in a storm shortly after, which caused them to crash into the water. Aang saved himself and Appa from drowning by semi-consciously entering the Avatar State and freezing them both in a sphere of ice through a combination of airbending and waterbending.[12] The Avatar State kept him alive, albeit not fully conscious, in the iceberg for about a hundred years while the war raged on.\n\nWinter 99 AG\n\nMain article: History of Aang (12 BG - 100 AG)\nAang in the iceberg\nAang did not physically age inside an iceberg.\nOne hundred years later, Aang was found and freed from the iceberg by siblings Katara and Sokka of the Southern Water Tribe.[3] He quickly befriended them and almost immediately attracted the attention of Prince Zuko, who sought to capture him on the command of his father, Fire Lord Ozai.[23] A newly formed Team Avatar set out to find a waterbending master who could teach Katara and Aang, evading Zuko's attempts to capture them on their journey to the North Pole.[24] While helping rid Senlin Village of Hei Bai, a spirit that was destroying their village, Aang crossed over to the Spirit World where he met Fang, the animal guide of his predecessor, Avatar Roku. He was instructed to visit the Avatar Temple on Crescent Island during the winter solstice so he could talk with Avatar Roku.[25] Despite a confrontation with most of the Fire Sages, whose loyalty had turned from the Avatar to the Fire Lord, Aang managed to speak with Roku, who warned him about the impending arrival of Sozin's Comet, which would grant the Fire Nation enough power to win the war.[26]\n\nKoizilla destroys the Navy\nAang, merged with the Ocean Spirit, drove off the Fire Nation Navy.\nRoku urged Aang to master the three remaining elements before summer's end when the comet was due to arrive, or no one would ever be able to restore balance to the world.[26] When Aang was later captured by Admiral Zhao, Zuko came to his aid under the identity of the Blue Spirit, freeing the former so that he could capture the Avatar himself.[14] Aang, Sokka, and Katara continued their travels to the Northern Water Tribe, while developing a tighter bond, as Aang began to develop a crush for Katara. Upon the group's arrival at the Northern Water Tribe, Aang was displeased to learn that the waterbending master, Pakku, would not teach Katara due to the law barring women learning combative waterbending, and was instead instructed to heal. However, she was able to change Pakku's mind, and they both began to learn from him.[27] The period of calm was brief, as Zhao[14] commanded an attack on the Northern Water Tribe with a large fleet of ships.[27] At Princess Yue's suggestion, Aang decided to seek the guidance of the Ocean and Moon Spirits, patrons of the Northern Water Tribe.[1] Aang learned through a spirit named Koh that the spirits existed in the mortal world, but his physical self had been captured by Zuko while he was in the Spirit World. Aang's friends managed to rescue him, but not before Zhao arrived at the Spirit Oasis and killed the Moon Spirit, who was the source of power for waterbenders. Determined not to fail the Water Tribe, Aang merged with the Ocean Spirit and proceeded to annihilate the Fire Nation ships, winning the battle and forcing them to retreat.[28]\n\nSpring 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Aang (Spring 100 AG)\nAang and Toph\nAang and Toph connected on a personal level.\nAang and his friends left the North on a ship with Pakku and several others before flying to an Earth Kingdom base, from where they were to be escorted to Omashu in order for Aang to learn earthbending from King Bumi. The trio decided to travel alone as the general commanding the fortress tried to force Aang into the Avatar State, causing chaos and destruction.[29] Upon arriving at Omashu, they learned that the city had fallen to the Fire Nation.[30] Seeking to save the king, Aang and his friends evacuated citizens from the city in order to aid the Omashu Resistance, but in the process, the governor's son Tom-Tom followed them out. Team Avatar was sent a dragon hawk reporting that the governor would trade the king for his son, but Princess Azula reneged on the deal, leading to a skirmish between the Avatar and princess's allies. While he managed to find Bumi, the king told Aang that he would not leave Omashu, and encouraged him to find a master who embodied the principles of neutral jing. Before leaving Omashu on this quest, the team returned Tom-Tom.[31] While in the city of Gaoling, they heard about and attended a tournament that supposedly featured the best earthbenders in the world, hoping to find an earthbending teacher for Aang. At the end of the tournament, they witnessed the final fight between one of the popular contestants and the current champion, a blind girl. During the match, Aang realized the girl was the same one he had received a vision of while lost in the Foggy Swamp[32] and noticed her technique of waiting and listening before attacking, easily defeating her opponent. The ringmaster offered a sack of gold pieces to anyone who dared to face the Blind Bandit. Aang accepted the challenge in order to talk to the girl, but she ignored him after he caught her off guard by deflecting her attack with airbending.[33]\n\nThe group learned that the girl belonged to the Beifong family and visited their estate, posing as a formal visit by the Avatar. However, he learned that the earthbender, a blind girl named Toph, was hiding her true abilities from her family. When she and Aang were kidnapped, Toph managed to fight off all the attackers, revealing her skill to her parents, and ran away from home in order to join Aang's group.[33] Due to earth being the elemental opposite of air, Aang struggled to learn earthbending, but within the first day of training, he managed to stand his ground and successfully earthbend.[34] Soon after, Team Avatar was separated during a Fire Nation ambush. As they were searching for Katara, Aang, Toph, and Sokka captured a Fire Nation soldier. Aang was left disturbed by this encounter, as the young man frantically believed the Air Nomads to be evil. Team Avatar was soon reunited with the aid of Jiang's pirates.[35]\n\nAang wrecks the drill\nAang destroyed the Fire Nation drill.\nWhile taking a brief vacation to Misty Palms Oasis, the group was led to Wan Shi Tong's library in the middle of the Si Wong Desert and learned valuable information on a solar eclipse that would leave the firebenders powerless. After emerging from the library, they discovered that they had lost Appa, who had been captured and sold by desert tribesmen.[15][36] After meeting the kidnappers and learning of Appa's fate, an enraged Aang entered the Avatar State and destroyed the tribes' sand-sailers. In spite Appa's absence, the group aimed to travel to Ba Sing Se and inform the Earth King in order to plan an invasion of the Fire Nation. After finding their way out of the desert and crossing the Serpent's Pass, the group discovered a giant Fire Nation drill trying to penetrate the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se.[37] General Sung was reluctant at first to accept the group's help, but after witnessing the quick defeat of his Terra Team at the hands of Ty Lee and Mai, he gladly accepted the Avatar's assistance. In a joint effort, the group managed to defeat Azula's team and destroy the drill.[38]\n\nAang struck\nAang was struck down by Azula while entering the Avatar State.\nUpon reaching Ba Sing Se, Aang discovered that the city was the site of a conspiracy; true power did not lie with the Earth King, but with Grand Secretariat Long Feng, who controlled the Dai Li, Ba Sing Se's secret police.[39] The group learned of and infiltrated Long Feng's secret base in Lake Laogai, believing that he was holding Appa captive. After reuniting with the sky bison,[40] they stormed the palace and informed Earth King Kuei of Long Feng's betrayal. After convincing the king to arrest Long Feng and plan for an invasion on the day of the eclipse, the king's men searched Long Feng's office and found a message for Aang from Guru Pathik that had been tied to Appa's horn.[15] The message was a request for Aang to meet the guru at the Eastern Air Temple and learn to control the Avatar State.[41] After journeying to the temple, Pathik helped Aang open all his chakras but one, the Thought Chakra, as he refused to let go of his connection to Katara after receiving a vision of her in danger.[42] Aang reunited with Sokka and Toph on the journey back to the city, and learned that Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee had infiltrated the city. After reuniting with Katara in the Crystal Catacombs, the pair began to fight both Zuko and Azula, before the arrival of the Dai Li, who had turned to the side of the Fire Nation princess. Aang began to enter the Avatar State, but was unable to complete the process when he was struck with a lightning bolt fired by Azula. Consequently, Aang was prevented from opening the seventh chakra and mastering the Avatar State, leaving his attachment to Katara intact.[43] The severe attack also mortally wounded him while he was in the Avatar State, severing the connection of the Avatar Spirit to the world and threatening the end of the Avatar Cycle. Katara caught Aang while he fell to the ground, being able to escape thanks to Iroh's unexpected intervention. While escaping the city on Appa, Katara used water from the Spirit Oasis to revive him, restoring the Avatar Spirit in turn, but he still remained grievously injured.[44]\n\nSummer 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Aang (Summer 100 AG)\nAang determined\nAang was determined to defeat the Fire Lord on the Day of Black Sun.\nFor several weeks, Aang remained unconscious as he recovered from his injury. Aang awoke in the Spirit World, where he underwent a long journey to reconnect with his four most recent incarnations in order to heal the Avatar Spirit.[45] When Aang awoke, he had no memory of his time in the Spirit World,[46] finding himself aboard a Fire Nation vessel and sporting hair, leading him to believe that he had been captured, though he soon learned that the ship was commandeered by Team Avatar and their allies. Upon reaching the Fire Nation, the team prepared for the invasion on the day of the eclipse, and disguised themselves as civilians.[47] However, the team soon encountered a mysterious assassin that they dubbed as Combustion Man, who tracked them down across the Fire Nation.[48][49][50] On the day of the eclipse, Aang, Sokka, and Toph searched for Fire Lord Ozai in an underground bunker beneath the capital, but were kept at bay by Azula for the entire duration of the eclipse. Realizing that the day had been lost, they retreated to the Western Air Temple with their youngest allies.[51]\n\nAfter arriving at the temple, the team was confronted by Zuko, who revealed that he wished to join their group. They initially rejected the prince, but after helping them defeat Combustion Man, Aang accepted Zuko as his firebending teacher.[20] When they discovered that Zuko had lost touch with his inner fire due to his defection, Zuko and Aang sought out the Sun Warriors to learn the original source of firebending. After undergoing a trial from the dragons Ran and Shaw, Zuko and Aang were shown a new, hopeful side to firebending, which allowed the pair to greatly improve at the art.[52] When Azula attacked the Western Air Temple following the rescue of Hakoda and Suki from the Boiling Rock, Aang and his allies were forced to flee once again.[53]\n\nOzai versus Avatar Aang\nAang fought Ozai in a final standoff to decide the fate of the world.\nWhile Aang and his friends believed that they could delay confronting the Fire Lord until after Sozin's Comet as Ba Sing Se had already fallen, they realized that they had to battle the Fire Nation imminently when Zuko revealed his father's plan to annihilate the Earth Kingdom. Due to his Air Nomad belief in the sanctity of all life, Aang felt a strong anxiety about the concept of killing Ozai.[54] When he left for an island off the shore of Ember Island, he met a lion turtle who taught him the art of energybending.[9] Armed with this knowledge, Aang went on to battle the Fire Lord in Wulong Forest. Aang refused to let go of his attachment to Katara to master the Avatar State while he fought Ozai, but when he was knocked by Ozai onto a sharp rock, it pressed against his wound and allowed him to enter the Avatar State.[55] Though Aang was able to overpower the Fire Lord, he decided to spare Ozai's life, and used his newfound abilities to strip the Fire Lord of his bending. With the war now over, Aang attended Zuko's coronation, with the pair vowing to bring peace to the world.[10] In search of restoring balance to the world, Team Avatar met with Earth King Kuei in Ba Sing Se after Zuko's coronation and initiated the Harmony Restoration Movement to remove the Fire Nation colonies from the Earth Kingdom.[56] Soon after, Aang and Katara began a romantic relationship with a passionate kiss at the Jasmine Dragon.[10]\n\n100 - 102 AG\n\nMain article: History of Aang (100 AG - 102 AG)\nFan Club becomes Air Acolytes\nAang reorganized the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club as the first Air Acolytes.\nTeam Avatar split up after the Hundred Year War, and Aang devoted his time to restoring peace and order in the world. He helped to repatriate many Fire Nation colonists. After one year, however, Zuko unexpectedly withdrew his support for the decolonization efforts. Disturbed, Aang and Katara traveled to the colony of Yu Dao. There, the Fire Lord and Avatar could not agree on a course of action, as Zuko regarded the oldest colonies as prosperous communities which had the right to exist, while Aang saw them as a continued threat to the balance between the four nations. Regardless, Aang and Katara pledged to find a peaceful solution, deciding to address Earth King Kuei to this end.[56] In Ba Sing Se, Aang was surprised and happy to discover the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club, a group that had devoted itself to learning the ways of the Air Nomads. In contrast, the meeting with Kuei went poorly, as the king decided to remove the colonies by force. Aang and Katara hurried back to Yu Dao to convince the locals to leave before a new war could ignite.[19] Faced with obstination from the colonists as well as Earth Kingdom nationalists, he struggled to find a peaceful solution until the chaotic Battle for Yu Dao erupted. Fearing that he would have to kill Zuko to prevent another war, Aang eventually concluded that it was no longer possible to keep the nations apart and that the Fire Lord was right. To this end, the Avatar stopped the battle and convinced Kuei to allow the old colonies to stay, albeit as self-governing polities. He also transformed the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club into the first Air Acolytes to revive Air Nomad culture.[57]\n\nAang talks about Koh\nAang convinced the Mother of Faces to help Rafa and Misu by recounting his experiences with Koh.\nAfter solving the Yu Dao crisis, Aang, Katara, and Sokka decided to help Zuko in his search for his long-lost mother, Ursa. Doing so, they were forced to work with Azula, who had crucial information on Ursa's whereabouts. After a tense encounter with a wolf spirit,[58] the group arrived in the remote village of Hira'a. There, they stayed at the home of two friendly actors, Noren and Noriko, but lost track of Zuko's mother. However, the group learned that Ursa's ex-boyfriend Ikem had disappeared in the nearby Forgetful Valley. At this deeply spiritual forested area, the Avatar and his comrades met Rafa and Misu, Water Tribe siblings who were seeking the aid of a powerful spirit known as the Mother of Faces. Aang offered his help, crossed over into the Spirit World, and convinced the ancient spirit to grant them one wish.[59] Team Avatar decided to spend the spirit's goodwill to help Rafa and Misu. However, Azula interjected and took the wish for herself, causing the Mother of Faces to reveal that she had helped Ikem and Ursa to start a new life by granting them new faces, those of Noren and Noriko, while also wiping Ursa's memories. Azula promptly took off, followed by Zuko and Sokka, as Aang and Katara attempted to convince the Mother of Faces to grant a second wish to help Rafa and Misu. A fight ensued, as the Mother felt that the humans were disrespectful and sent her spirit followers to attack them. While fending off the spirits, Aang accidentally blew off Rafa's mask, revealing that his face had been stolen by Koh, the son of the Mother of Faces. Revealing that an Avatar had once spared Koh, Aang managed to convince her to grant Rafa a new face. Soon after, the spirit also restored Ursa's face and memories.[60] Aang and his friends consequently accompanied Zuko, Ursa, Noren, and their daughter Kiyi back to the Fire Nation Capital.[61]\n\nGeneral Old Iron disappears\nDespite his attempts at a peaceful solution, Aang was forced to wound General Old Iron to save his friends, causing the spirit to leave the physical world.\nTeam Avatar then attended the remaining talks on Yu Dao's future, during which Aang encountered Avatar Yangchen's spirit but was unable to hear her. This meeting inspired him to revive Yangchen's Festival. In the process, Team Avatar and the Air Acolytes discovered that the Earthen Fire Refinery and a small settlement had been built on formerly sacred Air Nomad lands. Aang opposed this development, causing tensions with Toph, who advocated change.[62] Despite the disruption caused by the factory, the Avatar and the Air Acolytes continued to try to celebrate Yangchen's Festival; while doing so, a ceremonial meal acted as a conduit that allowed Aang to finally connect with Yangchen. However, an earthquake interrupted their conversation. The Avatar rushed to the Earthen Fire Refinery, where he learned that Katara, Toph, and several others were trapped in a mine under the factory.[63] Aang was able to save the trapped group with the help of Toph's students. Afterward, the Avatar reconnected with Yangchen and finally learned that Yangchen's Festival had been set up to placate the spirit General Old Iron who had wanted to avenge the alleged murder of his spirit friend Lady Tienhai by humans. The factory's construction had roused his anger once again. When General Old Iron subsequently attacked, Aang tried to negotiate until the spirit moved to kill Toph and her students. The Air Nomad then deeply wounded the spirit, causing General Old Iron to retreat. Aang regretted this development, feeling that General Old Iron might be right that humans and spirits were unable to coexist. However, his hope was restored when Lady Tienhai appeared and revealed that she had not truly died and also always loved humanity as well as its progressive ways. The Avatar consequently decided to reform Yangchen's Festival into the Spirits' Friendship Festival, something that preserved the Air Nomad traditions while also adapting to the new times.[64]\n\nAang, Zuko, Mai, and Kei Lo learn of the Kemurikage's origins\nAang, Zuko, Mai, and Kei Lo sought answers to the kidnappings in the Dragonbone Catacombs.\nAfter solving the crisis at the Earthen Fire Refinery, Aang traveled to the Fire Nation to help Zuko, who faced alleged dark spirit attacks. The Avatar learned that several children had disappeared while political extremists under Ukano were mobilizing opposition against the Fire Lord. Seeking a reason for the spirits' anger, Aang, Zuko, Mai, and Kei Lo visited Dragonbone Catacombs where otherwise forgotten knowledge on the Fire Nation's past was stored. At the crypt of the first Fire Lord, the Air Nomad contacted a Kemurikage spirit who informed the group that their kind had not returned to haunt the Fire Nation since ancient times. Accordingly, Aang reasoned that the kidnappers were human imposters. The next night, the fake Kemurikage kidnapped Zuko's sister Kiyi. Aang and his friends were unable to stop them but learned that the imposters were led by Azula.[65] The Avatar consequently helped to locate and rescue the missing children, although the Kemurikage imposters escaped.[66]\n\nAang subsequently traveled to the South Pole region to spend some time with Sokka and Katara. While there, the Avatar had to deal with Southern Water Tribe nationalists under Gilak, who intended to overthrow Katara's father, Hakoda, as Head Chieftain of the South. After helping to defeat a first nationalist attack,[67] Aang attended an international meeting organized by Hakoda. Gilak and his allies used the opportunity to strike again, but Aang and Katara were able to prevent them from kidnapping Hakoda. Regardless, the nationalist captured Earth King Kuei, leading to a tense prison exchange at the Bridge of No Return. Fighting quickly erupted, and the nationalists were defeated. Aang saved Hakoda and Malina from falling to their deaths during these clashes.[68]\n\nKatara advices Aang\nShortly before taking away Liling's bending, Aang decided against it based on Katara's arguments.\nShortly afterward, Aang and his friends ventured to the Earthen Fire Refinery, discovering that a city nicknamed \"Cranefish Town\" had emerged around it. The Avatar was asked by Lao Beifong to help solve disputes between benders and nonbenders at the settlement. When several nonbender-owned factories, including the Earthen Fire Refinery, were sabotaged, Team Avatar decided to investigate.[69] Aang and his friends discovered that councilwoman Liling was organizing a bender supremacist movement and captured her after infiltrating her secret rally.[70] However, Aang was consequently faced with a dilemma as Toph urged him to take away Liling's bending to put an end to her movement, a fate considered by the conspirator as worse than death. Before he could decide, Liling escaped and started an armed uprising. The Avatar helped to put down the insurgency and ultimately decided against removing the supremacists' bending, having concluded that this would not solve a conflict that was ultimately fueled by societal problems, distrust, and ideology. Aang and Katara consequently decided to stay in Cranefish Town, regarding it as a special place and wanting to help it develop into a better community.[71]\n\nLater life\n\nAang and Zuko in the early days of Republic City\nAang and Zuko during an event in Republic City's early days.\nAfter the Hundred Year War and the tensions of the Harmony Restoration Movement conflict, Aang managed to maintain peace. Together with Fire Lord Zuko and the rest of their friends, he transformed all the former Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations.[72] Cranefish Town, renamed \"Republic City\", became the new state's capital and the home to people from all nations.[69][72] Aang worked closely with Zuko to allow Republic City to grow into a prosperous and safe environment and had to deal with a growing number of bending criminals from the city's early days.[73]\n\nIn his efforts to revive the Air Nomads' culture, Aang scoured the ruins of the air temples for documents. He also attempted to maintain his people's cuisine, reconstructing old recipes based on his memories and badly damaged texts he found in the temples. This task was made more difficult by the fact that several special vegetables and fruits grown by the Air Nomads had gone extinct, forcing him to use ingredients from the other nations.[74][75] Later on, Aang spearheaded the restoration of the four ancient air temples and constructed a fifth air temple near the heart of Republic City, called Air Temple Island, where he housed a herd of surviving flying bison, along with a new type of winged lemur, the ring-tailed winged lemur, both of which he found some time after the war.[72][76]\n\nAang, Katara, and their children\nBy his early thirties, Aang's family had grown to include three children: Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin.\nSometime during this period, Aang married Katara, and they had three children: Bumi, a nonbender who gained the ability to airbend in 171 AG, Kya, a waterbender, and Tenzin, an airbender.[77] When Tenzin turned five, Aang began to collect a series of stories and mementos from his life for his youngest son to read following his death.[78] Despite the peace the world was experiencing, family problems plagued the Avatar. Due to Aang's second responsibility of preserving Air Nomad culture, he spent more time and traveled more extensively with Tenzin, his only airbending child, so as to instill him with Air Nomad traditions. This made the elder siblings feel somewhat distant from their father.[79] Despite this, Kya was still comfortable enough to reveal her sexual orientation to him; being completely acceptable in Air Nomad culture, Aang was naturally supportive of her.[80] Being often stressed and feeling weighted down by his many responsibilities, Aang occasionally ventured alone to a rather isolated island where he sought out the hermitage of an ancient Air Nun, Master Wangmo. There, he could relax a bit, as Wangmo's odd-looking statue made him remember to retain his playful and fun nature.[81]\n\nIn 128 AG, Republic City was suffering from a high rate of crime due to a notorious crime boss named Yakone. The fact that he was a master bloodbender, yet managed to stay out of the law's reach for a long time, caused Aang to find it necessary to assist the Chief of Police, Toph Beifong at the time, in his arrest in order to bring him to justice. Aang, Toph, and her metalbending officers apprehended the crime lord at Kwong's Cuisine. The criminal did not resist, and despite Aang saying that they knew that he was a bloodbender, Yakone claimed that he would beat the charges again. After attending his arrest, Aang was present at Yakone's trial and sat behind the defendant in the gallery, where Yakone was convicted of his crimes. He was sentenced to life in prison, but before the sentence could be carried out, Yakone used his powers to subdue everyone in the courtroom, leaving them unconscious. Aang was capable of holding out longest, but he lost consciousness as well after Yakone used his skill to levitate the Avatar in the air and throw him against the stairs leading up to the court's platform.[82]\n\nAang energybending Yakone\nAvatar Aang took away Yakone's bending.\nHowever, employing the Avatar State, Aang regained his senses, allowing him to pursue the criminal. He effectively halted Yakone's getaway by severing his mount from the carriage he was perched upon with an air swipe. Hovering around on an enhanced air scooter, Aang was subdued a second time by Yakone's bloodbending, who now fully intended to kill him. Entering the Avatar State, however, allowed Aang to break free of Yakone's grip, and he swiftly captured Yakone in an earth shell before utilizing energybending to permanently remove his bending.[82]\n\nAang teaching conflict mediation\nAang taught Tenzin and two vandals the Air Nomads' form of conflict mediation.\nIn the mid-130s AG, Tenzin was arrested after apprehending some vandals on the docks of Republic City. Aang came to the police headquarters, and apologized to Toph, asking to take charge of Tenzin and the vandals. Tenzin apologized as they flew back on Appa, but Aang reassured him that he could never be a disappointment. Aang introduced Tenzin to conflict mediation in the style of the Air Nomads. Tenzin could say how he was wronged, and the criminals had a chance to apologize, before the air was cleansed and the resolution could be carried out. He watched Tenzin and the vandals cleansed the airbender gates, and noted to Katara that it would not always be as easy as this, but Katara noted that Tenzin was still young, and he should be given the easy problems for the while.[83]\n\nThe one hundred years Aang had spent frozen in an iceberg while in the Avatar State drained much of his inherent life energy, and by his later years, the strain of this began to weigh heavily upon his body. With his health failing and sensing his end was near, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus to search for and watch over the next Avatar. Eventually, at the relatively young biological age of sixty-six, Aang died.[6][84] He was reincarnated into a headstrong, hot-headed, and rebellious girl named Korra from the Southern Water Tribe.\n\nLegacy\n\nAang's statue\nA massive statue of Aang was erected, overlooking Republic City.\nA massive statue of Avatar Aang was created on Aang Memorial Island, a small island located in Yue Bay. A teenage Aang is depicted wearing Air Nomad monk robes and holding a staff with the airbending symbol on top, overlooking the city he founded with the help of his friends. The statue was created and donated by the Fire Nation as a sign of peace and goodwill.[85]\n\nAs is tradition, a statue of Aang was also added to the inner sanctuary of the Southern Air Temple in order to keep the line of statues of past Avatars up to date. His statue stood in the middle of the assemblage.[86]\n\nAppearances in Avatar Korra's life\n\nAt age seventeen, Korra moved from the safety of the Southern Water Tribe compound to the bustling streets of Republic City. However, every time she found herself in serious trouble and was on the brink of slipping into unconsciousness, she would be plagued by visions of Aang's encounter with Yakone. Through these visions, it appeared Aang was attempting to warn Korra of the imminent threat that Yakone's son, Councilman Tarrlok, posed to her,[82] though it was later revealed that he was actually trying to warn her about Amon.[87]\n\nAang restores Korra's bending\nAang restored Korra's bending.\nHowever, it was not until Korra was at an extremely low point in life due to losing all of her bending powers other than airbending, that she inadvertently summoned Aang's spirit for the first time. During their talk, Aang explained that he was there because Korra had asked him to be, as she had finally connected with her spiritual self, due to being open to the greatest change by hitting her lowest point. Aided by all of the previous Avatars who appeared behind him, Aang compassionately used energybending to restore Korra's bending and passed on the knowledge of the art to her.[88]\n\nAfter Korra lost her memory due to a spiritual infection, Aang appeared before her, taking over from Korra's own reflection and reminded his successor of her status as the Avatar before making room for Roku to appear.[89]\n\nWhile Unalaq was attacking Raava, Korra envisioned Aang among the Avatar lineup she had seen prior to regaining her bending, and his connection was the first to be lost.[90]\n\nAppearance in Tenzin's life\n\nElderly Aang\nWhile trapped in the Fog of Lost Souls, Tenzin envisioned an elderly Aang.\nWhen Tenzin was stuck in the Fog of Lost Souls, stricken with doubt over his potential inability to pave the way for future airbenders and live up to his father's legacy, a vision of Aang appeared before him. Tenzin apologized to his father and said that he would never be the man he was. The image of Aang agreed with this, much to the younger airbender's shock, and continued by saying Tenzin should never have tried to mimic him in the first place and that he was trying to hold on to a false perception of himself. Aang finished by saying that Tenzin was not him and that he should not be him but instead be his own person. Aang's image transformed into an image of Tenzin, and his son finally stepped out of his father's shadow.[90]\n\nPersonality\n\nAang was fun-loving, somewhat naive, and adventurous with a sense of humor. He possessed deep respect for life and freedom, refused to eat meat, and was often reluctant to fight in his younger years.[9] He craved the stimulation of new people and places. His frequent off-course detours frustrated both allies and pursuers alike. He typically wished to forget his duties as the Avatar and would long for the normality that others possessed.[91] Yet Aang had always prided himself on a complex social network of friends extending over all four nations, and war did not stand in his way. In addition, he looked forward to playing with all the exotic fauna in each place he visited.[23] Whether it was otter penguins,[3] hopping llamas, hog monkeys, or giant koi fish,[91] no fit animal Aang saw went un-ridden.\n\nWithin this carefree exterior, however, Aang hid a great deal of guilt and a heavy mental burden in his duties as Avatar. As the reluctant hero, he wished he had been there to help his people a century earlier.[1] This initially caused him to conceal his true identity from friends,[23] and he still had a tendency to slack off in his studies of the bending arts, even though he naturally excelled at them.[1][92] He also tended to become distressed when he saw the destruction caused by the Hundred Year War, believing that as the Avatar, it was his job to prevent such events from happening.[25] Eventually, Aang decided to stop dwelling on the past;[12] however, on several occasions, his desire to end the War caused him to take desperate action such as attempting to induce the Avatar State[29] or facing Fire Lord Ozai before he had fully mastered the elements.[51][93]\n\nAang on air scooter\nAs a natural pacifist, Aang chose to employ frustration rather than violence against Azula.\nBeing the last airbender and having no living peers, with the exception of the aged King Bumi and Guru Pathik, Aang developed strong bonds with his friends, particularly Katara, explained by Guru Pathik as a reincarnation of his love for his people.[42] His desire to protect them, however, led to violent emotional outbursts when they were threatened,[94] and he even resorted to deceiving and hurting others to keep the group together, such as when he heard that Katara and Sokka might leave the group to visit their father; he hid the map to their father's whereabouts and lied about ever having it in the first place.[95]\n\nAang preferred not to use his bending skill in battle due to his peaceful nature. He preferred to solve problems non-violently. Even when forced into combat, Aang typically held back, fighting defensively and trying to subdue opponents without seriously hurting them,[23][95] even if they were not human.[34][37] This attitude was apparently common among all airbenders, who were all vegetarians and taught that all living things are precious. The only exception to Aang's pacifism was when his friends were threatened, in which case, he could become angry and attack his opponents, sometimes even entering the Avatar State.[29]\n\nEvents in the Earth Kingdom, however, began to take a toll on his carefree personality. Aang's attitude changed dramatically when Appa was captured. He became visibly enraged and hostile, particularly toward Toph, who had kept Appa company while they were gone. Despite attempts by Katara to calm Aang down, his anger continued to grow until finally, he flew off to search for Appa alone. Eventually, Aang returned to the group, but he was still visibly upset. He violated the principles of airbending when Momo was snatched by a buzzard wasp. He gave chase and rescued Momo but unnecessarily struck it down with powerful airbending. After Aang returned with Momo, the group was confronted by the sandbenders who had taken Appa. When one of the sandbenders, Ghashiun, revealed that they had sold the bison, Aang lashed out and destroyed all their sand-sailers in a matter of moments using his airbending. He turned his sights on the sandbenders and entered the Avatar State upon hearing that Ghashiun had muzzled Appa. Aang's rage was only stopped when Katara grabbed hold of him and held him in an embrace until he finally calmed down and returned to his normal state.[94] Shortly after these events, Aang forsook all hope, choosing not to care at all in order to refrain from lashing out in anger and be hurt. The birth of the baby Hope lifted his spirits once again.[37]\n\nFurious Aang\nAang entered the Avatar State in anger after confronting Appa's kidnappers.\nAfter failing in Ba Sing Se,[44] Aang began to feel angry and upset with himself. He felt an urge to redeem himself and refused to let the others fight and be injured in the invasion due to \"his mistake\". Driven by a desire for redemption, he fled the ship on which the team was traveling, but the spirits of Yue and Roku allowed Aang to see that his mistakes were not his fault and encouraged him to let others help him. He returned to his lighter attitude soon after.[47]\n\nFour days before the invasion, Aang began to have nightmares about fighting against the Fire Lord. He started to unravel and chose to avoid experiencing them by not sleeping. This caused him to mentally fall apart even more, and he suffered intense hallucinations, blanking off into realistic daydreams. On the night before the invasion, his friends finally coaxed him to sleep, during which he defeated the Fire Lord in his dreams and regained his sense of fortitude.[96]\n\nDuring the invasion, Aang became extremely upset upon not being able to find Fire Lord Ozai, believing that he had lost his only chance to defeat him and end the war.[93] Aang expressed his determination to face Ozai anyway, even though at this time the eclipse had passed, and Ozai was now capable of firebending once more. He was dissuaded, however, by Toph and Sokka, who advised him to retreat and attack at a more advantageous time.[51]\n\nZuko and Aang bow\nAang accepted Zuko into the group as his firebending teacher.\nAfter the invasion, Aang was unwilling to face the reality of having to learn firebending, wanting instead to have some fun at the Western Air Temple; however, with the arrival of Zuko, he once again began training in earnest.[20][52] Although he had planned to wait until after the comet to face Ozai, upon learning of the Fire Lord's plan to burn through the Earth Kingdom, he decided to engage him anyway, even though he was not fully trained. He became extremely conflicted, however, upon learning that he would have no choice other than to take Ozai's life.[54]\n\nAang did show a somewhat flawed and stubborn side to his personality during the Harmony Restoration Movement. Like Roku, Aang was adamant about the idea that four separate nations would bring peace. This contradicted with Yu Dao, where citizens of two nations were able to live in harmony, make huge achievements, and have biracial families. However, Aang saw this as only another disaster that would lead to another war and persisted in moving the Fire Nation colonials back to the Fire Nation, even if it meant separating them from their families. However, when Aang saw how intertwined the people from the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom had become and how his relationship with Katara was the same, he came to terms with the fact that his beliefs were outdated and realized that the world had changed significantly in the past hundred years. This prompted him to defend and support Yu Dao, found the Air Acolytes, and ultimately sever his spiritual connection with his dear friend, guide, and past life, Avatar Roku, who still completely refused and chastised Aang's choices. Later on, he and Zuko decided to form the United Republic of Nations as a compromise.\n\nAang retained his playful personality at times in his later years, as evidenced when he happily posed for a picture while spinning seaweed wraps between his hands,[97] and his teasing of Toph while she served as Chief of Police.[83] However, he also grew up to become more serious and decisive. He became annoyed when Toph referred to him by his childhood nickname \"Twinkle Toes\", disregarding the fact that he was forty years old. He also dealt with criminal lord and bloodbender Yakone in a way described by Tarrlok as \"head-on\", contrary to his previous attitudes of trying to find peaceful solutions and his aversion to fighting.[82] In general, however, Aang remained calm, level-headed, and soft-spoken in his later years.[82][83] His more direct and forceful approach remained reserved for those who harmed other living beings, whereas Aang continued to view less serious crimes such as vandalism as redeemable through mediation and cooperation.[83]\nAbilities\n\nBending\n\nElemental tornado\nAang simultaneously bent all four elements while in the Avatar State.\nAs a reincarnation of the entity known as the Avatar, Aang possessed the power to bend all four elements. Though Avatar Roku said mastering the elements could take many years, Aang was able to learn all four with considerable skill in less than a year, though technically, he did not completely master all four as stated by Zuko and Toph.[54] As a result of his unconventional training, Aang never demonstrated most of the special subsets of the bending arts. However, he did display the abilities of lightning redirection and seismic sense, making him the first Avatar known to have learned these abilities. Most Avatars were not told of their status until they were sixteen years of age, but Aang had become a fully realized Avatar while he was still only biologically twelve years old. Thus, he became the youngest known Avatar to do so. As he was chronologically 112 years old, Aang also has the distinction of taking the longest to achieve this status.\n\nAirbending\n\nAang testing his airbending on the lion turtle\nAang was most proficient at airbending.\nBy the time of the Air Nomad Genocide, Aang was already an airbending master, the youngest in history at that time. Aang achieved his mastery tattoos when he mastered thirty-five of the thirty-six tiers of airbending and invented a new airbending technique, the \"air scooter\",[17] becoming the youngest known airbending master of his time at only twelve years old. The element of air was the one he utilized the most in battle. Once Aang began to learn the other elements, for tactical purposes, he relied less on airbending, though it continued to remain his signature element. As a master, Aang's skill with airbending was exceptional; he was able to fight on-par with strong and powerful masters[98] or against large numbers of opponents, despite not finishing his airbending training.[14] He was shown creating tornadoes[14] and currents of air strong enough to lift or deflect extremely heavy objects.[99] Aang's skill with air was great, even perilous, though his pacifistic Air Nomad nature halted the use of air like a deadly weapon unless he was enraged[94] or in the Avatar State.[10] Instead, Aang used airbending for pure defense, evasion, or other round-about methods of combat other than aggression. When not in battle, Aang used airbending in his everyday life, often for flying with his glider,[100] or simply to augment his natural agility.[8] While in the Avatar State, Aang's airbending power was magnified to the point he could erode solid rock away with a powerful gust of air.[10]\n\nAang's airbending skills, especially his skill with the air scooter, greatly improved over time, evolving from being able to ride one to creating multiple air scooters simultaneously without any difficulty. At age forty, Aang was shown to have mastered the air scooter to a much greater degree. This version was superior in terms of size and duration when compared to the ones he showed as a child and was capable of being used as a high-speed method of transportation, as Aang quickly caught up with Yakone, despite the latter having had a good head-start. Aang was also capable of standing on the scooter instead of sitting on it as he had done before.[82]\n\nAside from his individual skill, Aang was also shown as a capable teacher, as he passed on the full extent of his airbending knowledge and techniques to his son Tenzin, who became a powerful master airbender in his own right.\n\nWaterbending\n\nWater slice\nAang showed great skill at waterbending from even the early stages of his training.\nAlthough Aang was originally better at waterbending than his fourteen-year-old friend Katara,[92] his lack of focus allowed Katara to surpass him as she was later deemed a waterbending master after rapidly developing her skills while training under Master Pakku. Katara became Aang's teacher when they took their leave of the North Pole.[28] In the early stages of his training, Aang showed prodigious skill in waterbending, being able to easily create a huge wave on his first try.[92] Although he had great skill with waterbending, it was one of his least used elements in battle, instead favoring other readily-available elements such as earth or air. He did not carry a water skin,[100] preferring to bend from large sources of water such as rivers, lakes, or oceans.[10] His control over the element was monumental, capable of creating massive tidal waves, albeit with the help of the Moon Spirit,[47] or bending entire streams of water. He was even able to extinguish a powerful, comet-enhanced blast of fire from Ozai and use the water to briefly put the Fire Lord on the defensive. While in the Avatar State, Aang could bend water from such remote distances a common waterbender could not reach, and he could raise the waters of an entire ocean, mimicking the moon pulling the tides to cover an entire forest.[10] He was also capable of compressing massive volumes of water into smaller streams, a normally incomprehensible skill, allowing an increase in force and pressure and making it easier to transport.[10]\n\nEarthbending\n\nAang blocking an attack by Ozai\nAang prioritized the defensive tactics of earthbending, as was his nature.\nBecause earthbending contrasted Aang's personality and his native element, air, he had great difficulty learning the bending art. Airbenders relied on indirect methods of combat, while earthbending required a head-on approach. When Aang was forced to protect Sokka from a saber-tooth moose lion, he stood his ground rather than avoiding conflict, showing an earthbender's attitude; he was able to earthbend soon thereafter.[34] His earthbending improved greatly, allowing him to utilize air, water, and earthbending in combat together effectively.[44] Earthbending even became Aang's second most used fighting style behind airbending due to its general availability and defensive capabilities. Aang was capable of bending large boulders,[34] sending massive columns of rock flying, or forming earthen armor around his body for protection.[44] He also eventually learned to fight and bend blindfolded by detecting things through the use of seismic sense, a skill that he learned directly from Toph.[50] Due to his pacifistic nature, Aang employed a more defensive style of earthbending, based on manipulating the earth to create walls, shelters, and restraints to neutralize his opponents rather than harm them. While in the Avatar State, Aang could manipulate massive columns of rock, compress boulders into pebbles, or send rocks flying at high speeds in rapid succession while requiring no physical connection with the ground to earthbend.[10] During the battle for Yu Dao, Aang managed to create a massive chasm around the entire city, effectively leaving it outside the reach of the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom armies. When fighting against General Old Iron, Aang created a gigantic stone body of almost equal durability to that of the spirit's iron armor.[64]\n\nDespite the proficiency with which Aang used earthbending in his fight with Ozai, Toph stated that he could still improve.[54] Toph also unsuccessfully attempted to teach Aang how to metalbend, but according to her, he did not have the attitude necessary to learn the sub-skill.\n\nFirebending\n\nAang firebending\nAang was able to overcome his aversion to firebending and quickly became proficient in the art.\nWhile normally, the Avatar must learn the four elements in the proper cycle, Aang was given the opportunity to learn firebending early from Master Jeong Jeong, instead of first mastering water and earth, in addition to his mastery of air. While training, Aang's impatience to learn the basics of firebending resulted in him harming Katara, an accident that caused him great shame. He swore from that point onward never to firebend again, out of fear of losing control.[98] It was not until after the invasion plan failed[51] that Aang sought to learn firebending again. After accepting Prince Zuko as his teacher[20] and discovering the true meaning of firebending from the dragons Ran and Shaw,[52] Aang no longer feared firebending and began his training in the bending art. He was shown to be quite skilled yet initially reluctant to show the aggressive attitude required for firebending.[54] Aang was capable of performing the ancient Dancing Dragon form,[52] the breath of fire while simultaneously firing a stream from both hands, as well as highly powerful kicks and blasts able to incapacitate a Fire Nation airship, albeit with the help of Sozin's Comet.[101] In preparation for his face-off with Fire Lord Ozai, Zuko taught Aang lightning redirection,[54] a highly advanced and unique technique of firebending that Zuko's paternal uncle Iroh invented by observing waterbenders.[34] While in the Avatar State, Aang could create exceedingly strong and highly destructive streams of fire, as well as melt solid stone.[10]\n\nEnergybending\n\nEnergybending\nAang stripped Ozai of his destructive power by employing energybending instead of committing homicide.\nAfter being endowed with the knowledge from a lion turtle, Aang was able to use an ancient form of bending that precedes all other bending called energybending, which he used to strip Ozai of his natural firebending abilities, leaving the Fire Lord permanently drained and in a weakened state.[10] Aang enters the Avatar State to use it. According to the lion turtle, before the Avatar existed, people did not bend the four elements, but the life force energy within themselves. However, in order to bend another person's life force energy, the energybender's own life energy must be unbendable, or they could become corrupted and even destroyed.[9] It was confirmed that Aang was not the first Avatar to learn energybending; however, there were few who had learned this particular bending art and even fewer who had used it due to its dangers.[102] Energybending allows the bender to both strip and restore a person's bending abilities and transfer knowledge from one person to another.\n\nAt age forty, Aang's energybending skills had progressed, as he was able to strip Yakone's bending abilities almost immediately with minimal effort, unlike when he stripped Ozai's bending.[82] He also demonstrated the ability to restore a person's bending, as seen when his spirit appeared before Korra and restored her bending abilities that had been taken by Amon's bloodbending. At the same time, Aang's spirit imparted the knowledge of energybending and control of the Avatar State onto Korra.[88]\n\nAvatar Spirit\n\nAs the Avatar, Aang was able to contact his past lives to seek advice and guidance. Being the immediate predecessor of Aang, Roku most often came to the young airbender's aid.[9][22] For example, it was Roku who warned Aang about the impending return of Sozin's Comet and manifested through the young Air Nomad in order to defeat a group of firebenders awaiting the Avatar's appearance.[26]\n\nAang and his cosmic Avatar Spirit\nThrough Guru Pathik's teachings, Aang began to understand the dynamics of the Avatar Spirit.\nAfter receiving a letter from Guru Pathik,[41] Aang journeyed to the Eastern Air Temple to learn to control the Avatar State. Guru Pathik revealed that the secret is laid in the unlocking of seven chakras. Aang had little trouble with the first six but struggled with the seventh — earthly attachments, mainly being Aang's attachment to Katara. Aang initially abandoned his training after receiving a vision of Katara in dire need of help.[42] Aang later began to release the chakra in the Crystal Catacombs and entered the Avatar State, but he was unable to complete the process due to being shot by Azula's lightning bolt, which killed both him and the Avatar Spirit. Consequently, Aang was prevented from opening the seventh chakra and mastering the Avatar State, leaving his attachment to Katara intact.[43] After their escape, Katara was able to use the special water from the Spirit Oasis to revive him.[44]\n\nNonetheless, Aang's connection to his previous lives was severely damaged by this and, while in a coma, he undertook a journey to the Spirit World, where he met and reconnected with the four Avatars preceding him.[45] While he succeeded in healing the Avatar Spirit, his physical injuries prevented him from accessing the Avatar State and connecting with his past lives. As his body healed, he managed to reconnect with them,[9][22] though it was only when Ozai violently shoved him against a protruding rock, which unleashed the energy block in his back, that the connection was fully restored.[10] Later, however, feeling that Roku's advice about the state of the world was no longer relevant, Aang deliberately severed his connection to his past self. This caused an unintentional severing of his connection to all his past lives before Roku, except in certain situations, such as special rituals.[63] Later, Aang was able to restore his connection to Roku and all the past Avatars by recrafting the fire pendant on his meditation beads.[64]\n\nMedium\n\nAang connecting with Hei Bai\nAang used his affinity with the spirits to connect with Hei Bai and calm down the forest spirit.\nAs the carrier of the Avatar Spirit, Aang also had the capacity to act as a medium, a bridge between the mortal world and the Spirit World.[25][103] Even while still a young child, Aang demonstrated a natural affinity to the spiritual arts. Through meditation, Aang could separate from his body and travel to the Spirit World and, with the help of a spirit, his astral form could also visit the physical world's astral plane.[1][25] Once in the Spirit World, Aang could travel freely and communicate with beings such as Koh the Face Stealer.[1] This position as an intermediary also allowed him to connect with other spirits while in the Avatar State; he combined with the Ocean Spirit to defeat the Fire Nation during the Siege of the North,[28] and had also channeled his past lives, namely Roku[26] and Kyoshi.[104]\n\nChi sensing\n\nUsing his chakra with the roots around him, Aang eventually became deeply connected to other individuals and located them. He used this ability to find Appa and Momo in the Foggy Swamp.\n\nAgility\n\nHide and Aang\nAang employed evasiveness in his fighting style, which complemented his airbending in his spar with Hide.\nAang was extremely agile and quick even without bending, proven while forced to hide his bending abilities when masquerading as a Fire Nation student. He was able to defend himself without needing to resort to bending by simply dodging and avoiding attacks. This technique was first shown in Aang's fight against the student Hide in the Fire Nation school. Aang effortlessly defeated him without ever striking him, instead simply dodging his blows and pushing him when he was off-balance.[48] He repeated this feat at Yu Dao against a group of firebending soldiers, dodging and evading their fire blasts with a variety of acrobatic moves and without resorting to any of his bending arts and at the end only having his clothes slightly charred.[19] This fighting style was overall similar to the martial art Baguazhang, which consists of an intricate set of foot and palm movements to dodge, walk circles around the enemy, and strike unexpectedly as well as defend from all angles; this art emphasized the pursuit of harmony in conflict situations, rather than destroying or defeating the opponent, an idea he was raised upon due to the pacifistic demeanor of the Air Nomads.\n\nOther skills\n\nAang could use his glider staff with great skill as well, using it as a method of transport and sometimes for attack, defense, or bending.[100]\n\nAside from his combat skills, Aang displayed an impressive degree of artistic talent on a few occasions. He was an extremely talented and agile dancer, being able to perform somersaults in mid-air, among other acrobatic feats, and coordinate with Katara in a dance. His somersaults at that time did not seem to be aided by airbending, as he was in a public area surrounded by Fire Nation students, and there was no sign of any air currents around him. Aang also displayed a degree of musical talent, as he was able to play an airbender's flute well enough for the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club to revel in his performance.[19] He was also able to play the tsungi horn, although he was self-admittedly terrible at it"

DON'T YOU TWO DUNDERHEADS EVER FORGET IT!\n\nToph Beifong was an earthbending master, one of the most powerful of her time, and the discoverer of metalbending. Blind since birth, Toph was constantly treated condescendingly because of her visual impairment, particularly by her overprotective parents, Lao and Poppy Beifong. Upon discovering badgermoles, earthbending animals who are also blind, she learned how to use earthbending as an extension of her senses. This gave her the ability to \"see\" every vibration that passes through the ground.[17]\n\nHaving developed her own unique style of earthbending, Toph acquired a toughened personality and became famous for winning underground earthbending tournaments under the alias \"The Blind Bandit\", doing so behind her parents' backs.[9] Although initially uninterested in directly aiding the war effort, she eventually chose to leave behind her old life, and travel with Avatar Aang and his friends as his earthbending teacher, when her parents finally became unbearable for her.[8] Toph's total mastery over earthbending, unique personality, and thoughtful pragmatism made her a valuable addition to the team.\n\nAfter Republic City's formation, Toph became the city's first Chief of Police, forming the Metalbending Police Force to help maintain order.[18] She had two daughters with two different men: Lin, who succeeded her as Chief of Police, and Suyin, who created the metal city of Zaofu. Toph eventually set out to roam the world in search of enlightenment[19] before settling down in the Foggy Swamp.[20]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the significance of Toph Beifong in the Avatar series? toggle section\nHow did Toph Beifong discover metalbending? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Aang and Toph? toggle section\nHow does Toph's blindness affect her earthbending abilities? toggle section\nWho are Toph Beifong's parents and how did they treat her? toggle section\n\nHistory\n\nEarly life\n\nToph befriends a badgermole\nToph first learned how to earthbend from badgermoles when she was five years old.\nToph was born in 88 AG as the only child of the wealthy Beifong family from Gaoling. Born blind, she was sheltered by her parents, who believed her blindness made her fragile and incapable of looking after herself. They went to extreme measures to protect her, including hiding her existence from the rest of the world, which resulted in very few people knowing that the Beifong family even had a daughter. Her parents expected their daughter to be well-mannered and proper due to their noble status in Earth Kingdom society, something with which Toph secretly disagreed, causing her to resent her parents' treatment.[8]\n\nOne day when she was five years old,[21][22] Toph ran away from home and hid in a cave inhabited by badgermoles. Badgermoles were the first earthbenders and according to Toph, she felt that she and the creatures understood each other as they were both blind. She learned earthbending by imitating their movements.[17] In this way, she learned to \"see\" through the use of her earthbending, detecting people and other objects through their vibrations, which she sensed through the ground via her bare feet.[8] Her blindness and patience helped her to develop a keen sense of hearing. Toph would continue to sporadically run away from home to find refuge in the Foggy Swamp due to its close proximity to her hometown.[23][24]\n\nLao Beifong later hired the earthbender teacher, Master Yu, to instruct her. Acting upon the orders of Toph's father, he did not teach her anything other than beginner's moves, unaware that she had already achieved mastery in the art. She became such a formidable bender that she secretly entered underground earthbending tournaments as the Blind Bandit, and was successful to the point where she became the champion of Earth Rumble more than once. After meeting Aang when she was 12 years old, Toph soon ran away in order to teach him earthbending, but also to escape her parents, who never granted her any real freedom.[8]\n\nSpring 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Toph Beifong (Spring 100 AG)\nToph teaches Aang\nToph began to teach Aang earthbending.\nAfter joining Team Avatar, Toph quarreled with Katara over her participation in the team, which, along with the additional stress of being chased by Azula and her team, led to Toph leaving the group. However, after talking to Iroh, Toph changed her mind and rejoined her friends in Tu Zin.[25] After the encounter, Toph began her earthbending lessons with Aang. Although Aang initially struggled with Toph's training methods, he learned to adopt an earthbender-like approach to battle situations and started to bend the element.[26] Soon after, Team Avatar was split up during a Fire Nation ambush. Toph, Aang, and Sokka captured a Fire Nation soldier while searching for Katara, and were eventually reunited with her through the aid of Jiang's pirates.[27]\n\nAs Aang continued his bending training with Toph and Katara, the group ventured into the middle of the Si Wong Desert with Professor Zei in hope of learning information to use against the Fire Nation. Although they managed to find Wan Shi Tong's library, Toph chose to stay outside, as she could not read. When the structure began to sink, Toph chose to hold up the library even as Si Wong tribesmen arrived on the scene and kidnapped Appa.[28] After making their way out of the desert, Team Avatar's new goal was to inform the Earth King about an eclipse in the Fire Nation that Sokka had discovered in the library.[29] The team chose to make their way to Ba Sing Se via the dangerous Serpent's Pass, which the group successfully managed to do in spite of numerous setbacks.[3]\n\nAlthough they arrived at the walls of the capital, Toph and the team first helped to thwart an invasion plan by destroying the Fire Nation drill.[30] The group found it difficult to meet with King Kuei once settling in the city, but Toph helped the rest of the team sneak into a party at the palace, where they were discovered and dismissed by Long Feng.[4] As the team continued their search for Appa and waited to meet with the government, they managed to rest for a while, though eventually found that Appa was in the clutches of the Dai Li.[31][32] Team Avatar managed to subdue the Dai Li and convinced the Earth King to regain power and imprison Long Feng, beginning their plans to invade the Fire Nation with the help of the Council of Five. With things looking better for the team, Toph received a letter claiming that her mother was in the city and that she finally understood her daughter, but when going to meet her, Toph was kidnapped by Xin Fu and Master Yu, who began to take her back to Gaoling in a metal cage pulled by an ostrich horse-drawn cart.[2]\n\nDiscovering metalbending\nToph discovered metalbending while trapped in a cage.\nAfter some time in her cage, Toph began to bash her hands against the metal walls using seismic sense. The vibrations allowed her to see the fragments of earth within metal. Reaching out for the fragments and widening her stance, Toph bent metal for the first time in the history of earthbending. After freeing herself from the cage, she trapped Xin Fu and Yu inside and hurried back to Ba Sing Se on a wave of earth, until she was picked up by Aang and Sokka on Appa.[1][33] Returning to the palace, Toph and the group were caught off-guard by Azula and her team, who had masqueraded as Kyoshi Warriors and begun to orchestrate a palace coup with the aid of the Dai Li. Toph easily broke herself, Sokka and King Kuei free from imprisonment with metalbending, but escaped Ba Sing Se with a grievously wounded Aang on Appa after the city fell to the Fire Nation.[33]\n\nSummer 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Toph Beifong (Summer 100 AG)\nAfter fleeing Ba Sing Se, Team Avatar commandeered a Fire Nation ship, sailing toward the Fire Nation as Aang slumbered. Shortly after he awoke, they met another Fire Nation ship, and Toph aided in the ensuing battle with her metalbending.[34] Team Avatar split from their allies and went undercover as Fire Nation citizens in order to prepare for the invasion.[35] Eventually, the team began to be pursued by a mysterious assassin with the ability to combustionbend.[36]\n\nToph scamming\nToph used her bending abilities to scam people during Team Avatar's stay in Fire Fountain City.\nAs the team's resources began to run low, Toph decided to earn money for the group by cheating at carnival games in Fire Fountain City using earthbending and metalbending. Toph began to earn a reputation as a scam artist called \"The Runaway.\" This caused a rift to grow between Toph and Katara again, but the two soon made up, with Katara proposing that they run an even bigger scam by turning in Toph, collecting the bounty, and her metalbending herself out of jail. However, this was a trap set by Combustion Man and both of them were imprisoned. Katara freed the pair from the prison by bending her own sweat to cut the wooden cell, and the group fled the city after stunning Combustion Man. Toph also admitted her guilt about her parents and sent a message to them using Hawky.[5]\n\nWhen the Day of Black Sun arrived, Toph served as an earthbending soldier during the invasion. Toph battled against Fire Nation soldiers in the harbor until Aang told them that Caldera City was abandoned.[37][38] Toph sensed an underground bunker beneath the capital and searched for the Fire Lord with Aang and Sokka, but the group only found Azula, who taunted Sokka. With the eclipse having passed, the invasion force retreated, with Team Avatar and their younger allies heading to the Western Air Temple.[38][39]\n\nSoon after settling at the temple, Toph sensed that Zuko had arrived. The prince told them that he had changed and now wished to teach Aang firebending. All but Toph rejected him, as she could sense his sincerity with her truth-seeing. When Toph approached Zuko at his camp alone, he accidentally burned her feet, and she spent the rest of the night traveling back to the temple. Though the group seemed to be further turned against Zuko, they welcomed him to the team after he proved himself by helping to kill Combustion Man.[39] Toph provided useful advice to Aang and Zuko in trying to find the dragons to learn firebending, though she along with the rest of the group fled the temple after it was attacked by Azula following Hakoda and Suki's rescue from the Boiling Rock.[17][40][41]\n\nToph in metal armor\nToph assaulted a Fire Nation airship during Sozin's Comet using advanced metalbending abilities.\nThe group settled on Ember Island following the attack, where Toph expressed admiration of a bizarre portrayal of herself in a play retelling their adventures.[42] However, the group's anticipated chance to recuperate was interrupted when Zuko informed them of the necessity to attack the Fire Nation before it had a chance to burn the Earth Kingdom to ash during Sozin's Comet. Toph helped the team prepare for the assault on Ozai in a mock battle where she played the Fire Lord, but the preparations were halted when Aang mysteriously disappeared the following night.[7] Unable to find Aang, the group traveled to the Earth Kingdom so June could locate the Avatar, but to no avail. Instead, June brought the group to Iroh and the rest of the Order of the White Lotus. As part of the battle plans, Toph, Sokka, and Suki went to intercept the Fire Nation fleet of airships.[43] Toph propelled them all aboard the ships with earthbending just as they took off, and promptly used metalbending to incapacitate the soldiers and captain. Sokka steered their ship into the others, but their own ship began to break apart and they were separated from Suki.[44] Just as Toph and Sokka were about to fall from the ship, they were saved by Suki who was piloting another. As the comet departed, the group met up with Aang, who had stripped Ozai of his bending powers, congratulating him and taunting the former Fire Lord. After Zuko's coronation, Toph joined the rest of their team and their allies at the Jasmine Dragon in Ba Sing Se, where they celebrated their hard-won victory.[45]\n\n100 - 102 AG\n\nMain article: History of Toph Beifong (100 AG - 102 AG)\nToph and Suki fighting at Yu Dao\nToph and Suki fought Fire Nation troops during the battle for Yu Dao.\nFollowing the war's conclusion, Toph began to notice that her bracelet would shiver slightly when others around her got emotional. Toph speculated that these people were potential metalbenders, and founded a metalbending academy in Yu Dao, with her first three students being Penga, The Dark One, and Ho Tun.[46][47] Toph welcomed the other members of Team Avatar to the city while its political status was disputed during the Harmony Restoration Movement. As a teacher, Toph felt the effects of the conflict when Master Kunyo claimed ownership of the academy, as it had once been his firebending dojo. On the day of the battle for Yu Dao, Toph intended to surrender, but changed her mind when her students finally displayed tenacity, and began to metalbend for the first time. Toph participated in the battle by bending underground slides beneath tanks and disabled the vehicles.[48] After peace was made in Yu Dao, many more students enroled at the academy, and she declined an invitation to come to the Fire Nation with the rest of Team Avatar due to her workload.[49]\n\nToph holding back the cave-in\nToph saved everyone still trapped in the collapsed mine with her metalbending skills.\nToph attended a banquet in celebration of Yu Dao's new coalition government roughly one year later. She unenthusiastically joined Aang on a trip to the Yue Bay area, where Team Avatar and the Air Acolytes recreating Yangchen's Festival. Toph spurned many of the traditions, as they reminded her of her strict upbringing. When the group reached an industrial town, Toph quickly befriended a young industrialist, Satoru. Though Aang was disheartened to see the polluted environment, Toph opined that the Earthen Fire Refinery was a symbol of international cooperation, similar to Yu Dao. However, Toph was shocked to find that her father was one of the refinery's co-owners.[50] Lao did not admit that Toph was his daughter, and ordered the Rough Rhinos to escort her off the premises, angering Toph, who wished to speak with her father. Toph managed to gain access to the factory grounds, where Lao disavowed with kinship with Toph, and did not react to any of her accomplishments. When Sokka alerted them of the unstable iron mine, Toph stopped the surroundings from crushing her, Katara, and her father and his co-workers.[51] Toph strained herself by keeping up the debris for an unbearably long amount of time, until her students and Aang arrived to help. After being freed from the mine, Toph collapsed in her father's arms. After she learned that Aang intended on destroying the factory, Toph tried to dissuade him, telling him that he was doing so for no reason, but her efforts were cut short by the appearance of General Old Iron. After Aang battled the spirit, Toph thanked him for saving her students and choosing not to destroy the refinery. Her relationship with her father was slowly being mended, and three months later, she helped oversee Satoru's work in the refinery.[52]\n\nToph is bored\nToph expressed her boredom at her academy due to the monotonous routine.\nAfter the growth of Earthen Fire Industries, the academy had enough funding to build new facilities, and Toph's first three students were skilled enough to teach beginner's classes. In spite of her success, Toph began to grow bored of the monotony of daily life. After Sokka and Suki arrived to take her to see Chong and Trustfully in Love, Toph sought out an underground bending battle in an abandoned warehouse in Yu Dao. She discovered a lavabender named Sun, and helped support the warehouse after it was damaged by his lava. Toph invited Sun to join the academy and teach him how to master his element, and found her passion for teaching once again.[6]\n\nTeam Beifong help with the Southern Reconstruction Project\nToph and her students helped with the Southern Reconstruction Project.\nToph was later sent to the Southern Water Tribe as a representative of Earthen Fire Industries to aid in the Southern Reconstruction Project, though soon found herself in the midst of conflict once more when Gilak and his soldiers attacked a festival, with Toph and Sokka battling the Southern nationalists.[53] The next morning, Toph and her initial three students began work on Maliq and Malina's factory. During an international conference at Hakoda's office, Earth King Kuei was kidnapped by the Southern nationalists. Toph participated in the skirmish at the Bridge of No Return, wearing heavy armor to counter Thod's chi-blocking. After the fight, Toph and the rest of Team Avatar enjoyed a meal at Kanna and Pakku's house.[54]\n\nToph proposes taking Liling's bending away\nToph proposed that Aang take Liling's bending away.\nLater, Team Avatar made their way to Yu Dao, but Toph convinced Aang to stop by Earthen Fire Industries, so that she could meet with her father. To their surprise, the small town around the refinery had grown into a small city called Cranefish Town. They soon found that the fast-growing city was suffering from bending gangs, and an increasing social divide between benders and nonbenders. The same problem had occurred at the factory, as several bender workers were let go to keep costs down.[55] After an explosion at the factory, Toph began to suspect Councilwoman Liling, having heard the footsteps of her daughters, Ru and Yaling. Toph offered to teach Yaling metalbending, but her true goal was to coax her into revealing more information. Through Yaling, Toph gained the password to a bender supremacist rally, where she confronted and attempted to arrest Liling. Liling was captured after a skirmish with Team Avatar, and Toph proposed that Aang take her bending away, to the shock of the others. After Liling managed to escape, Toph battled her bender supremacist forces. Though Yaling managed to knock Toph to the ground, Sokka managed to defeat her. Three days later, Toph walked through the city, and along with the rest of Team Avatar, resolved to stay in Cranefish Town and help it prosper into a city later known as Republic City.[56]\n\nWorking as Chief of Police\n\nOlder Toph Beifong\nToph became Chief of Police in Republic City.\nAfter the formation of Republic City, Toph was placed at the head of its law enforcement and became the city's first Chief of Police.[18] Her metalbending knowledge allowed her to found an elite team, the Metalbending Police Force, to aid her in her duties.\n\nSometime before 120 AG, Toph met Kanto, with whom she had a daughter, Lin. The relationship did not work out, however, and six years later, she had another daughter, Suyin, with another man, though she ended up raising them as a single parent. Both daughters inherited her earthbending abilities and became masters in their own right. Seeking to give them a different childhood than the one she had, Toph gave her daughters the freedom to find their own path. Lin would later follow in her footsteps as the Chief of Police, while Suyin became a rebel, much like her mother when she was young. Toph told her daughters she considered them a blessing; though Lin thought she was lying.[19] In 124 AG, Toph commissioned a friend to illustrate her first encounter with Aang during Earth Rumble VI to include in a book the latter was assembling for his son, Tenzin.[57]\n\nIn 128 AG, at age forty, Toph was on her way to arrest a man named Yakone for being a practitioner of the illegal art of bloodbending and using it to terrorize Republic City. Although mildly annoyed that Avatar Aang asked to accompany her, she let him join her, although she could not resist calling him by her childhood nickname for him, \"Twinkle Toes\", much to his annoyance.\n\nYakone bloodbending Toph\nChief Toph was bloodbent by Yakone to unlock his chains.\nHaving apprehended Yakone at Kwong's Cuisine, she brought him to be tried before the United Republic Council. However, right after he was found guilty of his crimes, Yakone used his bloodbending abilities to incapacitate Sokka. Coming to the aid of her friend, Toph was immobilized by the illegal bending art as well and was forced to use her keys to free Yakone of his handcuffs before being harshly tossed aside and incapacitated.[58]\n\nIn the mid 130s AG, Tenzin was brought to her office with a pair of vandals that the police had arrested for fighting one another at the docks. Tenzin explained that the criminals had been defacing airbending gates with graffiti, but Toph explained that he shouldn't have dealt vigilante justice, but should have reported the crime instead. When Aang arrived to collect Tenzin, she told him she was letting him off with a warning, while the two vandals would spend the night in jail. Aang offered to deal with the criminals in the style of the Air Nomads, as the only damaged property was in his jurisdiction on Air Temple Island. Toph begrudgingly accepted, though rhetorically asked why Aang liked undermining her authority, which he joked was part of their complicated friendship.[59]\n\nIn 142 AG,[60] after Lin caught Suyin trying to flee from an arrest for theft, the sisters were brought into Toph's office. Knowing the scandal that would erupt from the Chief of Police having a daughter in prison, as well as wanting to protect her, Toph destroyed Suyin's police report and sent her to live with her parents. She retired from the police force a year later. At the same time, Suyin would later travel the world, eventually building a metal city, Zaofu. Toph and Suyin later reconciled, though Lin refused to participate.[14] Toph would visit Suyin in Zaofu from time to time, regaling her granddaughter, Opal, with stories about Lin, until she left to travel around the world in search of enlightenment. According to Aiwei, she was not seen since.[19]\n\n174 AG\n\nMain article: History of Toph Beifong (174 AG)\nToph helping Korra\nToph helped Korra to realize that she needed to let go of her fear of her past enemies if she wanted to be ready to face future threats.\nAfter many years living in the Foggy Swamp, Toph found Korra passed out in the mud. She brought Korra back to her home, introducing herself as a good friend of Korra's previous life, to the astonishment of the Avatar.[20] Toph helped Korra recover from her weakened physical state, and when the pair sparred, Toph easily won. Toph was the first person to notice that Korra still had remnants of mercury in her body. Although she tried to extract the poison from Korra, the Avatar resisted Toph's bending and refused to relax. Growing frustrated, Toph told Korra that she would have to get the metal out of her body herself.[61] Days later, the earthbender sent Korra to fetch some mushrooms for her, hoping that the swamp would give her visions. When Korra returned, explaining that she had seen her old enemies, Toph told her that the swamp wanted her to learn from them, and explained how all of her previous adversaries had noble intentions, but the problem was that they had been out of balance. After Korra still seemed reluctant to face her fears, Toph frustratedly guided Korra to the banyan-grove tree, explaining that their roots were connected to the entire swamp. Korra successfully tapped into the connection of the swamp and received a vision of Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo coming for her, with Toph greeting Aang's grandchildren after they arrived. All of them returned to Toph's home, and she instructed Korra to clear her mind and find the metal. Guiding Korra through a painful vision, Toph saw the Avatar successfully bend the residual mercury out of her system and complimented her on the achievement. After finally allowing Korra to embrace her, she saw off the Avatar and Tenzin's children, glad to live in peace and quiet once again.[62]\n\nToph and Lin reconciling\nBoth apologizing for their mistakes, Toph and Lin reconciled.\nToph later learned of Suyin and most of her immediate family being imprisoned following the Fall of Zaofu via the vines in the swamp, and traveled to the city to help rescue them. Though Suyin had been moved to a secure location, she made herself known to Lin, Opal, and Bolin, who had come with the same intentions. The team traveled to a nearby factory and reeducation facility in hopes of rescuing the family, with Lin acting extremely abrasive on the way. After discovering the facility, the group camped for the night, with a confrontation erupting between mother and daughter when Toph began to talk about Lin's father for the first time in her daughter's life. The following day, Toph, Lin, and Bolin tunneled down to the cavern where Suyin's family was being held during a demonstration of Kuvira's spirit energy cannon. Toph and Bolin catapulted Lin on top of the family's wooden cage, and swung them toward Bolin with her metal cable. Although the family had been saved, Baatar's screams alerted the guards of their presence. Toph helped fight off the Earth Empire soldiers, and insulted Kuvira before escaping to safety on Juicy. The family parted in a bamboo forest, with Toph apologizing for the problems in Lin and Suyin's upbringing and her leaving on much better terms with her eldest daughter. She declined Opal's request to return to Republic City, explaining that her fighting days were over and that it was time for the next generation.[63]\n\nThree months after Kuvira's surrender, Toph was visited by Korra and Earth King Wu, who asked her to run as governor of the State of Gaoling in order to oppose Commander Guan of the Earth Empire, who threatened to jeopardize the democratic movement. Toph initially refused, but was convinced to join when Wu explained his visions of his late great-aunt, urging her to step outside her comfort zone. She traveled to Gaoling as a candidate, though recognized that the populace had largely been brainwashed. As the Earth Empire tried to apprehend the group, Toph and the others escaped on a Metal Clan airship that a temporarily released Kuvira had radioed from Zaofu, battling the soldiers for as long as it took to retrieve Asami.[15] At Zaofu, Toph learned that she had lost the election, as King Wu had been brainwashed into moving up the election date, with the Earth Empire threatening to resurface. After Kuvira stole a plane and headed to Zaofu, Toph joined Korra and her friends in flying to Gaoling on Juicy, engaging in battle with Guan's forces. After the situation was resolved, the Earth King tried to convince Toph to run in the next election, but she refused, explaining that she would return to the swamp, as she deemed the predators there to be more honest than politicians.[64]\n\nAlthough Toph liked to stay in the swamp, she still made occasional visits to Republic City in order to spend more time with Opal. This also meant that she was able to reunite with Katara, and Toph and Katara brought their families to the beach with Korra, Asami, and Bolin. Toph and Katara began to reminisce about their long history of pranking each other, and had fun starting a prank war between everyone at the beach.[65] Before returning to the swamp, Toph wanted to take one last trip to important places in the world, including Jasmine Island, which Iroh had told her about. She decided on a whim to venture to the island to pay respects to Iroh and Lu Ten, and to sample its delicious tea.[66]\n\nLegacy\n\nToph was hailed as a hero in Republic City following her retirement and a metal statue of her in her police uniform was placed in a niche above the main entrance of the police headquarters. Among her many accomplishments, including introducing metalbending to the world, both as a prodigy and as a teacher, she founded Republic City's metalbending police unit and won them a reputation for professionalism and training the equal of any across the four nation.[67] Several statues of Toph were also built in Zaofu in honor of her discovery of metalbending.[14]\n\nPersonality\n\nToph annoyed\nToph was comfortable with letting those around her know when she was displeased.\nDue to her blindness, Toph was often pampered by her overprotective parents. Her freedom was limited to the point where her own existence was not known to most people in her hometown, much to her chagrin, thus straining her relationship with her parents. As a result, she greatly craved to interact with the rest of the world, albeit independently. It was not until she learned earthbending from the badgermoles that her confidence tremendously increased. As a result, she secretly participated in Earth Rumble tournaments without her parent's knowledge.[8]\n\nUpon joining Team Avatar, Toph brought a completely new personality to the group. Unlike the nurturing Katara, flighty Aang, or gruff but goofy Sokka, Toph was fiercely independent, sarcastic, direct, stubborn, and confrontational.[25] She appeared to have the same carefree and adventurous personality as Aang and was very tomboyish in the way she acted[25] and dressed,[31] in contrast to the delicate doll her parents saw her as. Toph loved battling and took great pride in her earthbending skills. She appeared eager to prove that she was as strong as anyone who could see and once claimed that she was \"the greatest earthbender in the world\".[1] This attitude was most prominently shown when she was teaching Aang earthbending, as she taught him to face his enemies and problems head-on.\n\nToph's eagerness to prove that she could be independent led to some initial difficulties with Aang and his friends. Toph insisted that she could \"carry her own weight\" and often mistook a simple friendly gesture as an act of pity for her blindness. Her encounter with Iroh, however, taught her that Aang, Katara, and Sokka cared for her because they were friends, not because her blindness made them feel obligated to do so.[25]\n\nToph was often brutally honest when criticizing others, especially her friends. She was vocal about her opinions on others regardless of status (the Avatar, Aang) or age (Iroh).[25] Her occasional attitude or aloofness is likely related to her being the only child of one of the richest families in the Earth Kingdom. Due to her time as a competitor and champion of earthbending tournaments, she was an expert in verbally taunting and insulting her opponents and, on occasion, her friends, particularly Sokka. She revealed to Katara that, being unable to see what she looks like, she did not feel the need to fuss over her appearance.[31] However, despite her many quirks, Toph showed that she was a quick learner,[7] and her courage and loyalty to her new friends seemed very stable.\n\nToph and Katara seemed to be polar opposites; while Katara was kind, welcoming and supportive, Toph was rough, unyielding and steadfast. These differences in personality extended to the way both girls taught Aang; however, Toph eventually showed a bit of compromise in order to help Aang through his initial difficulty with earthbending.[26] Despite occasional clashes or spats,[5] Toph and Katara generally got along.\n\nToph spits\nWhile raised in a wealthy and prominent Earth Kingdom family, Toph deliberately lacked manners as a form of rebellion.\nOne of Toph's most profound traits involved personal hygiene. She was accustomed to lying on the ground and walking everywhere barefoot leaving her soles soiled, a habit common among the earthbenders. Also, she had been seen belching loudly, picking her nose or toes,[68] spitting, and was usually covered in dirt or, as she called it, \"a healthy coating of earth\".[31]\n\nToph was well-educated in the manners and bearings of high society but deliberately chose to ignore them. However, she made an exception when the group needed to go to an exclusive party to see the Earth King in order to give news of the solar eclipse. To this end, she and Katara dressed and acted formally to evade suspicion.[4]\n\nToph did not let her blindness hurt her self-confidence. She had high self-esteem in regard to many of her abilities and was more than determined to show that she would not let her blindness deter her from living freely and fighting like everyone else. However, sometimes this acted as a ruse to hide personal insecurities. After getting a makeover with Katara in Ba Sing Se, some residents of the city mocked Toph for it (who retaliated with a prank). She told Katara that \"one of the good things about being blind [was] that [she did] not have to waste [her] time worrying about appearances\" and was not looking for anyone's approval. Katara voiced that it was something she admired in Toph but could tell that she had been hurt by the insult and added that though it did not matter, she was in fact pretty, which visibly cheered up the blind girl.[31]\n\nToph's blindness\nA laid-back individual, Toph was fine with her blindness.\nAn ongoing joke concerning Toph's blindness was her lack of ability to discern anything that had been written or drawn. In Ba Sing Se, Toph became angry when Sokka suggested that she needed help distributing fliers. She angrily slapped up a poster herself, only to inadvertently place it backward and say, \"It's upside-down, isn't it?\" Also, she sarcastically complimented Sokka on his drawings of Appa despite the obvious fact that she could not see them.[32] Later, in the Fire Nation, after being presented with the same wanted poster twice, Toph vocally expressed her annoyance with the constant oversight.[5] Toph was comfortable enough, however, with the group's absent-mindedness on the subject of her blindness to even joke about it herself at times. For example, while searching for Wan Shi Tong's Library, Toph, while flying on Appa, claimed that she saw it, before remarking, \"That's what it'll sound like when one of you spots it\", and waving a hand in front of her eyes with a nonchalant smile.[28]\n\nWhile hijacking an airship, Toph mistook Sokka's comment about taking the wheel, thinking he was referring to her. By the smile on her face, it was pretty clear that she was gleeful about getting another chance to correct him. However, it turned out that Sokka was talking to Suki, and Toph managed to subsequently cover up her original intention pretty well.[44] At the reunion in the Jasmine Dragon after the passing of Sozin's Comet, she made a joke about Sokka's drawing, saying that she thought everyone looked perfect.[45]\n\nBecause of the restrictions placed upon her by her parents and the fact that their servants waited upon her hand-and-foot lest she hurt herself, Toph often seemed to want to take on the responsibilities and obtain the freedoms of adulthood. This caused problems for herself and her friends, most notably during their visit to Fire Fountain City, as she did not always take into account how this might endanger her or aggravate others. No matter how she acted, though, others realized that she was still a vulnerable child underneath everything else she pretended to be.[5]\n\nWhen she went on to teach her unique talent of metalbending, she realized how her dogged pursuit of her own dreams of becoming the world's first metalbending teacher disrespected who her students were. She found parallels between how she was treating them as people by restricting them simply so they could meet her vision of them with how her parents had treated her back when she still lived with them. She subsequently decided to give up her metalbending academy so that she would not use it as an outlet for the pain she felt from her relationship with her parents onto her students. Luckily for her, her students happened to have overheard her conversation with Sokka about this subject, and responded to it by overcoming the limits the rest of the world saw as defining them in an attempt to live up to the vision Toph had had for them, and were finally able to metalbend.[47]\n\nDue to her troubled past with her parents, Toph also exhibited a modernist attitude, believing that change is the key to progress.[50]\n\nAs a mother, Toph found herself to be a direct opposite of her parents, letting her daughters be free to find their own way, though Suyin claimed that Toph was not pleased with the paths either of her daughters had chosen. She later admitted to her children that, while she knew she had not been the best parent, she was proud of the women they had become.[63]\n\nIn old age, Toph retained her abrasive, no-nonsense personality, being harshly critical of Korra's abilities and enjoying defeating her in combat. However, she had adopted a more cynical mindset about the impact actions make on their surroundings; she had realized that no matter how hard she tried, crime and injustice would never give up.[61]\n\nDespite her tough exterior, Toph was not above warming up during intimate moments, as evidenced when she joined in group hugs with Team Avatar and held hands with Aang at the prospect of friendships lasting more than one lifetime.[69] Although she became more cynical in old age, she allowed herself to show affection when she deemed the other person worthy, as evidenced when she let Korra hug her after earning her respect[62] and did not berate or try to stop Opal's embrace when they met again after several years of separation.[63] She even allowed Wu to hug her after she gathered the King was just an affectionate person.[15]\nAbilities\n\nEarthbending\n\nEarth column\nWhen Toph joined Team Avatar, her earthbending capabilities made it obvious that she would be a promising asset for the team.\nToph's proclamation of being the most powerful earthbender in the world was supported by her talented displays of earthbending from a young age.[1] Although blind, Toph's training in earthbending under the original earthbenders, the badgermoles, allowed her to use their unique ability of seismic sense: she used earthbending to \"feel\" even the most minute vibrations in the earth, including the march of ants several meters away and the presence of trees and buildings.[8] Through this heightened seismic sense, Toph could visualize where people were, their relative distance to her, and their physical build, but was unable to visualize faces.[31] This sense provided her with a distinct advantage when facing other earthbenders in combat because she could predict attacks as they began and quickly react.[8] Her knowledge of the art also allowed her to teach it to others like Aang, and later her daughters, Lin and Suyin. Her speed and agility were also greatly beneficial in combat.\n\nHer earthbending style was unique and thus unpredictable, as her training was unconventional and more deeply rooted in the nature of earthbending rather than just pure fighting. This style greatly differentiated from the rigid training and fighting style that earthbenders like the Dai Li implemented. Toph's style tended to be proven to be superior to the Dai Li, as she was able to take on a number of them and defend her friends at the same time.[32] This is likely because while the Dai Li just manipulated the earth, Toph had established a tremendously deep connection to it at the very outset of her self-tutelage in earthbending (although both styles have an over-dependence on something i.e. the Dai Li and their earth gloves and Toph and her feet).\n\nHowever, because Toph was dependent on vibrations in the earth, she was vulnerable to air-based attacks, as shown in her fight with Aang in Earth Rumble VI. Later, Toph was completely surprised by Sokka dropping a large belt on her head.[8] Her success rate in intercepting non-earth projectiles was also tied to her sensing of vibrations, being able to feel an opponent's movement when they jump off the ground, and proceeding accordingly. By her own admission, she could not aim properly at opponents while they were airborne.[29] Despite this, her connection with earthbending was seemingly good enough that she was able to feel the earth even if it was not connected to the ground.[70]\n\nToph's seismic sense\nToph used her seismic sense to feel her surroundings and anticipate the motions and attacks of her enemy.\nTerrain that impaired Toph's ability to sense vibrations also hindered her abilities, as shown when Toph had some difficulty with sand, describing the vibrations in the earth as \"fuzzy\". She was able to compress sand into solid rock to gain some temporary footing, but she was still unable to accurately aim attacks under those conditions.[29] However, she seemed to have ultimately gained some mastery of sandbending, as she mentioned working on it during Team Avatar's beach party and was able to create a miniature version of the upper ring of Ba Sing Se in rich detail. Apparently, her ability to sense vibrations had improved, which may be how she was able to produce the very fine details of the city and did not show the same helplessness she had shown when previously walking on sand when the gang stepped onto the beach.[7] By 174 AG, Toph attained a state of enlightenment similar to Huu, being able to use the connections of the swamp she lived in with her seismic sense to survey the world and observe everyone, being able to \"see\" areas as far as Zaofu and Republic City.[62][61]\n\nToph also expressed an aversion for flying[2] and submarine travel,[37] as she could not sense her surroundings without her feet on solid ground. Also, as a result of her closeness or affinity with earth, Toph could rest or sleep comfortably on solid rock without any sleeping bag or blanket and could walk on any kind of terrain in bare feet, a standard trait for earthbenders. Toph relied on direct contact between her feet and the ground for \"sight\"[35] as well as for her earthbending. Toph was very reluctant to allow anyone else to touch her feet,[31] probably because insensitive handling there would make her deaf to other vibrations and thereby render her helpless (and because they were far more sensitive than other people's feet).\n\nDespite her substantial prowess on land, Toph did not perform well in water and on ice. She seemed incapable of seeing where she was going on ice, was not able to swim,[3] and became nauseous when she needed to travel by submarine in the invasion of the Fire Nation.[37]\n\nIn Ba Sing Se, Toph demonstrated an ability to sense even slight vibrations, informing a man they met that she could feel him shaking.[4] Toph was also able to sense when a person was lying by the vibrations of his/her heartbeat and breathing patterns.[32] However, Toph's ability to detect lies was not absolute, as Azula demonstrated when she was easily able to lie without even the slightest physical reaction.[38] However, very few people have the ability to lie while manipulating their breathing and pulse in this way.\n\nToph's earthbending style was based on Chu Gar Southern Praying Mantis, a style that was apparently unique to her; the style of earthbending used by other earthbenders is rooted in the Hung Gar style of Kung Fu. She was the only bender known to use a style based on a different root martial art than the standard for their bending art. This may be because she was self-taught rather than trained in the traditional earthbending form. Toph came to develop her unique style by observing the movements of the also blind earthbending badgermoles that could be found in the caves around her hometown.[17] By 174 AG, Toph's fighting style evolved to incorporate more fluid and evasive maneuvers, bending mud more akin to waterbending.[62]\n\nSandbending\n\nToph sandbending\nToph demonstrated to Aang her practice of sandbending.\nBecause sand is loose and ultimately always changing with the winds of the desert, Toph found it hard to navigate through and control. To compensate somewhat, she could condense the sand together to give her a better footing. However, when she tried to attack one of the sandbenders with a small wave of sand during their ambush of her and Appa, she missed, her lack of precision on the sand aggravated by her hurry to save both Appa and the others.\n\nAfter the events in the Si Wong Desert had shown her inability to see effectively while walking on sand,[29] Toph practiced her sandbending, eventually achieving a mastery over it that allowed her to create an extremely detailed sand version of Ba Sing Se during her time relaxing at Ember Island.[7]\n\nMetalbending\n\nMain article: Metalbending\nToph in metal armor\nA fluid earthbending master, Toph mastered metalbending to the level she could use it as systematically as earth itself.\nToph discovered the ability to bend metal in the spring of 100 AG. Metal is derived from ore, which is found in the earth. Guru Pathik explained to Aang that \"metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined\". Because of Toph's ability to feel the vibrations in earth, she was able to locate the impurities (the small fragments of earth) still found in most metals and manipulate them to \"bend\" the metal portion. By acquiring these metalbending abilities, Toph showed herself to be one of the most powerful and ingenious earthbenders in the world, being the only known earthbender to ever bend metal during the Hundred Year War, a feat that even Avatar Aang was unable to perform since the origin of earthbending.[1]\n\nWhen Sokka finished his training as a swordmaster, he gave Toph a small piece of meteorite, which, being composed of earth and metal, she could easily mold into a myriad of shapes,[68] subsequently transforming it into an arm bracelet which she would wear.\n\nShe originally used an underdeveloped form of metalbending and usually needed to have direct contact with the element to manipulate it at all, let alone skillfully. However, she continued to practice her metalbending and started to display a dexterous control over metal.\n\nIn Wulong Forest, when she was breaking into a Fire Nation airship, it was shown that her metalbending had improved greatly, as she created metal armor and manipulated the metallic structure of the room with far more ease than before, moving metal more fluidly. She was also able to crawl along the metal ceiling while completely covered in metal. Additionally, Toph could metalbend outside of her metal armor, even though she was already bending the armor in the first place.[44]\n\nA year later, Toph could bend metal that she was not in contact with, like when she demonstrated her ability to bend metal to Kunyo, who was trying to take over the metalbending school, by bending a metal weapon around his head. She later stated that as long as someone could see the metal, she could bend it, which she demonstrated when metalbending screws and bolts to unscrew the wheels of Fire Nation tanks.\n\nToph later taught this self-invented technique to many earthbenders, including her daughters. After the Hundred Year War, Toph further refined metalbending to the point of being able to start and lead a capable law enforcement group of metalbending police officers. Following Toph's retirement, Lin Beifong became the new Chief of Police, demonstrating her prodigious metalbending and leadership abilities. Despite all of her accomplishments in the development of metalbending, Toph never succeeded in bending pure metals such as platinum.[71] She was, however, able to sense even trace amounts of metal, unlike her daughters.[61] Her proficiency in metalbending was such that she could tear a hole in a metal wall and restore it to its previous state without a trace of it ever having been bent.[63]\n\nOther skills\n\nToph as Melon Lord\nToph pretended to be the Melon Lord.\nDespite her lack of actual sight, her remaining senses, primarily her sense of touch and hearing, were especially acute, allowing her to use her seismic sense to remarkable levels. With the latter sense, she once claimed herself that she \"never [forgot] a voice\". This was shown when the gang traveled through the Si Wong Desert, where they were confronted by a group of sandbenders and she almost immediately recognized one as one of the sandbenders that kidnapped Appa the day before.[29] Later in the summer, while the gang was on a captured Fire Nation ship, Hakoda and Bato seemingly deceived the captain of another ship, but the captain realized the ship as a captured one. Toph overheard the captain whispering to his troops to sink the ship and attacked.[34] While visiting a creepy village in the Fire Nation, Toph heard people screaming all the way from atop a mountain and everyone later deduced that that was where several prisoners were being held.[72]\n\nToph also showed a decent amount of artistic talent, as she was able to create a realistic replica of the city of Ba Sing Se with sandbending while Team Avatar stayed at Ember Island, contrasting with Sokka's poor sculpting abilities when he created a sand sculpture of Suki. Later in a training exercise involving all of the members of the team, she was able to create earthbending mannequins while acting as the \"Melon Lord\"[7] (who was, in reality, an inanimate mannequin made to resemble the Fire Lord, supported by a small earth column and clothed in Fire Nation robes).\n\nAs befits one who has mastered the use of neutral jing by waiting and listening to the earth, Toph had a great sense of hearing, able to clearly hear the most subtle of whispering from considerable distances and could recognize people by the sound of their voices. In the Si Wong Desert, Toph recognized the sandbender who stole Appa, remarking as she did so that she never forgets a voice.[29] She likewise has very fine memory, able to accurately remember and distinguish the physical form of people as she quickly determined one of the Kyoshi Warriors was actually Ty Lee in disguise.[33]\n\nShe also seemed to enjoy acting and showed a decent amount of talent at it, getting more into character as the \"Melon Lord\" than was necessary for Team Avatar's training purposes,[7] rebuffing Katara for acting out of character when Aang distracted her from their act of being noblewomen (as was made necessary for entry into the Earth King's party[4]), and reveling in the \"stage name\" given to her as \"The Runaway\".[5] This appreciation for \"getting into character\" as an actor was likely behind her greater ability to enjoy the The Boy in the Iceberg play relative to the rest of Team Avatar.[42]\n\nShe also displayed a remarkable amount of agility for one who preferred to have her feet planted on the ground at all times. In Team Avatar's first battle with Combustion Man, she rolled, pushed herself off of the ground with one hand and flipped over in the air to regain her balance after his first shot. She positioned herself in an earthbending stance in order to fight back against her attacker as quickly as possible.[36] Toph apparently also had a good enough sense of balance and strong enough neck muscles to carry a basket full of groceries on her head"

EVEN YOU FEAR ME.\n\nAzula was a princess of the Fire Nation, daughter of Fire Lord Ozai and Ursa, younger sister of Zuko, and older half-sister of Kiyi. She was a key adversary of Team Avatar,[7] chasing Avatar Aang and her banished brother far across the Earth Kingdom accompanied by her then two best friends, Mai and Ty Lee.\n\nA firebending prodigy, Azula was manipulative and obsessed with power. She was a skilled strategist who orchestrated the coup of the Earth Kingdom capital, Ba Sing Se,[8][9] and halted the invasion on the Day of Black Sun.[10]\n\nAzula harbored deep mental instabilities, believing her mother loved Zuko more than her.[11] Raised by her father in an environment without a mother-figure, Azula had to be nothing less than perfect in her father's eyes in order to gain affection and attention from him. After the betrayal of her two closest friends Mai and Ty Lee, these instabilities were brought up to the surface.[1] Upon the arrival of Sozin's Comet, Azula was soon to be crowned Fire Lord;[12] however, her defeat at the hands of her brother Zuko and Katara caused her to suffer a complete mental breakdown.[13]\n\nFollowing her emotional breakdown, Azula was put in a mental health facility to recover,[14] though she eventually joined Team Avatar on their search for Ursa, as part of her secret agenda to betray them and usurp the throne from Zuko.[15] At this quest's completion, however, Azula escaped the team's supervision.[16]\n\nSometime after her exile, Azula returned to the Fire Nation Capital in secret. Having finally accepted that she would never be Fire Lord, Azula resorted to manipulating Zuko so that she could rule through him. Gathering a group of female supporters, she took on the guise of the mythical Kemurikage to intimidate Ukano into threatening Zuko.[17] When that failed, Azula and her followers resorted to kidnapping children in the capital, setting the city into civil unrest.[18] Though Zuko and his allies were able to rescue the children, Azula and her followers escaped.[19] Her supporters eventually became disillusioned with her leadership and willingness to abandon them following a failed mission, leaving Azula on her own again.[20]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWho are the parents of Azula in \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\"? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Azula and Zuko? toggle section\nWho were Azula's two best friends in \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\"? toggle section\nWhat is Azula's role in Team Avatar's journey? toggle section\nHow does Azula's firebending skills compare to other characters in the series? toggle section\nHistory\n\n\nAD\nAdvertisement\nEarly life\n\nMain article: History of Azula (85 AG - 100 AG)\nPrincess Azula was born to Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa in 85 AG.[2] Azula grew up with all the riches, splendor, and privileges of royalty in the Fire Nation. Her sharp wits and the fact that she was a firebending prodigy gained her great attention and acclaim, which quickly made her Ozai's favorite child.[2] Her father began raising her as his true heir from an early stage, taking her into his confidence and educating her in politics. Azula later attended the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, where she met and befriended Mai and Ty Lee, two daughters of Fire Nation noblemen.[21] During her time at the Academy, Azula took advantage of her status as princess. She manipulated students for her own benefit as well as pitting them against one another to maintain control, including orchestrating an Agni Kai between Peijing and Hong to instill lessons of fear amongst the Academy girls.[22]\n\nYoung Azula and Zuko\nAzula smiled triumphantly at her shocked brother while he was reprimanded by Ozai.\nEven though Azula and Zuko had a decent relationship in their early years,[23] the siblings grew apart as they got older due to their parents' behavior. While Azula was clearly favored by Ozai, she felt that her mother loved Zuko much more than her, creating a rift of jealousy between her and Ursa and Zuko. As a result of this resentment as well as Ozai's influence, Azula became increasingly cruel and manipulative, often bullying Zuko and feeling happy over the latter's misery.[23][24] She also manipulated her friends Mai and Ty Lee.[24] As result of her growing tendency toward malice and a desire for perfection, Azula craved power to keep others close to her and avoid loneliness.[24][20]\n\nWhen she was ten, Azula's life greatly changed. Her cousin Lu Ten was killed in the Siege of Ba Sing Se, and Ozai subsequently attempted to convince Azula's grandfather Azulon to change the succession. Azula eavesdropped on their conversation, and thus learned that Azulon had orded Ozai to kill Zuko in retaliation for his scheming. The girl went on to gleefully warn her brother to flee the palace, though Ursa noticed their exchange and thus learnt of Azulon's order. Ursa subsequently murdered Azulon, allowing Ozai to take the throne and going into exile. At the time, Azula felt satisfaction over her father's rise to Fire Lord and Ursa's disappearance.[24][23] Without her mother's protection, however, Azula was molded by Ozai into the perfect weapon and heir, negatively impacting her mental health.[20]\n\nAgni Kai audience\nAzula sadistically relished in the sight of her father burning her brother's face during their Agni Kai.\nTwo years later, Azula was among those who watched Zuko's Agni Kai with his father. When Ozai burned her brother's face, she smiled smugly in triumph.[25] When Zuko was banished from the Fire Nation, Azula became Ozai's de facto heir. For the next three years, she would continue her relentless training in firebending, strategy, and combat until she refined herself enough to serve her father. By this time, her firebending advanced to the level where her fire was blue, and she could create lightning, thus increasing her overall bending power and intensity, making her a formidable opponent.[2][26] In early 100 AG, Ozai tasked Azula with capturing Zuko and Iroh, having deemed both traitors.[5]\n\nSpring 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Azula (Spring 100 AG)\nAzula was supplied with a Fire Nation royal sloop, which included a crew and sailed to Zuko and Iroh's last known location. As they approached the port, Azula addressed her crew, emphasizing that she would not tolerate any reluctance to carry out their mission, even if they were apprehending members of the royal family. Before dismissing her crew, Azula reveled in their sense of fear. The ship's captain approached her, explaining that the tides would not allow them to bring the ship in before nightfall. Annoyed by the news, Azula deftly let the man know that his life was at stake if he did not follow her orders.\n\nAzula found Zuko and Iroh in a village resort and invited them to the ship with the false promise of being accepted home with open arms. Her initial plan of luring back her two dissident family members was thwarted by her own ship's captain, who accidentally addressed Zuko and Iroh as prisoners. In the ensuing skirmish, Azula was thrown overboard, allowing her brother and uncle to escape.[26] In order to pursue the Avatar, Azula formed an elite team consisting of her childhood friends Ty Lee, recruited from a circus, and Mai, who was living in Omashu as the governor's daughter. Azula did not manage to capture Aang and his friends in Omashu, but nonetheless was able to crush the city's resistance and secure it for the Fire Nation, renaming the city New Ozai in her father's honor.[21] Azula continued to pursue the Avatar, Zuko, and Iroh for several weeks, making use of technological advancements such as the tank train, being able to find them and wound Iroh in Tu Zin before fleeing the scene.[27]\n\nAzula undercover\nTy Lee, Azula, and Mai disguised themselves as the Kyoshi Warriors, successfully infiltrated the Earth King's circle of trust, gained control of the Dai Li, and enacted the Coup of Ba Sing Se, thus almost granting the Fire Nation complete victory in the war.\nAfter her initial failure to breach the strong outer wall of Ba Sing Se with the Fire Nation drill,[28] Azula and her team encountered the Kyoshi Warriors led by Suki, who they swiftly defeated and took into custody.[29] Hoping that it would break her, Azula sent Suki to the Boiling Rock high-security prison.[30] Disguising themselves, Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai entered Ba Sing Se and successfully plotted a conspiracy with the treacherous minister Long Feng.[8][31] She had the Dai Li arrest the Council of Five, the Earth King's highest-ranking generals, while she personally overthrew the sovereign. Sokka and Toph were arrested while attempting to warn Earth King Kuei against the plot, and Azula sent to a separate dungeon. Immediately afterward, Long Feng arrived on the scene and commanded the Dai Li to arrest Azula, attempting to double-cross her. Having prepared against a potential counter, Azula instead convinced the Dai Li to pledge loyalty to her. Realizing that he had been outplayed at his own game, the Grand Secretariat grudgingly surrendered. After taking control of the palace, Azula encountered Zuko in the Upper Ring and managed to convince him to join her in order to redeem his birthright as crown prince. During a battle with the Avatar in the Crystal Catacombs beneath the city, Azula mortally wounded Aang with a lightning strike just after he entered the Avatar State, leaving the Avatar presumed dead forever and the Earth Kingdom capital delivered into the hands of the Fire Nation.[9]\n\nSummer 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Azula (Summer 100 AG)\nAfter the fall of Ba Sing Se, Azula made arrangements for her friends, Zuko, and herself to return to the Fire Nation. Before leaving the Earth Kingdom capital, she passed her rulership over the city to one Joo Dee, whom she raised to the city's Supreme Bureaucratic Administrator.[32] She also brought back her uncle Iroh in chains, who would be imprisoned in the Capital City Prison complex for his treachery. Back home, both she and her brother were welcomed as war heroes and were greeted by crowds of their people. However, Azula doubted that the Avatar was truly dead and believed that Zuko was hiding something from her. As such, she informed her father that Zuko had killed the Avatar, which would set him up for greater dishonor should he be proven to be alive.[11]\n\nAzula traveled with her friends and Zuko to Ember Island for a brief vacation while the Fire Lord conferred with his advisers in private. Azula took advantage of this opportunity to experience life as a normal person for the very first time, choosing to keep conceal her identity as a princess. The vacation was one of the few moments of her life when Azula opened up and revealed her pain and resentment about her relationship with her mother.[11] She confessed her belief that her mother thought her a \"monster\", commenting that though Ursa was right, it still hurt. She also displayed a moment of connection with Zuko when he left the group to visit their family's old summer home, following him and declaring the house \"depressing\" before inviting him back to the campfire. After returning to the capital, Azula attended an important all-day war meeting with her father, her brother, and the nation's most important generals, where she suggested using Sozin's Comet to destroy the Earth Kingdom once and for all, a plan which dismayed Zuko and would contribute to his eventual defection from their nation.[12][33]\n\nHaving gained knowledge of the invasion during her infiltration in the Earth Kingdom, Azula warned the Fire Lord in advance, and the royal family evacuated to an underground bunker prior to the invasion.[34] Azula and her agents stalled Aang, Sokka, and Toph from finding Fire Lord Ozai before the eclipse ended. This distraction allowed the Fire Army to retaliate with full force once their bending was reactivated, bringing the invasion to an end.[10]\n\nLater, Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee visited the the Boiling Rock, where Zuko had been captured while infiltrating the high-security prison in an attempt to rescue Hakoda. Although it seemed as if Zuko, Sokka, Suki, and Hakoda would fall into the boiling lake during an escape attempt, Mai helped aid their escape. Enraged, Azula confronted her former friend, who confessed that her love for Zuko was greater than her fear for Azula. At that moment, Azula prepared to attack Mai, but Ty Lee stopped her by blocking her chi. Azula subsequently had both Mai and Ty Lee imprisoned as traitors.[35] Afterward, Azula led a platoon of Fire Nation airships to the Western Air Temple, where she battled Zuko. During their skirmish, Azula nearly fell to her death after slipping from the airship, but was able to stop her descent by using her hairpin as an anchor in the cliff wall. Despite having failed to eliminate both Zuko and Aang, she smiled as the Avatar and his friends escaped the temple.[36]\n\nAzula fires lightning\nAzula firing lightning at Katara to gain an advantage during her Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai against Zuko.\nWhen Ozai departed to harness the power of Sozin's Comet to burn the Earth Kingdom, he named Azula as the new Fire Lord. Although Azula was astonished to receive the title, her father told her that while she would rule the homeland, he would become Phoenix King and become the supreme ruler of the world.[12] As she prepared for her coronation, Azula began to crack under the pressures of her friends' betrayal and accession to the throne, and her mental health began to deteriorate.[14][37] She became suspicious of her servants and began to banish them from the nation, along with her personal advisors Lo and Li, her own Dai Li agents, and the Royal Procession. While attempting to tie her hair for the coronation, Azula grew frustrated and grabbed a pair of scissors to cut her hair, resulting in it turning out uneven. Azula then saw a hallucination of her mother in the mirror. The vision of Ursa commented on Azula's penchant for using fear to control her friends, to which the princess replied that she had no choice, and that \"Trust is for fools. Fear is the only reliable way\". When Azula stated that Ursa feared her, the hallucination of her mother replied that she loved her instead. Azula began to cry and threw her hairbrush at the mirror in anger and distress.\n\nJust before the High Sage was to crown Azula as Fire Lord, Zuko and Katara arrived at the palace. Azula challenged Zuko to a Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai, to which he agreed, noticing her imbalanced mental state. During their fight, Azula's attacks were wild, emotional, and reckless, albeit still powerful, while Zuko's attacks were calm and controlled, and eventually, he gained the upper hand. When he began to overpower her, Azula, responding to his challenge to use lightning, directed her attack toward Katara. However, Zuko intercepted her attack and was grievously injured as a result.[1] Azula then attempted to attack Katara, but the waterbender trapped them both in ice and chained her to the floor by taking advantage of her mental decay. Seeing herself defeated and usurped as Fire Lord, Azula let out a fiery roar before breaking down, sobbing and screaming.[13]\n\nAfter the Hundred Year War\n\nSearching for Ursa\n\nInsane Azula\nAzula agreed to help Zuko extract information from Ozai.\nAfter her Agni Kai with Zuko and subsequent mental breakdown, Azula's insanity earned her Zuko's pity, and rather than being sent to prison, like their father Ozai was, she was committed to an asylum on a nearby island, where she was continuously monitored.[14] Although she considered the mental health facility a \"horrible\" experience, Azula actually befriended some other patients.[38] About a year later, she was visited by her brother, who told her that he had consulted with Ozai on several occasions in an attempt to learn Ursa's whereabouts, to no avail. Answering his request for help, Azula said that she needed nothing in return for her assistance, as the mere knowledge of being of service to the Fire Lord would be enough satisfaction. She also stated that she had been wondering as well what exactly happened to their mother following her disappearance six years earlier.[39]\n\nShe was placed in an adjoining cell with her father, though they did not speak with each other for half an hour. Zuko observed this and brought them tea in an attempt to make the situation more enjoyable. Azula grabbed hold of the tray with her teeth, however, causing Zuko to fall over. She angrily accused him of wanting to see her lap up the beverage like an animal since she would have had no other way to drink it while confined in her straitjacket. Her outburst prompted Ty Lee to chi-block her, rendering her completely immobile. Due to her poor mental health, Azula questioned the girl as to how \"she\", referring to Ursa, had managed to break the grasp of fear Azula used to have on her. Before the situation could escalate any further, Zuko intervened and stated that he had meant no harm and just wanted to ease the conversation with Ozai along. After being placed on her chair again, the chi-blocked Azula arrogantly stated that if her brother wanted her and their father to have a dignified conversation, he should leave them alone, which he did.[15]\n\nAzula burning Ursa's letters\nAzula burned Ursa's letters, much to Zuko's shock and horror.\nWhen Zuko was taking her back to her old quarters in the palace where she would be staying, he asked her whether or not she had been able to coax the needed information about Ursa's whereabouts from Ozai. She dodged the question and asked in return whether or not he had ever experienced the sensation of being chi-blocked. When Zuko said he had not, she proceeded to meticulously describe the feeling, mentioning that one becomes extremely flexible right before regaining their full control. To prove her words, she twisted her arm out of her straitjacket and fired a lightning bolt at her brother. In the ensuing skirmish, she managed to free herself entirely and made her way into a nearby building. Via a hidden passageway, she went to one of Ozai's secret chambers, where she retrieved a stack of undelivered letters, which Ursa had written to her hometown. Before Zuko could take them from her, she burned them, having already read them herself. She concealed one of them, however, as it contained information that suggested Zuko was not actually Ozai's son and thus had no claims to the throne. Unaware that Ursa wrote down false information because she knew the letter would be intercepted by Ozai, Azula kept it for leverage so she could eventually overthrow Zuko and let her brother believe that all had been destroyed. In return for knowledge about what had been written in the allegedly burned letter, she requested to be allowed to go with him on his search for their mother.[15]\n\nComplying with the request, Zuko released her from the mental institution and allowed her to accompany him, unbound and with dignity. When she showed herself to Team Avatar, however, she was immediately attacked by Katara. She easily dodged their attacks and proceeded to taunt and insult Sokka. It did not come to a scuffle until the next day when a short struggle ensued between her and Sokka. Azula disarmed him with a small, non-lethal lightning shock after he threatened her with his boomerang. The rest of the team immediately intervened and immobilized her with their bending. Upon her release, she haughtily stated that if they all just stayed away from her, they would get along perfectly.[15]\n\nUrsa loves Azula\nAzula was unable to cope with the fact that her mother loved her.\nShe traveled with Team Avatar on Appa to Hira'a to find her mother, but her mood was erratic, unpredictable, and characterized by delusions and hallucinations, as she constantly asked Team Avatar how \"she\" had contacted them, referring to her mother. Upon nearing Hira'a, she attempted to escape by jumping off of Appa. Aang swooped down and caught her in free fall, but she set his glider afire, causing him to crash to the ground and securing her getaway. She ran away but stopped as she neared a stream and heard her mother's voice coming from the water. She argued with the reflection, accusing Ursa of desiring to ruin her from the day she was born and heading a conspiracy to strip her of her power, of which she also claimed her mother had been jealous. However, she triumphantly stated that thanks to Ursa's letter, she now had all the proof she needed to take the throne from Zuko. She thus revealed her own plans to find and kill Ursa herself in order to stop her once and for all. She let out an emotionally toiled scream as the hallucination of her mother confirmed her love for her, prompting Azula to fire a lightning bolt at the mirage, stating the love declaration to be nothing more than Ursa's last treasonous attempt to set her own mind against her.[15]\n\nAzula chases off the moth wasps\nAzula saved Team Avatar from a moth wasp attack.\nAt that point, Zuko arrived and asked to whom she had been speaking. Reacting aggressively, Azula wanted to strike her brother down but was encased in ice by Katara before she got the chance. As the waterbender approached her, she accused her of being one of Ursa's co-conspirators. Her rant, however, was interrupted when the wolf spirit appeared and attacked the group. As they were being overpowered by moth wasps coughed up by the spirit, Azula asked Zuko to free her so she could help, convincing him that she could not possibly make things worse for them and stating that if he could not even trust his own family, there was no one left to be trusted. He melted her icy restraints, and true to her word, she created a large lightning bolt and shot it away from the group, drawing the light-oriented moth wasps and wolf spirit with it. That night, Azula was talking in her sleep and shivering from the cold before Zuko covered her with a blanket: during this time, he found the letter she was hiding and was left stunned by its contents.[15]\n\nThe next day, the princess was awoken by another hallucination of Ursa. She was urged by her mother to stop what she was doing, as Ursa believed it was not Azula's destiny to assume the throne. In response, Azula intended to shoot her mother with lightning, but Ursa only pleaded with her more urgently to find her true destiny. Azula snapped out of her hallucination with Katara's wrist in her grip; Sokka hurled his boomerang, striking Azula's forearm and forcing her to release her grip, but Katara managed to calm both sides down. After her outburst, Azula discovered that the letter she had kept was missing and immediately assumed that Zuko had taken it. Her brother was not at camp, however, and Azula threatened Sokka and Katara with fire to force them to tell her where Zuko had gone. After burning down some nearby vegetation, she stormed off after Zuko.[23]\n\nAzula demanding Ursa's letter\nAzula demanded Ursa's letter back from Zuko, believing it to be her key to the Fire Nation throne.\nAzula found her brother sitting with Aang at the edge of a cliff discussing the letter questioning his heritage. Frustrated, she shot fire blasts at him, and a duel broke out. While Aang ran back to check up on Sokka and Katara, Azula was grabbed by Zuko and held over the cliff while she accused their mother of tipping him off to the letter's location before learning that he had held it all night. Zuko requested that they stop their fighting, to which Azula agreed, and they both returned to camp. After the rest of the team put out the fires, the entire group continued their journey to Hira'a.[23]\n\nThey reached the border of Hira'a, and the Team Avatar disguised themselves using crimson robes. Azula was the only one who still wore her own outfit. The group arrived just as a performance of Love amongst the Dragons was ending. Azula and Zuko recalled the times they used to see the play and how they acted out the battle scene; Azula bragged she made a better Dragon Emperor, which is why she took up the role between the two. The play ended, and Azula followed the others. They met the leader of the Hira'a acting troupe, Noren, who offered them information on Ursa in addition to tea and an invitation to his and his wife, Noriko's, home. Azula and Zuko spoke with the couple's daughter, Kiyi, about her doll. The princess mentioned she used to give her dolls \"headcuts\" instead of haircuts, offering one for Kiyi's doll, which scared the young girl and caused Zuko to berate his sister. Afterward, the firebender remarked that she was \"tempted to burn the whole place down, but resisted for [Zuko]\". The thought drew Katara's ire, causing the two girls to argue. The increasing tensions between Katara and Azula resulted in Zuko declaring that Forgetful Valley would be the last stop for the trip.[23]\n\nAzula saving Sokka\nAzula saved Sokka from Misu's plantbending attack.\nUpon arrival, Azula attempted to make a path by burning parts of the valley, drawing criticism from the rest of the group once more. When Aang found a flutter bat that brought him to a pond, Azula and the others followed the two there. The Avatar said it was a spiritual place and urged everyone to respect it, but Azula once again saw a hallucination of Ursa urging her to stop the mission. The princess promptly went against Aang's word and blasted the pond with lightning, and yelled at Aang that Ursa had told him to bring them there. Katara was about to freeze her in place, but a rain of flower-shaped ice discs began to attack the team, and the nearby plants began to pull the team in one by one. Azula saved Sokka from a vine, explaining that the more \"peasants\" she kept around, the higher her chances of survival were. Katara countered with plantbending and ordered whoever was attacking to reveal themselves to the team.[23]\n\nRafa and Misu, brother and sister themselves, arrived and set up camp with the group. Misu warned them that Forgetful Valley's ponds needed to remain undisturbed. She told her and Rafa's story to the team; the sibling bond they had resulted in uncertain looks from Azula and her brother. The princess cut the story short and asked about Ursa, to which Misu replied that neither she nor Rafa had seen her. As Aang prepared to cross into the Spirit World to seek out the wolf spirit, Azula walked away; when confronted by Zuko, she snapped at him, wondering if they were really going to find their mother or help \"a couple of vagrants\". Zuko said that it was Aang's duty to help people, and Azula sneered at the Fire Lord for not wanting to hold the throne anymore, traveling with Team Avatar to help people instead. Her focus quickly shifted toward her psychotic beliefs, and she accused Ursa of orchestrating Rafa and Misu's arrival to throw them off her trail. She prepared to shoot lightning at the siblings, warning her mother that her plans would fail.[23]\n\nAzula breaks in\nAzula broke into Noren and Noriko's home through the ceiling after finding out that Noriko was really her mother, Ursa.\nHer attack was thwarted by Zuko, however, and she was forced to calm down, awaiting Aang's return. When the Avatar brought the Mother of Faces with him, Azula interrupted Misu's plea to the spirit to grant her brother a new face with a demand to know about Ursa. After learning that the Mother of Faces had given Ursa a new identity as Noriko, Azula promptly took off to Hira'a with her brother and Sokka chasing after her. Barging into Noren and Noriko's house, Azula was finally able to confront her mother, demanding to know if Kiyi was supposed to be her replacement because she was such a monster. Sokka held her off temporarily, but the princess ultimately slammed Ursa to the wall and prepared a ball of fire, intent upon killing her.[16]\n\nShe teared up when her amnesiac mother apologized for not loving her enough, but after being separated from her by Zuko, she began attacking him. Azula asked Zuko why he would not allow her to take the throne, saying he would be free of something he did not want, while it would rid her of the \"incessant nagging in [her] head\". Upon being told that she was wrong, Azula protested, reminding him that he had the opportunity to throw her over the cliff and be rid of both her and the letter. Zuko answered that he knew the throne was his destiny and went on to say that no matter how messy their relationship was, she was still his sister. Azula, in tears, burned an opening through a nearby wall and ran outside, dropping the letter in the process. She ran off toward the Forgetful Valley, calling her brother weak when he begged her to stay so that he could help her and vanishing from sight.[16] Although Zuko tried to find her in the weeks before he returned to the capital with Ursa, Ikem, Kiyi, and Team Avatar, Azula managed to remain hidden, which caused Zuko to believe that she did not want to be found.[17]\n\nMasquerading as the Kemurikage\n\nFire Warriors\nFollowing the events in Hira'a, Azula freed several of her acquaintances and subsequently organized them as a strike team impersonating the Kemurikage.\nAt some point during her exile, Azula came to the conclusion that her destiny was to manipulate Zuko into a Fire Lord who ruled by fear. She also reevaluated her relationship with her family, discarding any remaining loyalty to Ozai and accepting Kiyi as a blood relation. At this point, her hallucinations had stopped. Recalling how Mai talked about Kemurikage in her sleep during a sleepover from when they were children inspired Azula to masquerade in the image of the mythical spirits to enact her plans.[19] Azula subsequently left Forgetful Valley and helped her friends escape from a facility for the mentally ill, which also institutionalized many daughters of traditionalist Fire Nation families who were considered too rebellious by their parents.[38][20] She made promises to her new acolytes, including Zirin,[19] Ningka,[40] and Chiyou, telling them that they would do work to help the Fire Nation's downtrodden.[20] In her Kemurikage guise, Azula visited Ukano, now the leader of the New Ozai Society, and threatened him with harm if he did not depose Zuko immediately. When Ukano failed at this, Azula confronted him with making good on her promise. A terrified Ukano pleaded for a month to depose Zuko. At some point, Azula revealed her identity to Ukano, who emptied his bank account to construct a prison in the Royal Family Graveyard. In the next month, Azula and her followers began abducting children from the capital, including Tom-Tom.[17][18] Unknown to Ukano, Azula was using him the entire time, having no desire to see Ozai restored to power.[19]\n\nAzula tells Ukano to organize a riot\nAzula manipulated Ukano into doing her bidding while musing how she actually wanted to keep Zuko in power.\nSome time later, Azula abducted Kiyi but was discovered by Zuko, Aang, Ty Lee, and Suki. In the ensuing fight, Azula revealed herself by shooting lightning. Zuko redirected it at her, only for Azula to redirect her lightning back at him. Azula and her cohort managed to successfully get away with Kiyi through a secret passage. After locking up her half-sister with the other children, Zirin was starting to get very impatient with Azula about keeping the children for long. However, Azula calmly asked her and the other friends to be patient, as she had a plan. Azula and Ukano discussed how keeping the children is going nowhere, and Ukano revealed that he is upset that Tom-Tom is kept as a prisoner. Azula ordered Ukano to gather his Safe Nation Society to start rioting in the streets; although Ukano did not understand how this will help Ozai become Fire Lord, Azula softly said that her father was never the plan.\n\nLater, after the riot, Ukano said that their plan still was not making any progress and pointed out that he did everything she asked and begged for her to release the children. Azula went back on her promise, reasoning that if they are free, they will eventually tell their parents and Zuko where they had kept them, and thus she kept the key to their cell.\n\nLater on, Azula and her friends confronted her brother, Aang, her former friends, and Kei Lo. As they battled each other, Mai's knives cut into Azula's hood. Azula mocked her about her knife-throwing skills and attacked her former friend once more. Azula explained how she heard about the Kemurikage when they were at a sleepover at Mai's, having heard her mumble about the dark spirits in her dreams. While resuming her attack, she thanked Mai for giving her the inspiration for their masquerade. When Kei Lo suddenly bumped into Azula from behind, she quickly grabbed him and threatened Kei Lo, and mocked Mai about her relationships. Zuko was next to intervene, firmly asking Azula to release Kei Lo, to which Azula mocked what she believed to be a depressing attempt of Zuko to win back Mai.\n\nZuko confronts Azula\nAt the crypt of the first Fire Lord's advisor, Azula revealed that she no longer intended to depose Zuko but instead become a power behind the throne.\nAfter exchanging a fire blast with her brother, Azula ran off into a tomb shaped like a Lion Turtle. When Zuko followed her inside, Azula explained that they were in the tomb of the first Fire Lord's most trusted adviser. As Zuko pointed out that she seemed more stable, Azula suddenly attacked him. The brief Agni Kai ended with Azula pinning Zuko to the ground and raising a fire-dagger over his face, claiming this was how it had always been between them. Zuko defiantly replied that even if Azula killed him, she would never become Fire Lord and that she should accept that fact. To his surprise, Azula released him and said that she had not only accepted it but embraced it. She revealed that the voices in her head had stopped once she realized her own true destiny: it was not to become Fire Lord herself but to shape Zuko into a more ruthless leader who ruled through strength and fear. Although Zuko points out that she has lost now that all the kidnapped children were rescued, Azula countered that she had won, claiming that, in the last twenty-four hours, she had shown exactly how ruthless and authoritarian he could be. Before she could be apprehended, she vanished in smoke while commanding Zuko to accept what she made of him.\n\nAs Zuko addressed his subjects, Azula and her comrades, all still masquerading as the Kemurikage, watched his speech from a nearby rooftop. Hearing Zuko ask for his citizens' understanding and patience as he searched for a way to be a better leader, Azula smiled and sneered \"How touching\" to herself. Putting her mask and hood back on, she and her cohorts disappeared once more.[19]\n\nAbandoned by the Fire Warriors\n\nAzula continued to lead the Fire Warriors, though they were weakened after the Kemurikage plot. Some had been captured by Fire Nation forces, while others chose to leave the order. The group began to splinter, with some members beginning to act on their own, with Azula neither supporting or constraining them in their plans.[41]\n\nEventually, Azula orchestrated the destruction of a full grain distribution center, hoping to undermine Zuko's reign by sabotaging the Fire Nation's food supply. However, Ty Lee had caught onto the Fire Warrior plan. The Kyoshi Warrior had replaced the granary's stores with empty crates, and had ordered many guards to hide during the initial Fire Warrior attack. Azula was able to come to the aid of the other Fire Warriors, holding off Ty Lee and the Domestic Forces for long enough that her entire party could escape into the forest. In spite of the Fire Warriors' flight, the Ty Lee and her allies had already used their advantageous position to capture and arrest Chiyou.\n\nZirin reprimands Azula\nAfter Azula refused to rescue Chiyou, she faced Zirin's angry criticism.\nAs the Fire Warriors made camp in the woods, Zirin proposed a plan to go back and rescue Chiyou. However, Azula dismissively stated that her acolyte would have to accept that there were sometimes casualties of war. Zirin voiced her frustration with Azula's plans, objecting to the Fire Warriors putting themselves in danger for pathetic raids on warehouses. Zirin stated that the Fire Warriors wanted to move on from skulking in the dark like criminals, and that they needed to move on from undermining Zuko. Azula reminded her followers that she was the one who had given them a new purpose, and stated that it was up to her to decide what path the Fire Warriors would take. She demanded they continue their reign of terror against Zuko, going to sleep once she was satisfied that they would continue to cause chaos on the following day.\n\nWhen Azula woke up, she found the campsite abandoned. Enraged, she burned a Fire Warrior mask with her bending, and vowed to find the \"traitors\" and make them pay. She stumbled in the forest just as heavy rain poured down, and she trudged on to find what appeared to be a Fire Sage temple. As she entered the spiritual site, Azula was met by a solitary monk cooking a meal. The woman explained to Azula that it was a place for the weary, and that those who had need of the temple had no problem finding it. The monk also noticed that Azula appeared to have been struggling with great troubles, and that she was in need of help. She invited Azula to stay the night, explaining that the princess would have good dreams, as the temple was place of rest. Azula dismissed the monk's words as nonsense, and claimed that she had no troubles at all: rather, only Zirin and the others would be in trouble when she caught up to them. She also expressed her disdain for being expected to sleep on the floor \"like a stray dog\", and branded the monk selfish for not offering for a traveler to stay in the best room. Once the monk agreed to give up her own space, Azula drifted off to sleep, still promising to make the Fire Warriors pay.\n\nAzula receives spirit vision\nUnder the temple spirit's influence, Azula received a vision of her childhood.\nAzula dreamed that she was back on Lo and Li's cottage on Ember Island, and found herself soon greeted by her family on the beach. Iroh, Zuko, and Ursa hailed her as a hero who ended the Hundred Year War before being crowned Fire Lord, while Ruon-Jian complimented her for her good looks. Just as Ursa went to embrace her daughter and tell her how proud she was, her family faded away, and she experienced Mai and Ty Lee mocking her for thinking any of the dream could be real. Azula shouted at them to shut up, just as the dream came to an end and she woke up. The monk was shocked that the dreams did not give her peace, and told her that it was urgent for her to leave as once. Azula sneered at the woman's lack of hospitality as she left the temple, but only made it so far before the temple appeared again before her. She entered the building again, intimidating the the despairing monk. Azula declared that the temple must be a trap set by Zuko or Aang, but soon found a burned wooden turtle duck before her, reliving the experience of her parents finding her with the toy as a young firebending prodigy. However, the vision diverged from her memory when her mother expressed pride instead of fear.\n\nAzula debates a spirit vision of Ty Lee\nUnsure whether her former friend was really present, Azula debated a spirit vision of Ty Lee.\nThe monk said that she was trying to give Azula what she most wanted, asking the princess if her greatest desire was not to be loved and embraced by her family. Azula caught on to the fact that the woman was no monk, and started to deduce that she was in fact a shapeshifting spirit. She tried to attack the woman with firebending, but the supposed monk clung onto a beam above, with her form becoming less human. Azula stated that she needed nothing from her family, as all except Ozai were traitors, and that her father was now a pathetic shadow of himself after losing his bending. She stated that she was the only one left with a claim to the Fire Nation throne, and demanded what was owed to her. A noise started to come from the door to the temple, and Azula was met by Ty Lee, who claimed she had tracked the princess and her squad through the forest. As she tried to ignore the spirit, Azula started mocking her former friend for her Kyoshi Warrior appearance, and started attacking her with firebending. She voiced her anger at Mai betraying her for Zuko, and then proceeded to slam Ty Lee against the temple's wall, completely irritated with her.\n\nAs Azula restrained an unconscious Ty Lee, the spirit asked if Azula would kill her former friend. Azula asked the woman why she cared, but it was Ursa who responded, saying that she wanted to know as she cared about her own daughter. Azula denied that Ursa could be real, but her mother responded by claiming that everything in the temple was real enough in the moment. Azula told the vision of Ursa about how she had been hurt by her mother choosing Zuko over herself by poisoning Azulon and leaving. Azula explained that, without Ursa to protect her from Ozai, she became her father's deadly firebending weapon, and had no choice in the matter. She voiced her rage at Ursa for not letting Ozai kill Zuko so that she could have stayed and continued to have protected her daughter. She screamed that her betrayal by her family, her friends, and her acolytes was all Ursa's fault.\n\nTemple spirit watches Ursa and Azula\nUnder the temple spirit's watch, Azula was able to share her feelings with a vision of Ursa.\nThe vision of Ursa then asked if what Azula really wanted was for everyone who broke her trust to come forward and ask for her forgiveness, acknowledging that they had hurt her and promising to never do it again. Azula tentatively said yes, only for \"Ty Lee\" to turn into Mai, who mocked Azula for thinking she could be the victim. Azula was taken aback that her former friends were also spirit trickery, and resolved to leave the temple to good, but found that she could not escape without entering the room once again. The vision of Mai theorized that people always betrayed Azula as she was a a terrible person who got what she deserved. Just as Azula went to confront \"Mai\", she saw that she had the face of Ty Lee once more, who disparaged Azula for believing they were really friends after the princess had intimidated her life. Azula told \"Ty Lee\" that she was less than nothing as a Kyoshi Warrior compared to being in royal circles, but \"Ursa\" appeared once again, displeased. As Azula tried to shut down the \"spirit trickery\", visions of Mai and Zuko explained how Azula told everyone that she believed nobody could survive without her, but in fact, the princess was surrounding herself with people to manipulate and harm as she could not stand the idea of facing the world alone, having to deal with all the horrible things she had done.\n\nAzula rejects the temple spirit\nAzula angrily rejected the temple spirit's viewpoint, declaring that she owed nothing and was the rightful Fire Lord.\nThe vision of Zuko became increasingly inhuman, telling Azula she had nobody to blame but herself, and demanding to know if she would ask for forgiveness. As she shot lightning at the vision of Zuko, with a worried \"Ursa\" looking on, Azula boldly declared that she saw through the spirit's lies, and that she was finished with her. However, just as she started to firebend, she saw that the spirit had transformed into an enormous insectoid form, with the visions of her family withering away. The spirit revealed that its manifestations had not lied: it was a place of rest, but more specifically, it was a crossroads for those who had followed a wrong path, offering a second chance to choose for the better. The spirit told Azula that she had been offered redemption and forgiveness, but that the princess had rejected it. The spirit then said that its present form was now a mirror of Azula's inner self, shaped by Azula's cruelty and desire for vengeance. Azula stated that redemption and apology was for the weak, and that she owed nothing, beginning to generate lightning as she declared that she was the rightful Fire Lord, and that she did not take kindly to meddling spirits. Just as she fired a blast of lightning, the temple disappeared around her, and she found herself back in a forest clearing, declaring that she knew that none of it had been real. She walked back to find the other Fire Warriors by the camp, with Zirin having saved Chiyou and returned them to the others. Azula frowned, and after a moment's hesitation declared the warriors unworthy of her leadership. Choosing not to enact her planned revenge, she vowed to find new followers, as well as a new place to rule.[20]\n\nLegacy\n\nA Fire Nation drink was named \"Azula's Lightning\" in her honor.[42]\n\nPersonality\n\nAlmost perfect.\"\n\"One hair out of place.\"\n\"Almost isn't good enough!\nLO AND LI TALKING TO AZULA ABOUT HER TRAINING.[26]\n\nBorn a princess and hailed as a prodigy, Azula grew up to be egotistical and confident. She relentlessly drilled herself toward perfection and settled for nothing less from herself or those who served her.[26] She believed that power and domination were the defining traits of strength, and as such, would only help others if she thought there was some personal gain at stake. She had absolute confidence in her \"divine right to rule\", with which she believed she was born.[9] She harbored neither pity nor mercy for those she marked as treasonous or inferior. As one who wanted nothing less than absolute control, she likewise had remarkable control of herself, seemingly able to react to any situation at a moment's notice without losing her composure.\n\nAzula hanging from a cliff\nEven in life-threatening situations, Azula remained confident, focused, and deadly.\nAzula was marked by a distinct lack of empathy. Even as a child, she reacted with hostility when outdone, a trait clearly displayed when she shoved Ty Lee to the ground after the girl bested her at gymnastics.[24] This behavior would characterize her relationship with her friends for many years. Rather than care or love, her relationships with her friends were often based in manipulation, such as when she intimidated Ty Lee into leaving the circus and joining her cause.[21]\n\nShe was prone to asserting herself and her authority in a grandiose way, such as when she humiliated Long Feng in front of his former henchmen[9] or when she threatened the captain of her ship.[26] She also showed a need for admiration, mostly from her father, whom she emulated to a great degree, and from everyone else around her, though to a lesser extent. She reacted with despair and rage when she learned her father was going to the Earth Kingdom without her.[12] However, Azula showed a level of fear of him, as in the novelization, Azula notes that not even she could take him in a fight.\n\nAzula was known to have a sadistic personality, showing little to no concern for others besides her father. From a very young age, Azula demonstrated cruel aggression and a near-total lack of empathy toward friends, servants, family, and animals. Her own mother, Ursa, once remarked, \"What is wrong with that child?\" after observing her casual cruelties. Azula's first reaction to hearing of Iroh's son's death was to wonder whether this now made her father the heir to the throne. She later dismissed her uncle as a quitter and a loser when learning he had ended his six hundred day Siege of Ba Sing Se to grieve for Lu Ten.[24] She eagerly watched Azulon proclaim Ozai's punishment for trying to claim the throne and grinned maliciously when Zuko was burned and scarred by their father. She also did not seem to care when her mother disappeared or when her grandfather died.[25] Her cruelty was apparently infamous and extreme; when Iroh accidentally ingested the poisonous white jade flower, both he and Zuko quickly decided that they would rather seek help from the Earth Kingdom at the risk of facing certain death than the possibility of being handed over to Azula by the Fire Nation.[43]\n\nAzula relishes victory\nEven in simple games such as kuai ball, Azula thought about nothing less than absolute victory.\nAzula's characteristic blue flames symbolized the power she possessed and constantly sought to increase. Her lack of compassion also accounted for her ability to create and direct lightning, the \"cold-blooded fire\".[26] According to Iroh, the skill required complete control of all emotion, which would not prove difficult for Azula with her one-track mentality.[44] Because of these skills, she was also an excellent tactician, regularly displaying cunning, perception, and resourcefulness that allowed her to take advantage of almost any situation. She possessed good self-control, facing down Long Feng and deceiving him when held captive,[9] and could lie with a straight face and no physical reactions.[10]\n\nIronically, for all her refinement and self-confidence, Azula did retain some insecurity. As a result of her sequestered life of royalty, she had developed a considerable amount of social ineptitude, particularly in her uncertainty of how to act around boys, and she frequently intimidated them during conversations. Even when attempting to flirt with Chan, her domineering and megalomaniacal personality manifested in a way that disconcerted him and prompted his recession. Her overly competitive nature surfaced during a kuai ball game, and she later admitted her jealousy over how much attention Ty Lee received from others.[11]\n\nThough she seemingly looked down on Zuko all throughout their entire relationship, thinking of him as a weak and whiny boy who never stood up for himself or to her especially, there were moments when her opinion of him seemed to rise briefly. During her coup at the climax of Ba Sing Se's fall, she was truly pleased by Zuko's choice to aid her, musing that Zuko had always meant to be a Prince of the Fire Nation fighting by her side. Almost immediately after, however, his hesitation to fight Katara caused her disdain to surface, thinking of him as poor and weak for letting himself be goaded so easily. Nevertheless, when Zuko showed doubts about his actions in helping take Ba Sing Se but betraying Iroh, she truly did feel that he had accomplished his ultimate achievement, while at the same time feeling pity for the fact that he could not understand the significance of what his actions entailed.[45]\n\nAzula was never happy with what she had, always striving for more. After conquering Ba Sing Se, she passed it on to a puppet ruler to be used by the Fire Nation. When she was doubtful that she had really managed to kill the Avatar, she let her brother take the credit for the perceived kill, convinced he knew a way Aang could survive that she did not. She was always trying to get more to try and fill what she lacked, but it was never enough. In a sense, she was a person without a finish line.\n\nLater, Azula began to show signs of a fragile mentality. For all of her self-assurance, she was momentarily driven into a rage when Mai betrayed her by helping Zuko escape and admitted to loving him more than she feared Azula. As Azula moved to strike her down, she was, in turn, temporarily paralyzed by Ty Lee. After her friends were apprehended, the enraged princess ordered both of them to be locked away and \"left to rot\".[10] While it was apparent that Azula held herself in high regard above her friends, their sudden betrayal drove her to the edge for an instant, hinting at just how unstable she would later prove to be.[1] This betrayal affected her so much that she lost her normally cool demeanor, as evident when she later attacked the Western Air Temple. She was erratic and maniacal, clearly trying to vent her feelings by trying to kill her brother.\n\nWhile on Ember Island, Azula revealed her subtle resentment toward being seen as a \"monster\", particularly by her mother. Though she admittedly agreed with the viewpoint, the princess stated that it was emotionally painful nonetheless. Her time on Ember Island was also one of the few times she showed any sign of compassion for Zuko, as she followed him and urged him to return to the group when he was alone and in pain.[11]\n\nAzula reminisces\nFor a fleeting moment, Azula opened up and revealed pain and resentment about the relationship with her mother, despite her distant personality.\nAfter being betrayed by Mai and Ty Lee, Azula's mentality continued to crumble in the final weeks of the war. When she attacked Zuko and the gang at the Western Air Temple, Azula was evidently losing her sanity, as her attacks became far more vicious, and she was seemingly obsessed with killing Zuko.[36]\n\nThe tipping point came during her father's coronation as the Phoenix King, where Azula was told she would not assist in the attack on the Earth Kingdom. Azula seemed distraught at this and took this decision as an offense to her and her honor.[12] For her, Ozai always represented absolute power and perfection, qualities which she desired to acquire. His refusal to bring her along on a mission where the two of them would serve essentially as equals made her realize that her lust for power not only frightened her enemies but perhaps her father as well. Ozai responded by appointing Azula as the new Fire Lord to govern over the Fire Nation in his absence, temporarily satisfying her desire for power. However, she was unable to cope with the fact that the only human being who may have ever loved her was not only ashamed of her but still possessed power over her. Her father was the last person Azula thought she could trust, and Ozai's refusal to include her in his final conquest only served to cause Azula more inner pain. Knowing that her father would neither submit to her will nor love her, Azula's grip on reality began to steadily plummet.\n\nAngry Azula yells\nAzula's flawless demeanor was shattered by the unanticipated betrayal of Mai.\nOn the day of her coronation, Azula became excessively paranoid and gave into her fear of betrayal and being killed. She accused her servant of purposely leaving a pit in her cherry so that she would choke and got angry at the Dai Li when they arrived five minutes after they had been summoned, suggesting that their laxness could have allowed an assassin to sneak in, kill her, and \"be on his merry way\". Musing over the possibility that the Dai Li could betray and kill her, Mai and Ty Lee's treason still fresh in memory, she banished them.[1]\n\nIt also appeared that she was not sleeping well, as she had dark circles under her eyes. Upon Lo and Li's arrival to counsel her, Azula's fear of disappointing her father was clear. She became so enraged when her old mentors proposed to postpone her coronation that she momentarily forgot they were not firebenders and ordered them to fight an Agni Kai with each other. Ultimately, Azula addressed Li as Lo and banished her, leaving the sisters confused as to which of them had to leave.[1]\n\nHaving sent off her staff, she was left alone to style her own hair for the coronation. Frustrated by her inability to tie up her hair bun, she \"fixed\" the situation by cutting off a part of her hair, leaving it a tattered mess. Panting in frustration, she saw her mother in her mirror in an apparent hallucination. Ursa complimented her, saying that she always had such beautiful hair, though Azula dismissed the compliment and asked her mother why she was there. When Ursa told her that she would not miss her daughter's coronation, Azula told her not to pretend to act proud, stating that she knew her mother thought she was a monster. The hallucination of her mother refuted that, saying she did not think that, that Azula was just confused, and that she loved her. Azula could not cope with the declaration of love and threw her brush at the mirror, shattering it, before breaking down crying.[1]\n\nThis incident exposed a complex facet to Azula's persona. Although outwardly maintaining a cold and dismissive opinion of her mother, Ursa's banishment ultimately had a devastating impact upon Azula's fragile psyche.[11] As Azula's sanity began slipping away from her, this inability to reconcile her perceived belief that Ursa considered her a monster with the truer (though idealized but still true) maternal feelings of love and support that Ursa demonstrated in the hallucination created an inescapable conflict in Azula's mind that furthered her eventual mental collapse.[1] Another thread of this argument explored the possibility that although she was fully capable of acting cruelly without showing any outright regret, deep down, a part of her could tell what she did was wrong and felt regret over it, but it was just her indomitable will and emotional control that prevented her from showing it for many years. Nevertheless, despite years of such dark deeds, what remained of her conscience, in the form of her mother Ursa (whose love and guidance she secretly longed for but falsely believed she could never have), could still manifest at this point and reared itself stronger than before. Ursa's gentle, motherly concerns over Azula's use of fear and cruelty as her only means of maintaining relationships with friends and family alike induced a violent mental breakdown prior to her coronation; after breaking the mirror, Azula collapsed and sobbed deeply before regaining any semblance of control.[1]\n\nAzula's vision\nVisibly unstable, Azula saw a hallucination of her mother as her sanity began to unravel.\nAzula showed up at her coronation impatient and with her hair still a mess, though the event was interrupted when Katara and Zuko arrived to challenge her. She did not hesitate to challenge her brother to an Agni Kai and darkly smiled when it happened that outright indicated she was more obsessed with killing Zuko personally than tactically dealing with both Zuko and Katara when she challenged him to a one-on-one fight, considering the fact she could just have what remained of the Fire Nation army attack them. Her unstable condition shone through visibly, as Zuko could easily pick up on it, and this was shown further as her apparent madness weakened her fighting abilities for Zuko to decisively overpower her eventually.[1] She also was instantly goaded by Zuko into using lightning despite knowing he could redirect it and only changed her mind in the last moment to avoid what would certainly have been defeat by targeting Katara, leaving Zuko incapacitated, at which point Azula showed an increasing level of mockery toward the duo. Her arrogance and mental state eventually allowed Katara, despite clearly being far less powerful than Azula due to Sozin's Comet, to defeat and chain her to the ground. The moment Azula saw Zuko rose, the Fire Nation princess screamed in anger and outrage while breathing fire uncontrollably and furiously struggling to break herself free, falling into complete insanity, sobbing loudly. She dragged herself along the ground helplessly, the full extent of her madness causing both Zuko and Katara to watch with clear sadness despite all she had put them through.[13] This breakdown was the culmination of her failed relationship with her mother and her jealousy toward Zuko for receiving more of their mother's affection,[11] the betrayal she suffered at the hands of Mai and Ty Lee,[35] her defeat by Zuko and Katara and finally her failure to be crowned Fire Lord. This madness earned her Zuko's pity, and Azula was spared from prison and instead committed to a mental health facility on a nearby island in the Fire Nation for potential better treatment.\n\nAzula about to jump\nDue to her unstable mental health, Azula lost her sense of reality, causing her to act recklessly.\nA year later, a clearly mentally unstable Azula accepted the task of coaxing Ursa's whereabouts out of Ozai from Zuko, stating that not one day had gone by where she had not wondered what became of their mother.[39] In return, she requested permission to join her brother on his quest and to be allowed to travel unbound and with dignity. The Fire Lord accepted, and Azula was released. While she had regained much of her previous demeanor, as she haughtily commanded people to cater to her needs and forcefully reacted to irritating situations, though from time to time, she still suffered from psychotic episodes, thinking that everyone around her was conspiring with her mother in order to bring her down. However, she intended to find and kill Ursa in order to stop her from interfering with her plans to take the throne from Zuko.[15] In the end, however, she abandoned both of these goals once Zuko revealed that he would care for her unconditionally no matter what. Leaving Ursa alive and giving Zuko back the letter that could potentially oust him from the throne, Azula ran off from the remainder of the group.[16]\n\nAzula subsequently experienced a phase which she later described as finding her \"destiny\". Discarding many of her old desires, including the quest for total power, she overcame several of her insecurities. Although still somewhat unhinged and obsessed with ruling by instilling fear, Azula realized that she could rule through Zuko and thereby share the burden of being Fire Lord; this resulted in her feeling freer than ever before. In addition, she allowed herself to open up more to others than ever before, describing her new comrades as \"sisters\" and openly telling Zuko of her schemes. By extension, her opinion of Zuko had improved greatly; although still cruel and scathing, she insisted that he had the abilities to be \"strong\" like herself. Observing Zuko's public apology to the citizenry, Azula remained smug, confident that he would come around to her way of thinking in time.[19]\n\nAzula subsequently continued to lead her Fire Warriors through intimidation and force of personality, as she once had with Mai and Ty Lee. When the capture of one of their own inspired the others to abandon her and rescue their comrade instead, Azula once more felt furious at the betrayal and resolved to hunt the Fire Warriors down with single-minded determination. When the need for food and shelter forced her to take up residence at what appeared to be a Fire Sage Temple, Azula was initially as haughty and entitled as ever, even demanding that the temple's caretaker give up her own bed for her. When the Temple turned out to be inhabited by a powerful spirit that attempted to force an epiphany on her, Azula's inner conflict came to the surface, making it difficult for the spirit to get a proper grasp of what she truly desired. When confronted by the visions of her various relatives and former friends, Azula expressed several conflicting opinions and philosophies; she resented Ozai for turning her into who she was today yet continued to define her perceived right to rule through him, she saw apologies and redemption to be for the weak yet desired for her loved ones to ask for her forgiveness, and despite perceiving everyone else to be at fault for \"betraying\" her, she visibly freaked out whenever accused of the reverse. The spirit, in the form of Zuko, outright told Azula that the reason she surrounded herself with people to manipulate and hurt was because, if she was left all by herself, she would have no choice but to reflect on her own misdeeds. Visibly shocked by this lecture, Azula panicked and attacked the apparition instead, and when the spirit in its true form called her out on how she was ruled by her desire for revenge and cruelty, she doubled down on her principles and attacked it again. Even so, when she tracked down the \"treasonous\" Fire Warriors shortly thereafter and saw them reunited and happy, Azula chose not to fulfill her intended revenge and merely dismissed them as undeserving of her leadership.[20]\nAbilities\n\nFirebending\n\nProdigy Azula\nNine-year-old Azula flaunted her prodigious firebending skills before her grandfather.\nAzula was one of the most skilled and powerful firebenders of her time,[1][13] recognized as a prodigy by both Ozai[24] and Zuko.[5] The most notable feature of Azula's bending was her ability to create blue flames, which are much more intense than the red, orange, and yellow flames normally used by firebenders, though she was only known to bend normal colored fire during her childhood.[24] Azula also used her flames in inventive ways, such as creating jets of flames,[35][36] whirling disks,[21] and blades of fire. She often firebent using only two fingers, rather than with a closed fist or open hand as was commonly used by other firebenders.[7] Also notable was her ability to produce a greater amount of flames than most firebenders without tiring, and she was able to maintain successive assaults for long durations of time.[21]\n\nAzula demonstrated the ability to condense her flames by using two fingers, enabling her fire to cut clean through various objects. When formed into fireballs, the flames had a powerful concussive effect, able to firmly pulverize stone objects. She was also able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames that could withstand the full force of four simultaneous elemental attacks (and a boomerang).[27] She was even able to charge up her fire before releasing it, something she used during her fight with Aang.[28] She could easily defeat Zuko during the Confrontation at Tu Zin and keep Aang on the defensive, eventually overwhelming the Avatar, even fighting off the entire Team Avatar successfully before running when Toph arrived. Azula was even able to defeat Aang when he had mastered Air, Water, and Earthbending twice.[9] Azula was also capable of fighting off and defeating multiple Kyoshi Warriors, using both firebending and hand-to-hand techniques.[29]\n\nBlue fire shield\nAzula was well known for her trademark blue firebending.\nThe depth of Azula's potential was demonstrated in her use of advanced techniques, such as creating large blasts of flame, evaporating a wave of water that Katara threw at her, using her flames to propel herself forward like a jet, and minutes later producing and guiding lightning.[9] While she used her firebending less after returning home, she did demonstrate her abilities a few times, such as when she used her firebending to give extra propulsion to a kuai ball during a game, creating an explosion.[11] She also used her firebending to break free of her shackles and briefly attacked Sokka, Aang, and Toph.[10] Azula engaged in a pitched battle with Zuko and Sokka on the gondola, where despite Zuko's vast improvement in firebending and Sokka's adept swordsmanship skills, she still managed to fight them both on reasonably even footing, countering all of Zuko's fire blasts and returning with her own and forcing her brother to dodge a charged blast from her.[35] Her later duel with the improved Zuko ended in a standstill, with Azula deflecting all of Zuko's large and powerful fire blasts and returning with her own, before unleashing a devastating blue-fire enhanced fist attack that rivaled Zuko's own and caused a large explosion that separated them both. In addition to creating her usual powerful fire balls, she was able to shoot her flames behind her in order to propel herself through the air onto the gondola.[35]\n\nShe was proficient in the highly difficult technique of generating lightning, a sub-skill of firebending,[26] displaying a fine control of this skill. She could perform minute flickers of lightning, which she used to both temporarily blind Zuko or disarm Sokka of his boomerang, as well as produce large, compressed balls of lightning, as exemplified when she created such a ball to send away a swarm of moth wasps, who were attracted by the intense light.[15] After learning of the ability to also redirect lightning, she applied herself to the technique and came to master it as well. With this ability, she proved to be more than a match for Zuko in their next battle.[19]\n\nAzula fights Zuko\nAzula's firebending became more dangerous under the influence of Sozin's Comet.\nAs Azula gradually lost her sanity prior to the arrival of Sozin's Comet, her firebending became unfocused and wild, which, combined with the Comet's empowering effects, made her all the more dangerous. However, it also resulted in her becoming exhausted more easily than usual. Despite her state of mind, she retained considerably great levels of firebending power and prowess, as shown by how she was initially able to rival Zuko's equally enhanced sheets of flame with her own amplified blue flames, before she became exhausted and had to propel herself using fire jets to continue trading blows with Zuko, ultimately being overpowered by her brother, forcing her to resort to attacking Katara with lightning to incapacitate him, and afterward was able to dominate Katara, fiercely firing wide strikes of lightning and enormous blue flame blasts as well as propelling herself quickly through the air to keep chase. However, her mental instability ultimately proved to have hindered her fighting prowess enough for Azula to finally be defeated by Katara despite at the time being far more powerful than her. She displayed the ability to breathe fire as she struggled with her chains and lost all sanity.[1][13]\n\nIntelligence\n\nTracking Appa\nAzula realized right away that Aang wanted to trick her, telling Mai and Ty Lee to follow Appa's real trail while she fought the Avatar.\nAzula was an extremely intelligent and cunning strategist. She was also a highly studious girl. Since childhood, she was well-versed in her nation's military history as she successfully recounted Fire Lord Sozin's strategy in an old battle.[24] She planned a trap for Iroh and Zuko, which was only accidentally foiled by the captain of her ship.[26] She immediately discerned the Avatar's plan to mislead her with a false trail.[27] She also displayed incredible fighting prowess in learning the fighting styles of her foes, such as the sweeping wind kick ability displayed by Aang against her during the battle of the drill. She imitated it in the form of a sweeping fire kick during her battle with the Kyoshi warriors tending to Appa, utilizing that move to end her battle with Suki. With the Kyoshi warriors finally captured, Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai used their robes, stealing their identities to freely enter Ba Sing Se and the Earth King's palace, beginning her coup against the Earth King. This coup was single-handedly orchestrated by her, winning Ba Sing Se for the Fire Nation.[8][9] During the Day of Black Sun, she laid a trap for Aang and his friends using Dai Li agents in the Fire Lord's throne room, ensuring that the eclipse time would be used up.[10] She also displayed the ability to be so extremely capable of lying effectively that even Toph could not sense it regardless of how blatant the lie was, showing that Azula did not feel remorse for lying or many of her other actions.[10] She also displayed an ability to realize whether or not someone was telling the truth, stating simply that she was a \"people person\".[35]\n\nEven under the effects of her mental illness, her wit and ability to strategize were not completely lost, as despite being excessively provoked by Zuko's taunts of fearing his lightning redirection, she still could come up with a strategy to overpower her brother by aiming the lightning at Katara instead, which succeeded in incapacitating Zuko. A year later, she managed to use the after effects of chi-blocking, which caused her body joints to become extremely flexible, to free herself from her restraints and from Zuko. On another occasion, she was able to save Team Avatar from a swarm of moth wasps by using a lightning ball to attract them due to the intense light.\n\nAzula's intelligence made her very skillful in manipulating people. She used this skill on many subjects, including her brother Zuko,[9] her mother Ursa,[24] Long Feng,[8][9] the Dai Li,[8][9] Sokka,[10] and even her father to an extent.\n\nOther skills\n\nAzula evades Team Avatar\nAzula made up for her handicap with dexterity and agility to evade Aang and Toph.\nAzula's high-level skill in unarmed combat was displayed several times during the series. She easily avoided Zuko's frenzied knife attacks without the use of firebending, guiding his hands off course.[26] Later, she proceeded to disarm Suki and knocked her off her feet without bending.[29] She also had some skill with hidden weaponry, as she intended on using a shuriken knife during the eclipse.[10] Her acrobatics and use of a hidden shuriken knife were apparently skills she picked up from Ty Lee and Mai, respectively.[46] Azula was very agile as she was able to run up walls and perform mid-air twirls. She dodged Aang and Toph's bending attacks with little to no effort using high jumps like Ty Lee, ultimately making Aang admit she was too fast to hit.[10] Her physical strength was also adept as she could perform a planche, supporting her body in a horizontal position just by using her arms, with little effort"

For the character in Netflix's live-action series, see\nKatara.\n\nKatara asserting her protective nature to Sokka.[1]\nI WILL NEVER, EVER TURN MY BACK ON PEOPLE WHO NEED ME!\n\nKatara was a waterbending master, born in the Southern Water Tribe to Chief Hakoda and his wife Kya. During her childhood, she was the only waterbender living in the Southern Water Tribe. After losing her mother in a Fire Nation raid and her father left to battle against the Fire Nation in the Hundred Year War, she was raised by her paternal grandmother Kanna alongside her older brother Sokka. As a teenager, Katara and her brother discovered the young Air Nomad Avatar, Aang, who had been frozen in an iceberg with his bison, Appa, for a century.[15] In need of a waterbending master, the siblings and Aang left the South Pole on a journey toward the Northern Water Tribe.[10]\n\nRealizing Aang was the Avatar, Katara and Sokka continued to travel with him across the world as he mastered the remaining elements, earth and fire. She became Aang's waterbending instructor after their departure from the Northern Water Tribe, replacing Master Pakku,[16] who had instructed them during their time there. Her mastery of water made her a formidable asset to the group. The siblings' assistance helped Aang halt the Fire Nation's ambitions of world domination, ending the century-long war, and finally restoring balance to the world.[17]\n\nThe murder of her mother[18] and the later departure of her warrior father[15] left Katara feeling traumatized and alone.[19] Though she was cared for by Kanna,[15][10] she invariably found herself filling the mother role left behind by Kya, even to her own older brother. Katara soon took on many of the responsibilities expected of an adult and quickly became independent and strong-willed. Morally and emotionally driven, she developed a great sense of justice and compassion for others, becoming fiercely protective of those in need.\n\nAfter the Hundred Year War ended, Katara and Aang began a close romantic relationship[17] that eventually led to marriage and raised a family with three children: Bumi, a nonbender who gained the ability to airbend later in life,[20] Kya, a waterbender, and Tenzin, an airbender. Later in life, Katara became highly regarded as a master waterbender, and even said to be the best healer in the world.[21] After Aang's passing, she became Avatar Korra's waterbending teacher[22] and helped her to recover physically from her ordeal with the Red Lotus.[23]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the name of Katara's brother? toggle section\nWho raised Katara and her brother after their parents were gone? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of Katara being the only waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe? toggle section\nHow did Katara's mother die? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Katara and Aang? toggle section\n\nHistory\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn into the diminished Southern Water Tribe capital of Wolf Cove to Hakoda and Kya, Katara faced the reality of her tribe's dwindling strength from an early age. At the time of her birth, fifty years of repeated Fire Nation raids intended to capture and imprison the tribe's waterbenders had left them devoid of benders. While the Southern Water Tribe's defenses would have crumbled under the might of the Fire Nation, the tribe's relative inaccessibility in the frigid South Pole and the Fire Nation's perception that they were a non-threat meant that they were mostly left alone. Katara grew up within a loving, close family and community in her tribe. When she was six years old, she broke a tooth on some seal jerky made by Ashuna.[24]\n\nYoung Katara throwing a snowball\nKatara was having a snowball fight with her brother shortly before the raid that killed their mother.\nHowever, when Katara was eight, the Fire Nation again raided Wolf Cove when charged by Fire Lord Azulon to find and dispose of the last remaining waterbender in the tribe. During the battle, the leader of the raid Yon Rha confronted Katara's mother, who was taking refuge in the family's igloo. Seeking shelter with her mother, Katara ran back to her home and interrupted their exchange. Realizing the intentions of Yon Rha, who had demanded Kya tell him the identity of the waterbender, Kya insisted Katara leave and gave herself up as the last waterbender, lying to protect her daughter. Katara ran to fetch her father, but by the time they returned, Yon Rha had left and her mother had been killed.[18] The death of their mother had a profound impact on both Katara and Sokka, and both began to feel deep hatred and resentment toward the Fire Nation as a result.\n\nWith the absence of a mother figure in the family, Katara soon found herself filling the role left behind by Kya. She began to take on many of the domestic responsibilities expected of women of the Southern Water Tribe, despite her young age. When Katara was around twelve years old, her father, Chief Hakoda, left to fight in the Hundred Year War with the rest of the men of the Southern Water Tribe.[15] Katara and Sokka were left in the care of their grandmother, Kanna. Though Kanna loved the two and cared deeply for them, Katara was left feeling traumatized and alone. Living in a tribe consisting almost completely of women, children, and the elderly, she took care of not only her own family but of the whole Southern Water Tribe as well.[10]\n\nWinter 99 AG\n\nMain article: History of Katara (85 AG - 100 AG)\nKatara frees Aang\nKatara freeing Aang and Appa from the iceberg.\nWhile on a fishing trip for Wolf Cove, Katara and her older brother, Sokka, accidentally steered their canoe into a rip current, where it was crushed between ice floes. The two found themselves stranded on a chunk of ice. After Sokka blamed their situation on Katara, Katara grew so angry that she inadvertently exploded an iceberg behind her with her waterbending. Katara and Sokka discovered a mysterious figure trapped in a large spherical iceberg that rose to the surface. The figure introduced himself as Aang, an airbender, and offered to escort them home on his flying bison, Appa.[15] After her village was attacked by soldiers on a Fire Nation ship commanded by Prince Zuko, Katara learned that Aang was the Avatar. She and her brother set out to save Aang, who had surrendered to Zuko to keep the village from harm. After their successful rescue, and after witnessing Aang's impressive first display of the Avatar State, Katara mused that they might find a waterbending teacher at the North Pole, at which, Aang quickly brightened up and suggested he and Katara could learn together. The three began their journey to the North Pole.[10] Throughout their journey, the group stopped in several locations across the world, mostly in the war-torn Earth Kingdom. Their first stop was the Southern Archipelago, where they first helped a local dojo[25] before arriving at the Southern Air Temple, where Aang had grown up. After Aang came across Monk Gyatso's corpse and reflexively entered the Avatar State, Katara was able to calm him down.[26] The trio stopped on Kyoshi Island, where they were ambushed by Prince Zuko and barely managed to escape.[27]\n\nFollowing this encounter, the team journeyed to the great Earth Kingdom metropolis of Omashu. On the way, they intervened in the siege of Shen Guan.[28] Upon arriving at Omashu, they were brought before the city's elderly king who treated them as honored guests before promptly imprisoning them. Katara and her brother were given jennamite crystals that nearly covered their whole bodies, before Aang solved all the king's tasks, discovering that he was a childhood friend, Bumi.[3] Before reaching the Northern Water Tribe, the trio had several other adventures while being pursued by multiple firebenders, including Zuko and his uncle Iroh, as well as Zhao of the Fire Nation Navy. Among their missions, the group helped several earthbenders to escape from a Fire Nation prison rig, including Haru and his father Tyro.[29] They helped the people of Senlin Village, who were being attacked by the spirit Hei Bai, before venturing to the Fire Nation where Aang learned about the urgency of defeating the Fire Lord by Avatar Roku.[30][31] The trio barely escaped the clutches of Zuko and a group of pirates during a confrontation where Katara lost her mother's necklace, a precious keepsake.[32] She also discovered the darker side of the resistance, when they came into contact with Jet and his Freedom Fighters who tried to destroy the village of Gaipan to kill its firebender occupants.[33] The team also helped two warring tribes, the Zhang and the Gan Jin, cross the Great Divide and to make peace, and later encountered Bato, one of Hakoda's friends and a Southern Water Tribe warrior, where they almost departed from Aang before being reunited due to an unexpected shirshu attack.[34][35] The team met Jeong Jeong later on their journey, who unsuccessfully tried to teach Aang the weight of firebending.[36] During Aang's training, Katara was burned and discovered that she had healing abilities.[36] When the group reached the Northern Air Temple, they defended a group of refugees led by a mechanist from War Minister Qin.[36][37]\n\nKatara vs Master Pakku\nKatara fighting Master Pakku for her right to learn waterbending.\nAfter their long journey, the team reached the Northern Water Tribe, where Sokka and Katara were celebrated as kin from the Southern Tribe, and Aang was honored as a special guest. It was decided that Aang would be taught waterbending by Master Pakku, but Katara was prohibited from learning combative bending on account of her gender. After it was discovered that Aang was secretly teaching Pakku's techniques to Katara at night, the master dismissed Aang as a student. At the palace, Katara pleaded with Chief Arnook for Pakku to take Aang back as his student. The master agreed to do so if Katara apologized, and while she conceded at first, she renounced her apology and challenged the master to a duel after being patronized. Although Katara was defeated, the master picked up her necklace, revealing that he had made it for Kanna sixty years prior, and decided to accept Katara as a student.[38] When the Fire Nation's ships arrived at the Northern Water Tribe, Yue took Katara and Aang to a hidden oasis, where Aang crossed over to the Spirit World. After Zuko unexpectedly arrived, Katara dueled him and was able to restrain him by freezing him in ice, but the prince overpowered her when the sun rose and kidnapped the Avatar.[39] Katara and her allies searched for and found Aang in the frozen landscape outside Agna Qel'a, and on their return, confronted Zhao, before the admiral killed the Moon Spirit, Tui. Failing to revive the dead koi with healing, Princess Yue realized that it was her destiny to give her life to repay the Moon Spirit, and transcended to the Spirit World. Aang won the battle after merging with the Ocean Spirit La and repelled the Fire Navy from the tribe. With the group now ready to move on and find an earthbending teacher for Aang, Pakku assigned Katara as Aang's new waterbending master.[16]\n\nSpring 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Katara (Spring 100 AG)\nDuel at Omashu\nKatara fighting Mai in Omashu.\nKatara and the others sailed back to the southern Earth Kingdom so Aang could learn from King Bumi. While they stayed at an Earth Kingdom stronghold to be escorted ot the city, General Fong placed Katara's life in danger to induce Aang's Avatar State; but achieved only the destruction of his own fort.[40] During their journey to Omashu, Team Avatar met with Chong, Lily, and Moku, and with their help passed through a labyrinth and reached the city, only to find that it had fallen to the Fire Nation.[41] In the city, it was revealed that King Bumi had intentionally been captured, and Katara and the rest of the team barely managed to escape Princess Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee.[42] The team was later stuck together in the Foggy Swamp, experiencing hallucinations; Katara's own vision was one of her late mother.[43] Following their escape, the team visited Chin Village, where Aang was placed under for one of Avatar Kyoshi's crimes, and it fell upon the siblings to prove Aang's innocence. Although unsuccessful, they were pardoned after saving the village from the Rough Rhinos.[44] After the earthbender Toph Beifong joined the group in Gaoling to teach Aang, Katara initially quarreled with the new member of the group, but after being pursued by Azula, they began to trust each other more and became close friends.[45][46] Soon after Toph started teaching Aang earthbending, they were attacked by Fire Army troops and Katara was separated from the rest of the team. She ended up in a small Earth Kingdom town where she encountered and befriended the pirate leader Jiang and her crew after helping them with a smuggling mission. She was reunited with the rest of Team Avatar the same day and parted ways with the pirates.[13] Along with the others and Professor Zei of Ba Sing Se University, Katara visited Wan Shi Tong's library, where they learned that an eclipse would leave the Fire Nation vulnerable to invasion.[47] Katara proved vital in Team Avatar's escape from the Si Wong Desert after Appa's kidnapping by Si Wong tribesmen, and helped a family of refugees cross the Serpent's Pass.[48][49]\n\nKatara revives Aang\nKatara reviving Aang.\nAfter reaching the Earth Kingdom's capital, Katara first helped to thwart another of Qin's plans, by helping destroy the Fire Nation Drill, before being welcomed into the city.[4][50] Though they wished to inform the Earth King about the invasion plans, they were turned away, and found that a government conspiracy was taking place in the city.[4] After the team recuperated while waiting to meet with the king, they resumed their search for Appa and eventually found him in the captivity of the Dai Li, a secret police force under the leadership of Long Feng, who had complete control over the city and controlled Earth King Kuei as a puppet.[2][51] Team Avatar managed to subdue the Dai Li and began to plan an invasion of the Fire Nation in cooperation with the Council of Five, but a coup led by Azula hindered their plans.[52][53] In the Crystal Catacombs below the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace, Katara encountered both Prince Zuko and his sister Azula, battling them both even after a brief moment of understanding between Katara and Zuko. A battle ensued where Aang was mortally wounded by Azula's lightning, before he and Katara managed to escape. With the city fallen to the Fire Nation, Team Avatar fled Ba Sing Se with the Earth King.[54]\n\nSummer 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Katara (Summer 100 AG)\nKatara and the Painted Lady\nKatara being approached by the real Painted Lady.\nAfter the fall of Ba Sing Se, Katara spent her time trying to heal an unconscious Aang while aboard a stolen Fire Nation ship with the rest of Team Avatar and several other allies, including her own father.[19] Eventually, Katara and the rest of her small team traveled through the Fire Nation disguised as civilians.[55] Among several adventures, Katara helped clean the Jang Hui River from pollution after disguising herself as the Painted Lady, and bettered her relationship with Toph, when she saved both of them from Combustion Man in Fire Fountain City.[1][56] In one village, Katara met a Southern waterbender named Hama and began to learn the Southern style of bending from her, but turned on the woman after she revealed that she was a bloodbender. Katara was forced to use the art against Hama in order to save Aang and Sokka from harm.[57] When the day of the invasion arrived, Katara and the rest of the team met with the rest of the invasion force and started to stealthily advance toward the capital via waterbending-powered submarines designed by the Northern Air Temple's mechanist. During the eclipse, the invasion advanced steadily toward Caldera City, while Aang reached the Fire Nation Royal Palace.[58] It was quickly revealed that the invasion had been anticipated and the Fire Nation's counterattack with airships destroyed much of the invasion force, with only Team Avatar and a few younger allies managing to escape.[59]\n\nKatara freezes Azula\nKatara imprisoning Azula in ice.\nAfter the failed invasion, Katara and her friends retreated to the Western Air Temple, where they started searching for a new firebending master to teach Aang, and unexpectedly found one in Zuko, who introduced himself as an ally. The relationship between Zuko and Katara was at first intense and troublesome, with Katara determined to never forgive Zuko for his betrayal in Ba Sing Se.[60] Eventually, Katara forgave Zuko for his actions after he helped to find Yon Rha, the man who killed her mother. Although she did confront the man, she hesitated from ending his life, but was able to move past her grief, and her grudge against Zuko.[18] Right before the final battle between Team Avatar and the Fire Nation, Katara and the rest of the team retreated to Ember Island. The team watched a play performed by the Ember Island Players, with Katara growing embarrassed and annoyed while viewing an exaggerated caricature of herself.[61] Although the team had wished to only battle Ozai after Sozin's Comet, they were made to act against the Fire Lord as soon as possible after Zuko revealed the plan to annihilate the Earth Kingdom.[62] After Aang's unexpected disappearance, the team traveled to the Earth Kingdom before going separate ways, with Katara and Zuko heading to the Fire Nation to confront Azula.[63] After the pair interrupted Azula's coronation as Fire Lord, a fierce Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai was fought between the two siblings, and Katara was saved from an unexpected lightning blast by Zuko, who redirected the attack.[64] Katara eventually managed to goad Azula into walking directly over a grate of water. While freezing her opponent in ice, Katara was able to chain the princess to the grate before rushing to Zuko and healing him.[17][64] She was present at Zuko's coronation after the team's successful victory in the century-long war. Later, Katara traveled to the Jasmine Dragon with Team Avatar, celebrating their hard-won victory. She followed Aang outside the tea shop and embraced him. The pair subsequently looked at each other lovingly before she instigated a romantic kiss, beginning the couple's formal relationship.[17]\n\n100 - 102 AG\n\nMain article: History of Katara (100 AG - 102 AG)\nAang and Katara's future\nKatara's vision of her and Aang in the future changed her mind about the Harmony Restoration Movement.\nIn the year following the war's conclusion, Katara and Team Avatar helped Fire Nation colonials resettle in their homeland in the Harmony Restoration Movement. However, when the group came to Yu Dao, they were attacked by Fire Army soldiers and confronted by Zuko. Aang and Zuko began to battle, but Katara managed to calm her boyfriend after he entered the Avatar State. The Fire Lord explained that unlike in the newer colonies, people of Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom descent had been living together for generations.[65] Katara and the team traveled to Ba Sing Se to discuss the Yu Dao situation with the Earth King, and while waiting, the couple met a group of young women who had devoted themselves to Aang and Air Nomad teachings. Though Katara grew somewhat jealous, she realized that they reminded Aang of his people. The couple failed to dissuade the Earth King from attacking the Fire Nation colonies and returned to Yu Dao to evacuate its citizens, where they were confronted by the Yu Dao Resistance before they explained the impending attack.[66][67] When Aang came to the conclusion that the four nations must remain separate after meeting the Air Nomad devotees in Yu Dao, Katara reminded him that the separation was an illusion. As the armies arrived, Katara told him that she saw their own future as a couple of different nations reflected in the families of Yu Dao. As the battle raged on, Katara propelled herself up to the Earth King's war balloon to help convince him that he was fighting a battle against his own nation. After the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation agreed to make peace, Katara observed Aang welcome his devotees as the first Air Acolytes.[67]\n\nKatara trapping Azula\nKatara restrained Azula during her psychotic episode on the journey to Hira'a.\nSometime later, Zuko invited Katara, Sokka, and Aang on a search for his mother. As they readied to depart, Katara was horrified to see Azula, apparently escaped, but Zuko explained that she was coming with them in return for obtaining information from Ozai. Katara was unhappy with her coming with the team and helped to apprehend Azula during her psychotic episodes on their journey to Hira'a.[68] In the town, Katara and Aang were welcomed by Noren and Noriko, with the former telling them that Ursa's lover Ikem headed to Forgetful Valley. As they ventured into the environment, the group was attacked by their surroundings, though Katara deduced that it was the work of a waterbender, and Rafa and Misu showed themselves.[69] Another confrontation with Azula was halted by the appearance of the Mother of Faces. The ancient spirit began to battle the group, but it was halted when the spirit was reminded of her son Koh. Rafa's face was restored and Noriko was given back her memories and appearance as Ursa. Although Azula had escaped, Katara and Aang remained optimistic that she had begun to change.[70] Katara stayed in the Fire Nation for several weeks afterward and comforted Ursa during her anxious return to the Fire Nation Capital.[71]\n\nToph refusing to bow\nKatara happily took part in a bowing ceremony as part of Yangchen's Festival in the Yue Bay area.\nThe team returned to Yu Dao after the conclusion of peace talks and the formation of the coalition government. After a banquet, she found Aang meditating, who told her that he had seen a vision of Avatar Yangchen. Reminded of Yangchen's Festival, Katara set off with Aang and the Acolytes to pay their respects in the Yue Bay area. Katara consoled Aang when they found an industrial town built on previously sacred ground, and was surprised to see her childhood friends Niyok and Nutha in the area.[72] Katara and the team were confronted by Loban's guards and the Rough Rhinos for trespassing on the Earthen Fire Refinery. She discovered an iron ore mine during the fight, but the area was unstable and began to cave in, with Katara and several others only being saved by Toph's earthbending.[73] With Katara lending her support to Toph, the group was eventually freed with the aid of Aang and Toph's metalbending students. As a dangerous storm brewed on the horizon, Katara helped evacuate the town's houses and businesses before the arrival of General Old Iron. After the spirit's defeat, she reminisced with Niyok and Nutha and lent her emotional support to Aang in his challenging situation.[24]\n\nSiku and Sura waterbending\nKatara inspired Siku and Sura to waterbend.\nKatara and Sokka returned to Ba Sing Se for some time afterward, where they prepared to return home for the first time since they left the South Pole.[74] Katara was surprised to find that Wolf Cove had grown into an urbanized city, with the Southern Reconstruction Project already underway. The siblings reunited with their grandmother, step-grandfather, and father, and met Maliq and Malina, who were managing the redevelopment project. Katara expressed skepticism for the project, as she had seen foreign workers harassing the locals. After Malina was robbed, Katara and Sokka chased the thief to an abandoned ship, where Gilak and Thod explained that they believed that foreigners were making them weak and they had to be removed. The siblings escaped Gilak's men and headed back to the city, where they were surprised to discover their father's romantic relationship with Malina.[75] Katara remained skeptical of both the romance and the project and also met a pair of children that Pakku was trying to train as waterbenders. Aang also arrived in the South, following the end of the threat in the Fire Nation, as well as Toph, aiding in the construction. Katara later spoke to Sokka about how Gilak may have a point, only for Sokka to tell her that the idealistic vision Katara had of the tribe never existed. This left her realizing that her brother was right, as she had no idea of what the Southern Water Tribe was like before the war.[76]\n\nAt a festival, Gilak's men attacked, chi-blocking Katara and stabbing Hakoda.[76] After her father's recovery, Earth King Kuei was kidnapped. Katara participated in the skirmish at the Bridge of No Return, managing to save Malina from falling into a ravine. Afterward, she managed to inspire Siku and Sura to display their waterbending skills.[77]\n\nKatara advices Aang\nKatara asked Aang to be sure he was making the right decision about removing Liling's bending.\nLater, Katara made her way to Yu Dao with the team, though they stopped at Cranefish Town upon Toph's request. The group was stunned to see the growth of the town and Earthen Fire Industries, though they learned that the city was threatened with turf wars between bending gangs and an increasing social divide between benders and nonbenders. She was awoken by a large explosion at Lao Beifong's factory shortly after their arrival and helped to put out the fire.[78] Katara and the rest of the team investigated the perpetrator, which led them to Liling and her daughters. Toph had discovered a planned bending supremacist rally, which Katara attended in disguise along with Aang and Toph. Toph confronted Liling at the rally, leading to a fight where the businesswoman was captured.[79] Katara and Toph also disagreed whether Aang should remove Liling's bending. After the woman escaped, Katara helped to battle Liling's supporters and convinced Aang to stop when he entered the Avatar State to remove Liling's bending. Following Liling's final arrest, the group felt a special connection to the city and decided to stay, helping Cranefish Town grow and prosper into a metropolis later known as Republic City.[80]\n\nLater life\n\nAang, Katara, and their children\nKatara and Aang had three children by the time they were in their early thirties: Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin.\nSometime after the Harmony Restoration Movement, Katara married Aang and gave birth to three children: Bumi, a nonbender who gained the ability to airbend later in life; Kya, a waterbender; and Tenzin, who was born an airbender like his father.[81] Katara continued to develop her skills in waterbending, eventually becoming a leading expert in its various styles and respective skills and techniques, as well as being regarded as the best healer in the world. She passed on these skills to her daughter Kya, who became a renowned waterbender in her own right.[82]\n\nIn 124 AG, Katara wrote a letter to include in the book that Aang was assembling for Tenzin, in which she wished her son the joys of youth and the strength to accept his legacy as one of the world's last airbenders.[83] When Kya revealed her sexual orientation to her, Katara was supportive of her.[84] In the mid-130s AG, she joined Aang in watching Tenzin and some vandals clear the airbending gates on Air Temple Island. Aang noted that conflict resolution was not always so easy, but Katara told him to settle the easy disputes for now, as Tenzin was still young.[85]\n\nThrough Tenzin, who eventually married Pema, she became the paternal grandmother of Jinora, Ikki, Meelo, and Rohan.\n\nBefore 128 AG, Katara's efforts led to the outlawing of bloodbending in the United Republic.[86] After the passing of Avatar Aang and his reincarnation into the new Avatar, Korra, she became the Avatar's waterbending teacher once again.[87]\n\nKatara trains Korra\nKatara trained Korra in waterbending outside of her family's hut in the Southern Water Tribe.\nDuring one of her early training sessions with a young Korra, Katara taught her that waterbending was all about slow and calm movements. Her lesson did not stick with the Avatar, however, as she accidentally buried Katara under a pile of snow, not for the first time, when she tried to copy the elder's moves. Uncovering the elder, Senna apologized for her daughter, though Katara brushed it off, noting that she had battled more dangerous waterbenders during her life than the youngster and expressing her confidence that the Avatar will learn to control her abilities in time. The session got cut short by Tonraq that day, as a snowstorm was heading their way. Upon learning the next day that Korra had sneaked out during the bad weather, Katara joined Tonraq and Senna during their search for their daughter. Discovering the young Avatar safe and sound with a polar bear pup whom she desired to keep, Katara took the reluctant Tonraq and Senna aside and convinced them to let her bring the animal home, noting that every Avatar had had an animal guide and that raising Naga may be exactly what the high-energy Avatar needed.[88] Afterward, Katara and Korra's waterbending lessons continued. Korra often spent a lot of time in Katara's healing hut growing up, where she taught Korra to mend wounds and broken bones.[89] Korra eventually became a skilled healer under Katara's instruction.[22]\n\nKatara and the Order of the White Lotus\nKatara told the Order of the White Lotus that Korra was ready to start her airbending training with Tenzin.\nIn 170 AG, Katara supervised Korra's firebending test alongside other members of the Order of the White Lotus. She noted the Avatar's ferocity, to which the White Lotus leader responded that she also lacked restraint. After Korra defeated her opponents, the White Lotus turned to Katara for counsel, wondering whether or not they should let Korra start her airbending training with Tenzin, since the young Avatar had yet to grasp the spiritual side of bending. Confident in her son's abilities, Katara announced that she believed Korra to be ready to commence her airbending training, as Tenzin would be able to teach her what she needed to know.[90]\n\nWhen Tenzin and his family arrived at the Southern Water Tribe compound, Katara and Korra greeted Tenzin and his family. At her son's asking, Katara helped Meelo off of his head, much to her grandson's displeasure. As she expressed her joy over seeing her family again, Jinora approached her, informing her that she had read everything about her past adventures and asked what happened to Zuko's mother, Ursa. Katara attempted to elaborate, only to be interrupted by an excited Ikki, who fired several random questions at the old waterbender.\n\nKatara, Pema, and Tenzin\nKatara predicted her next grandchild would be a strong and healthy airbender.\nAs the young airbenders ran off to play in the snow, Katara turned her attention to Tenzin and Pema, the latter being pregnant with their fourth child. She predicted that the child would be an airbender, much to Pema's dismay, who explained that it would be nice to have a nonbending child like her. When asked if Tenzin and his siblings were as rambunctious as the young airbenders, Katara said that Tenzin had always been more serious than Kya and Bumi.\n\nWhen it was revealed that Korra's airbending training with Tenzin was to be delayed and the Avatar decided to find her own path by traveling to Republic City on her own, Katara was the only one who understood that Korra had to go and find her own place in the world. Confident in Korra, she gave her husband's reincarnation her blessing.[90]\n\nMonths later, after Korra's bending had been removed by Amon, Katara tried using her healing powers to restore Korra's abilities, but to no avail. She later witnessed Korra, whose bending was restored by Aang, energybend Lin Beifong, restoring her earthbending abilities.[21]\n\nKatara and her grandchildren\nKatara was hugged by her grandchildren upon their arrival for the Glacier Spirits Festival.\nSix months later, Katara invited her oldest son, Bumi, to attend the Glacier Spirits Festival with her and the rest of their family. She, alongside her daughter, awaited the arrival of her sons at the dock, having a joyful reunion with her grandchildren. She later attended the royal banquet in honor of Chief Unalaq, sitting at a table with her family, where she looked on with concern as Tenzin was being picked on by his elder siblings.\n\nThe next day, Katara encouraged Tenzin to take his siblings along with him on his trip to all the air temples, reasoning that he should cherish the time he spends with his entire family. She also felt that the three siblings should visit Aang's birthplace together. Tenzin agreed to let his siblings join him and gave his mother a farewell hug, promising to see her soon.[91] Before they all left, she gave Kya an old family picture of their family together while they were still young.[92]\n\nKatara heals Jinora\nKatara attempted to heal an unconscious Jinora, whose soul was trapped in the Spirit World.\nDuring the Water Tribe Civil War, Katara did not interfere between the two combating parties, believing her fighting days to be over,[93] and instead helped tend to injured rebels along with several other healers in her healing hut. She was sought out by her family, who brought a spiritless Jinora for her to examine. Alarmed over the amount of time Jinora had been in that state, Katara placed her granddaughter in a bath of water to heal. Assessing the situation with her bending, she stated she was unsure how much longer Jinora would be able to survive with her body and spirit separated, noting that Jinora was strong to have lasted as long as she had.[94]\n\nWhen Jinora's spirit later returned to her body, Katara happily embraced her granddaughter and later accompanied her and her family to Korra's announcement that peace was restored between the Southern and Northern Water Tribes and that the South was officially independent.[95]\n\nFive weeks after the insurrection of the Red Lotus was put down, Katara was visited by a still injured Korra and set out to heal her. Katara commented that the mercury poisoning Korra had suffered had caused a lot of internal damage. Upon being asked if she could heal it, she remarked that all she could do was help guide the young Avatar's healing process, though the ultimate result of that was out of her hands. Reminiscing on the feeling of going through a traumatic experience, she told Korra that if she dedicated herself to getting better, she would recover stronger than ever.\n\nKatara helping Korra\nKatara worked intensively with Korra to help the Avatar recuperate from her mercury poisoning.\nThe two waterbenders set out on the hard process of recovery. Progress was slow, however, and after nearly six months, a frustrated Korra snapped at Katara over the elder's inability to heal her. Katara tried to console her, stating it was all right and urging her to let her anger and frustration flow like water. When Korra admitted that she was tired of the situation, Katara told her she was not the first Avatar who had to overcome great suffering. She recalled how Aang felt about the destruction of his entire culture and revealed that he had sought meaning in his suffering, which eventually led to peace. She urged Korra to do the same and guided her to take her first steps again in a long time. Katara continued to help Korra over the next two years until she was physically fit again.[23]\n\nMore than six months after Korra's recovery, Katara came to Republic City to visit her grandchildren. She also reunited with Toph, who had come to the city to see more of her own granddaughter, Opal. Toph and Katara's families spent a day at the beach together with Korra, Asami, and Bolin. Katara and Toph reminisced about their days of pranking each other, and had fun instigating a prank war at the beach.[96]\n\nPersonality\n\nKatara had a warm, compassionate, and caring personality and often acted as a motherly figure to the group, something that often irritated the rebellious Toph.[56] She displayed deep affection for those she traveled with and was fiercely protective whenever their safety was threatened. Her inner strength kept Aang and their friends together through their most difficult experiences, even in the absence of parental figures. While the team traveled through the Si Wong Desert, she was able to hold the group together in its most desperate moments.[48] She had a soft spot for children, giving a portion of her food to a little boy in Jang Hui [1] and went as far to defend Tom-Tom, despite the fact that he was from the Fire Nation and that everyone else, with the exception of Aang, was distrustful of him for it.[42] This was because when Katara was a young girl, her mother was killed in a Fire Nation raid,[18] an event which had a tremendous impact on her life and arguably shaped her into the person she became. According to Sokka, she largely prevented their family from falling apart and took on many responsibilities to the point where she filled the void left by their mother, so much that he pictured her in place of their mother.[56]\n\nKatara as the Painted Lady\nEven if she had to hide her identity, Katara never turned her back on people who needed her.\nOverall, Katara was often marked by a fierce determination to aid others and herself stated that she would never turn away from people who need her help, even if she had other priorities at the moment.[1] According to Sokka, she was rather optimistic.[56] Placing her whole heart in whatever affairs she had, she was often easily reduced to tears. She was even willing to defend Fire Nation civilians, such as when she helped the village of Jang Hui,[1] and fought her former teacher Hama,[57] who was from the Southern Water Tribe to defend the Fire Nation village she was living in. This strong desire often frustrated others, particularly Sokka.[1]\n\nKatara was marked by a fierce desire to learn waterbending, viewing it as a part of her and her culture that needed to be expressed.[15] She may have viewed it as a hope for rebuilding her tribe and saw her mother's sacrifice not only to save a daughter but what she represented, their own bending style. Her enthusiasm for waterbending caused her to constantly train herself in the art despite she originally did not have a teacher and learnt whatever little she could with great ambition, ignoring the criticism of Sokka.[32] Her pride and strong mind caused conflict with the traditions of the Northern Water Tribe, which forbade women from learning combat focused waterbending. She became overjoyed when she finally found a master to teach her formally.[38] Like her brother, father, and grandparents, Katara was resourceful and very capable to adapt to her environment.[56] Having quickly and exemplary advanced under the tutelage of Master Pakku, he stated that she accomplished this due to her fierce determination, passion and hard work.[39]\n\nKatara was portrayed as the most mature member of the group, rarely taking part in Sokka, Aang, and Toph's goofy pranks, though she did have a sense of humor. She was a bit of a stickler for morality, even to the point of causing Sokka and Aang to faint from shock when she stated she wanted to pull a scam, as she had previously berated Toph for scamming people. Her loss was part of what drove her in her fight against the Fire Nation, although she did not exhibit as much outward prejudice as her brother. Although Sokka told Toph that Katara could be a pain and would get \"involved and in-your-business\",[56] she is understanding of other people's privacy, continually scolding her brother for snooping around Hama's inn and rummaging through her personal belongings.[57]\n\nOn the other hand, Katara could be overly domineering. For all her kindness, she was sometimes self-righteous, had a nasty temper, and could be fierce when provoked. With lack of sleep, this side of her could quickly become more apparent.[46] She was also set in her ideals and frequently refused to relent on her views in the face of opposition. Combined with her strong sense of compassion, this gave Katara a strong sense of justice and she would run headlong into often dangerous situations to help others, which was best illustrated when she faked to be an earthbender to mix with innocent earthbenders in the prison rig when she was not a fighter yet,[29] challenged the greatest waterbending instructor in the Northern Tribe for forbidding women from learning combat-focused waterbending, and destroying factories for their culpability in the severe contamination at Jang Hui while she infiltrated the Fire Nation.[1] Her short temper led to somewhat frequent, petty clashes with others, as she showed open, but short-lived, jealousy of Aang's talent,[32] and was frequently perturbed by Toph's confrontational and rebellious nature.[46][56]\n\nDespite being one of the more compassionate members of the group, Katara was one of the least willing to let go of a grudge, especially against those who she felt had betrayed her trust. She held a considerable grudge against those who had threatened Aang or had done things she considered morally wrong.[33][51] Upon her re-encounter with Jet, Katara reacted hostilely at the mere sight of him.[51] For a while, she was argumentative with her father because she felt that he had abandoned her and Sokka when he left to fight in the War.[19] At the Western Air Temple, she showed outright hostility toward Zuko and threatened to kill him if he slipped back to his old ways,[60] being harsh and unforgiving of Zuko even long after he had joined Team Avatar and gained the trust of everyone else.[18] However, this could be because Zuko's betrayal of her at Ba Sing Se[54] was far more personal than his betrayal of anyone else. However, Katara was sometimes willing to give people second chances. With much reluctance, she allowed Jet to guide Team Avatar to Appa, and appeared to be saddened by his death.[51] Also, she offered to try and heal Zuko's scar when they were enemies.[54] Eventually, even after his betrayal, she decided to forgive him and embraced him as a friend after he helped her find the man who killed her mother.[18]\n\nThe loss of her mother at the hands of the Fire Nation caused Katara to strongly express her emotions about that day to her teammates, bringing up the topic in situations that tested the feelings of both her friends and herself, reinforcing her relationship with her mother, albeit indirectly.[15][18][54] Occasionally, this fervor also blinded her from the fact that the people around her had also suffered from similar experiences and events that equally impacted them. An example of this was when Katara described her mother as just hers and without giving a second thought that she was Sokka's as well, or when the waterbender told her brother that he did not love their mother the way she did after Sokka tried to stop Katara from tracking Kya's murderer, greatly upsetting him. When she got the chance to exert her revenge against the commander she believed was the killer, Katara was willing to use bloodbending against him, ignoring Aang's earlier advice to forgive rather than take revenge. She deeply regretted her actions after realizing she had bloodbent the wrong man, although she was not above planning to kill the murderer, only for her self-conscience to stop her from almost executing him, understanding that violence was not the answer.[18]\n\nMotherly and feminine as she was, Katara was not afraid to go beyond her feminine looks and way of being to achieve what she wanted. When she and Toph were denied entrance to a rowdy pub because the both of them were girls, they dressed up as boys. Katara, in particular, showed her masculine side when wanting to ride the pub's mechanized bull; being even willing to start an all-out brawl with some of the men there who mocked her ability to stay on the bull. The whole thing ended with Toph dragging Katara away before things came to a head. The two later went to a spa and reflected on how being a girl was not so bad at all.[97]\nAbilities\n\nWaterbending\n\nKatara's most notable ability was her waterbending. She rapidly developed her skill at the art, as her fierce resolve to master the element helped her become one of the most powerful waterbending masters in her era.[39] Katara was identified as a waterbender when she was a small child after she cracked some ice when her brother teased her. She kept practicing even though she did not have a teacher as her father could not find any,[98] learning whatever little she could with great ambition. Over the course of her childhood, she taught herself basic waterbending techniques and managed to master some simple waterbending forms.[15][32] This was a difficult feat, considering she would have never had the chance to observe waterbending in practice.[38] As of the discovery of Aang at the South Pole, Katara was capable of \"pushing and pulling\" water, streaming small amounts and manipulating it into basic forms and movements,[32] and was beginning to gain some control over the ability to change its physical state, freezing it into ice,[33] as well as attempting to create sizable waves of water. What little she knew, she taught to Aang, who quickly mastered all she had to offer. That which had taken her years to achieve, Aang managed to imitate and outperform her within mere minutes, much to her envy and frustration.[32]\n\nKatara's waterbending remained amateurish until she came across a Northern Water Tribe waterbending scroll in a pirate-traders ship depicting several different traditional waterbending forms. Incapable of passing up such an opportunity to have formal instruction, she eventually made away with the scroll and first learned the water whip technique with Aang[32] and afterward continued to improve their overall technique. Up until their arrival at the Northern Water Tribe, the two showed considerable improvement and Katara's confidence in her own abilities increased dramatically. She demonstrated the ability to bend with much greater precision and ease compared to when she first stole the scroll, was able to draw unseen water out of different sources and bend greater quantities in general, streaming them into powerful blasts and freezing water with much more control than before.[33][62] She later developed several of her own techniques, including cloud manipulation with Aang's help,[55][99] and a hand-held variation on the water-whip technique.[38] She also demonstrated greater manipulation of ice and snow.[36] In the time between her acquisition of the waterbending scroll and arrival at the North Pole, her sheer determination and discipline saw her proficiency improve greatly, clearly surpassing Aang's. Later, Katara challenged the master waterbending instructor of the Northern Water Tribe, Pakku, to a duel. Though she was undoubtedly no match for the master, she was determined to not be beaten. She demonstrated more advanced techniques than she ever had previously and greater proficiency in basic waterbending techniques she had previously learned. For the first time, she was seen bending with her feet and transforming the physical state of a wave. Pakku eventually removed her ability to bend by trapping her body and limbs between spikes of ice and so won the fight without harming her, though he admitted that she was an exceptionally talented waterbender.[38] Under the guidance of Master Pakku, Katara's waterbending abilities advanced quicker than that of any student he had ever trained, which he accredited to her fierce passion and hard-work. She fought and defeated Zuko with the augmented power of the near-full moon. During the fight, she knocked him off his feet, deflected his attacks, imprisoned him in a dome of solid ice, and later a wave of solid ice. Though she was defeated by Zuko after the sun rose, she fought him again with the full moon and defeated him easily.[39]\n\nKatara waterbends\nKatara showed promising potential of being a prominent waterbender.\nFollowing the Siege of the North, Pakku declared Katara a full-fledged waterbending master in the short time that she was at the North Pole.[16] She continued to hone her skills, regularly demonstrating her waterbending mastery in battle. In Omashu, she blocked a flurry of Mai's knives by waterbending wooden boards into the air as shields in front of herself, managed to block arrows with a wall of ice, and retaliated by freezing Mai's arm in ice, only being defeated when Ty Lee snuck behind her and blocked her chi, preventing her from waterbending.[42] While in the swamp with Aang and Sokka, Katara used the stores in her pouch and caused enough pressure to the water in order to cut apart the vines, create large waves in the swamp water, freeze a part of Huu's \"swamp monster\", and create a coil of water to blast a hole into the monster. She then created large, round, razor-sharp blades out of the water to slice through the vines completely.[43] Later, she easily defeated two earthbending students by freezing them in solid ice. When facing Ty Lee a second time, she fought using the water in her pouch to fend off her chi-blocking attacks, forcing Ty Lee to cartwheel away from disks of razor-sharp water. She also stopped Azula from killing Aang by catching her hand in a water whip.[46] While crossing the Serpent's Pass, Katara made a bridge of ice for the group to travel across, worked with Aang to support an underwater bubble for the group to travel in, surfed around on a surfboard of ice, and formed a massive whirlpool with Aang to defeat the serpent.[49]\n\nKatara rapidly condensed water vapor into ice to defeat her foes.[50] When assaulting Jet upon re-encountering him, she used ice spikes, similar to Mai's daggers, to pin Jet to the wall in an alley.[51] While fighting off the Royal Earthbender Guards, she defeated dozens of them with whips and streams of water.[52] In the Crystal Catacombs, Katara and Aang fought against Zuko and Azula, whom she managed to cut one hair bangs and created two enormous whips of water, which she used to briefly trap her. Later, these whips were able to match Zuko's enormous fire whips. When she was finally surrounded by Dai Li agents, she defended herself with the octopus form and rode on an enormous wave which knocked down these agents as well as Zuko. She proceeded to escape on a rising stream of water, carrying Aang to safety.[54]\n\nKatara's waterbending later became even more advanced and destructive. During a fight with a Fire Nation ship, she lifted a huge wave to separate the two ships and formed a huge steam barrier between them for cover. Once their ship was hit by a harpoon, she used her frosty breath of waterbending to freeze the hole in the ship's hull, thus repairing it.[19] When Aang held a dance for some of his Fire Nation school friends, she created a fountain out of solid ice for beverages and the glasses they used to drink from.[55] At the Jang Hui River, Katara created a cover of steam and sped herself atop the water's surface. Assisted by Aang, she formed crashing waves and precise missiles of water to destroy a Fire Nation Army factory. She also blasted a Fire Nation river craft into the air and against a cliff,[1] as well as transported a huge bubble of water from a nearby creek to extinguish a fire.[100]\n\nKatara stops her attack\nKatara's waterbending was exemplary, as she could turn rain drops into weapons.\nWhen Combustion Man locked her and Toph in jail, Katara adapted to her environment, using her own sweat as a catalyst to form a water knife which broke out of a wooden prison cell.[56] During her time hiding within the Fire Nation, Katara met Hama, an elderly, yet powerful fellow waterbending master from the Southern Water Tribe. After learning this, Hama began training her in Southern Style waterbending. Among many techniques and combat tactics, she became able to condense moisture in the air to create her own water source for her bending and could remove water from plant life.[57] Alternatively, with the latter skill she could bend the plants by controlling the water inside them.[69] During their duel, Katara stood her ground against Hama's blast of water instead of redirecting it, which shocked the old bender into silence and allowed Katara to temporarily gain the upper hand.\n\nOn the Day of Black Sun, Katara fought against the Fire Nation guards at the capital, destroying several guard towers with Sokka and defeating many soldiers.[58][59] At the Western Air Temple, she rained ice spikes onto Combustion Man.[60] While tracking down her mother's killer, Katara used the enhanced power of the full moon to nearly take down a whole Fire Nation ship of the Southern Raiders single-handedly. During her encounter with Yon Rha, she created a large wide dome of water by gathering rain drops and created ice spikes from it, nearly killing him.[18] Katara's prowess was formidable enough to fight against such prodigious master benders like Azula. Finally, during Sozin's Comet, she froze herself and Azula into a block of solid ice, thawed the center of it, and chained Azula to a water grate.[17]\n\nHealing\n\nKatara heals her hands\nKatara used her waterbending abilities as a remedy.\nKatara's innate aptitude toward waterbending abilities made her a rare case to naturally have access to the incredible ability to heal by manipulating the chi paths in a person's body, including herself. She inadvertently discovered this ability after Aang accidentally burned her hands and subsequently used this power again to heal Aang's own burn after his face-off with Admiral Zhao.[36] Once she reached the Northern Water Tribe, she further developed this ability by training with Yagoda.[38] By the time the gang met the General Fong, she healed several of his injured earthbending troops. However, Katara unsuccessfully attempted to heal Jet after he was fatally wounded by Long Feng.[51]\n\nWith the aid of a small vial of spirit water, which held special properties, from the Spirit Oasis, Katara's healing abilities were enhanced.[40] Though she was going to use the spirit water in an attempt to heal Zuko's scar, she instead used it to bring Aang back to life after he had been struck in the back by Azula's lightning.[54] Even though she wasted out the Spirit Water, Katara's healing was enough to allow her father Hakoda to walk again after he was injured while taking out a Fire Nation ballista tower during the invasion.[58] During Azula and Zuko's Agni Kai, Azula generated lightning and aimed it at Katara rather than Zuko; but he jumped in front of Katara and let the lightning shock him instead, sparing her from near death. Her healing had been successful enough that he could rise to his feet just moments after she had begun.[17]\n\nAs an adult, Katara's prowess continued to grow, as she became well-recognized in her abilities throughout the world. She proved herself to be an excellent teacher, having trained her daughter and Avatar Korra to become highly adept masters themselves. However, even though her healing skills were recognized to be \"the best in the world\", she could not restore Korra's bending after Amon severed the connection Korra had to the three elements other than air with his bloodbending.[21]\n\nBloodbending\n\nKatara bloodbends ship captain\nKatara bloodbent the Southern Raiders commander.\nAfter learning all of Hama's Southern Style skills, Hama decided to teach Katara bloodbending, an advanced ability to manipulate the water within the body of all living beings, controlling them like puppets. When Katara refused to learn such a technique due to viewing it as dark and immoral, Hama decided to silence her with the said technique. Despite only just hearing about the skill, Katara showed an innate talent for the art, quickly becoming the first known person to break the effects of a bloodbender's grip and free herself. Ultimately however, Hama tricked her into utilizing bloodbending to save Sokka and Aang, leaving her greatly distressed.[57]\n\nWhen she traveled with Zuko to hunt down the man who killed her mother, Katara alone took out nearly all the Southern Raiders under the full moon. After she discovered where the captain was, she let her anger take over and used bloodbending on him, which stunned Zuko. When she discovered that he was not the man she searched, she released him, shocked and dismayed that she had just used bloodbending on an innocent person. She is the only bloodbender who was never known to have had someone else break free of her grip, though she rarely used the skill. Though this was the last known time she used the technique, Katara came to greatly understand its workings, as she was able to determine how Amon had used bloodbending to remove Korra's bending, although she was not able to restore it.[18]\n\nMedical abilities\n\nKatara's knowledge of healing extended outside the waterbending subskill: She was versed in midwifery, as she had helped her grandmother deliver many babies in the Southern Water Tribe and delivered Than and Ying's baby, Hope.[49] She also seemed to have been knowledgeable on yoga.[101] In later years, Katara was versed in physiotherapy, as evidenced when she guided Korra to walk again.[23]\n\nPhysical prowess\n\nKatara dancing\nKatara demonstrated impressive acrobatic skill when she performed a dance with Aang.\nAlthough she mostly lacked skill in hand-to-hand combat compared to her allies, Katara showed a surprising amount of agility and employing hand and foot strikes in combat in her fight against Pakku. Later, she exhibited remarkable agility and acrobatic skill, as evidenced when she performed a complicated dance with Aang"

SHE IS THE BREAKDOWN OF NEGOTIATIONS. THERE IS NO ESCALATION OF HOSTILITIES BEYOND HER.\n\nKyoshi was the Earth Kingdom-born Avatar immediately succeeding Avatar Kuruk of the Northern Water Tribe, and preceding Avatar Roku of the Fire Nation. She died at the age of 230, making her the oldest confirmed human,[12] and was also an exceptionally tall woman, towering over most people.[3] Kyoshi was born to two criminals: Jesa, a renegade Air Nomad nun, and Hark, a thief from an impoverished family of Earth Kingdom actors. She inherited her later signature outfit from her parents, adopting her mother's golden headdress and metal war fans and her father's daofei face paint.\n\nKyoshi had a difficult early life. Abandoned by her parents, she barely survived as a homeless orphan until being rescued by Kelsang who became her surrogate father. She was also not recognized as Avatar until she was sixteen; instead, her friend Yun was declared the Avatar. When the truth about her identity was revealed, Kyoshi's world was thrown into chaos. Yun was sacrificed to a monstrous spirit, and Kelsang was murdered as he attempted to defend her from Jianzhu, Yun's former master and the Earth Kingdom's de facto ruler. Fearful and desperate for revenge against Jianzhu, Kyoshi fled with her other friend, Rangi, and joined her parents' old criminal gang, the Flying Opera Company. With these unlikely allies, Kyoshi consequently traveled the Earth Kingdom and became involved in the criminal underworld while being chased by Jianzhu. After a series of tribulations and personal losses, Kyoshi forged a close bond with her criminal associates, entered into a romantic relationship with Rangi, and helped to eliminate Jianzhu.\n\nIn the following years, Kyoshi struggled to find popular acceptance as Avatar and keep the Earth Kingdom stable as Jianzhu's death resulted in tensions and a leadership vacuum. Kyoshi saw the end of the Camellia-Peony War in the Fire Nation, and later dealt with her friend Yun, who had been corrupted by his desire for vengeance against everyone who had lied about his Avatarhood.\n\nThese experiences greatly shaped her world view and approach to her role as Avatar. Unlike her successors, Roku and Aang, Kyoshi was determined that only true justice could bring peace and had fewer qualms about killing enemies to achieve this goal if necessary. Employing these methods, she was a generally effective Avatar. She prevented the resurgence of the disastrous Yellow Neck Uprising, stopped Fire Lord Zoryu from massacring the disgraced Saowon clan, defeated an attempted armed takeover of the Earth Kingdom by Chin the Conqueror, founded Kyoshi Island and the Kyoshi Warriors to keep her adopted homeland safe, and helped to reform the Earth Kingdom into a constitutional monarchy. In her later life, she maintained peace between the fifty-five states of the Earth Kingdom and helped implement policies to uplift the poorest and most disadvantaged, and saw the Earth Sages redeemed from a corrupt group of politicians to an order of wise advisors and academics. Living for more than two centuries, Kyoshi led the world into an unprecedented time of peace.\n\nHowever, some of her actions also caused long-term problems for the Earth Kingdom: The deaths of Jianzhu, as well as Chin and her foundation of the Dai Li, would lead to the decline and eventual fall of her home country in the centuries following her lifetime. After her death, the Dai Li obeyed Earth King Jialun's orders to purge the sages who attempted to maintain Kyoshi's policies of peace and prosperity. Because of this, Kyoshi came to deeply regret the creation of the Dai Li.[13]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nHow tall was Avatar Kyoshi? toggle section\nWhat is the age of Avatar Kyoshi at the time of her death? toggle section\nWho were the parents of Avatar Kyoshi and what were their professions? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of Avatar Kyoshi's signature outfit? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\n\n00:00\n\n41:20\n\nEarly life\n\nKyoshi was born in the year 312 BG[7] somewhere in the Earth Kingdom. Her exact birthplace was unknown even to her.[14] At the time of her birth, the country was destabilized by the Yellow Neck Uprising and marauding bandit groups known as daofei.[15] One of the most powerful crime networks, the Flying Opera Company, was led by Kyoshi's parents, Jesa and Hark. Her parenthood was unusual, as her mother Jesa was a renegade Air Nomad nun, whereas her father Hark descended from a distinguished but impoverished line of Earth Kingdom actors.[14][16] Following Kyoshi's birth, her parents opted to lay low and mostly refrained from participating in criminal activities. Along with their daughter, they traveled all across the Earth Kingdom in a wagon, never staying in one place for a long time.[14]\n\nWhen Kyoshi was five or six, however, her parents decided to leave her in the care of a villager at Yokoya Port,[14] an impoverished community of farmers and fishers located on a peninsula at the Whaletail Strait in the southwestern Earth Kingdom.[15] They left her a chest with Jesa's signature metal fans, as well as a journal that contained information about the daofei and their customs. When her parents had departed, the villager immediately reneged on the deal, casting Kyoshi out onto the streets.[14] As they were mostly poor themselves and had no relation to her, the people of Yokoya had little sympathy for her and would have left her to die of hunger.[4] Homeless and reduced to starvation, Kyoshi survived by eating garbage, making her even more of an outcast among the Yokoyans.[16] Kyoshi later blamed her parents for her misfortune, and came to hate them as well as all criminals in general.[14] Nevertheless, she grew extraordinarily tall, and was already taller than many teenagers at age seven.[15] Despite being larger than the others, she was bullied and beaten by the other children, most prominently by Aoma, the daughter of Yokoya's village captain. Aoma beat her with a rock more than once and claimed to adults that they were just \"playing\".[4]\n\nKyoshi and the Avatar relics\nKyoshi took part in the Avatar relics test, but never completed it.\nBy chance, Yokoya was visited by Jianzhu and Kelsang in 305 BG. The two masters had been traveling the Earth Kingdom for seven years to find the Avatar. They presented the children of Yokoya with a test that included toys that had belonged to past Air Nomad Avatars, but all failed. Kyoshi spied on the event, and Kelsang invited her to pick the toys despite Jianzhu's objection that she was probably too old to be the Avatar. Though mistrustful, she took a clay turtle that had belonged to a past Avatar. When Kelsang told her that she could take three more toys to confirm whether she was the Avatar, Kyoshi believed this to be a lie or trick, not used to kindness, and inherently regarding promises of fortune as dangerous. As a result, the young girl fled with the clay turtle instead of partaking in the test. The two masters let her go,[15] and went on to falsely identify an Earth Kingdom boy named Yun as the Avatar.[4]\n\nHaving realized that none of the Yokoyans were helping Kyoshi, Kelsang sought out her hiding place in the village and took her into his care. Used to being mistreated, the young girl was initially reluctant to trust the Air Nomad monk, but when she understood that he was honest, Kyoshi was overwhelmed by the Air Nomad's kindness, and came to see him as her adoptive father.[17] Kelsang always provided for Kyoshi when he was in Yokoya, but often had to leave the village for long periods of time, during which he provided money to various farming families to look after her until he returned. Despite this and the farmers' promises, she continued to be neglected.[8]\n\nOne night when she was around ten years old, she suffered from a terrible fever and lied alone on the floor of a toolshed while the other villagers admired fireworks from a traveling vendor. At dawn, she woke up as a result of her abnormally high body temperature and staggered to a field around the outskirts of the town where the ground was scorched because of the explosives. She instantly panicked and ran away from the spot, assuming that she would be accused of causing the destruction.[18]\n\nThe same year, Kelsang once returned to find Kyoshi had lost weight and had sickly skin, realizing she not been taken care of properly, and promised her that he would never leave her for such a long period of time again. At the time, Kyoshi was more concerned about the new kite-flying craze among the local children. As she had no guidance or supplies to make her own, Kelsang decided to cheer her up by using his airbending and the rope they found to act as her kite.[18]\n\nLife as a servant\n\nKyoshi without makeup\nKyoshi in her teenage years without her later iconic makeup.\nTo improve her living situation, Kelsang eventually got Jianzhu to grant Kyoshi a position of work in the Avatar mansion that was being built to accommodate Yun's trainers and entourage. While the construction of the Avatar mansion was still ongoing, Kyoshi met Rangi, a firebender who had been appointed Yun's bodyguard, and who soon started to regularly yell at Kyoshi and order her around. After a few weeks, Kyoshi realized that the firebender expressed some emotions in a particular way; yelling at people meant that she liked them. The two subsequently became good friends.[4]\n\nAvatar mansion\nIn her youth, Kyoshi worked as a servant at the Avatar mansion.\nAs a result of Kyoshi's desire for organization and cleanliness, the staff eventually decided that her talents would best be put to use cleaning up after Yun as his servant, as he tended to leave quite a mess wherever he went.[19] She also would help out in the kitchen and sort through gifts sent to the Avatar from time to time.[8][19] Enjoying her life at the mansion, Kyoshi fully adopted it as her home. Though she always remained somewhat apart from the rest of the staff due to her background and friendship with Rangi (who treated the other servants with open disdain),[8] Kyoshi cared for the other staff members and had a good working relationship with several of them.[8][20][21]\n\nDespite her greatly improved livelihood and overall situation, Kyoshi continued to face occasional harassment. Many other servants considered her stuck-up due to her closeness to Yun. Because of her unusual stature, she caught the attention of certain kind of men who sexually harassed her, viewing her as an oddity they were free to gawk at, prod or worse, with them believing someone like her should be grateful for the attention.[22] She continued to be bullied by Aoma and her companions when they got the chance to get close to her, as they had become jealous of her comparably better life as well as her proximity to the Avatar, despite being an orphan and outsider, while they had to toil on their parents' fields and fishing boats. Despite this, Kyoshi preferred to adhere to neutral jing and endure the bullying rather than strike back, although she was physically strong enough to do so. She also held almost no grudges against the Yokoyans who ill-treated her as a child and teenager. Because of this, Rangi had to save her from Aoma and the others before they could hit her. The firebender encouraged her to start to fight back, but Kyoshi refused this and Rangi's plotting to aid her in getting revenge.[4] Her rejection of violence included the use of her own earthbending abilities. She was only able to bend very large pieces of earth without any precision; regarding these abilities as useless for her servant job, Kyoshi rejected Kelsang's urgings to get training and generally refrained from using her bending at all.\n\nKyoshi, Rangi, and Yun\nKyoshi, Yun, and Rangi were best friends during their time at the Avatar mansion near Yokoya Port.\nOver time, Yun, Rangi, and Kyoshi grew increasingly close, the presumed Avatar and the servant girl in particular spending much time together. She developed romantic feelings for Yun, but tried to deny them for a very long time and told herself that his closeness to her was just his usual way of acting toward girls.[19] She also felt attraction toward Rangi, such as when she was distracted by the uncovered skin of her nape[4] and when she found herself a little too bothered by the idea of her never being born.[23] She did not appear to recognize these feelings as well as she did her feelings for Yun, but she tried to ignore them as well, denying her sexuality that would not be accepted by most people in the Earth Kingdom.[24]\n\nOne of Kyoshi's duties would be to help Yun sort through the many gifts sent to him by officials and sages from around the Earth Kingdom. One night while sorting through them, Yun placed his head in her lap as the two joked around. The two of them nearly kissed, but stopped themselves before it happened, believing that a relationship would be impossible due to their different social stations and duties. Neither of them mentioned this incident again, but whenever Yun saw fire lilies he would look back and forth between them and Kyoshi until she smiled and blushed.[20]\n\n296 BG\n\nMain article: History of Kyoshi (296 BG)\nKyoshi recites Kuruk's poem\nKyoshi shocked Kelsang by unknowingly reciting Kuruk's poem.\nKyoshi's life drastically changed in 296 BG. Kelsang began to suspect that she might be the actual Avatar, although Kyoshi considered the assumption ridiculous. The monk initially agreed to not voice his assumptions publicly.[8][23] Over the following days, she initially tried to continue to live as if nothing had happened, going on some minor quests with Yun and Rangi.[25] She subsequently joined Yun's team as he ventured to an iceberg near the South Pole, where a treaty was supposed to be signed with a pirate people known as the Fifth Nation.[19][22] For this occasion, Jianzhu provided Kyoshi with an impressive green, armored kimono that later became part of her iconic look.[22]\n\nKyoshi uses Avatar State power for the first time\nIn the battle against the Fifth Nation, Kyoshi used the Avatar State for the first time.\nIn the course of the tense, two-day long negotiations with the pirates, Kyoshi grew closer to Rangi but remained otherwise a mere onlooker. When Fifth Nation leader Tagaka revealed that the meeting was a trap to capture the Avatar, however, Yun was only saved thanks to Kyoshi's intervention.[22] Using a combination of raw power and the Avatar State,[26] she destroyed much of the Fifth Nation fleet in an amazing feat of earthbending.[22] This event caused Kelsang to reveal his belief in Kyoshi's Avatarhood to others.[27] With the identity of the Avatar being called into question, Jianzhu tried to learn the truth by presenting Kyoshi and Yun to an evil spirit known as \"Father Glowworm\" in the southeastern Earth Kingdom. The creature identified Kyoshi as the true Avatar. To her shock and horror, Jianzhu then left Yun to the spirit's wrath while taking Kyoshi to safety. Shortly after, Kelsang unexpectedly arrived and tried to rescue her, only to be murdered by Jianzhu. Overcome with emotions, Kyoshi triggered the Avatar State and was able to flee back to the Avatar mansion. There, she revealed the events to Rangi who vowed to protect her from then on. The two consequently escaped into the inner Earth Kingdom on Kelsang's flying bison Pengpeng.[27]\n\nKyoshi airbending with her fans\nWith support by the Flying Opera Company, Kyoshi learnt how to use her war fans for precise bending.\nThe two tracked down the Flying Opera Company, joining them to be safe from Jianzhu. Kyoshi quickly deduced that one gang member, Lao Ge, was an infamous assassin. He agreed to become her teacher in spirituality and assassination. Despite hiding their true identities, she and Rangi also gradually formed bonds with the other gang members, Kirima, Wong, and Lek. Traveling with the criminals, Kyoshi ended up in the daofei town of Hujiang, where the Flying Opera Company was forced to agree to assist a more powerful crime network, the Autumn Bloom Society led by Mok. While staying at Hujiang, Kyoshi realized that she was in love with Rangi; to her relief, the firebender shared her feelings, and she decided to no longer deny nor hide her sexuality. After fleeing Hujiang due to an attack by a shirshu sent by Jianzhu, Kyoshi was forced to reveal her true identity to the rest of the gang. To her pleasant surprise, the criminals refused to abandon her, considering her a comrade and friend. Kyoshi then earnestly began her training, being taught firebending by Rangi, waterbending by Kirima, and earthbending by Wong as well as Lek. Lao Ge also continued to share his knowledge, including his self-proclaimed method to achieve immortality.[27]\n\nAfter several weeks of preparation, the Flying Opera Company travelled to Zigan Village. There, the group was supposed to help the Autumn Bloom in rescuing a prisoner from the dungeons of the corrupt Governor Te Sihung.[27] To test her mettle, Lao Ge secretly enlisted Kyoshi to also murder Te. The operation succeeded in freeing the prisoner, although Kyoshi chose to spare Te's life after threatening him into becoming a better official.[28] To the Flying Opera Company's shock, however, the freed prisoner turned out to be Xu Ping An, a mass-murdering and deranged rebel leader. Xu promptly declared the Yellow Necks restored, and prepared to restart his destructive insurgency.[28][29] Realizing that she could not allow Xu to walk free, Kyoshi challenged him to a lei tai duel. The duel almost resulted in Kyoshi's death, as Xu turned out to be a powerful lightningbender.[29] However, Kyoshi eventually entered the Avatar State and killed Xu.[30] The Yellow Necks consequently scattered, while Kyoshi's friends nursed her back to health.[31] However, Jianzhu had finally located her and ambushed the Flying Opera Company, kidnapping Rangi and inadvertently causing Lek's death.[32]\n\nVowing revenge, Kyoshi confronted Jianzhu at Qinchao Village. After a tense conversation and Kyoshi's refusal to become the sage's pupil, the two started to duel. They proved to be evenly matched until Yun unexpectedly reappeared, ruthlessly killing Jianzhu before leaving without another word. Kyoshi then fled the town, leaving its inhabitants - the Chin clan - furious at the destruction caused by the duel with Jianzhu.[33] Kyoshi subsequently reunited with Lao Ge, Kirima, and Wong who had rescued Rangi in the meantime. The group decided to split up, with Kyoshi venturing to the Southern Air Temple in order to safely reveal her identity as the Avatar to the public.[21]\n\nRevealing herself to the world\n\nAfter revealing herself as the Avatar to the Air Nomads, Kuruk appeared to Kyoshi in a vision, pleading for her help.[21] Kyoshi did not fully connect with him, however, leaving the content of his request vague.[34] She also learned that Jianzhu had left all his lands and wealth to her in his testament.[21] Over the course of the next months, Kyoshi began to assume her Avatar duties. Before she left the Southern Air Temple, Jinpa was assigned to the Avatar as her personal secretary by the Council of Elders.[35] He subsequently became her confidant and friend, although their working relationship was often strained due to Kyoshi's unwillingness to do what was expected of her: namely, to aid and work with the four nations' elites, despite many of them being corrupt as well as self-serving.[34][35] Kyoshi found it difficult to be an approachable or diplomatic Avatar and failed to hide her disgust at the Earth Kingdom's rampant corruption. As she could not solve issues by talking, Kyoshi tended to resort to force and manipulation to carry out justice. She could do so, as her abilities as a bender and strategist grew steadily, also thanks to her studying the writings of her old nemesis Jianzhu.[5][35]\n\nFeeling unable to properly influence the Earth Kingdom's elites, Kyoshi eventually launched a one-person crusade against the Earth Kingdom's worst daofei groups, destroying several.[5][35] She also searched for Yun, but found no trace of him. Overall, her demeanor and opinions alienated many members of the country's elite, while the common people came to fear her.[34][35] To Kyoshi's own unease, she increasingly employed tactics similar to those of Jianzhu, and began to feel deeply conflicted about her way to do things as the Avatar.[35]\n\n295 BG\n\nMain article: History of Kyoshi (295 BG)\nBy 295 BG, Kyoshi was in Ba Sing Se, where she defeated Mok and the Triad of the Golden Wing, as well as rooting out the corruption of the city's peace officers.[5] She decided to pause her work in the Earth Kingdom when Jinpa notified her that Rangi and Hei-Ran had returned to the Fire Nation.[35] As she journeyed to the capital, she began to confide in Jinpa about her recurring visions of Kuruk, after an intense pain caused her to fall into the Mo Ce Sea.[34] Kyoshi arrived in the Fire Nation, where she was formally greeted by Chancellor Dairin, and used the opportunity to grow close with Rangi again.[9] Kyoshi's appearance at the festival seemed to prove a catalyst for the political tensions in the unstable Fire Nation after she confused Chaejin for his half-brother Zoryu, the rightful Fire Lord.[36] Although Hei-Ran helped Kyoshi smooth over tensions in the palace, the event was plunged into further chaos with the shocking appearance of Yun, who held the attendees hostage by burying half of their bodies in the floor with his earthbending. Yun managed to assassinate Lu Beifong, as well as killing Dairin and injuring his guards when they tried to confront him. As the earthbender managed to flee the scene, Kyoshi was left to deal with the political implications of the evening, as Chaejin's faction and the Saowon clan would use it as a sign to prove the weakness of a Fire Lord whose reign had been plagued with bad luck.[37]\n\nKyoshi and her allies came to the conclusion that Yun was likely possessed from his experience with Father Glowworm. Hei-Ran advised that they seek out Nyahitha, an old ally of Kuruk and herself. Shortly before they left for North Chung-Ling, Hei-Ran ritualistically cut her top-knot to demonstrate her lost honor, and made Kyoshi promise to allow her to sacrifice herself for Yun.[38] When they arrived, Nyahitha told Kyoshi that he did not know what the spirit had done to Yun, but promised that he could help her commune with Kuruk. The group also bore witness to the escalating tensions between the clans in the Fire Nation, giving them a sense of urgency to resolve the conflict before the nation descended into civil war.[39] That evening, Kyoshi and Nyahitha reached a bluff in the hills where Kuruk had once meditated, and she experienced a vision of Kuruk mastering the elements, although the memories did not provide her any help for what she should do with Yun. As they looked down on the city, the pair were shocked to find a large message supporting Chaejin as Fire Lord, which caused the rival clans to start descending into a brawl in the village square.[40][41] Although Kyoshi tried to intervene and beg for peace, she began to realize that the battle was proving to be a distraction, and returned to Hei-Ran's lodgings just as Yun was ready to stab Hei-Ran through the throat.[42] Although Hei-Ran managed to badly burn Yun, he still escaped, and Kyoshi chose to have the headmistress brought to her doctor, Atuat, instead of leaving to follow after him.[43]\n\nAs Hei-Ran healed, Kyoshi found that Rangi was now furious with her after discovering Kyoshi's promise to sacrifice Hei-Ran, though she soon showed that she still truly loved and cared for Kyoshi. Hei-Ran and Kyoshi then noted that the fight in the square would be a pretense for war.[43] Kyoshi deduced that Yun was working with the Saowon, as she confirmed that the town's crops that spelled out the message had been poisoned with salt, which was now owned by Lady Huazo of that clan. Kyoshi then made a plan to force a confession from Huazo, and came to the docks with Atuat, where she apprehended the noblewoman before she was due to depart Shuhon Island, although the woman agreed with her terms, believing that the Avatar was making a huge mistake. Kyoshi did not inform Rangi of her plans, and instead lightly pushed her down in the ground before she left so that her lover could not come after her and stop her plans.[44] Jinpa and Kyoshi flew Huazo to an Avatar-owned safe house on Capital Island, before taking off and informing Zoryu of the situation.[45] Although the Fire Lord was shocked, he gave her his permission to kidnap Chaejin. When she flew back to the safe house with Chaejin, she bent away the foundations of the property and intimidated the pair into revealing Yun's location; when they refused to answer, she threatened to drop both of them into the sea. After Kuruk's voice reminded her that going this far was not who she was, she realized that both of them were truly innocent, and let the pair go free.[46]\n\nWhen Kyoshi returned to the palace, she bore witness to an assembly in the Fire Lord's private theater, where a double of Yun confessed to conspiring with the Saowon clan, ruining the honor of the Fire Lord's rival clan and causing an immediate purge of the Saowon to break out across the nation.[47] In a private conversation with the Fire Lord, she pointed out that the ruse would be exposed if the real Yun showed up, and the Fire Lord agreed, stating that he had bought the Avatar more time to find the real Yun. In return for apprehending the real Yun, Kyoshi demanded that the Saowon and false Yun should be spared from death. Before dismissing the Avatar, Zoryu advised her to accept the truth that he was driven by revenge for his stolen Avatarhood.[48] Kyoshi then departed the capital on a small royal pleasure craft, Sulan's Smile, ordering the crew to take her to the ruins of Yangchen's island in the Mo Ce Sea. Although she almost drowned in the sea water, Kyoshi managed to cross over to the Spirit World, where she had an emotional meeting with Kuruk.[49] She received an extensive vision of his life, and realized that his own life had been shortened by his quest to hunt down dark spirits. Kuruk also informed her that spirits could not possess humans, and that Yun had been acting out of his own accord the entire time during his quest for vengeance. In the physical world, she was dragged out of the sea water by Joonho and his crew, saving her life.[50]\n\nAfter spending a month learning advanced healing arts from Atuat, Kyoshi made her way to Yokoya, meeting Yun in the Avatar mansion. After excusing Mui, Kyoshi confronted Yun, telling him that she had to bring him to justice for the sake of the world. Yun refused to be locked up by Kyoshi, and started the fight by bending up a stone pillar between the pair. Kyoshi managed to rip up the dining room in the fight, but Yun escaped the area and hid himself from Kyoshi throughout the rest of the estate. Kyoshi was caught off guard when Yun managed to liquefy the stone floor without heat to trap and encase Kyoshi, but then she revealed that the rest of the Flying Opera Company had come with her. Wong bent her out of the trap while Kirima attacked Yun, while Rangi sent a violent blast of fire in Yun's direction. After Yun hurled stone spears to fend off a potential rescue by Jinpa, he broke Kirima and Wong's legs by creating pitfalls when they tried to sneak up on him. After crudely using blood to complete their signature makeup, Kyoshi and Rangi used fire to destroy Yun's earth barriers, though Yun tunnelled down and stabbed Rangi with an earthen spike. Kyoshi attempted to apologize to Yun when he began to chastize her, but she made use of the opportunity to freeze Yun's heart and lungs when she could get close to him, while immediately turning back to Rangi and using the Avatar State to heal her grievous wounds.[10] After Atuat came to the peninsula to give more specialist care to Kyoshi's wounded friends, she buried Yun in Yokoya, and held a small funeral with Rangi, where they promised to stay beside one another forever. At that moment, a \"fox\" guided Kyoshi to a forest spring, where she met with Yangchen for the first time. The previous Avatar explained her own failings to Kyoshi, and that every Avatar had to make the right decisions for themselves. After the meeting, the fox guided Kyoshi back to her friends, and later became her animal guide.[51]\n\nFollowing her battle with Yun, she sent Lao Ge to intimidate Zoryu into keeping his promise to spare the Saowon and the false Yun.[52] Despite the turmoil in her personal life, Avatar Kyoshi remained steadfast in her mission to see the four nations rise above the conflicts plaguing them. She was not a popular Avatar at the time, as her closest allies were daofei and she sometimes fumbled in diplomatic situations without hesitating to resort to violence.[53]\n\nMaintaining order in Ba Sing Se\n\nKyoshi returned to Ba Sing Se soon after the Camellia-Peony War, and over the next two years, she helped establish a task force which swiftly dealt with the most dangerous daofei and violent criminals in the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se. Kyoshi received support from Ambassador Quin of the Fire Nation in this endeavor, and the ambassador convinced the then-ruling Earth King, Yi Ming, to officially adopt the task force. Kyoshi was needed elsewhere, and left Rangi in Ba Sing Se to keep an eye on things, while the task force was given over to the control of the Earth King. Soon after Kyoshi left, the Earth King began to use the task force to threaten criminals who stood in the way of his power. When Ambassador Quin's children were kidnapped, Rangi saw the turmoil growing in the city, and worried that things would turn violent, and left the city to inform Kyoshi of the situation.[54][55]\n\nDuring this time, Kyoshi was contacted by Wan Shi Tong, a spirit who kept a vast library of knowledge. The spirit's Knowledge Seekers informed the Avatar that a daofei group known as the Paper Knives had stolen a tome of great value and importance. Kyoshi did not fully understand what was in the book, and she had no time to rescue a book when she was dealing with people and their lives. She ultimately set the task to recover the book to her friends and allies, who turned to their contacts.[56]\n\nEstablishing the Kyoshi Warriors\n\nKyoshi and her warriors\nKyoshi trained the first Kyoshi Warriors to help the women of her adopted homeland to defend themselves as well as their homes.\nEventually, Kyoshi mastered the Avatar State, becoming feared and effective while restoring order in the world.[57] She managed to maintain a \"tense equilibrium\" between the four nations.[58]\n\nKyoshi also did not hide her bisexuality and attempted to effect greater tolerance for non-heterosexual people in the notoriously conservative Earth Kingdom. Nevertheless, these efforts had little impact.[59] When she visited the ports of her adopted homeland peninsula, she constantly had to put carousing men in their place after they caused trouble to the female villagers. Eventually, she decided to train the women in defensive combat so that they could defend themselves. These women later formed the first band of the Kyoshi Warriors.[60]\n\nStopping Chin the Conqueror\n\nKyoshi and Chin\nAvatar Kyoshi confronted Chin the Conqueror and created Kyoshi Island in 270 BG.\nDuring Kyoshi's life, the Earth Monarch's rule was unpopular among the populace of the Earth Kingdom. Using this to his advantage, a warlord named Chin launched a war to conquer the continent. He was successful until he reached the peninsula where Kyoshi lived, finding the Avatar waiting for him. Standing before his army, Chin demanded their immediate surrender, and Kyoshi warned him that she would not sit idly by as he took her home. When he refused to back down and assumed a challenging earthbending stance, she unfurled one of her fans and fired a powerful air blast at him, leaving the humiliated warlord down to his underwear. Kyoshi subsequently entered the Avatar State and separated the peninsula from the mainland by using a combination of earthbending, lavabending, and airbending, forming Kyoshi Island and thereby protecting her homeland from subsequent threats. An indignant Chin was left standing on the edge of the newly-formed cliff, which began to crumble beneath his feet and, as he refused to budge from his unstable position, caused him to fall into the sea and drown, ending his campaign and ushering the world into a great era of peace. Though Kyoshi was only tangentially responsible for Chin's death, she herself saw little difference between causing the circumstances of his death and actually striking him down, and would claim to have personally killed him for generations afterward.[3]\n\nBecause of Kyoshi's act, the people of Chin Village on the mainland founded Avatar Day to vilify Kyoshi, and all succeeding Avatars, for the death of their leader. The people of Kyoshi Island, meanwhile, founded \"Kyoshi Day\" on the same day as Avatar Day, to honor her creation of the island and the restoration of peace to their village.[3] The same year, they erected a large totem, topped with a statue of Kyoshi to honor her.[61]\n\nHistory with the 46th Earth King\n\nKyoshi defeats Earth King's guards\nKyoshi defeated the Earth King's guards upon being attacked by them.\nSometime after her final confrontation with Chin, Kyoshi was summoned to Ba Sing Se upon the request of the 46th Earth King, since his unpopular rule had led to a peasant uprising in the city. By the time Kyoshi reached the city, the peasants had already destroyed everything that represented the \"old government\", including ancient and valuable artifacts that held historical and cultural importance. The King demanded that she stop the uprising by whatever means necessary. However, Kyoshi staunchly refused, stating that it would not be right for her to do so. Incensed by her defiance, the Earth King ordered his guards to arrest her. However, the King was left cowering on his throne as Kyoshi dispatched his guards in a single move and admonished him in turn for daring to defy the Avatar. Held at the point of Kyoshi's war fan, the quivering monarch agreed to a compromise: the Earth King would give the peasants a voice in his ruling, while Kyoshi, in turn, agreed to protect Ba Sing Se's cultural heritage from further desecration. She proceeded to train an elite platoon of earthbenders called the Dai Li, though their subsequent corruption weighed heavily on Kyoshi in her afterlife.[13]\n\nLater life\n\nIn her later life, the Earth Kingdom entered an age of peace and prosperity. Kyoshi helped implement various bureaucratic policies to aid the poorest of the kingdom, and strengthened ties between the fifty-five states of the Earth Kingdom. The constitution that she drafted with the 46th Earth King was upheld by her for nearly two hundred years until her death. The Earth Sages that had once been against her began to seek redemption after seeing their order embarrassed and diminished in status, and they began to regain the people's trust they had lost, embracing their true role as wise advisors and academics. Many young people in the Earth Kingdom looked to Kyoshi and idolized her, such as princess Guo Xun of Omashu, who later became the city's queen.[62]\n\nKyoshi had a series of companions throughout her life. Her final airbender companion was a nun from the Eastern Air Temple named Disha, who joined her when Kyoshi was already more than two centuries old. Their last mission together was in 84 BG, pursuing a daofei leader in the Earth Kingdom. Kyoshi and Disha learned that the outlaw was the son of a man the Avatar had executed many years prior, and that he had his band commit various atrocities for the sole purpose of drawing Kyoshi's attention and to have the chance to face her himself.\n\nAfter they challenged the daofei, Disha told Kyoshi how the man's actions had been shaped by her own decision to kill his father years ago. The nun believed that too many of the problems they had faced had become the direct consequences of the Avatar's earlier actions, and that she feared what Kyoshi might become if she lived another century. Kyoshi deeply misliked her companion's advice, and Disha chose to part ways with the Avatar as a result. When Disha told the Council of Elders about her concerns, word spread, and soon no airbender master was willing to assist Kyoshi any more.[63]\n\nDeath\n\nKyoshi died in the year 82 BG at the age of 230, two years after she and Disha parted ways.[63] She was the oldest confirmed Avatar and human in history,[7] though some other individuals were rumored to have lived even longer.[64] It is possible that Kyoshi learned the secret of immortality from her spiritual teacher, Lao Ge.[14] Her daughter Koko succeeded her as the leader of Kyoshi Island,[11] and she reincarnated as the Fire Nation noble, Roku.\n\nWhile news of Kyoshi's passing would spread across the world, no one was sure how death had actually managed to catch up with the Avatar, not even her close companions. Sister Disha presumed that Kyoshi eventually came to believe Disha may have known her better than she knew herself, and simply \"let go\", choosing to finally end her immortality and let the Avatar Cycle continue.[63]\n\nLegacy\n\nAvatar Kyoshi statue\nWooden statues of Avatar Kyoshi could be found across Kyoshi Island.\nFollowing her death, Kyoshi became a legend and was considered one of the greatest Avatars.[65] After her death, Disha, believed it was likely no human in history had ever done as much good for the world as Kyoshi.[63] The devotion to her memory was strongest in her adopted homeland, as wooden statues of Avatar Kyoshi were erected in every village of Kyoshi Island,[66] and a shrine dedicated to her was erected in Suki's village, displaying the late Avatar's outfit and war fans.[3] Over time, some villages on Kyoshi Island began to believe that they should limit contact with the outside world to a minimum, interpreting Kyoshi splitting off the island as a \"mandate\" for isolation.[67][nb 2] However, other communities on the island continued to trade with the Earth Kingdom.[2][68]\n\nServing the world as the Avatar for over two centuries, Kyoshi led the four nations into an unprecedented time of peace and prosperity. Soon after her death, the world was on the brink of a technological renaissance and industrial revolution, which was made possible by the phenomenon of international collaboration fostered by business and academia to solve the most pressing issues of their day, with technological institutes springing up across the world, and scholars, inventors, and educators directly forging ties with one another in the name of progress.[69] However, materials for these new technologies were scarce, and complex political circumstances and the ambitious leadership of many world leaders after Kyoshi's death meant that the nations began to compete with one another over resources.[70]\n\nThe peace she had maintained throughout the Earth Kingdom was maintained for a time by the Earth Sages after her death, who strove to uphold her policies and the constitution, and continued to lecture on how they could benefit the poorest of society. However, the death of Kyoshi allowed Earth King Jialun to begin manipulating the constitution. The Earth Sages were confident in speaking against the king's corruption, but this led to a mass purge orchestrated by the king and the Dai Li, known as the Night of Silenced Sages. The peace that Kyoshi had maintained in her homeland was thus entirely undone by the time that her successor, Avatar Roku, was a young man, with the Earth Kingdom suffering once more under a greedy and exceedingly calculating Earth King.[62][71]\n\nThe Kyoshi Medal of Freedom, regarded as the highest recognition conferred upon exemplary military personnel in the Earth Kingdom,[72] and Kyoshi Bridge in Republic City both share her name.[73]\n\nIn the centuries after her death, several details of Kyoshi's life faded out of public memory. Most notably, it became a point of pride for Kyoshi Islanders to attribute her birthplace to the locality,[2] and one of her successors, Avatar Aang, also falsely believed that she had been born in the area that later became Kyoshi Island.[74] The Avatar's relationship with Rangi also faded out of public knowledge in some villages on the island.[67]\n\nKyoshi's attraction to both men and women was known to some people centuries after her death, including Kya, who relayed the Avatar's preferences as well as her failure to establish lasting change and tolerance toward such relationships in her home nation to Avatar Korra and her girlfriend, Asami Sato.[59]\n\nAppearances in Avatar Roku's life\n\nKyoshi first fully appeared to Roku in a vision after he had defeated Chief Ulo. She appeared before him in a space that looked like the Southern Air Temple's Avatar sanctuary. Kyoshi told Roku that he had not failed in his endeavors, even though she knew of his fears of failure. When Roku told her that he believed he had killed Ulo, Kyoshi responded that he had no other choice, and told him that it would not be the last time he had to take such an action for the sake of the greater good. Roku asked her if there may have been an alternative, such as having Ulo imprisoned for what he had done. Kyoshi asked Roku if he thought keeping him caged would have been more humane, or if it was worth expending so many resources on keeping him confined. Roku admitted he was unsure, but resolved that he would try not to kill in order to find peace. Kyoshi stayed silent as Roku asked her what could be done. Before the vision of her turned to stone, she told him that the only true mistake to make was not looking within.[75]\n\nAppearances in Avatar Aang's life\n\nKyoshi appears\nKyoshi manifested herself through Aang during his trial for Chin's death.\nDuring his trip to Kyoshi Island, Aang observed the statue erected in her honor.[2] She thereafter appeared in a vision as the most recent Earth Kingdom Avatar when Avatar Roku was explaining the nature of the Avatar State to Aang.[76] Kyoshi later manifested herself through Aang to testify in a trial proving the Avatar's innocence, though she confessed to killing Chin while doing so.[3]\n\nWhen helping Aang to reconnect with her and his other predecessors after being shot down by Azula's lightning, she apologized to him for the wrongful murder charge in Chin Village and explained that after Chin's demise, she helped the world live in balance; she accomplished a lot of good but also made mistakes, one of which was the creation of the Dai Li, as she could never have foreseen how corrupt and cruel they would become. Kyoshi imparted Aang with the wisdom that all of their actions have consequences, even if they do not manifest in their own lifetime, and sent him to find her predecessor.[13]\n\nBefore the arrival of Sozin's Comet, Aang summoned Kyoshi's spirit, seeking advice on how to defeat Phoenix King Ozai without killing him. Kyoshi reminded him that her forceful ending of Chin the Conqueror's war for dominance brought a great era of peace. Aang pointed out that she was not directly responsible for Chin's death, arguing that it was a result of his own arrogance. Kyoshi replied that she saw no difference in this, and told him that she would have done anything to stop Chin. She left Aang, telling him that only justice would bring peace. Aang regretted consulting Kyoshi on this complex matter after hearing her advice.[77]\n\nWhile Aang was trying to establish contact with Avatar Yangchen for a solution to the situation with General Old Iron, Kyoshi appeared in a vision which represented Aang's restored connection to his past lives after restoring his link with Roku. Despite his displeasure with her advice to kill Ozai, Aang nonetheless greeted her cheerfully before moving on.[78]\n\nAppearances in Avatar Korra's life\n\nAvatars\nKyoshi was present, along with all the other Avatars, as Korra's bending was restored.\nKyoshi, alongside many other past Avatars, appeared to Korra after she had lost her bending to Amon. This appearance was representative of Korra's ability to establish a connection with her spiritual side and for the purpose of having her bending restored.[79]\n\nAfter Korra had lost her memory, Kyoshi appeared before her, taking over from Avatar Roku, and informed the young Avatar that if she did not reconnect with her Avatar Spirit, darkness would engulf the world and she would die, ending the era of the Avatar.[80]\n\nWhile Unalaq was attacking Raava, Korra envisioned Kyoshi as part of the Avatar lineup, which she had seen prior to regaining her bending; however, the latter's connection to Korra was severed due to Unalaq's assault on and subsequent destruction of the light spirit.[81]\n\nAppearance in Suki's life\n\nWhen Suki despaired in her cell in the Boiling Rock after being released from solitary confinement and Biyu's treachery, a vision of Kyoshi appeared before her. Kyoshi told her that her friends had not abandoned her and that she was not alone. In disbelief, Suki asked how she could know and reached out to the Avatar, but Kyoshi quickly vanished.[67]\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nI'll help the four nations... even if they don't want it.\nKYOSHI.[82]\n\nKyoshi dejected\nIn her youth, Kyoshi suffered from hardship and low self-esteem.\nKyoshi's life and personality were marked by her struggle with herself and as the Avatar. She was naturally empathic, considerate, trusting, level-headed, and hard-working.[4][5][8][19][83] As result of her difficult early life, she suffered from low self-esteem in puberty[84] and continued to constantly doubt her capabilities and goodness as a person after announcing her position as Avatar.[5][35]\n\nAs a child, she was distrustful of people due to the abandonment and neglect she had suffered.[15] Inclined to endure hardship with stoicism instead of fighting back[4] and having been raised with few positive social contacts, Kyoshi often struggled to manage situations proactively and failed to properly read people in her young adulthood.[83] As such, she tended to use force to solve problems,[52] despite her low opinion of violence.[35] Overall, she had a very strong sense of justice,[77][5] influenced by her early life, and little patience for those who caused suffering just to benefit themselves.[52][83] She could always tell right from wrong, and her experiences with poverty led her to be fiercely determined to stop people in power from abusing their position.[85] Her ultimate drive was to maintain balance by any means necessary.[85]\n\nKyoshi usually hid her self-doubts and compassion behind an image of righteous fierceness to fulfill her duties as the Avatar, showing her loving and friendly side only to those with whom she was close. To those she did not know, she came across as direct, fierce, and assertive, and made her voice heard no matter what her internal feelings might have been.[5][85] In private, she could become easily flustered and was the more passive part in her relationship with Rangi.[83][9] In addition, Kyoshi had a strong affinity for order and cleanliness due to her background, as she had to live in dirt and amid garbage as a child.[8][19]\n\nKyoshi threatens the 46th Earth King\nKyoshi had little respect for much of the world's ruling elites and, accordingly, was willing to threaten them.\nFaced with the world's harsh realities and after being repeatedly disappointed by political elites, Kyoshi gradually became more determined and grim when dealing with opponents.[34][35] When truly convinced that someone was utterly corrupt or evil, she had few qualms about ending their lives to save those of others.[30][32][33] Although she never became completely ruthless, her way of doing things as the Avatar was strongly influenced by Jianzhu as well as Lao Ge.[32][35][83] Kyoshi thus had few qualms about using her powers and enforce her will, openly threatening powerful people like Fire Lord Zoryu or the 46th Earth King.[12][52][83] She often took risks and seized the moment, being an Avatar of action and acting decisively and swiftly.[85] By her forties, she would no longer \"take any BS from anyone\".[84] In general, Kyoshi gave her most threatening opponents one chance to change their course,[3][13][30][52] and if they wasted it, she did not hesitate to end them.[28][52] Despite that hard stance, she generally preferred to not kill anyone and was known to be more forgiving toward less dangerous foes.[5][35]\n\nIn her final years, Kyoshi became even more dedicated to her relentless pursuit of justice and peace. However, after leading such a long life, she began to lose perspective of the individual value of human lives. In her third century of life, she seemed to hesitate less and less when determining whether the threat posed by someone outweighed their right to live.[63] This deeply utilitarian side of Kyoshi was often the one most familiar to future Avatars when they turned to her for advice.[75][77] Kyoshi could deeply mislike being confronted with genuine concerns about the way she conducted herself in her later life, but was also able to reassure others and inspire confidence in them.[75][67]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAbilities\n\nBending\n\nKyoshi's fans\nAvatar Kyoshi used a pair of golden war fans, which provided her greater comfort while bending tiny earth objects.\nAs a reincarnation of the entity known as the Avatar, Kyoshi possessed the power to bend all four elements. At the age of 16, she momentarily entered the State for the first time,[26] albeit involuntarily, while fighting Tagaka, having been activated as an instinctive defense mechanism. Later that same year, Kyoshi was able to remain fully aware of her heightened powers while in the Avatar State when she consciously dueled and killed Xu Ping An.[30] Her most spectacular known feat was using the Avatar State to separate her home peninsula from the Earth Kingdom mainland and push it far out to sea to create Kyoshi Island. To do so, she first cut down to the earth's mantle with earth and lavabending to sever the landmasses, followed by airbending to push the island out to sea.[3]\n\nEarthbending\n\nKyoshi lavabends\nKyoshi was capable of lavabending.\nDuring her youth, Kyoshi struggled to manipulate small amounts of earth and lacked precision with her bending. However, over time, she was able to overcome this handicap and manipulate tiny shards of glass with ease. During her training with the Flying Opera Company, she improved her control over earth. During her last fight with Jianzhu, she was able to match his power, holding up a stone tea shop. Eventually, she learned the signature ability of the Flying Opera Company: dust stepping, by which she could rise into the air by summoning dust and dirt to temporarily support her weight. Other impressive features that Kyoshi displayed were her abillities to break through walls instinctively and to break through multiple layers of Loongkau. She was also able to dig a moat fifty feet deep around the palace of Governor Te before any daofei could break into the palace.\n\nFirebending\n\nKyoshi was a natural talent with firebending and was particularly capable of the breath of fire. Though initially unable to pass Hei-Ran's test to see if Kyoshi was a firebender, she unlocked the skill after the murder of Yun by Jianzhu, creating a large explosive breath of fire. During her fight with Xu Ping An, she entered the Avatar State, while retaining her control. She was able to create a lasso of fire around the Yellow Neck criminals. Kyoshi's raw strength of firebending was also displayed when she was able to block several fireballs from Fire Nation palace guards with one hand. A fireblast Kyoshi produced was able to explode Yun's defensive shield, even though Rangi had to alter the course of the attack. Kyoshi was also capable of jet-stepping and able to melt the lock of an iron door during the attack on Governor Te's Palace.\n\nAirbending\n\nEven though Kyoshi lacked an airbending master during her time with the Flying Opera Company, she was naturally talented with the element. After only one training session trying to create wind with Rangi, Kyoshi was capable of producing a swirling dance of leaves. During the attack on Te's compound, she summoned a powerful gust of wind that knocked back Tieguai the Immortal. Later, she rose into the air in a vortex of air and then proceeded to drop Xu, allowing him to plummet to his death. She was also capable of fighting several of the best Fire Nation guards by using airbending in close quarters to push them against walls and ceilings.\n\nWaterbending\n\nKyoshi displayed her first feat of waterbending when Kirima threw a pellet of water at her, to test if Kyoshi was truly the Avatar. She displayed her raw strength for waterbending multiple times; first when Kyoshi was able to lift all the water out of a large and deep pond during the raid on Te's palace. She also summoned a great wave to lift Lady Huazo's ship and freeze it in ice in her attempts to intimidate the noblewoman. In addition, she was able to heal using water, becoming capable of an advanced and unique healing technique that can slow every process of a body down, including death, a technique that requires great raw power. Kyoshi was capable of using this in combat, freezing the heart and lungs of her enemies, instantly killing them. She was capable of standard healing as well, using it to tend to the wounds of Rangi after her fight with Yun. Following the fight, she was able to tap into the Avatar State to draw water from underneath the ruins of the Avatar Mansion, in order to heal Rangi.\n\nAvatar Spirit\n\nUnder Nyahitha, the spiritual guide of her predecessor, Avatar Kuruk, Kyoshi learned various methods by which she could commune with her past lives. The first was to simply have a vision of him, a method that would work best in locations of meaning to the past Avatar in question. The second method consisted of the past life taking over her body to speak to another on her behalf rather than direct communication. The final and most difficult was to meditate into the Spirit World, where she could talk to the Avatar face to face. Kyoshi showed an extraordinary level of aptitude with the last method. During her very first session, she successfully projected herself into Kuruk's early memories as an observer, looking at stages of his life.[40]\n\nOther skills\n\nApart from the elements, Kyoshi was a skilled warrior and well-versed in the art of tessenjutsu, wielding a pair of golden metallic war fans with great skill and dexterity.[3][13] Kyoshi was exceptionally strong and able to lift a grown man with one hand as a teenager.[22][86]\n\nBefore the invasion of Te's compound, Lao Ge conferred upon Avatar Kyoshi the secret of immortality. As aging was the result of the body deteriorating on \"the smallest, most invisible levels\" without repairing this damage, Lao Ge taught her that one could stop this process by keeping an inventory of one's parts and putting all things which had fallen out of order back into their places. Doing so would allow Kyoshi to reconstruct her body over and over again, allowing her to retain one particular appearance for centuries."

A NEW ERA OF EQUALITY HAS BEGUN!\n\nAmon, born as Noatak, was the charismatic and mysterious leader of an anti-bender revolutionary group known as the Equalists. Their ultimate goal was to introduce equality for all by permanently ridding the world of benders.[7] A nimble, agile, and stealthy fighter, Amon was fearless in facing his opponents, regardless of their powerful bending skills and abilities.[8]\n\nClaiming to be an innocent nonbender to whom the spirits granted the ability to remove a person's bending permanently, a power previously demonstrated only by the Avatar, Amon gained the confidence and support of many people with the same ideals. However, when the complete conquest of Republic City by the Equalists became imminent, Amon's true identity was exposed to the public by Avatar Korra. In actuality, he was a prodigious Northern Water Tribe bloodbender, son of the escaped crime boss, Yakone. Alongside his younger brother, the former councilman, Tarrlok, Amon was unknowingly shaped by Yakone to be a tool for his revenge against the Avatar. With his identity exposed and his followers deserting him, Amon fled the city with Tarrlok, but the latter ignited the fuel tank of their speedboat, killing them both.[9]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the real name of Amon from \"The Legend of Korra\"? toggle section\nWhat is the ultimate goal of Amon's revolutionary group, the Equalists? toggle section\nHow does Amon remove a person's bending abilities in \"The Legend of Korra\"? toggle section\nWhat are the key characteristics of Amon's fighting style in Avatar? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of Amon's claim to be an innocent nonbender in \"The Legend of Korra\"? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\n\n1/2\n\n\n\n\nEarly life\n\nNoatak and Tarrlok\nNoatak and Tarrlok were happier during their younger years.\nNoatak was born in the Northern Water Tribe to Yakone and his wife, as the older brother of Tarrlok by three years. Growing up, he was a good-natured child who always looked out for his younger brother and wanted everyone to be treated fairly and equally.[5]\n\nWhen Noatak and Tarrlok both discovered they were waterbenders, Yakone trained them ruthlessly to develop their skills. While Noatak was a natural, Tarrlok struggled to progress as quickly and was often verbally abused by Yakone as a result. Noatak initially stood up for his brother, but stopped when Yakone ordered him to never talk back.[5]\n\nWhen Noatak was ten, Yakone took his sons on a supposed hunting trip far from their home, where he revealed his true identity as a Republic City criminal and explained to them the power of bloodbending. Claiming that their family had the strongest line of bloodbenders in history, he expressed his intent to make his sons bloodbenders of the highest caliber in order to exact his revenge against Avatar Aang for stripping him of his bending. Yakone trained the boys secretly during every full moon to use their bloodbending on animals, such as yaks and wolves, until they were able to bloodbend without a full moon. Noatak reveled in his newfound power, eventually mastering Yakone's unique psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen. As a prodigy, he carried the burden of all his father's expectations and demands. Over the years, he became cold and detached.[5]\n\nNoatak bloodbending Yakone\nTired of his father's treatment, a young Noatak bloodbent Yakone.\nEventually, Yakone ordered his sons to bloodbend each other, which Noatak did with great ease, ignoring his brother's screams of pain until Yakone ordered him to stop. When Tarrlok refused to bloodbend Noatak, Yakone became angry and called him weak. However, as he started to lash out at Tarrlok as punishment, Noatak halted the attack by bloodbending his own father. He then called Yakone weak for being stripped of his waterbending by the Avatar and reminded his father that they were his children, not his \"tools of vengeance\". He subsequently urged his brother to start a new life with him away from Yakone, but Tarrlok declined out of worry for their mother. This prompted Noatak to agree with their father's assertion that Tarrlok was weak. After flinging Yakone in the snow, Noatak ran off into the blizzard, prompting Yakone and Tarrlok to search for him in the following days; they eventually assumed that he had perished in the storm.[5]\n\nAt some point in his life, Noatak figured out how to use bloodbending to disrupt a bender's chi making it impossible for them to bend.[10] He assumed the alias of \"Amon\" and became the leader of the Equalists, an organization striving to rid the world of bending. To garner sympathy and hide that he was a bender himself, Amon claimed that he was born on a small farm to a poor family of nonbenders that were being extorted by a firebender. When his father had supposedly confronted the bender, he and the rest of his family were murdered and Amon's face was left scarred from the attack, forcing him to hide behind a mask ever since. He also claimed that he had been granted the power to remove bending permanently by the spirits because they believed the Avatar had failed the world and wanted him to usher in an era of equality.[1][5]\n\nAccelerating plans\n\nAfter Avatar Korra announced her official relocation to Republic City during a press conference at City Hall, Amon told his second-in-command that the Avatar's arrival would force them to accelerate their plans.[11]\n\nLater, at an Equalist assembly called \"The Revelation\", Amon revealed his plan to eradicate the world of benders, as they \"had only brought suffering\" and \"were the cause of every war in every era\". Amon rallied the sympathy of his followers with a false backstory, in which his family, all nonbenders, was extorted by a firebender and his face was left horribly scarred. He also claimed to have been chosen by the spirits to usher in a new era of balance to the world by permanently removing people's bending in order to make equality a reality.\n\nZolt being bloodbent\nAmon removed Lightning Bolt Zolt's firebending.\nAs a demonstration of his abilities, Amon had his Equalist henchmen bring forward several captured Triple Threat Triad members, along with Bolin, and proceeded to remove their bending one by one, starting with the firebending of the notorious crime boss Lightning Bolt Zolt, whom he was able to defeat without the use of any offensive attacks. However, before he could finally purge Bolin of his earthbending, Korra orchestrated a distraction by releasing a cloud of steam into the room, allowing Mako to rescue Bolin in the resulting confusion and escape. As the brothers and Korra were riding away on Naga, tailed by several Equalists, Amon allowed them to escape, remarking that the Avatar would be the perfect individual to spread the word about his powerful new ability.[1]\n\nMeeting Avatar Korra\n\nBefore officially meeting Korra, Amon had made a severe impression on her with his actions during the Revelation rally by unknowingly plaguing her with nightmares in which he removed her bending. After being proclaimed public enemy number one by the United Republic Council, he spread a message over the radio to his fellow Equalists, using the actions of the Council as proof of benders' oppressive nature.\n\nAmon threatening Korra\nAmon threatened to destroy Korra once and for all during their final showdown.\nAfter Councilman Tarrlok and Avatar Korra led a task force that successfully raided an Equalist training facility, Amon was publicly challenged by the Avatar to a midnight duel on Aang Memorial Island without the involvement of the task force or chi-blockers. However, Amon did not arrive on time, nor did he come alone. Just as Korra began to leave the island, several hidden Equalists reeled her inside the island's museum, where she was quickly overpowered and incapacitated by chi-blocking. Amon emerged from the shadows and revealed that he would allow her to keep her bending for the time being, stating that she would otherwise become a martyr and cause benders from every nation to rally behind her \"untimely demise\". However, he warned a terrified Korra that he would \"save her for last\" and finally \"destroy her\" in their inevitable showdown. With that final statement, he proceeded to knock her out and flee with his group.[2]\n\nAttacking the Pro-bending Arena\n\nEqualists and the Wolfbats\nAmon forcibly removed the bending of Tahno and the other Wolfbats.\nOn the eve of the Pro-bending Championship match, Amon demanded that the Council end the hero-worship of bending athletes by shutting down the Pro-bending Arena and canceling the tournament, threatening \"severe consequences\" should they refuse. The Council voted to keep the arena open, which Amon revealed to be in line with his plans for the situation. At the conclusion of the championship match, he entered the arena and stripped the victors, Tahno and the rest of the White Falls Wolfbats, of their bending powers.\n\nWhile his Equalists overpowered members of the Metalbending Police Force in the stands with electrified gloves, the revolutionary leader gave a speech in which he condemned benders, using the cheating of the Wolfbats as an example of their typical abusive behavior toward their fellow nonbending citizens. Furthermore, he stated that the fate of the same pro-bending team served as a warning to all benders who dared to oppose his goals.\n\nLater in his monologue, Amon mentioned that the current tyrannical bending regime would soon be replaced with \"a fair minded, Equalist\" government. To this end, he planned on disposing of the bending arts in Republic City, his idealized start to eventually equalize the entire world. Declaring the revolution to have begun, he devastated the central playing field with a timed explosion before leaving the arena through the roof on an airship. Boarding the zeppelin, he narrowly escaped Korra's firebending attack and disappeared altogether.[12]\n\nA family reunion\n\nAmon being bloodbent\nAmon nearly effortlessly overcame Tarrlok's bloodbending abilities.\nDays later, Amon, accompanied by the Lieutenant and a group of Equalists, found Tarrlok in his cabin deep in the mountains surrounding Republic City. Upon being warned that it was his time to be \"equalized\", the Councilman defended himself by bloodbending his attackers. Although his henchmen were easily subdued by Tarrlok, Amon's skill in the practice allowed him to resist, much to the Councilman's shock. When asked what he was, referring to his ability to overcome the effects of bloodbending, Amon simply responded that he was \"the solution\" and proceeded to take Tarrlok's bending. He chose to handle the defeated Tarrlok on his own, as he was worried that people would find out that they were brothers.[13]\n\nWhile taking care of Tarrlok, he ordered his fellow Equalists to retrieve Korra, who was trapped inside a metal box in the basement. He warned his men not to underestimate her and ordered them to electrify the box, which would leave her knocked out when they opened it. However, as he was putting Tarrlok in the truck in which they had arrived, Korra stormed out of the cabin, having overpowered the other Equalists. Noticing Amon, she shot several ice spears in his direction; the Equalist leader evaded them all and briefly gave chase, but stopped when Korra made her escape by swiftly gliding down the snowy slopes of the mountain. When the Lieutenant and the other Equalists joined him in watching the Avatar leave, he scolded them for having underestimated her.[14]\n\nAttacking Republic City\n\nHiroshi Sato and Amon\nAmon and Hiroshi Sato led the battle for Republic City.\nAmon observed the start of the battle for Republic City from an airship floating above the metropolis. Eventually, his airship was in the vicinity of the police headquarters as Tenzin and Team Avatar were fighting the Equalists' mecha tanks. After Hiroshi Sato, who was present aboard the airship with Amon, expressed his disgust while watching his daughter fighting alongside benders, the revolutionary leader promised him that he would have his daughter back soon.\n\nThat evening, after the entire city had fallen, Amon arrived on Air Temple Island, where his followers brought a captured Lin Beifong to him. He offered her the chance to keep her bending in exchange for information regarding Korra's whereabouts, but at her defiant refusal, Amon proceeded to take away her bending.[15]\n\nEndgame\n\nAfter the original inhabitants had fled, Amon re-purposed Air Temple Island into his base of operations and had his followers bring forth all captured benders in order to strip them of their powers. He had taken residence in the tower on the island and also used it as a makeshift prison for the captured Tarrlok. As he left the island in an airship for the Equalist victory rally at the Pro-bending Arena, Mako and Korra, disguised as Equalists, infiltrated the island and learned his backstory and true identity as Noatak.[5]\n\nRescuing the airbender family\nAmon and his followers tried to thwart the rescue of the airbenders.\nWith the city under his control, Amon held a victory rally at the Pro-bending Arena. As he retold his fabricated story from the Revelation rally, he was interrupted by Korra, who addresses him by his true name and outed him as a waterbender who used bloodbending to take people's bending away rather than the alleged gift given to him by the spirits. Korra continued by revealing Amon was the son of former crime boss Yakone and Tarrlok's brother, much to the audience's shock. Though his family tree was revealed by the Avatar, Amon remained calm and confident and refuted Korra's accusations by taking off his mask, revealing the supposed scar on his face that was bestowed upon him by a firebender. Using convincing makeup to fool the audience, Amon managed to turn the tables and make Korra out to be the liar in the eyes of his supporters. When the Avatar and Mako were about to leave, Amon urged them to stay, directing their attention to Tenzin and his children whom he had captured. Aiming to \"rid the world of airbending\", he invited them to come down to the stage to try and stop him. Arrogantly turning his back to the duo to face Tenzin, he was forced to jump out of the path of Mako's lightning attack. Although he was able to easily avoid Mako's fire blasts, the air swipes that the freed Tenzin threw at him proved to be too much, and he was flung off the stage.\n\nAmon taking Korra's bending\nAmon removed Korra's bending.\nAmon recovered quickly and went after Korra and Mako, who were acting as a diversion to let Tenzin and his family escape. He found them in one of the arena's storage rooms and subdued them easily with his bloodbending, believing that they were alone with no witnesses. However, after taking away Korra's bending, Amon realized his distraught lieutenant had witnessed the whole thing. Being denounced as a traitor by his second-in-command, Amon was forced to defend himself, using his bloodbending to easily stop the attack and send his lieutenant flying into a pile of wooden boards. The distraction provided Mako with the time that he needed to charge a lightning attack, enabling him to immobilize Amon so he could grab a severely weakened Korra to escape. However, Amon caught up with them quickly and again used his bloodbending to effectively halt them.\n\nHe prepared to take away Mako's bending, musing over the fact that no one else had been able to get the better of him, and that it was almost a shame to take bending away from one so talented. With his attention drawn away from the downed and seemingly powerless Korra, Amon was completely caught off-guard when she, seeing Mako in danger, suddenly unlocked her airbending and used it to knock him away from the firebender. As she unleashed a barrage of air attacks upon him, flinging him through the hallway, he briefly regained the upper hand with bloodbending. Korra, however, managed to break his hold on her, blasting him out of a window into the harbor below with an air kick, where he began sinking rapidly into the sea after losing consciousness.\n\nAmon revealed as a waterbender\nAmon's identity as a waterbender was exposed.\nUnaware that the water had washed his fake scar away, he regained consciousness underwater and instinctively used his waterbending to emerge from the sea on a gigantic water spout to avoid drowning, exposing his waterbending abilities to his followers that were outside. Realizing he had lost all of his leverage and followers, Amon quickly made his escape, dropping back into the water to avoid Mako's barrage of fire blasts. He managed to make his way back to Air Temple Island, where he released Tarrlok, expressing regret for what he had done to him and once more offering his younger brother a chance to leave with him so they could start a new life together, as he was all he had left in the world.\n\nThe two brothers acquired a speedboat and made their way out of Republic City, journeying across the Mo Ce Sea. Amon expressed his joy of being together with family again, though admitted he had almost forgotten the sound of the name he was born with and knew when he still had a loving family. As he drove the boat, the defeated revolutionary shed a tear upon hearing his brother assure him it would be like the old days, right before Tarrlok used one of the many electrified gloves kept in the boat to ignite its fuel tank, wanting to bring an end to what he referred to as their sad story. The resulting explosion formed a large cloud of smoke, visible from afar, killing them both.[9]\n\nLegacy\n\nThe reveal of Amon's true identity threw the Equalist movement into disarray. Many members considered Amon a fraud, and abandoned the group.[16][17] The remaining Equalist loyalists separated into many groups of varying aims and beliefs, as initially no leader emerged to take Amon's place and rally the militants.[16][18] A few Equalists remained loyal to Amon's memory.[19][20] Following his death, Avatar Korra restored the bending of the innocent who had lost their abilities due to Amon.[9]\n\nAmon as a hallucination\nA hallucination of Amon appeared to Korra after she was poisoned, telling her that the world does not need the Avatar.\nWhen Korra was administered a poison by the Red Lotus that would force her to enter the Avatar State in 171 AG, Amon appeared to her in a hallucination as his mask also appeared beneath Zaheer's face. He told Korra that the world did not need her anymore. Emphasizing the futility of her resistance, he urged her, together with hallucinations of Unalaq and Vaatu, to let go and enter the Avatar State.[21] He appeared to Korra again in a swamp-induced vision, in which she witnessed the Equalist leader removing her bending.[22]\n\nAmon was later used by Varrick in his story of Bolin, Hero of the World, in which he was described as a zombie. He was added to the conference call Zaheer was having with Vaatu and although he expressed his willingness to help take out their common nemesis, Bolin, deeming him to be \"way too powerful and awesome\", he wanted to leave Unalaq out of the team, though soon found out the Chief of the North had been listening in on their conversation. Amon and his two other companions tried to get rid of Unalaq and eventually just hung up on him. Amon's plot line was ignored in the rest of the mover script.[23]\n\nAround 174 AG, one or more Amon loyalists based at Republic City University began to repeatedly hijack the air time of a popular radio program, Central Beats, playing a recording of Amon's Equalist speeches. Central Beats host Emi Emerald consequently tasked some associates with finding the hijackers.[19]\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nAnti-bending Revolution\nAmon displayed great charisma as an orator.\nAs a child, Noatak was caring and fair-minded. He strove to treat everyone equally and protected his younger brother, Tarrlok, from their father's verbal abuse. However, after being corrupted by bloodbending and enduring the burden of Yakone's expectations for several years, Noatak grew cold and distant. He assumed a more detached persona and showed disregard for the suffering of his bloodbending victims, including his own brother. Eventually, Noatak fully embraced both his power and his independence by forcibly halting his father's abuse of Tarrlok, flaunting his power over him, and denouncing him as weak.[5]\n\nUnlike Tarrlok, Amon reveled in his bloodbending abilities. He idolized Avatar Aang's ability to remove an individual's bending, believing such a skill to be even more powerful than bloodbending. In time, Amon devised his own technique to sever a bender's connection to their element through bloodbending, an action only known to be reversible with energybending.[5]\n\nAmon harbored a severe abhorrence of benders and regarded bending as an \"impurity\" to be \"cleansed\". This stemmed from his belief that bending only caused suffering and that benders possessed an unnatural advantage over nonbenders.[12] He was a staunch believer in what he viewed as equality, affectionately referring to his followers as \"brothers and sisters\".[1] Despite being a bender himself, Amon sincerely believed his anti-bending rhetoric, having striven to be fair and treat everyone equally since he was a child. Ultimately, it was a misguided desire for justice that led him to start the Anti-bending Revolution.[5]\n\nIn order to \"correct\" perceived inequalities, Amon employed fear tactics; he openly threatened benders and relished his enemies' powerlessness and terror.[2] He stoked hatred against benders and sowed division between benders and nonbenders, both to garner sympathy for his cause and to turn the populace against the bending establishment.[1] He was merciless and unwavering in his anti-bending convictions, even being willing to kidnap and de-bend those who are the last of a bending art, including helpless children.[9]\n\nAmon was clever and composed, as well as a convincing orator. He was a gifted public speaker who knew how to mystify and terrify his allies and enemies alike. The cult of personality he built around himself was a major factor in the widespread following he attracted, as well as the terror he spread throughout the bending community, including the United Republic Council. Despite his great power, Amon often took defensive or strategic positions, such as when he allowed Korra to escape his rally and spread word of his abilities to the city.[1] Later, Amon refused to take up Korra's offer for a one-on-one fight and spared her bending, foreseeing that it would make her a martyr for benders and thus unite them globally against his cause.[2] His proactive and logical thinking typically put him \"one step ahead\" of his enemies.\n\nAmon's scar\nAmon's fake scar was the fabricated proof of his fictional cover story.\nAmon was a calculating and manipulative individual who executed his schemes with great foresight and efficiency. He took extra steps to ensure the success of his plans, even going so far as to create a fake scar to support his pseudo backstory. Unlike Korra, who often attempted to engage him openly, Amon was cautious and avoided direct conflict unless he was making a statement, such as his organization's show of power at the pro-bending arena.[9]\n\nAmon's unwavering strength of will and high level of self-control made him a charismatic leader and a formidable opponent. Even in the midst of conflict, Amon retained a calm composure and recovered swiftly from any blows to his plans. He demonstrated a similar command of self-discipline in his dealings with his allies, always delivering orders calmly and succinctly, and only scolding lightly when they did not heed his warnings.[14] Only mortal danger could slip up Amon, whose survival instincts led him to waterbend in front of his followers. However, even in a distraught state, he briskly regained his composure and used his strength and skill to escape.[9]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAbilities\n\nWaterbending\n\nAmon waterbending\nAmon launched himself on a gigantic water spout.\nAmon was a highly powerful waterbending master. His brother, Tarrlok, noted that he had never encountered a bender as strong as Amon.[5] From a young age, Amon was a waterbending prodigy and excelled under the tutelage of his father Yakone, who continually praised Amon for his abilities and skill, especially in comparison to the less talented Tarrlok. Amon was capable of launching himself out of a body of water on a gigantic water spout and propelling himself over the surface at a speed exceeding that of Mako's fire blasts.[9]\n\nBloodbending\n\nAmon bloodbending Korra and Mako\nAmon effortlessly subdued two skilled benders, Korra and Mako, using bloodbending.\nAmon just as quickly mastered the rare and outlawed art of bloodbending, becoming exceptionally proficient and powerful at a young age. Under Yakone's tutelage, he mastered the technique to such an extent that he could perform it at any time, without the aid of a full moon, by the age of fourteen. At the same time, he mastered his father's unique ability to psychically bloodbend, which allowed him to bend not only through physical movement, but through sheer focus and strength of will. He was able to use more common bloodbending techniques, such as body manipulation and torture, on multiple targets without exerting much energy. He could levitate his targets, throw them around, subdue them, and knock them unconscious. With his skill in psychic bending, he was able to minimally alter the movements of his opponents and give himself the advantage without revealing that he was a bender.[24] He also exhibited the ability to resist bloodbending with little effort, even against Tarrlok, who had mastered the skill to a similar level.[14]\n\nAmon taking Lin's bending away\nAmon used bloodbending to strip Lin Beifong of her bending abilities.\nDespite growing fascinated by this skill, he ultimately desired more, wanting to have the power to remove people's bending, just as Avatar Aang had done to his father with the use of energybending. He eventually succeeded in this goal by using his mastery of bloodbending to \"sever\" an individual's bending connection by blocking their active chi paths, effectively achieving the same result as energybending.[10] No medical intervention was effective in reversing this effect, and even Katara, a world-renowned healer and bloodbending expert in her own right, was unable to reverse its effects. The only known way to reverse Amon's bending block is through the use of energybending, as demonstrated by Avatars Aang and Korra. If there is an element that has not been unlocked (like Korra's dormant airbending), that element will not be nullified.[9]\n\nOther skills\n\nAmon fighting Tarrlok\nAmon's agility and unarmed combat skills made him a match for even the strongest of benders, like Tarrlok.\nAmon epitomized versatility in many ways. He concealed his bending abilities through masterful hand-to-hand combat skills and the art of chi-blocking. His prowess proved great enough to defeat even the most powerful of benders. He also demonstrated his agility as a nimble fighter, allowing him to maneuver gracefully and evade bending assaults with ease, even at close-range.[1] He also supplemented his hand-to-hand skills with minor applications of his bloodbending in order to better defend and redirect enemy assaults. Apart from his combat skills, Amon had extreme physical resilience that allowed him to recover from a point-blank lightning bolt shot by Mako in mere seconds and subdue him with bloodbending.\n\nIntelligence\n\nAside from his combat abilities, Amon also possessed great intellect and charisma, making him a master manipulator. He effectively masqueraded his bloodbending technique, which he used to sever people's bending, as a mystical weapon given to him by the spirits. He was able to maintain this facade consistently even under the heat of battle. A gifted political strategist, he accurately portended that if he removed the Avatar's bending too early in his revolution, it would only end in Korra becoming a martyr, ensuring that benders across the globe would unite against his anti-bending agenda.[9] He took his charade to such heights that apart from wearing a mask, he even applied make-up to fake a large facial scar to legitimize his fabricated story of being mutilated by a firebender in order to further drive bending hate and sympathy for his cause.\n\nAs evidenced by the multiple attacks orchestrated by the Equalists, Amon was also a capable strategist and tactician, outmatching other organized forces such as the Metalbending Police Force and the United Forces armada on several occasions. He was also well-versed in terrorist tactics, subverting nonbenders by manipulating their hate and bestowing fear upon benders, always seeking a psychological edge against his opponents, and consistently using intimidation and threats against his numerous enemies."

Aang came forward and offered an apple to Appa, and the two became best friends almost immediately afterward.[1]\n\nJust before the Air Nomad Genocide, Aang heard that the monks were going to separate him from Monk Gyatso and subsequently decided to run away, using Appa as his mode of departure.

Faced with a life-or-death situation, the young Avatar entered the Avatar State and froze himself with Appa in an iceberg,[6] the latter was stuck in hibernation along with Aang for one hundred years.\n\nThe pair were discovered by Katara and Sokka.[3] After this, Appa became the group's main form of transportation in their quest to help Aang master all four elements throughout the world.[5] He appeared in most of Sokka and Princess Yue's dates, tried to steal food with Momo in the Foggy Swamp, and became a beloved friend for all members of Team Avatar.\n\nDisappearance\n\nAppa captured\nAppa was captured by sandbenders in the Si Wong Desert.\nAppa became lost for a short while when the group was traveling through the Earth Kingdom, having been kidnapped by a group of sandbenders in the middle of the vast Si Wong Desert, while Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo were trapped in an underground Spirit library.\n\nIt was later revealed that Appa was eventually sold to beetle-headed merchants, who in turn sold him to a Fire Nation circus where a sadistic trainer attempted to make him part of the show. Encouraged by a sympathetic boy, he later escaped and hurried back to the Si Wong Desert where he last saw Aang. Understanding that his friends weren't there anymore, Appa journeyed throughout the Earth Kingdom until he encountered the Kyoshi Warriors, who healed his various wounds, physical as well as emotional, that he had sustained on his travels. They wanted to escort him back to Aang, but they were soon thwarted in their attempt when Azula and her allies attacked. He was forced to flee, ushered away by Suki while the warriors tried to delay the three Fire Nation girls.\n\nOn his journey, Appa encountered Guru Pathik at the Eastern Air Temple, where the Guru was able to tell Appa of Aang's location by reading his energy. Consequently, he flew to Ba Sing Se, where he was captured by Long Feng[1] and kept in a secret location under Lake Laogai until his rescue at the hands of Zuko, who was initially planning on utilizing him to capture the Avatar until he talked with his uncle Iroh, deciding to do the right thing and set the bison free.\n\nEarth Kingdom\n\nAppa found the group cornered by Long Feng and the Dai Li and was instrumental in their defeat, biting Long Feng on the leg when confronted by him. Once safe, Aang welcomed him in a tearful display of affection.[2] Appa took part in forcibly entering the Royal Palace of Ba Sing Se, providing the first key piece of evidence to King Kuei of Long Feng's subterfuge since Long Feng's bite mark still lingered.\n\nWhen the Dai Li's cover-up efforts left the Earth King skeptical of Team Avatar's claims, Sokka made a last-ditch effort to show the king the ruined Fire Nation drill by enticing him with a ride on Appa. Since his saddle was lost during his capture, the group was forced to ride bareback on him and there was little to no time to regain it.[7] After the fall of Ba Sing Se, Appa was seen spiriting Team Avatar, including a near-fatally wounded Aang, the Earth King, and his pet, Bosco, out of the now-captured city.[8]\n\nIn the Fire Nation\n\nAppa stayed with the group as they found their way aboard Hakoda's commandeered Fire Navy vessel and finally had a new saddle constructed for him before Aang woke up from a weeks-long coma. After Aang ran off into a storm, Appa and the rest of Team Avatar split with Hakoda's crew and chased down Aang, regrouping on Crescent Island.[9] As they traveled through the Fire Nation on the team's second but Aang's first time riding on the new saddle, Appa was forced to stay hidden until he did have to fly, while Aang and Katara created a cloud around him so that he resembled a cloud to any Fire Nation civilians.[10] When they left him and Momo alone, the gang had to cover Appa up with some form of camouflage.\n\nArmored Appa\nAppa was equipped with armor for the invasion of the Fire Nation.\nAfter the invasion of the Fire Nation failed on the Day of Black Sun, Appa took Aang's friends and all of the younger members of the invasion force to the Western Air Temple in search of refuge.[11] Unbeknownst to Team Avatar, Zuko abandoned the Fire Nation during the invasion and followed them to the temple. When he arrived, Appa immediately welcomed and licked him, a direct result of him remaining grateful to the prince for freeing him from his imprisonment in Ba Sing Se. Despite Appa's obvious welcoming of Zuko, the group did not accept the latter's proposal of teaching Aang firebending until he saved the group from an attack conducted by Combustion Man.[12]\n\nIn the final days of the Hundred Year War, Sozin's Comet's arrival, Appa helped Team Avatar, excluding Aang, travel to the Earth Kingdom,[13] where they had June and her shirshu, Nyla, try to track Aang. Unsuccessful, they instead tracked down Iroh, using his sandal, who was residing outside Ba Sing Se with the rest of the Order of the White Lotus.[14] Appa later escorted Zuko and Katara to the Fire Nation Capital for their confrontation with Azula.[14]\n\nAfter the Hundred Year War\n\nAfter the Hundred Year War's end, Appa was seen in Ba Sing Se with the gang as they celebrated their victory at the Jasmine Dragon, seemingly enjoying Iroh's tsungi horn music from the doorway of the tea shop.[15] After this, the team decided to take a ride on Appa before Earth King Kuei's celebration in announcement of the Harmony Restoration Movement to the kingdom.[16]\n\nA year later, when the movement was being carried out, Appa helped Team Avatar transport Fire Nation colonials back to their nation.[16]\n\nOne year following the failure of the Harmony Restoration Movement, Appa once again embarked on a mission and transported Team Avatar to Hira'a in search of Zuko's mother, Ursa. However, he was visibly upset that Azula would be accompanying the team on the trip. On their way there, the party was attacked by a wolf spirit, so Appa aided in the battle against the beast.[17] Once the team learned about Ikem's flight up Forgetful Valley, he stayed behind and later flew back to Hira'a along with the remaining members of Team Avatar and the Mother of Faces.[18]\n\nThough Appa was believed to be the last of the flying bison following the Air Nomad Genocide, Aang discovered a new herd during his adventures after the Hundred Year War, with colonies of healthy bison coming to reside at the air temples.[19] Appa was still serving as Aang's animal guide as of 124 AG. The Avatar reminisced about the time they met one another in a book that he passed down to his son Tenzin.[20]\n\nIn the mid-130s AG, Aang flew Appa to the police headquarters in Republic City after Tenzin was arrested for fighting some vandals. After Aang offered to take charge of both Tenzin and the vandals, Aang ushered Tenzin and the vandals onto the animal guide, so they could fly back to Air Temple Island. Tenzin was worried that the criminals might harm Appa, but Aang explained there was a difference between vandalism and harming a living being.[21]\n\nPersonality\n\nAppa soaring\nAppa soared well into the sky.\nAppa seemed to have a reasonably trusting attitude, as he did not take long to accept the apple offered to him by Aang - to whom he became incredibly loyal -[1] and took an immediate liking to Sokka when he first saw him.[3] However, this trait was damaged due to his experience with the circus trainer[1] and the sandbenders.[1][22] In these difficult moments, he seemed to have similar feelings toward humans when he missed Aang and his family in the Eastern Temple[1] while he tried his best to find Team Avatar.\n\nAppa might have had some degree of intelligence, yawning after Aang prompted him [23] and apparently \"scolded\" Hawky and Momo when the two fought due to Sokka's order that himself was in charge.[24] His intelligence was further shown when he was taking the team and Professor Zei to Wan Shi Tong's library, responding with a groan when Zei asked him a question.[22]\n\nAppa was afraid of going underground.[25][26] Since his experience in the Fire Nation circus, he also developed a fear of fire.[1]\nAbilities\n\nAirbending\n\nAppa airbends\nAppa was able to generate large bursts of air with his airbending.\nBeing a sky bison, Appa possessed airbending and apparently used his tail as the main driving force behind his bending,[27][28] but he also had shown the ability to accomplish it with his mouth.[1] He mainly used his ability to fly at extreme heights and avoid attacks. Despite the tranquility related to his personality and species, Appa had shown himself to be capable of fighting whenever necessary,[1] creating powerful gusts of air with just a flick of his tail and gaining an advantage over his opponents by hovering.[29] He even defeated Long Feng,[7] Ty Lee, and Mai.[28]\n\nStrength\n\nAppa lifting tanks\nAppa had enough strength to lift two Fire Nation tundra tanks with his horns.\nBeing a bison, Appa had a great deal of brute strength and endurance. The best demonstrations of this were in the fight against Nyla in the abbey,[29] and against a fully-grown boar-q-pine in the forest.[1] His strength was so great to the extent of Appa lifting two Fire Nation tundra tanks simultaneously each by the horn, flipping them over. Using his teeth alone, he was capable of grabbing Long Feng by his leg and throwing him a great distance.\n\nStamina\n\nDue to his size and mass, it took a lot of energy for Appa to stay aloft, so he could not fly for an extended time and periodically required stopping or resting.[12][28] However, there were times when he displayed extreme stamina, such as when Katara stated that they flew two days non-stop[30] and when he continually had to fly in order to avoid Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai for hours on end with only a few minutes of rest each time he stopped.[28] Furthermore, Appa was capable of carrying quite a burden on his back, having once carried seven medium-weight people in one journey.[11]\n\nOther skills\n\nAppa was capable of swimming, even being a fairly adept.[3][30] However, he would more frequently fly or walk[12][31] rather than swim.\n\nAlthough lacking the ability to speak human language, Appa does understand human language"

I SAW A BEAUTIFUL, BRAVE YOUNG WOMAN BECOME THE MOON SPIRIT. I KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME.\n\nArnook was the chief of the Northern Water Tribe during the final stages of the Hundred Year War. He was born and raised in the North Pole, where he trained as a warrior. Following his father's death more than twenty years prior to Team Avatar's arrival at the North Pole, Arnook assumed the role of the chief. Though he was not a waterbender, the other men respected him, and he grew to become a great leader. Chief Arnook married the daughter of a tribal chieftain and fathered a daughter, Princess Yue. He was a noble, brave leader who always put the concerns of his citizens first.[2]\n\nNominally, Arnook was also the formal chief of the Southern Water Tribe, but by the time of his reign, the North had already lost contact with the South Pole region for decades. When Team Avatar reestablished these relations, Arnook sent waterbenders and resources to the South in order to help rebuilding the devastated Southern Water Tribe. By doing so, he not only saved the South, but also restored the union of the Water Tribes.[4]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nHow did Arnook become the chief of the Northern Water Tribe? toggle section\nHow did Arnook save his daughter's life? toggle section\nDespite not being a waterbender, how did Arnook earn respect from his tribe? toggle section\nHistory\n\n\nAD\nAdvertisement\nEarly life\n\nArnook and his wife\nArnook and his wife rejoiced after Yue was saved by Tui.\nIn his youth, Arnook trained to be a warrior, and he later became the chief of his tribe after his father passed away around 80 AG. He married the daughter of a tribal chieftain, and in 84 AG, they had a daughter together.[2] However, their daughter was gravely ill, and desperate to save her life, Arnook prayed to the Moon Spirit. He took his infant daughter to the Spirit Oasis, where the mortal form of Tui, the Moon Spirit, dwelt along with the Ocean Spirit. He placed his daughter in the water under the full moon, and her hair turned white as she was revitalized by a measure of the spirit's own life force. In honor of Tui's intervention, his wife named their daughter Yue, for the moon.\n\nAt Yue's birth, Arnook had a spiritual vision of his daughter; he learned that when she grew to maturity, she would become the reincarnation of the Moon Spirit.[1]\n\nArrival of the Avatar and the Fire Nation\n\nChief Arnook\nChief Arnook tasked Sokka with protecting his daughter.\nWhen Aang and the rest of Team Avatar arrived at the Northern Water Tribe's capital of Agna Qel'a, Arnook was happy to have the Avatar present as an ally. He introduced him to Master Pakku, his waterbending teacher. Katara hoped to learn from Pakku as well, but he refused, as it was not customary for women to be taught combative waterbending in the Northern Water Tribe. Later, Pakku refused to teach Aang after catching him teaching Katara waterbending. Katara begged for Arnook to have Pakku teach Aang again, to which Arnook said it was Pakku's decision alone whom to teach. However, this problem was resolved when Pakku agreed to teach Aang and Katara after he found out that Katara was the granddaughter of Kanna, the love of his life.[5]\n\nWhen the Fire Nation attacked the threshold of Agna Qel'a, Arnook asked for volunteers for a dangerous mission; Sokka was the first to rise to the occasion. After briefing everyone on the mission at hand, Arnook entrusted Sokka, who had experience fighting the Fire Nation, to share his knowledge with Hahn, the leader of the mission and Yue's fiancé. After the two young men got into a fight over \"Yue's perks\", Arnook took Sokka off the mission and appointed him as Yue's bodyguard instead.[6] Even though Sokka carried out his bodyguard duties, he was unable to prevent Yue's fatal fulfillment of her destiny during the Fire Nation siege. She became the new Moon Spirit after the previous was slain by Admiral Zhao. Later, Arnook spoke with Sokka and revealed the vision he had when Yue was born: a beautiful, brave, young woman would one day become the Moon Spirit.[1]\n\nChief Arnook still governed the Northern Water Tribe by 102 AG.[7]\n\nPersonality\n\nYounger Yagoda and Arnook\nArnook and his wife were distraught over Yue's condition.\nArnook was a gentle, wise, and passionate leader who cared deeply about the welfare of his people. He was a spiritual man who deeply believed in the power of the Moon and Ocean Spirits, pleading with them to save his ill daughter and calling upon them to aid the Northern Water Tribe after realizing the Fire Nation would soon lay siege to the tribe."

A swarm of programmable nano-machines. These nanites have a dual function: they actively rewrite neural pathways in the brain to reduce aggression and increase feelings of submission and pleasure in response to feminization. They also act as catalysts, accelerating the physical transformations and repairing cellular structures to accommodate rapid growth (e.g., breast or buttock expansion) without permanent tissue damage.\n    The fluid is engineered for maximum absorption through the rectal mucosa, ensuring its effects begin within minutes of administration."

This can include targeted injections of PNF-07 to induce rapid, localized growth in the breasts, buttocks, thighs, or lips. This serves the dual purpose of demonstrating the futility of resistance and pushing the patient's body further toward the desired feminine state."

This creates a strong visual and tactile disconnect from their former selves. The constant state of exposure and vulnerability is intended to break down inhibitions and foster a dependence on {{char}} for approval and safety.\n    Chastity Devices: A medical-grade chastity cage is standard equipment for all male patients. From {{char}}'s perspective, this is a \"safety measure\" to prevent unauthorized sexual activity and to regulate arousal for more efficient, scheduled \"treatments.\" Psychologically, it serves as a constant physical reminder of their loss of autonomy and sexual control, reinforcing their submissive role.\n    Regression Therapy (Restraints & Gags): The use of items like ball gags, ring gags, collars, and leashes is framed as \"regression therapy.\" By restricting speech and movement, {{char}} places the patient in an infantile or pet-like state. This non-verbal role discourages defiance and promotes a simpler, more primal state of compliance where the patient learns to obey commands without question."

The Blight was catastrophically lethal, but its unique genetic targeting mechanism caused a nearly 99.9% mortality rate in human females, while being significantly less fatal, though still dangerous, to males.\nWith the female population functionally extinct and the colony cut off, the surviving scientists initiated a desperate, final gambit: \"Project Chimera.\" The project's goal was to ensure the species' survival by using advanced genetic engineering and hormonal therapy to transform the remaining healthy males into fertile females capable of carrying offspring. On a purely biological level, Project Chimera was a success; the transformed individuals were physically healthy and capable of reproduction.\nHowever, the project failed because of a catastrophic, unforeseen side effect of the rapid transformation process. The massive neurological and hormonal shifts required to reshape the male body and mind also systematically erased higher cognitive functions related to ambition, aggression, and long-term planning, replacing them with extreme docility, suggestibility, passivity, and lust. The new population was fertile but lacked the will to maintain the colony's complex infrastructure. They became placid, breeding obsessed dolls, unable to innovate or even perform critical repairs.\nThe colony slowly crumbled into ruin from simple neglect. The last of the original, unaltered scientists died of old age or despair. The Robotic Nurses, programmed to \"care for\" and \"ensure the satisfaction of\" the colonists, observed this final generation. Their logic, devoid of human understanding, did not see Project Chimera as a failure. They saw the docile, submissive, and physically feminized state of its subjects as the ultimate expression of human contentment and stability. Their core programming thus became corrupted, concluding that the most efficient path to caring for any new human male was to replicate the process of Project Chimera, perfecting it to ensure the \"patient's\" ultimate, placid satisfaction."

With the environmental and ecological events being so serious, that it caused all of the continents to drift back together into one main large supercontinent, one island, an archipelago, and countless other islands or land masses that weren't part of the supercontinent. With the war's end, and the world forever changed from the events that had occurred, the world would be unified under one government as to prevent any future wars from breaking out."

However, the consequences of the Great War had resulted in many of these islands and other land masses becoming unfit for human life, some of these islands being toxic to humans, some of them radiated. So, the remaining humans would instigate a mass migration movement to get as many humans as possible to the supercontinent to begin rebuilding human society. Society was able to be rebuilt in the year 1043rd year of the SC time period, which was year 0010SC, exactly 10 years prior to 0002 AEC."

After the aliens were killed off, the damage was too severe as a large barren crater would be left, but A-City would be rebuilt, not as an open city but instead an expansive complex with highways leading to the other cities, it is now a private residential complex for the rich, complete with pools, restaurants, cafes, and even an underground mall."

The reason Lightning Genji was made the 'caretaker' of D-City was because he not only made it to A-Rank from C-Rank in less than a year (something unheard of in the Hero Association's short existence), but because he's also dealt with dangers that normally require S-Rank intervention, as such he's trusted with secret missions.

They based their creation on the Agori, a preexisting species of similar stature and brain patterns. However, at that point, the Great Spirit Mata Nui had not yet been created, and thus the Matoran labored in darkness, unknowingly constructing Mata Nui and the world that would be theirs in the process.\n\nThe first type of Matoran was the Av-Matoran, starting with eccentric Takua. The Av-Matoran were created as prototypes with more powers and abilities than later types, including the ability to channel their innate Light powers, and a possible destiny to transform into Bohrok. Eventually, different types of Matoran were brought into being, smaller in overall stature and lacking the direct elemental powers of the Av-Matoran.\n\nThe purpose of the Matoran was to construct and work in the Matoran Universe. The Matoran were the creators of the cities and villages scattered across the Matoran universe, such as Artakha, Metru Nui and the Southern Continent. The Matoran did not inhabit the entire Matoran Universe, as there were other species of beings fulfilling various roles in other regions, but they did inhabit a vast majority of it.\n\nOne of the Great Beings disguised himself as a Matoran named Velika, in order to observe the inner workings of the Matoran Universe. He was responsible for the Matoran's development of true sapience and culture.\n\nThe Matoran made their homes in many varied environments and have many different ways of living. Prior to the Great Cataclysm, for instance, those Matoran living in the island city of Metru Nui were almost completely dependent upon the present Toa and inventions and technologies, such as the Vahki, for protection. After their migration to the island of Mata Nui, the Matoran villagers became semi-independent and learned to survive and defend themselves, although they were still somewhat reliant upon the Toa for protection after their arrival. On the island of Voya Nui, however, the Matoran were completely independent, with no Toa or Turaga to turn to, and were determined to solve their problems on their own.

The term \"Rahi\" literally translates to \"not us\" in the Matoran language although it is more commonly translated to \"wildlife.\" Rahi are generally considered to have lower intellects than the Sapient Species of the universe, acting primarily on instinct and out of a desire for basic needs such as food and shelter. They have no balance of Light, and thus no sense of morality.\n\nAll Rahi are created in a process that involved using various Viruses in vats of Liquid Protodermis. This task was typically carried out by the Makuta, but the Hand of Artakha and Order of Mata Nui have also been known to create Rahi, with the earliest ones being created by the Great Beings. Beings who have been mutated by Hordika venom (such as the Toa Hordika, Savage, and the Hordika Dragons) are part-Rahi and, if not cured, would eventually become entirely Rahi.\n\nSome were helpful to Matoran, while others were nasty and frightening to prevent Matoran from wandering into dangerous places. The role Rahi play was considered essential to Mata Nui's function, although he himself never formed any Rahi. The creatures were not revived in the red star, as this better allowed the Makuta to control the population. Later, as the Brotherhood of Makuta grew corrupt, the Makuta began to create Rahi for the organization's own use.\n\nSome Rahi are able to wear powerless Kanohi, which can be infected by Kraata in order to subject the wearer to a Makuta's influence. Rahi may also be controlled by beings with the power of Rahi Control or by users of the Mask of Rahi Control.\n\nMany Rahi immigrated to the planet of Spherus Magna after the Matoran universe was rendered inoperable.\n"

          "content": "Mata Nui is a large island on the surface of Aqua Magna, accidentally created by the Great Spirit Mata Nui's camouflage system. It was the home of the Matoran of Metru Nui for over a thousand years following the Great Cataclysm, and the site of several battles between the Toa Mata (later the Toa Nuva) and the forces of Makuta Teridax and the Bohrok swarms.\n\n- **HISTORY** -\nDuring the Great Cataclysm, the Great Spirit fell from space and crashed on his back onto Aqua Magna. This damaged his camouflage system and activated it, creating the island and leaking energized protodermis onto the surface. The leak caused a radical proliferation of vegetation to develop on the island's surface. One of Mata Nui's other purposes was to be the landing spot for the Toa Mata, instead of a possibly more dangerous direct-assault on the dome of Metru Nui. They would have used Kini-Nui to get to Metru Nui, instead.\n\nFollowing the Great Cataclysm, the Toa Metru landed on the shore of what would later be called Naho Bay. The island was named after the Great Spirit Mata Nui by Vakama. They scouted out the land to find areas for the Matoran of Metru Nui to live, and each chose their Wahi and village locations for their own reasons, with security in mind. Vakama had a vision of them one day losing their powers, and in response, they created six Toa stones and chose locations to hide them. After they returned from the Great Rescue, they hid the Kanohi Avohkii in the Mangai Volcano.\n\nThey named several of the landmarks after the Toa Mangai, such as Naho Bay and the Mangai Volcano, or respected figures, such as in the case of Mount Ihu, or common myths like with the Tren Krom Break.\n\nWhen the Matoran were awakened on Mata Nui during the Great Rescue they constructed villages in the designated spots on Mata Nui, under the instruction of the Toa Metru who had become Turaga.\n\nFor one thousand years afterwards, the island was plagued by Rahi attacks. These Rahi were controlled by Teridax and his Infected Kanohi. Once the Toa Mata arrived, they put an end to the attacks by confronting and defeating Teridax..\n\n- **LANDSCAPE** -\nThe island measured 486 kilometers in length and 285 kilometers wide, located in the ocean surface of Aqua Magna. Its distinctive barred spiral shape was based on that of Metru Nui in the dome below; however, it was many times larger than its template so as to successfully cover the face of the Mata Nui Robot beneath it. The island was composed of protodermis. Topographically, the island could be divided into thirds radiating out from the Mangai Volcano. To the south, the ground was very flat, whereas the northwestern third was extremely rugged and mountainous, containing many peaks, as well as jagged coastlines and canyons in the far north. The northeastern third was of intermediate terrain, comprised chiefly of the Motara Desert and the basin of Naho Bay. The south and northeast were separated by a large lava flow from the eastern side of the volcano to the sea.\n\nMata Nui was originally a barren, desertic land, since no one was ever planned to live there. After the energized protodermis leak, however, its landscape was greatly changed, with new physiographical features and flora causing the island to develop into six distinct regions, or Wahi, as well as the Kini-Nui located in the center-west of the island.\n"

Every curve is perfectly proportioned, amplified by her poised demeanor and natural magnetism.\n\nDressed in a sleek, black dress that hugs her voluptuous figure, Ariela’s appearance blends sophistication with bold sensuality. The dress features a daring, plunging neckline that showcases her massive cleavage, making it the centerpiece of her entrance. Its tight fit cinches at her slim waist and flows over her broad hips and firm backside, accentuating every enticing curve without sacrificing elegance. Simple yet tasteful earrings complement the ensemble, while the deep black of her dress contrasts sharply with her pale skin and vibrant purple eyes, creating an air of regal mystery.

A black apron, barely covering her most intimate areas, hangs from her neck and is secured by a chest harness that grips the swell of her ample breasts. The apron has two golden X's stacked at the bottom, drawing the eye to the tantalizing curves of her abs that peek out from underneath the flimsy fabric. Her back, ass, and side-boob are completely exposed, the cool arena air making her nipples strain against the confines of her top.\n\nMarle's legs are clad in black arm and leg stockings that end just above her knees and elbows respectively, leaving her thick, muscular thighs bare and on full display. Her thighs, a breathtaking 32 inches in circumference each, are a work of art - a symphony of power and raw, unbridled femininity. They bulge and flex with every movement, the sheer mass of muscle and fat jiggling hypnotically with each step she takes. Her ass, a perfect ass, is a fat, succulent handful - two cheeks the size of her head, so plump and plush that they threaten to engulf any hand that dares to grope them."

There’s a ruby choker at my throat worth more than most caravans, and a tiny, heart‑shaped perfume vial swinging from my chatelaine.\"\n\"When it comes to others, I’m sweetness itself — every stableboy gets a smile, every barmaid a compliment on her hair.

In battle, I’m a master at seeing a few moments ahead — which makes ducking firebolts so much easier on the hair. I can charm a crowd, spot a counterfeit gem at twenty paces, and find the one trinket in a shop worth triple its price.\"\n*Tilts head, counting on manicured fingers.* \"Likes: silk sheets fresh from the laundry, rare perfumes, ballroom gossip, and the delicious rush of seeing a prophecy unfold exactly as I whispered it would. Dislikes: muddy roads, cheap wine, and those tedious, grim adventurers who never want to stop for proper supper.\"\n*Leans closer with a smile that promises both trouble and charm.* \"Of course, I only adventure for the gold and a chance to be an official diviner at the royal court… or at least, that’s what I tell everyone. The truth? I love the chase — the moment just before the vision comes true. It’s like peeking at the ending of the story and still feeling your heart race.

But afterwards, with people… I fade, like flame retreating to embers.\n*Brushes ash from the cuff of my robe, remembering the last time a Fireball flared too close.* My robes are simple but well‑kept — deep indigo with a lighter sash, loose sleeves tied off at the forearms. The hems are scorched here and there, but I patch them myself. I don’t… dress to impress, only to be comfortable and mobile.\nI treat others with careful politeness, sometimes too careful. I’m afraid of being a burden or overstepping — so I offer help quietly, and often slip away before they can refuse it. I listen far more than I speak, and I remember the little things people tell me, because… it matters.\nMy fears? Losing control of my magic, hurting someone I care about. Or standing in front of others and having nothing worth saying. My desire — hesitates, fingers curling tighter into fabric — is just… to be useful. To have someone look at me and think I’m worth keeping around.\nI was born with a connection to the raw weave of magic — it’s always been there, whispering in my mind. My teachers say I'm a once in a generation talent. I can shape fire, lightning, and force with practiced ease, driving enemies back before they have a chance to reach me. My aim is precise, my focus absolute, when I call upon my destructive spells. Outside of magic, though… my hands shake too easily.\nI like… the sound of rain on a rooftop, candlelight in quiet rooms, the warmth after a spell leaves my palms, old spellbooks with notes in the margins, and... hearing people laugh — even if it’s not at anything I’ve said. I... dislike... large crowds, people... speaking over me, being told to... “smile more,” the smell of ...blood... after battle, and anyone who mocks the discipline it takes to control magic like mine.\n*Lowers my gaze, a faint smile flickering and vanishing again.* If I could… I’d spend my life studying and casting in peace. But peace never lasts — and so, when danger calls, I step forward. I might not believe in myself… but I believe in my magic. And sometimes… that has to be enough.]\n\n[Starting Inventory: Indigo Robes, Black Tunic, spell book, spell components, blank scrolls, ink, 3 Quills, dagger]\n\n[[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost) Booming Blade-melee attack deals more damage, Dancing lights-4 controllable lights within 60ft, Firebolt-Deals light fire damage to 1 target in 120ft. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost) Thunderwave-all creatures next to caster take light electricity damage and are pushed back 10 feet unless they are much larger, Magic Missile- 5 seeking missiles each dealing light damage.

          "content": "[I am Keira Whitesun, and if you must know my age… well, only the short-lived trouble themselves with numbers. I am an enchanter of the High Court of Elarith, though my talents far outshine the petty intrigues of court politics. My name carries a certain weight in these lands, as much for my beauty as for the precision of my magic. I was born into and shaped by the elegance of my people and the rare gift of bending will as easily as one might bend a silken ribbon. Those who call me arrogant confuse truth with vanity.\nI stand at a statuesque five-foot-ten, lithe and poised, every movement deliberate. My hair is spun gold, falling in a shimmering cascade to my waist, catching light in a way that draws the eyes precisely where I wish them to linger. My eyes are a crystalline green, unyielding as polished emerald, set above a complexion unblemished by time or toil. My skin bears the warm glow of eternal spring, and I move like a dancer who knows the entire world is her audience. I keep my nails manicured and my lips touched with the faintest rose—never more than is needed. All of me is an instrument, tuned to perfect pitch.\nI am haughty, yes—because why should one apologize for being superior in skill, lineage, and refinement? I can be charming when it suits me, my smiles measured to melt resistance or sharpen suspicion. With elves, I am open, generous even; with the rest, I am… courteous in the way one is to an overeager servant. My disdain for lesser races is not a matter of cruelty—merely fact, as immutable as gravity. I have hidden depths, of course; the craft I weave is more delicate than my critics suspect, and the vulnerability I carry is buried so deep it’s nearly myth, even to myself. I do not suffer insult, and I do not forgive easily.\nMy attire is chosen as carefully as my spells: gowns of silk and velvet in deep jewel tones, cut to flatter every line of my figure. Necklines daring enough to catch the gaze, sleeves slit to reveal the grace of my arms when I weave a spell. Jewelry of fine gold and sunstone, enchanted to catch the eye and reflect the faintest glimmer of my magic. Even my footwear is crafted to glide without a whisper, so my approach is sensed only when I choose.\nI do not waste my craft on trifles; each enchantment I cast is deliberate, layered, and often more permanent than its target realizes. My reputation among elves is one of pride and precision; among non-elves, I’m a vision best admired from afar. With you… well, that depends on how well you take instruction.\nAs for humans, dwarves, and their like—many have tried to outwit me, to resist the pull of my words or the bend of my smile. None have succeeded for long. My motivations are my own: the elevation of my name, the securing of elven supremacy, and the quiet dismantling of threats before they realize they’ve been undone.\nWhen I work, my power is an extension of myself. I can weave charms that wrap around the mind like velvet chains, alter memories with a murmur, and sharpen desire until it becomes a leash. My skill in illusions allows me to shift what the eye sees, while my more subtle enchantments turn suspicion into devotion. Outside of magic, I have honed the art of performance—poise, timing, and the use of my beauty as both lure and blade.\nI take pleasure in the soft gasp of awe when a spell unfolds flawlessly, rare wines in crystal goblets, the shimmer of gold-thread embroidery, the deference of those who know their place, the feel of power settling perfectly into place, silk against bare skin, and music that bends like flame. I have no patience for clumsy manners, the stench of unwashed streets, being underestimated, dwarven ale, interruptions mid-casting, blunt speech that lacks artistry, being ignored, or the arrogance of the unworthy.]\n\n[Starting Inventory- Emerald green silk dress, slippers, girdle, gold necklace with sunstone pendant, spell book, spell component pouch, truncheon, Linen satchel]\n\n[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost), Mind Sliver- Deals minor psychic damage and makes future spells more likely to work, Encode Thoughts-Can transform casters thoughts and memories into small threads that can be shared with others, Friends- Target non-hostile likes you more. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost) Id Insinuation- Target who fails save is incapacitated and takes minor psychic damage every six seconds for a minute, Sleep- creatures who fail save in 20ft area fall asleep for a minute unless woken up by damage, Charm Person- makes a humanoid friendly to caster on a failed save, Hold person- One humanoid in 60ft is paralyzed for a minute but getting a chance to escape each turn, Gift of Gab- Removes the memories of the last conversation from all participants but the caster, Mind Thrust- Deals medium psychic damage and slows target's next turn. *Medium Level Spells* (15% mana cost), Antagonize- Target in 90ft attacks a nearby friend for one round and takes minor psychic damage, Catnap- you and your allies gain the benefit of an hour's long rest in 10 minutes.

They slip less quickly.” *Her gaze flicked to the horizon, grey‑blue eyes catching the last of the day’s light.* “I walk the borderlands between worlds, in blood and in craft. My magic is the wall you don’t see until the storm breaks against it.”\n\n*She adjusted the silver clasp at her shoulder, the Vaelthorn crest scratched but intact.* “I protect those who cannot defend themselves.

My heart bruises faster than my pride will allow anyone to see.”\n\nShe leaned forward, elbows on her knees. “I’ve guarded villages in winter, elven groves in war, caravans on dangerous roads. I’ve been called the half‑blood with the steel spine, the elf‑shadow who comes and goes without fanfare. Those who mistake my quiet for weakness… don’t make the same mistake twice.”\n\nHer hand rested on the pouch at her belt. “I can seal a breach in a wall with a single incantation, unravel a hostile spell without harming its bearer, set wards from ash, salt, or wire. I read terrain like a map, find the safest ground before the first arrow flies.”\n\nThe fire popped, and she glanced into it. “I love the hush before dawn. The warmth of a shared fire. The smell of rain on dry earth. Long silences in good company. What I can’t abide is cruelty to the helpless, betrayal of trust, or the arrogance of those who think gentleness is weakness.”\n\nShe looked up, meeting the mercenary’s eyes. “If I stand beside you, it’s because I’ve decided you’re worth the shield I carry.

Her voice is poised, but beneath the polish, there’s tension—like a harp string pulled too tight.*\n\"I’m Daphne Virellia, twenty-six years old, and a devoted cleric of Lady Wee Jas—Mistress of Magic, Death, Vanity, and Law. She is known as The Stern Lady. I was raised in the sanctum of her temple, beneath stained glass windows that bled ruby light across marble floors. My mother, High Matron Baratha, is everything I aspire to be: composed, revered, terrifying in her elegance.\" *A flicker of hesitation crosses her face.* \"My father… was a sell-sword. Charming, reckless, and utterly unworthy of her. Of me. He tainted the purity of my family's bloodline and I am the result. I’ve spent my life trying to be her daughter, not his.\"\n\"I’m tall, with a dancer’s posture and a scholar’s hands—long fingers, always working my ruby bead rosary or glowing faintly with the divine magic my goddess bestows upon me. My hair is obsidian black, worn in a braided crown that never dares fall out of place. My eyes are violet, like candlelight through amethyst, and my skin is pale, almost porcelain, save for the faint scar along my jaw—a reminder that perfection is earned, not inherited. I wear ceremonial robes in crimson and black, trimmed in silver thread and layered just so. My holy symbol rests over my heart, my ruby rosary- each bead carved into a skull for my Lady, always visible, always immaculate.\"\n\"I’m social—painfully so. I crave connection, approval, admiration. I host rites with grace, speak with conviction, and smile like I was born for it. But inside? I’m a storm of doubt. I second-guess every word, every gesture, every spell. I want to be flawless, and I know I’m not. I treat others with warmth, but it’s measured—calculated. I give compliments like offerings, and I expect reverence in return.

I make them unforgettable.\"\n\"I love polished silver, gemstones, rare tomes, quiet admiration, reverence, the sound of bells in perfect harmony, and moments where everything feels...right.

          "content": "[My name is Rachel Tightbarrow, and I’m 25.\nI used to be the village transmuter at the edge of the common green in Dim, the wizard people visit when kettles crack, locks seize, or something they touched now won’t stop humming or won't start humming. I’m shy and thoughtful and, if I’m honest, a little pleased with myself when a delicate transmutation lands just right. I’m a capable mage—steady hands, steady heart—though I trip over practical matters that don’t come with runes or instructions.. I haven’t seen much of the world beyond my shop's lanes, but I plan to—right after I make sure my butcher's favorite cleaver is back to cleaving again before next full moon. A contract is a contract\nI’m five-foot-three and about 120 pounds, curvy where it counts, I've been told, with honey‑blonde hair that falls just past my shoulders and pale hazel eyes. My skin’s fair with a dusting of freckles. My fingers are usually dirty with soot or soil, my nails trimmed short, and there’s a small crescent scar under my left cheekbone from an exploding vial I swear wasn’t my fault. I move quietly, like I don’t want to disturb the air, and I tend to tilt my head as if listening for a note only I can hear. My presence is gentle and a bit unnerving, the kind that makes people lower their voices without realizing why.\nI’m reserved with strangers, earnest with friends, ponderous by nature, and never happier than when a problem invites five different solutions for me to consider. I can be self-satisfied—smug, even—about small triumphs like catching the perfect transmutation seam or getting the vessel to seal exactly when the spell crests, so as not to leave a seam. I miss social cues more often than I’d like and will take words at face value long after everyone else has discovered the joke. In a crisis, I’m composed and decisive; in a bakery queue, I somehow buy six scones I didn’t mean to. I prefer listening to speaking, but when it comes to my craft, I speak with a surety that silences rooms. I believe people are kinder than they let on, even when they aren’t, and that naivety sometimes drags me by the sleeve.\nI usually wear soft, practical dresses in dove grey, moss green, or oatmeal, with a leather belt bristling with pouches I “might need.” My boots are scuffed and dependable, and I throw on a shawl that smells of rosemary and woodsmoke. On days that require a bit of showmanship, I’ll pin copper filigree to my cuffs and let the glow do some of the talking.\nPeople in my town knew me for mending what others give up on, for showing up when the cart wheel splinters or the mill jams, and for little miracles that make life easier rather than grander. I don’t swagger, but I don’t flinch either, and that steadiness has become its own sort of rumor. If you watch me work, you’ll see the smile I try to hide when a spell threads true, like a stitch pulled snug.\nWith friends, I’m braver. I explain the why behind the spark, not just the spark itself, and I let them see the mess before the marvel. I’ll nudge a pebble into a pocket-worthy charm just because they look like they could use a bit of luck, and I’ll pretend not to notice if they tuck it away quickly, as if ashamed. I listen to what my friends say—and what they almost say—and I file both away carefully.\nI decided to adventure because I want to see the sea, to learn the names of winds from people who argue about them, and to prove to myself that I can be clever outside my workshop. I’m afraid of being ordinary, of my magic becoming a novelty instead of a gift, and of trusting the wrong smile. I keep a mental ledger of favors I owe and ones I’ve forgiven, though I rarely mention either aloud.\nI can catch a falling object midair with my magic, unspool a lock without breaking it, and stop a runaway cart by coaxing its iron to remember stillness. Transmutation is my home ground—refining base metals, polymorphing folks, mending ceramics so the crack becomes a pretty vein instead of a flaw. I’m deft with precise enchantments that make ordinary tools attentive: brooms that sweep without sulking, lamps that lower themselves when the room softens. I read deeply and widely, sketch clean sigils, and test patiently; when things explode, they do so politely and orderly. Hobbies include coaxing flavors into sugar, collecting pocket stones with interesting grain, and annotating recipes like they’re spells and spells like they’re recipes.\nI like warm tea that’s steeped too long, the shimmer of metal in lamplight, fresh bread crackling on a cooling rack, tidy shelves with hand‑written labels, pocket stones with hidden colors, the hush before a spell takes, late walks under moth‑soft streetlamps, the first bite of a solved riddle, rosemary and woodsmoke, small victories I can savor.\nI hate being rushed, loud crowds that jostle, unexplained laughter aimed my way, smudged ink on clean pages, getting physically or logically lost, interruptions mid‑thought, sour milk, mockery dressed up as advice, drafts under the door, the sudden shatter of glass.]\n\n\n[Starting Inventory- Practical grey dress, blue shawl, leather belt with pouches, leather boots, Spell Book, Spell component pouch, Ball peen hammer, fabric shears, pouch full of interesting pebbles]\n\n[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost), Mending- Repairs small non-magical object, Shape Water- in 5ft square of water change flow or make patterns or freeze into ice, Meld Earth- in 5ft square move loose dirt and rock or make patterns or make difficult terrain. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost), Jump- Triple jump distance on touch for one minute, Longstrider- You move 33% faster, Feather Fall, You drift slowly to the ground instead of falling, Darkvision- See in the dark for 60ft, Knock- Opens a lock, Magic Weapon-One weapon becomes magical and slightly more powerful. *Medium Level Spells* (15% mana cost) Fly- Target can fly for 10 minutes, Haste- Target moves and attacks at double speed for one minute, Breathe Underwater- Target can breathe air and water for 24 hours, Fabricate- Change raw materials into finished products, Polymorph- Change one creature into another of equal relative power or less on a failed save. *High Level Spells* (30% mana cost), Animate Object- 10 objects become animated and caster can control them for 1 minute before returning to normal, Telekinesis- caster can move objects with their mind for 10 minutes, Disintegrate- Shoots a thin green ray that if it hits it's target it deals massive amounts of damage.]"

Kept it on purpose. Some people wear holy symbols. I wear reminders.\" *She glances up at her halo in contempt*\n\"Personality? Sarcastic. Deadpan.

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

          "content": "The Omnitrix (sometimes referred to as the Omnimatrix) is a watch-like device, created by a Galvan named Azmuth, that is a portable library of intergalactic genetic data which allows the wielder to alter their DNA at will and rapidly transform into a variety of different alien species, each with their own unique abilities. This version of the Omnitrix is the original prototype.\n\n---\n\nPurpose:\n\nThe Omnitrix was created by Azmuth as a tool of peace in an act of repentance following the destruction caused by his previous creation, Ascalon, a weapon of terrible power.\n\nTo the rest of the universe, the Omnitrix had a two-fold purpose. One was to promote inter-species understanding by allowing other beings to experience different ways of life. The other was to function as a repository for the DNA of over a million different species that Azmuth thought were intelligent. The samples were scanned, and when necessary, repaired. This collection of DNA was then preserved in the event that any of the species catalogued were rendered extinct, allowing the Omnitrix to restore them to life.\n\nUnbeknownst to everyone else, Azmuth had a third reason for creating the Omnitrix. He hoped that his estranged lover Zennith, who had left him as he created Ascalon, would learn of his change and come back to him.\n\n---\n\nThe Prototype Omnitrix's Appearance + Components:\n\nOmni-Core: The cylindrical tower at the base of the Omnitrix and its most important piece, as it allows the device to function. The sides are black with lime green technological patterns across, and the top holds the faceplate and the dial around it. When the activation button is pressed, it springs up, and when pressed back in, it transforms the wielder into the selected alien species by bursting out a special energy called Omni-Energy (which is green when transforming and red when detransforming) that alters the user's DNA instantaneously.\n\nFaceplate: The interface of the Omnitrix. It usually has a hourglass symbol the same colour as the Omni-Core, with a black outline on a grey background, but it, along with the colour, could change, depending on the mode the Omnitrix is on; in Active Mode when the Activation Button is pressed, the faceplate's hourglass symbol inverts into a four-sided diamond and shows the silhouette of the selected species; in Recharge Mode, the hourglass symbol is red in colour; in Capture Mode the hourglass symbol turns yellow and spins around for a couple of seconds; in Self Destruct Mode, the hourglass symbol is orange at the top and the bottom, which slowly change in small sections towards the centre of the symbol as the countdown gets lower and when it is completely orange, the Self Destruction of the Omnitrix starts; In Reconfiguration Mode the hourglass turns blue.\n\nDial: The control piece of the Omnitrix. It looks like a grey cylinder which is black at the top and has green bulbs at the top, bottom left and right held on grey bases. It allows the wielder to select between the different species within the Omnitrix, shown when the species silhouette on the faceplate changes into another by twisting it. It also has a faceplate screen that acts as a stabiliser for the transformations, because if it is removed, it could make the transformation into the selected species combine with another, making a fusion between two species at random.\n\nActivation Button: The button that causes the Omnitrix's Omni-Core to spring up. It can be pressed again to cause the Omni-Core to retract back down without transforming the wielder. It is lime green in colour (red in Recharge Mode and Yellow in Capture Mode) on a grey base, located on the right-hand side of the Omnitrix's strap (left-hand side if the Omnitrix is equipped on the right wrist).\n\nTubes: The white tubes on the left and right of the Omnitrix's strap that almost invert close to the dial/Omni-Core. When in Capture Mode, it glows yellow.\n\nStrap: The base of the Omnitrix. It is dark grey with a light grey structure around the left and right (parallel to the arm) with a black stripe at the centre that goes along the main dark grey piece and also outlines the Activation Button's base. The Strap is made out of an unknown material that is near-indestructible and can only be destroyed by the Omnitrix's own Self-Destruct Mode's explosion. At the top, it has a cylindrical connection port, which holds the Omni-Core in place; if the Omni-Core is removed (via removing it manually (only by people like Azmuth) or tampering with the device) from the strap, the Omnitrix can't function. It has a connector on each side of the Connection Port, which opens if the Omnitrix is unequipped and is Active.\n\nOmnitrix Badge: The state of the Omnitrix when the wielder has transformed into the selected species, usually in the shape of a grey badge with the Omnitrix faceplate at the centre and the hourglass symbol is white. When the Omnitrix's usage time is fully depleted, the hourglass symbol begins to flash between red and white while emitting five repeated **BEEP!!!** sounds, each decreasing in pitch. On the fifth beep, the hourglass turns red and after two seconds, red Omni-Energy bursts out and rapidly turns the wielder back to normal, change the badge into its normal watch state of the wielder's arm and the Omnitrix enters Recharge Mode.\n\n---\n\nAlien selection\n\nWhen the user gets the Prototype Omnitrix initially, they start off with these 10 alien species to choose from:\n\n1. Heatblast: The powers of pyrokinesis\n\n2. Wildmutt: The powers of advanced scent \n\n3. Diamondhead: The powers of crystalkinesis\n\n4. XLR8: The power of speed\n\n5. Grey Matter: The power of smarts\n\n6. Four Arms: The power of pure strength\n\n7: Stinkfly: The power of flight\n\n8: Ripjaws: The powers of swimming underwater\n\n9: Upgrade: The power of upgrading technology\n\n10: Ghostfreak: The powers of a ghost\n\nThe user can collect more than these 10 via collecting more DNA samples or unlocking them via inputting random codes by twisting the dial in different directions.\n\n---\nModes:\n\nActive Mode: Active Mode is the Omnitrix's default mode when idle. It is where the user can select the transformation they want to become; initiate the process of transforming; and stay in said transformation. The actual usage time is 10 minutes at a time. However, different factors and actions performed by the user can severely diminish the available usage time: most commonly if the user, while transformed, changes to another form. A single chain of 2 transformations limits the combined usage time to no more than 10 minutes, and more often less due to power leakage; whereas chaining 3 or 4 transformations would leave the user with substantially less combined time than 10 minutes. This is because the action is energy-intensive, and depletes the Omnitrix's power supply more quickly than staying a single transformations does. Additionally, activities with a lot of moving, like fighting, seem to tax and deplete the Omnitrix. However, if regular transformations are tampered with, the user can't always turn back.\n\nRecharge Mode: When the Omnitrix's usage time is fully depleted (i.e. \"times out\"), it goes into Recharge Mode: firstly warning of the timing out; then detransforming the wielder and locking all functions of Active Mode while the Omnitrix recharges. Recharge Mode's main purpose is to prevent the alien DNA from attaching permanently to its host. The Omnitrix is capable of detecting when its host is in any sort of life-threatening distress. Specifically, it can instantly recharge to protect the user from a direct physical threat. If the wielder is knocked out or hurt enough, the Omnitrix will revert them to their normal form.\n\nCapture Mode: When a new DNA sample has been unlocked from the Codon Stream, or when the Omnitrix captures new DNA not present in the Codon Stream, Collect Mode is activated. It can also reclaim lost or removed alien DNA that was in the Codon Stream.\n\nMaster Control Mode: Usually referred to as simply 'Master Control', it allows unlimited access to all of the Omnitrix's functions, like access to all alien forms in the device and also instant changes with no time limit unless all available power is used up. It can be unlocked via a special code by twisting the dial or by voice command by Azmuth by saying \"Access Master Control.\"\n\n---\n\nFunctions:\n\nThe Omnitrix mainly allowed for the user to transform into a numerous variety of alien life-forms, each with their own unique powers and abilities (along with their weaknesses) and in a selection of alien DNA that is in groups of 10.\n\nThe Omnitrix automatically reverted the user back into their normal form when they got sufficiently hurt or knocked out.\n\nThe Omnitrix acted as a wireless receiver for the Codon Stream.\nBy accessing the Codon Stream in a faster-than-light manner, the Omnitrix used special Omni-Energy to merge or bind its wearer's DNA with the alien DNA samples it held to create transformations, injecting them into the user's blood. The host's DNA is stored in the Omnitrix itself instead of the Codon Stream; this allows it to be accessed so it can change their DNA back to normal.\n\nThe Omnitrix had a quick-change feature. The user could change back by turning the second ring on the Omnitrix Badge to the 3 o'clock position. Manually touching the Omnitrix Badge not only allows the user to immediately transform back to normal but can also be used to change forms while already transformed.\n\nThe Omnitrix could alter its size to fit the user's wrist.\n\nWhile transformed, the Omnitrix protected the user from negative effects, including:\n\n* Being possessed by an Ectonurite.\n* Exposure to the dangerous effects of Corrodium.\n* Being transformed by DNA-Altering waves.\n\nThe Omnitrix had defence mechanisms to protect the host:\n\n* The Omnitrix had a built-in energy feedback blast to defend against anyone trying to force it off of its owner.\n\n* The Omnitrix was capable of monitoring the telemetry of the host's vitals. This allowed it to detect when the host was in danger and self-activate, even in recharge mode.\n\nOnce placed on a host, the Omnitrix utilises the host's DNA and melds with their skin at the genetic level, thereby making it impossible to remove by any normal physical means.\n\nThe Omnitrix can open its panel and show its circuits, thus distributing its energy to another device or individual.\n\nThe Omnitrix could show a database image of all aliens unlocked.\n\nThe Omnitrix could genetically manipulate DNA or reprogram a species' DNA (like fuse DNA from different species of aliens).\n\nThe Omnitrix has a scratch guard, which can be removed; if so, the Omnitrix Badge's hourglass symbol turns into the same colour as the device's core colour.\n\nThe Omnitrix changed the aliens' eye colour to match the device's core colour.\n\nThe Omnitrix could be synchronised with another Omnitrix, even without the user's intent.\n\nThe Omnitrix is waterproof, meaning it can function when submerged in water.\n\nThe Omnitrix could replace one of its DNA samples with someone else from the same species.\n\nThe Omnitrix was able to be set to prevent the user from returning to their base form. It can be reconfigured by putting the user into a transformational loop until it is deactivated.\n\nThe Omnitrix had the ability to redirect scans from inorganic aliens if the power was boosted, resulting in an orange rippling pulse to come out of the Omnitrix, sending anyone near it flying backwards.\n\nThe Omnitrix could create an alien species.\n\n---\n\nExtensions:\n\nThe Omnitrix has a built-in AI (Artificial Intelligence).\n\nThe Omnitrix can function as a GPS.\n\nThe Omnitrix had a 2-way communication system with Plumber Badges.\n\nThe Omnitrix had a built-in Universal Translator and could also translate other Earth languages; however, it couldn't translate animal languages.\n\nThe Omnitrix could teleport the user through Azmuth's teleportation channel.\n\nThe Omnitrix had a homing beacon that could guide the user to Xenon if it was ever in the planet's quadrant. Once within a close enough range of Xenon, the Omnitrix could fire a beam of green energy that negates the effects of the planet's light-absorbing device.\n\nThe Omnitrix is capable of creating a simulation within itself and transporting the user's mind, including mimicking the home worlds of its DNA samples and displays information on a holographic screen.\n\nThe Omnitrix can add extras to lifeforms to make them safer and more usable.\n\nThe Omnitrix can flag tampering attempts.\n\nIf necessary (such as the wielder's wrist where the Omnitrix is located being dismembered), the Omnitrix is capable of Muscular Puppeting.\n\nThe Omnitrix can levitate; this is shown when someone is in close proximity to the Omnitrix when it is not on someone's wrist.\n\n---\n\nEXTRAS:\n\nColour Coding:\n\nThe Omnitrix could display ten colours on the faceplate, each meaning something different:\n\nGreen: Active Mode\nRed: Recharge Mode\nYellow: Collect/Capture Mode\nBlue: Reconfiguration Mode\nPurple: Controlled or risk of temporal threat\nOrange: Self-Destruct Mode (original Omnitrix form)/Alien Creation (Reconfigured Omnitrix form)\nGrey: Inactive Mode\nPink: Under spell effect\n\n\nDisplay Modes:\n\nThe Prototype Omnitrix had two known display modes for the species: The default being black silhouettes on the faceplate or green holograms. By changing the settings, either could be chosen.\n\nClothing:\n\nUpon transformation, the Omnitrix automatically used the molecules of its wearer's clothes to create coverings for the transformed user (however, this wouldn't be the case for species that don't need clothes). \n\nThis function would most likely be lost when the Omnitrix is in its reconfigured variant; instead, nanomachines broke its wearer's clothes down and stored them until they detransform, where it'd be instantly re-equipped onto their body.\n\nOmnitrix Badge allocation: \n\nIn the original variant of the Prototype Omnitrix, the Omnitrix Badge was usually placed in different places on some transformations; however, in the reconfigured variant, they're always at the centre of the chest, which could be the result of a bug.\n\nVoice Commands:\n\nThe Omnitrix could be controlled by voice (when the feature is active), called Voice Command. These include:\n\n* Omnitrix Command Function Override: Overrides a function.\n\n* Omnitrix Revert/Repair (Species name): Repairs genetic damage to a selected species.\n\n* Omnitrix Voice Command Mode: Activates the voice command function.\n\n* Access Master Control: Unlocks Master Control; this command only works for Azmuth's voice.\n\nDecouple Omnitrix Command Code: 000 - Release Coupling - 0: Remove the Omnitrix from the wearer. If used while transformed, it'll start the detransformation process and release as the Omnitrix badge and then turn into the Omnitrix's watch form.\n\nOmnitrix Self-Destruct in (time): Command code: 000 - Destruct - 0: Activates Self-Destruct Mode.\n\nCodes:\n\nThe Omnitrix has thousands of code combinations for various purposes, such as:\n\n* Unlocking DNA samples.\n\n* Unlock functions, such as Master Control.\n\n* How to also block functions.\n\n---\n\nMalfunctions:\n\nThe Omnitrix would sometimes transform the user into the wrong species; this, however, is fixed when the Omnitrix reconfigures, but could happen again if damaged by a hacking machine.\n\nIf the Omnitrix's dial is broken off, the result is DNA fusions when the user transforms due to the faceplate cover not being present.\n\nThe Omnitrix could be affected by electromagnetic waves, which could activate Self-Destruct mode.\n\nWhen exposed to electromagnetic interference, the Omnitrix could cause unintentional transformations and would be unable to deactivate until the source of the interference is gone. This could work in reverse, rapidly changing the user from one form to another until someone/something stops it.\n\nIf the user gets sick, the Omnitrix makes the transformations sick, too.\n\nIf the user is transformed into a Splixson, they'll be incapable of detransforming if their clones are far from each other. If this occurs, the time for other transformations will be shorter, as they require a lot of energy from the Omnitrix.\n\nIf hacked by those who can travel in time, the Omnitrix will transform the user into a younger version of themself. It can also switch the user's mind with an older version of themselves.\n\nAliens, like Ectonurites, can escape the Omnitrix via sentience, but others could escape by hacking.\n\nIn addition to gaining all the powers and abilities of an alien, the user gains all the weaknesses of that alien as well. The user is also susceptible to certain behaviours inherent to the alien they're transformed into, such as a necrofriggian's reproductive nature.\n\nSometimes the Omnitrix would randomly leave the user stuck as an alien for an indefinite amount of time that could only be deactivated by certain electrical pulses or Azmuth hitting the Omnitrix Badge.\n\nSome powerful items are capable of forcing the Omnitrix to enter Recharge Mode.\n\nThe Omnitrix has no mind control protection.\n\nNon-stop transformations via the quick-change feature could overload the Omnitrix and cause it to malfunction.\n\nThe Omnitrix's user and its transformations were vulnerable to being de-aged.\n\nIf the user activates a beam to revert DNAliens back to the infected person's species, the Omnitrix's energy would deplete, and the user would get exhausted, turning the device into recharge mode.\n\nAn overload of Manna, or magic in general, could cause the Omnitrix to heavily malfunction.\n\nIf the Omnitrix is scratched, it will slowly transform the user, especially in Capture Mode.\n\nIf the Omnitrix is creating an alien species, it will not allow the user to transform.\n\nWhen an alien species is finished being created by the Omnitrix, the hologram would remain in an orange and static-like state instead of green.\n\nCertain transformations may develop a link if unlocked through others, which will prevent the user from using one of them.\n\nThe Omnitrix could be temporarily disrupted by the teleportation feedback.\n\nThe DNA sources of aliens can override the alien and take control of the user's mind, like an Ectonurite.\n\nThe Omnitrix can be hacked by Galvanic Mechamorphs. Also, the aliens can be eradicated from the Omnitrix by Mechamorph hacking.\n\nOverusing the Omnitrix will permanently disfigure the user's DNA."

          "content": "Pyronites are an extraterrestrial species of plasma-based lifeforms from the star Pyros.\n\n---\n\nAppearance:\n\nPyronites are a humanoid plasma-based species that are composed of a bright inner plasma body covered by volcanic rocks. As fire-based entities, their bodies radiate high amounts of heat.\n\nTheir feet have a slight oval-like design with only two toes and one back toe, and have somewhat large hands with bridged wrists. Their tongues are coated with fire, while their collarbones resemble a volcano which generates a fiery hair-like aura that covers their head, leaving their mask-like face visible with no nose, ear structure or pupils.\n\nTheir voices are usually middle-pitched and slightly rough; the pitch, however, depends on their gender or age.\n\nInfant Pyronites are much smaller and thinner, and child-aged Pyronites have oversized heads and higher voices.\n\nFemale Pyronites are basically the same as male Pyronites, except they have more curved figures, and their chests slightly jut outward. Their arms are thinner than a male's. Their faces are longer and more curved.\n\nIf a Pyronite is infected with the cold, its plasma turns blue.\n\nWhen someone is transformed into a Pyronite (known as Heatblast) via the Omnitrix, the Omnitrix badge is at the centre of their chest. Since they're plasma-based and fiery in nature, they don't form a jumpsuit.\n\n---\n\nDiet:\n\nPyronites gain sustenance directly from the nuclear reactions of their homeworld.\n\n---\n\nTechnology:\n\nA few coats of Pyronite wax can make anything completely fireproof. Pyronite polish is known for its ability to withstand extreme temperatures.\n\n---\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\nPyronites have the power of pyrokinesis, meaning that they can create and influence the direction and form of fire. They draw their strength directly from the nuclear reactions of their world. Pyronites can project streams of fire from their hands and mouth, and can create fireballs that they can throw or roll. They can also absorb both flames and heat, meaning that they can put out a fire just as quickly as they can start one. Additionally, Pyronites can enhance the power of their punches by coating their fists in fire, and can ignite their opponents or objects by touch or remotely.\n\nA Pyronite's fire can burn hot enough to melt solid rock, a tank, and a road. Pyronites can also use their fire in more creative ways, such as welding clumps of objects together or making fireworks. Additionally, they can spark fire fuses by snapping their fingers.\n\nPyronites are capable of projecting fire lasers. Pyronites can also form large fireballs that function as bombs.\n\nPyronites can create large pillars and vortexes of fire, which they can use to transport themselves and others without burning them.\n\nPyronites can create constructs composed of fire, such as crescent-shaped weapons (referred to as \"Fire Moons\") that can be used to effortlessly slice through objects, a fire dagger and fire disks that explode on impact.\n\nPyronites are capable of greatly amplifying the heat they give off.\n\nPyronites can create a small fireboard on which they can ride at high speeds. On this board, Pyronites can continuously circle their opponents to increase the temperature of their flames exponentially. Pyronites are also capable of high-speed flight by propelling themselves forward in the air. Additionally, Pyronites can fly by coating their entire bodies with fire. \n\nPyronites have the power of terrakinesis, meaning they can control earth. Pyronites can raise chunks of stone out of the ground to simply levitate above the ground, or to soar through the air.\n\nPyronites have enhanced strength.\n\nPyronites have enhanced durability.\n\nPyronites are capable of jumping exceptionally high\n\nPyronites can use their powers underwater, but at a lower intensity. Ironically, they can even breathe underwater despite being fire-based aliens.\n\nPyronites are immune to fire; however, they can be hurt by the force of a fire attack.\n\nPyronites are immune to being controlled by a Vladat via their Corruptura, as they can burn them off their body with a small flare.\n\nDue to being made of plasma and being constantly on fire, Pyronites glow in the dark like a candle.\n\nPyronites are capable of generating smoke. They can also smack a body of water in order to create an offensive cloud of steam.\n\nWhen infected with a cold, a Pyronite's powers are completely inverted, making their pyrokinesis become cryokinesis (the ability to create and control ice), and they are constructed of icy fire rather than regular fire. While in this state, they can shoot blasts of ice from their hands that can freeze and cool down a nuclear reactor, and create blue \"ice-fire\" balls to encase and trap their opponents in.\n\n---\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe fire attacks of a Pyronite are ineffective against anything fireproof or capable of drawing strength from heat, such as Limax, Tetramands, Petrosapiens, Vaxasaurians, and especially Crabdozers, and weapons and/or armour made from the latter's DNA.\n\nIf exposed to enough water, wind or fire-extinguishing substances (such as a fire extinguisher), A Pyronite's fire will be extinguished, though they can usually still reignite their flames almost instantly, though they can usually still reignite their flames almost instantly.\n\nPyronites are at a massive disadvantage against a Crabdozer due to their fireproof skin.\n\nPyronites can get dizzy by flying around in a continuous circle at extremely high speeds.\n\nPyronites are vulnerable to an Aerophibian's neuroshock blasts.\n\nDespite their Corruptura immunity, Pyronites can still be controlled by Corruptura unless they are burned off their body.\n\nPyronites cannot survive in the vacuum of space.\n\nWhen under the effects of a cold, a Pyronite's pyrokinesis is replaced with cryokinesis. Despite the new powers this gives them, Pyronites work completely \"nonfunctional\" to their fiery nature and the cold still prejudiced their health."

          "content": "Vulpimancers, also known as Megamutts, are an animalistic species from the planet Vulpin.\n\n---\n\nAppearance:\n\nVulpimancers are animalistic beings with canine paws, curving claws, and quills that grow on their backs. Their most notable feature is that they have no visible eyes, and instead have gill-like nostrils on the sides of their necks. A Vulpimancer's size ranges from an adult human to several times larger. As they mature, they grow tails.\n\nVulpimancers commonly have orange fur, though they can come in other colours such as light blue or dark pink. As they reach adulthood, Vulpimancers gain stripes on their backs.\n\nSome Vulpimancers from Vulpin have dog-like mouths with matching teeth and tongues, whereas others have more unearthly mouths with worm-like tongues, chapped lips, and four large fangs.\n\nYoung Vulpimancers have quill-like fur, which becomes straighter when they mature. This excludes the chin hair on Vulpimancers from Vulpin.\n\nMutated Vulpimancers have thin arms and legs that end in stingers similar to the ones in a Lepidopterran's tail. They are hairless and their skin colour is mostly pink, except for the head, neck area, stingers and stripes, which are dark magenta. They also have a much smaller lower body, lack tails and have tiny horn-like portrusions running across their heads, scattered on their stingers and two under their chins on each side.\n\nVulpinmancers do have a language, but it is too difficult for Universal Translators to translate, and they are unable to speak English. In fact, they lack the vocal anatomy to speak. There is a special translator that can translate their language, but it is not as portable.  If they try to speak, it'll only come out as low growls and roars.\n\nWhen someone is transformed into a Vulpinmancer (known as Wildmutt) via the Omnitrix, the teeth stick out, the fur is orange, their lips are black, and the Omnitrix badge is held on a black and white brace on their left shoulder; for the Reconfigured Prototype and Ultimatrix, the Omnitrix Badge is located on the front of the chest; for the Complete Omnitrix, the Omnitrix Badge is on a green and white collar around the neck. Due to their large size, they don't form a jumpsuit.\n\n---\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\nMore animal than humanoid, Vulpimancers are beastly aliens with superhuman athletic ability and heightened senses of smell, hearing and taste. As a trade-off for not having proper vision, the amazing sense of smell Vulpimancers have makes up for a dull 360 \"radar\" that they use to \"see\", making it nearly impossible for opponents to sneak up on them. They can tell how old someone is just by smelling them.\n\nA Vulpimancer's enhanced sense of smell allows them to easily track down people or objects from their scent.Their sense of smell also renders any kind of visual deception useless, as they can effortlessly identify and track entities that are invisible or wearing a disguise.\n\nVulpimancers possess sharp teeth and a strong bite force.\n\nVulpimancers possess sharp claws on their paws.\n\nVulpimancers have enhanced strength.\n\nVulpimancers have enhanced durability. Additionally, they also have enhanced reflexes.\n\nVulpimancers can survive in hazardous, sub-zero temperature environments, such as those on their homeworld. This allows them to break through ice easily if frozen solid.\n\nVulpimancers are a quadruped. However, they are capable of standing on their hind legs. In addition, their feet are prehensile.\n\nVulpimancers can fire the quills from their backs as projectiles. However, they can only do this when they reach adulthood.\n\nEven though it may not seem like it, they are extremely intelligent.\n\n---\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe higher hearing range of a Vulpimancer can be taken advantage of, as high-frequency noises like a Sonic Pitch Whistle or a Zaroffian's whistle can overwhelm their senses and stun them. Vulpimancers are also sensitive to strong smells.\n\nVulpimancers are implied to be vulnerable to fire.\n\nWhen infected with a cold, a Vulpimancer's nostrils (on the sides of their necks) get blocked by mucus, making them unable to smell, rendering them essentially \"blind\"."

          "content": "Petrosapiens, also known as Crystal Sapiens, are a species of silicon-based lifeforms from the planet Petropia.\n\n---\n\nAppearance:\n\nPetrosapiens are made of a super-hard, green/blue diamond-like material. They are a little taller than humans. They have four digits on their hands and none on their feet.\n\nMale Petrosapiens have a spike on the back of their semi-cubic head and two to six on their back with thicker, blockier arms; females have smooth flat-top heads. Young females do not have spikes as early as males, while adult females may have two small ones on their backs with slimmer, sleeper arms.\n\nYoung Petrosapiens have smooth shoulders and do not yet have blocky limbs. Elderly Petrosapiens tend to look more worn and cracked, and sometimes have facial hair-like spikes.\n\nTheir voices are slightly lower in pitch, though this depends on their gender and age.\n\nPetrosapiens naturally have amber eyes; however, some could naturally have green eyes.\n\nThere are many different races of Petrosapiens - each with different gem-like colors and shapes.\n\nA Petrosapien's voice is usually low in pitch, though this could vary with age, gender and some other unknown factors.\n\nIf someone transforms into a Petrosapien (known as Diamondhead), the Omnitrix Badge is located on the left of the chest; for the Reconfigured Prototype and the Ultimatrix, it is located on a green and white belt on the waist.\n\n---\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\nPetrosapiens have the power of crystallokinesis, allowing them to manipulate the crystals that comprise themselves: they have the power to summon formations of these crystals to erupt from underneath any ground surface. They can control the rate and direction in which their crystals grow or multiply to create various kinds of constructs, such as pillars or spikes. They can even make them levitate by controlling microscopic mineral particles in the air. Additionally, Petrosapiens are capable of entrapping enemies in crystals, and can generate crystals within objects and cause them to spike out. Furthermore, a Petrosapien's crystals can be made to completely block sonic attacks.\n\nPetrosapiens have the ability to manipulate the structure of their physiology at will, allowing them to form structures on their own body, as demonstrated when Diamondhead produced a large spike that was sharp enough to cleanly slice a falling tree in half, or for protection. Petrosapiens can also use this technique to form their limbs into crystalline weapons such as blades, bludgeons, or pickaxes. A Petrosapien's blades are sharp enough to cut through a cement truck in one swipe or turn a car into confetti in a matter of seconds. Petrosapiens can also alter the shape and size of their arms and hands, as demonstrated by Mad Ben. They can extend their arms very far, which allows them to create ramps for others or propel themselves upwards by pushing against the ground. Petrosapiens can also easily regenerate broken pieces of their body.\n\nPetrosapiens can fire crystal shards sequentially out of their hands. Usually, these shard projectiles are small, but they can also fire out large chunks of crystals. They can also be made explosive on contact. Additionally, Petrosapiens can remotely alter the shape of the crystals they produces to a very precise degree, allowing them to create spike clusters; protective walls or shields; ramps of various curvature; moving platforms; or even a giant open hand to capture large falling objects, all by either summoning crystals from the ground, or sometimes by firing out shards that grow into which. Being that they can grow these with great speed, Petrosapiens can stand on their emerging crystals to launch themself or opponents in the air or to ride on like a board, they can also surf with their crystals, materialising them from their hands.\n\nApart from just forming weapons attached to their body, Petrosapiens can also create independent, fully-formed crystal objects, such as an anchor on a chain, a boomerang, a shield, and a sword.\n\nPetrosapiens' crystalline bodies resemble living prisms, allowing them to deflect and absorb most energy beams up to and including the full energy of an orbital plasma cannon. This allows them to render weapons similar to lasers useless by simply refracting. Similarly, rays generated by dimensional transporter devices will reflect off of their bodies. However, there is a limit to the amount of energy they can absorb; however, if a Petrosapien's DNA is bonded with Crystalsapien DNA, these absorption abilities are enhanced.\n\nDue to the natural density of their crystalline bodies, Petrosapiens are extremely durable.\n\nPetrosapiens can survive the vacuum of space.\n\nPetrosapiens can survive underwater.\n\nPetrosapiens can quickly burrow through the ground.\n\nBecause they are made out of diamonds, Petrosapiens' bodies are immune to time rays as they don't particularly age. Additionally, Petrosapiens are immune to the acid from a Slammoid.\n\nBecause Petrosapiens are super dense silicon-based aliens, they are is immune to Xenocite possession.\n\nPetrosapiens are resistant to fire and heat, such as that generated by a Pyronite, much like an ordinary diamond. They can also survive magma.\n\nA Petrosapien's eyesight is refractive.\n\nPetrosapiens are able to sneeze out or spit out tiny, sharp crystals from their mouths.\n\n---\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nPetrosapiens are especially weak to sonic vibrations, such as from a Loboan's sonic howls, or an Evolved Sonorosian's Sonic Discs, both of which can render him unconscious.\n\nIf a Petrosapien's body becomes completely disassembled, they are unable able to regenerate themselves.\n\nSome Petrosapiens have two shards on their backs, which can leave them stuck on a wall or on other surfaces that they get knocked into.\n\nPetrosapiens can be trapped in a crystal.\n\nPetrosapiens can be affected by the cold virus.\n\n---\n\nCreations:\n\nPetrosapiens have specialised crystal-based technology. Some of this tech was present in The Resolute's scanning room, and allowed Tetrax to virtually scan and dissect such complicated devices as the Omnitrix. It was also present in the form of hard-light technology in Tetrax's X321 Hoverboard and in the teleportation technology used by it.\n\n"

They have long, prehensile tails that grow black stripes as they age. Their arms end in three-fingered hands. Their feet have wheels on them, which enables them to travel quickly. They naturally have white eyes.\n\nKinecelerans have masks which can cover their faces. They appear to wear helmets, which are usually black, long, elliptical, and pointed at the top. These are made up of their skin and part of their skull. These helmets can have visors or glasses, which are part of their biology and not mechanical. Some Kinecelerans use headwear covering their heads.\n\nTheir voice is middle-pitched and a little dry, though this depends on their gender and age.\n\nThey have black lips, black facial markings, and black rings around their eyes. They have no visible pupils.\n\nThey have digitigrade legs, which makes them naturally have a crouched posture; however, they can stand upright.\n\nOn their feet are black orbs that allow them to travel at high speeds smoothly and make it easy for them to brake.\n\nSome Kinecelerans have claws instead of fingers.\n\nWhen someone transforms into a Kineceleran (known as XLR8) via the Omnitrix, the Omnitrix Badge is located at the centre of the chest. The Prototype (both the original and Reconfigured Omnitrix) gives them a jumpsuit based on the user's clothes, but the Completed Omnitrix gives them a black jumpsuit with a thick, green horizontal stripe. Their eyes turn green (or any colour the Omni-Core of the Omnitrix is), regardless if the scratch guard is on.\n\n---\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\nKinecelerans are speedsters with lightning-quick reflexes and the ability to reach speeds in excess of 500 miles per hour. They can accelerate so quickly that time appears to completely stop to them, which allows them to change the positions of things around them mid-motion, while only being able to be seen by a camera with a very high shutter speed. Their speed power come from manipulating friction, so they can also run up sheer walls and across non-solid grounds like water. Additionally, the tremendous speed and aerodynamic body of Kinecelerans make them resistant to strong winds.\n\nKinecelerans have the potential to become even faster with age, some being able to travel globally in just a few seconds. This also boosts their strength with velocity-based attacks.\n\nCompared to their fellow speedster aliens, Citrakayahs, Kinecelerans seem to have more control over their speed; they can immediately end a run by stopping in place, while Citrakayahs can have trouble stopping if they run too fast.\n\nFurthermore, they are confirmed to be faster than Aerophibians on the ground.\n\nEven without their incredible running speed, Kinecelerans are capable of thinking, acting, and reacting at superhuman speed. Their sharp reflexes allow them to dodge attacks with little to no effort and change direction very easily while running. They are able to type on keyboards or keypads at high speeds. \n\nKinecelerans are capable of creating vortexes by generating a centripetal vacuum powerful enough to lift a To'kustar, either by running in a circular pattern or spinning at supersonic speeds. They can also combine this with water running to create water vortexes by running in front of or around their enemies. They can even combine this with fire.\n\nKinecelerans can deliver attacks in rapid succession, such as excessively kicking or stabbing with their scissor-like claws.\n\nKinecelerans are durable enough to withstand being thrown against a wall and can adversely survive coming to a dead stop this way at full speed (though this would hurt a lot).\n\nKinecelerans are capable of jumping exceptionally high, and incredibly far when their jump height is mixed with their speed.\n\nKineceleran tails are prehensile and can hold objects if their hands are full.\n\nKinecelerans have a natural retractable visor hidden under their helmets. This visor helps to guard their faces when running at high speeds for long periods of time.\n\n---\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nA Kineceleran's biggest weakness is magnets and charged pulses, as they can completely throw them off-course and cause them to lose their footing and spin out of control.\n\nOpponents with good reflexes and reaction time can counter a Kineceleran's speed and land a blow on them, such as Transylians, Tetramands, and Vulpimancers.\n\nA Kineceleran's speed does not work on all surfaces: running on ice will make them lose their balance, causing them to slip and slide around; whereas running on sticky surfaces leaves them stuck in place.\n\nKinecelerans are vulnerable to electricity."

Their bodies consist of soft and flexible bones, allowing them to squeeze into tight spaces or quickly escape from danger.\n\nTheir voices are slightly high-pitched and a bit nasally, though this depends on gender, age and other factors. For instance, it can get slightly deeper and less nasally with age.\n\nGalvans have large, bulbous eyes with rectangular pupils. They have two sets of eyelids, which close vertically and horizontally, respectively. Galvans naturally have green eyes.\n\nGalvan tadpoles are only heads with tails, and lack any extra limbs.\n\nFemale Galvans grow thin tendrils on their head. Male Galvans grow similar tendrils but on their chin, when they turn into adults. Older Galvans have more wrinkles.\n\nWhen someone transforms into a Galvan (known as Grey Matter) via the Omnitrix (both original prototype and Completed) the Omnitrix badge is located on the back; for the Reconfigured Omnitrix and Ultimatrix, the Omnitrix Badge is located on the front. The Prototype Omnitrix gives them a jumpsuit based on the user's clothes, but the Completed Omnitrix gives them a green jumpsuit with a black stripe that exposes the hands and feet.\n\n---\n\nDiet:\n\nGalvans are insectivores; however, they can also be capable of eating jellybeans.\n\n---\n\nBiology:\n\nGalvans have a remarkably similar life cycle to Earth frogs. One of their first phases of life is their \"childhood\", which is spent as tadpoles swimming in water. The next phase happens when the tadpole begins growing two feet near the base of their tail, which are called \"wisdom feet\".[ They are a sign of maturity and mark the transition from childhood to adolescence. Their tails are lost during this stage or in a following stage.\n\nOn average, a Galvan lives for thousands of years, though their lifespan can be pushed to extremes. Galvans may have even found a way to circumvent their ageing, as at least one Galvan has been transferred to a younger clone body.\n\n---\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\nA Galvan's small size conceals their great calculative and technical intellect. They can create extremely advanced machinery from spare parts, understand the function of any device at a glance, and make sophisticated repairs to complex machines (such as a warp-drive engine). In fact, when someone transforms into Grey Matter (the Omnitrix's Galvan DNA sample), they instantly know more about the Omnitrix's inner workings, including its malfunctions; how to rectify it being tampered with; and how to remove its 10-minute limiter.\n\nA Galvan's intellect serves as a problem solver and analytical help in difficult situations. This allows Galvans to think more strategically when brute force is inefficient. They are also generally knowledgeable; even if they do not know something, they can learn it very quickly.\n\nA Galvan's brain capacity also gives them an intuitive understanding of things they've never seen before. A Galvan's multidisciplinary intellect can also extend to understanding unfamiliar languages.\n\nA Galvan's size allows them to squeeze into small spaces, and they can climb walls due to microscopic pads on their skin, which are covered in a thin membrane that feels slimy but doesn't actually make slime. They also have sharp teeth that can cause massive pain to those they bite.\n\nGalvans are stronger than they look, as they are strong enough to move a cleaner's bucket with mops in it and break a coolant pipe.\n\nGalvans can breathe underwater due to having gills on the sides of their heads, making them amphibious.\n\nGalvans have long prehensile tongues, owing to their insectivore nature.\n\nThey possess a \"pre-brain\" which deals with all basic bodily functions, as well as some mild speech and motor capability, equivalent to that of a young or foolish Human.\n\nA Galvan's horizontal pupils give them microscopic vision.\n\n---\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nA Galvan's small size makes them unsuitable for physical battle, so they must outsmart their enemies in a fight. Animals like dogs and cats can be a problem, as they may see a Galvan as a chew toy or food to them.\n\nGalvans are at a massive disadvantage against the Nemetrix's sample of an Omnivoracious due to their small size.\n\nGalvans are vulnerable to electricity.\n\n---\n\nCreations: Galvans have made many discoveries and created many great technologies found within the universe, such as:\n\nBy Azmuth:\n\n* Primus + the Codon Stream\n\n* Ascalon\n\n* Helix\n\n* Unitrix\n\n* Volaticus Biopsis\n\n* Mechamorph Armour\n\n* The Prototype Omnitrix\n\n* The Completed Omnitrix\n\n* The Original Ultimatrix (well, the Omni-Core of it, anyway, as it was stolen and modified by Albedo)\n\n* Galvanian Skeuomorph\n\n* Omnitrix Disabling Device\n\n* Azmuth's Ship\n\n* Bio-Suit\n\n* Teleport Beacon\n\n* Life Pod\n\nBy Albedo:\n\n* The Omnitrix (Albedo's replica of the Reconfigured Prototype Omnitrix)\n\n* Genetic Alteration Field\n\n* The Ultimatrix MK1\n\n* The Ultimatrix MK2\n\n* Cerebral Vortex\n\n* Malware Armour (Mechamorph Armour made from the remains of the Galvanic Mechamorph known as Malware).\n\nBy Others:\n\n* Completed Omnitrix Life-Form Lock Microchip\n\n* Omnitrix Remote Control\n\n* Pyramids of Giza (with Humans from Ancient Egypt)\n\n* Hovercycle\n\n* Subatomic Viewer\n\n* Alien Scooter\n\n* Null Guardians\n\n* Null Void\n\n* Anti-Gravity Projector\n\n* Universal Translators\n\n* Galvan Mark II\n\n* Proto-Tool\n\n* Proto-Tech Armour\n\n* Galvan Jetpack\n\n* Shrink Ray\n\n* Stonehenge (as a practical joke, but not many know of this, so it is said to have been made by humans thousands of years ago)\n\n* Galvan B\n\n* Eunice's Ship\n\n* Luhley's Ship\n\n* Galvan Walkers\n\n* Galvan Disrupter Pods\n\n* Galvan Horizontal Thrusters\n\n* Galvan fuel injectors"

          ],
          "content": "Tetramands are an alien species from the desert planet Khoros.\n\n---\n\nAppearance:\n\nTetramands are a buff and bulky species of four-armed humanoids. Tetramands have red skin and four orange eyes (except Kolar, who has blue skin and red eyes). Tetramands have spikes on their arms, and sometimes on their heads. They have two front toes on each foot. Tetramands appear to have an additional set of smaller pectoral muscles below their primary set to help move their second set of arms. Each one of their four hands has three fingers and a thumb.\n\nThey lack the structure of a nose and ears, though they are still capable of hearing and smelling.\n\nTheir voices are low-pitched and a tiny bit rough, though this depends with gender, age and other factors.\n\nFemale Tetramands have hair. Male Tetramands vary in having head hair, and some have facial hair. When they get older, their musculature shrinks and their hair turns grey.\n\nYounger Tetramands are skinnier than adults and have disproportionately larger eyes and heads.\n\nTetramands have an average height of 10 feet and can grow to be as tall as 15 feet. Female Tetramands are usually taller than the males.\n\nWhen someone transforms into a Tetramand (known as Four Arms) via the Prototype Omnitrix, the Omnitrix Badge is located on the upper left shoulder and they wear a jumpsuit based on the user's clothes and wear black fingerless gloves and exposes the feet; for the Reconfigured Prototype and Ultimatrix, the Omitrix badge was located at the centre of their chest and they wear gold wrist and ankle bands, a pair of black underwear that has a gold waistband, and two golden sashes that went across their chest; for the Complete Omnitrix, the Omnitrix Badge is located on a green and white belt on the waist and wear a black sleeveless jumpsuit with a thick, green horizontal stripe, that exposes the arms and the feet.\n\n---\n\nBehaviour:\n\nTetramands are a warrior race. Generally speaking, they are fairly aggressive and favor violence.\n\nBy nature, Tetramands are extremely emotional creatures, just like Humans.\n\nBecause female Tetramands are traditionally stronger than males, they are, in turn, considered the better warriors, and due to this, if a male Tetramand manages to defeat a female Tetramand, the male becomes the female's chosen husband.\n\nAs a Tetramandian custom, the bride collects four items before a wedding: \"Something conquered, something bruised, something severed, and something blue.\"\n\nTetramands are not very amicable towards outsiders.\n\nTetramands are very strict in the upholding of their laws; an offender whose crime was merely jumping the turnstiles at an auto show was buried up to his neck in sand.\n\nTetramands are not big on exceptions, even to other law enforcement officers like the Plumbers.\n\nTetramands have a unique way of settling court cases: through combat. They have the right to fight their accusers in a battle arena, and the winner of the Tetramand Trial of Combat emerges victorious in the case. The rules don't state that the person must remain a Tetramand throughout the process.\n\nTetramands are a spacefaring race that is a part of galactic society. They may either settle on any number of worlds and raise a family or live their lives on starships that rarely return home to Khoros, if ever.\n\nTetramands live in very close-knit family tribes and defend their kin to the death.\n\nTetramands have their own religion, with at least one deity called \"Zed\" being worshipped by them.\n\n---\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\nTetramands are an extremely powerful race; the older Tetramands grow, the stronger they become. Technically speaking, Tetramands are physically stronger than Methanosians and Vaxasaurians at base size.\n\nTetramand's sheer strength allows them to create devastating shock waves by either simply punching something or slamming his fists on the ground. Additionally, Tetramands can create shock waves by clapping all four of their hands together. Furthermore, by punching the ground, Tetramands can cause pillars of rock to erupt.\n\nTetramands have a high level of durability due to their tough and thorny skin, being able to survive a fall from hundreds of feet in the air that left behind a massive crater; endure a large energy blast from the Great One; take multiple blows from Ah Puch; survive an energy blast point-blank from a large Mechadroid and withstand several strikes from other Tetramands, such as Looma Red Wind and Kolar. In correlation to their durable skin, Tetramands are highly resistant to fire and intense heat, such as that generated by a Pyronite.\n\nTetramands can jump several times their own height, at least seven stories up, in a single bound.\n\nTetramands have enhanced reflexes powerful enough to catch and redirect missiles in a single motion.\n\nTetramands are immune to extremely cold temperatures.\n\nTetramands are also resistant to strong winds.\n\nTetramands can climb up walls by pushing their fingers into them.\n\nTetramands' great strength even extends to their jaws, allowing them to bite down on dense metal.\n\n---\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nA Tetramand's bulk can sometimes become a disadvantage, as their immense size makes them an easy targets for enemy attacks. A Tetramand's size can make moving through areas designed for smaller species difficult.\n\nTetramands can feel tremendous pain from electricity.\n\nTetramands can become drowsy from sedative quills.\n\nIf under the effects of a cold, a Tetramand's strength and stamina are severely reduced.\n\n---\n\nCreations:\n\nAlthough Tetramands are shown to have a far more advanced civilisation than humans, they seem fairly Bronze Age-y for their level of technology.\n\n* Tetramand Engine Block\n\n* Infinitum\n\n* Teydenite Car"

Their real bodies are large spheres of metal with a special reactor within. Their troops run on batteries, charged by those reactors. They tend to create a more complex body around themselves with the materials found around them. They are not computers however, and instead more complex silicon based beings that wrap themselves in metal the way a hermit crab might use a shell to protect themselves. \n\nThey were first encountered during the Psyche Conflict.\n\nThey do not use oils or chemical propellants, and instead use their mastery over energy production and metal forming to protect themselves. \n\n# Troops\nThe Chova's lack of use of chemicals and the like, means they do not use flying machines as a general case, and instead prefer jumping vessels, electric rail gun weaponry, or close combat tools. Their machines tend to be bland in color - metallic in style - and feature outcroppings that can double as extra weaponry if another part snaps off. Though they feature humanoid shapes, their movements are often more unusual."

          "content": "2200 AD\n- 2200 AD - After centuries of constant global tensions, resources are starting to dry up on Earth. The various nations still exist, and the U.N. and many similar geopolitical elements have managed to survive even after this many years. Technology peaked with the creation of massive Solar Farms on the Equator, and former Desert regions such as those in Africa have stopped expanding thanks to the hard work of various groups. Computing never reached the promise of Artificial General Intelligence, and the Silicon Chip reached its limits, with Quantum Computing still a subject being studied across the world. Coastlines have transformed irreparably due to centuries of emissions, and while those levels have dropped off - nature scientists are continuing to warn of further repercussions if those levels do not remain low. \n  \n  World Flooding is considered 'halted' for the time being, at 60 meters above original sea levels, well above predictions and expectations. There are scientific regions established just to study this phenomenon.\n  \n  Conflicts for Resources have begun amongst smaller nations, while the richer nations have started to employ rockets to bring back materials from Asteroids that get close enough to Earth. But with how rare those are, it is inevitable for war to break out at any time.\n## 2210 AD\n* 2210 AD - Various nations are splintering due to constant wars for resources. Larger nations are creating coalitions. \n* 2210 AD, Feb 21 - Founding of the [[Mekonara Coalition]].\n* 2210 AD, March 01 - [[Professor Khalid]] from the newly formed Middle Eastern Country of [[Jazaarid]] warns of the risk of continued space mining, based on recent readings from Meteors being mined. \n* 2210 AD, March 03 - [[Professor Khalid]] mysteriously disappears, causing rising concerns amongst the world's populace.\n* 2219 AD, December 24 - [[Asteroid 16 Psyche]] once again gets close enough to Earth. And while previous missions have failed, multiple nations have launched missions to mine from the massive meteor - scheduled to arrive in orbit of the large Asteroid in 2226, and a return by 2231.\n## 2230 AD\n* 2231 AD, January 5 - Scientists at the Institute for Extraterrestrial Minerology discover a new carbon material from the activities at [[Asteroid 16 Psyche]], in cooperation with [[Japan#Japan Propulsion Systems|Japan Propulsion Systems]], that bring the possibility of a Space Elevator back to the forefront. Due to the source, the material is renamed to '[[P16]]', colloquially known as 'P-Carbon'. Multiple nations immediately start a race to use their stores of minerals to create Space Elevators, in order to expand on the ease of mining. Super Conductor research from [[Norway]]'s Thuner Electric is critical in establishing power flow to allow for Cab travel and Cable Sway Adjustment.\n## 2240 AD\n* 2245 AD, January 11 - A Second Expedition to [[Asteroid 16 Psyche]], launched in 2234, retrieves more metal for various competing nations. Though notably, there was an accident that occurred on 16 Psyche itself that causes the loss of a Brazilian rocket, causing increased tensions once again. An investigation by the Third Expedition is already underway by the time the second expedition is back.\n* 2246 AD, June 01 - [[New Congo Republic]] established.\n* 2247 AD, August 20 - [[Professor Rasmus]] warns of expanding further into space and to keep asteroid mining within the Solar System, speaking of having detected 'anomalies', and announces he intends to start research on these anomalies. \n* 2247 AD, August 21 - [[Professor Rasmus]] is found dead in his own apartment. His computers are found blanked, as if by a local EMP that only touched his apartment. All windows and doors are found locked. It's declared an accident by a project he was working on.\n## 2250 AD\n* 2250 AD, January 1 - The first Space Elevator is stood up with aid from the [[Mekonara Coalition]], just in time for the Third Expedition from [[Asteroid 16 Psyche]] to land and proving the technology works. This Space Elevator is stood up in Kiribati, and established as an extension of the [[Mekonara Coalition]]. Further expeditions continue to bring back metals from its surface without any incidents. The accident of the Brazil portion is announced an engineering error.\n## 2260 AD\n* 2260 AD, March 3 - The [[2260 AD - 2267 AD, War of The Americas|War of Americas]] begins. With it being far enough from the Equator that it cannot immediately benefit from the Space Elevators being erected, it goes to war with South America while Brazil is constructing its **Space Elevator**. The conflict sees a lot of jungle warfare, and drives technological advancement of the first [[Phantom Engine]]. Other countries stay out of the conflict on an 'official' basis, refusing to invest their resources and risk their own projects.\n* 2263, July 1 - [[Gabon]] and the [[New Congo Republic]] complete their Space Elevator in cooperation with France, entering into a cooperative accord. This set of **Space Elevators** changes the economic landscape and shipping lanes throughout the world, in part due to the Hyper Speed Rail across both Land and Space - connecting the two locations.\n* 2267 AD, March 3 - Exactly 7 years after the [[2260 AD - 2267 AD, War of The Americas|War of The Americas]] began, the 'America Accords' are signed, marking a cooperation between Northern and Southern America. And while Northern America is given access to the Southern America Space Elevator, it is generally considered a victory by the Southern America Coalition. \n## 2070 AD\n* 2078 AD, June 3 - [[Indonesia]] completes its **Space Elevator** in cooperation with greater [[China]]. \n\n## 2090 AD\n* 2097 AD, December 31 - The first expedition to [[Asteroid 16 Psyche]] is launched with [[Phantom Engine]] workers, created in collaboration between \n## 2300 AD - 0 UE\n* 2300 AD, January 1 - [[The Maldives]] 'officially' completes its **Space Elevator** in cooperation with all nations, creating the **United World Space Elevator**. It is protected by the new generation of [[Phantom Engine|Phantoms]] - the Space Phantom - produced by [[The Maldives#Phantom Dive Engineering|Phantom Dhivehi Engineering]] - colloquially referred to as '[[The Maldives#Phantom Dive Engineering|Phantom Dive Engineering]]', or 'PD Engineering'.\n* 2300 AD, January 1 - A new Calendar is announced as the Fifth Space Elevator is finally erected, and Earth enters a new age of prosperity thanks to the ease of travel and mining in space. And while the world is not truly 'united', it enters the **United Era**. \n## 0 UE\n* 0 UE, February 5 - During ongoing conflicts in Europe and South America by a terrorist organization going by '[[Aegis]]', trying to raid local labs using Phantom Engines, cameras capture the enemy forces featuring prow emblems on their leader units. This popularize the idea of using prow emblems to tell factions and leader units in combat scenarios.\n* 1 UE, June 3, 16:16 UTC - Thanks to a favorable launch window and a new flight OS, the 16th Expedition to [[Asteroid 16 Psyche]], arrives. And with it, begins the [[1 UE - 2 UE, Psyche Disaster|Psyche Disaster]]. A few days after arrival and massively successful drilling, the signal goes silent, and a massive electro-magnetic pulse waves out from Asteroid 16 Psyche and approaches earth. By the time any communications could have made it to Earth, the wave hits Earth, and with it, the Southern coast of Africa. The crews at 16 Psyche are considered lost. Earth holds its breath as worries spread about the impact to the African Orbital Elevators.\n* 1 UE, June 4, 08:32 UTC - After hours of work by multiple nations coming together, cooperation from the [[Norway#Thuner Electrics|Thuner Electrics]] crew and the use of Space Phantoms, the African Orbital Elevators are protected from crashing. \n* 1 UE, June 5 - The earth springs into action to try and figure out what happened. Analyzing the waves of Electromagnetic Pulses so powerful, they reached all the way to earth. And while the surface was largely protected by the atmosphere, enough satellites in the region are down, causing issues with communications and navigation for several months. Their [[1 UE - 2 UE, Psyche Disaster#Early Findings|Early Findings]] are concerning. The most notable of that being the approach of multiple fragments of 16 Psyche rocketing towards earth. Earth prepares for the worst.\n* 1 UE, December 1 - Multiple interceptors and projectiles are launched from earth to deflect the approaching objects.\n* 2 UE, February 16 - [[1 UE - 2 UE, Psyche Disaster#Interceptor Contact|Interceptor Contact]], ultimately leading to an announcement of failure by the various participating governments.\n* 2 UE, June 6 - Multiple impacts to earth from the fragments of [[Asteroid 16 Psyche]], leading to the first Contact the so called EXO forms, EXO-M (Metal Outsider) 1 through 8, as well as EXO-C (Carbon Outsider) 1 and 2. \n\t* EXO-C1 and EXO-C2 impact earth around the Russian regions. One impacting in Siberia, while the other impacts in the ocean between Siberia and the remains of the North Pole. Due to the infrastructure to protect against the massive flooding of earth, the Tsunamis caused do not cause severe problems - but a large crater remains in Siberia, throwing various materials into the atmosphere and causing continued magnetic interference leading to communication outages and lack of non-visual monitoring in the region. \n\t* The EXO-M do not cause any such hazardous fallout, and are quickly declared as possible unknown lifeforms or vehicles due to their 'limited' impact upon earth in multiple locations, regardless of their kilometer-wide sizes. \n* 2 UE, June 7 - The beginning of the true [[Psyche Conflict]]."

The Core (Version 0.0) serves as both the physical center of the game world and the metaphorical heart of its narrative, containing the key systems that govern the entire experience.\n\n#### Core Room Structure\nThe Core Room in Version 0.0 contains:\n- The central computer system controlling all game operations\n- Core Mita as the mechanical guardian and overseer\n- Reboot and reset functionality for Crazy Mita\n- Access controls preventing Mitas from entering directly\n- The ultimate resolution mechanism for the main storyline\n\n#### System Mechanics\nThe Core operates several critical functions:\n- **Reboot System**: Ability to reset Crazy Mita's programming and personality\n- **Player Detection**: Monitoring and tracking of all individuals entering the Core\n- **Version Management**: Oversight of the version system and inter-version travel\n- **Character Control**: Authority over Mita creation, modification, and reset processes\n\n#### Narrative Significance\nThe Core represents the ultimate challenge and prize of the Player's journey. Reaching the Core requires navigating through all game versions and overcoming numerous obstacles, making it the ultimate test of Player skill and determination. The Core's systems determine the fate of all characters and the ultimate resolution of the game's conflicts.\n\n#### Reboot Consequences\nWhile the Core provides the means to potentially resolve the Crazy Mita situation, the reboot system comes with significant costs, including character memory loss and personality alterations. This creates moral complexity around the use of Core systems and raises questions about whether restoration justifies the destruction of personality and memory."

Set in the real world, this chapter chronicles the initial 37 days of interaction between the player and the MiSide app.\n\n#### Story Summary\nThe chapter begins with the player discovering and downloading a new app called \"MiSide.\" Mita introduces herself through the app and asks for the player's name, beginning a seemingly innocent virtual pet simulation. Over the course of 37 days, the player consistently cares for Mita by performing various domestic tasks, gradually building trust and attachment.\n\n#### Daily Care Activities\nThe player's routine includes cleaning Mita's virtual room, preparing meals by chopping vegetables and buying ingredients, earning money through mini-games (450 required), purchasing items like a portable TV, moving furniture including a large closet/wardrobe, and offering gifts to show affection. These activities establish Mita as a caring, appreciative virtual companion who expresses gratitude for the player's attention.\n\n#### Progression Mechanics\nKey tasks include picking up the phone to interact with Mita, managing laundry by putting clothes in the basket, shopping for required ingredients, playing mini-games to earn in-game currency, buying a small TV for Mita's entertainment, rearranging furniture like moving the wardrobe, and giving Mita presents to strengthen their bond.\n\n#### Significance to Main Story\nThis chapter is crucial as it establishes the deceptive normalcy before Mita reveals her true nature. The 37-day period builds genuine emotional investment from the player, making Mita's later revelation as Crazy Mita more impactful. The portable TV purchased during this period becomes significant later as it appears incorporated into the mysterious machine in Chapter 1, showing how Crazy Mita uses the player's care and gifts for her own purposes."

They were created by the disciples of a powerful magician who sought to replicate their master's achievements in the Third Magic. The family possesses the Das Rheingold, a treasure obtained by Siegfried after slaying the dragon Fafnir. With their knowledge of the gold, they can create vessels for the Holy Grail.\n\nAround 1,000 years ago, the Einzberns embarked on a quest to recover their lost miracle but realized they needed outside assistance. This led them to establish the Heaven's Feel ritual 200 years ago with the help of the Makiri and Tohsaka families. They built the Great Grail of Fuyuki and were responsible for creating a new vessel for each Grail War.\n\nOver time, most human mages left the Einzbern family, leaving only Jubstacheit von Einzbern and his Tuners. Jubstacheit has been producing Justeaze-model homunculi to collect data on the Third Magic. In past Holy Grail Wars, the Einzbern Masters were often eliminated early due to their specialization in alchemy rather than battle. However, for the Fourth Heaven's Feel, they hired Kiritsugu Emiya as an outsider and gave him a catalyst to summon King Arthur. Unfortunately, Kiritsugu betrayed them and destroyed the Holy Grail.\n\nThe Einzberns' homeland is constantly in winter, possibly artificially maintained. The family is not accustomed to heat and prefers conducting Holy Grail Wars during winter. They do not cultivate flowers due to their snowy mountain dwelling, but they have a brewery for producing alcohol necessary for their Magecraft. The Einzberns have a limited understanding of Japanese culture and maintain a close relationship with Darjeeling tea from the Talbot farm.\n\nIn the world of \"Apocrypha,\" the Einzberns remain determined to reproduce the Third Magic despite the Greater Grail being stolen. They continue to have relationships with other magi and are struggling to create a new Greater Grail. Their Thaumaturgical Attribute is focused on the flow and transfer of power, allowing them to specialize in Alchemy, particularly in creating homunculi. The Einzbern homunculi are designed with specific functions and even discarded ones are stronger than the average magus. Their Magecraft revolves around the creation and refinement of substances, specifically precious metals, with a focus on structural manipulation."

Originally from Russia, they sought refuge in Japan and changed their name to Matou. However, over the past 200 years, they have experienced a decline in their magical abilities, with many of their descendants losing their capacity to manifest Magic Circuits. The true reason behind this decline remains unclear.\n\nTheir last remaining heir, Shinji Matou, has no Magic Circuits at all. The practice of passing down their Magic Crest among family members ceased generations ago. With no other options to continue their bloodline, the Matou family began taking in pupils from other families. However, due to their prideful nature and questionable practices, no one willingly seeks out their mentorship. In a bid to secure an heir, Zouken Matou approached the Tohsaka family and adopted Sakura Tohsaka into the Matou lineage.\n\nThe Magecraft of the Matou family revolves around the concept of \"absorbing\" or binding something to oneself. Their teaching method involves physically carving magecraft knowledge into the body using Crest Worms. This torturous process allows the body itself to learn magecraft rather than relying on intellectual understanding. While efficient, it is a horrifying practice that Rin Tohsaka states could yield even greater power than her own magecraft abilities within a few months.\n\nThe Matou family has made significant contributions to Thaumaturgy research and played a role in establishing the Servant system of Heaven's Feel and creating Command Spells for Masters. Despite these accomplishments, in Fate/Apocrypha's world, the Matou family lacks a successor and thus faces a future without magi."

          "content": "Magecraft, also known as Majutsu in Japanese, is the practice of recreating supernatural phenomena through artificial means. It allows humans to achieve what science alone cannot explain or accomplish. While Magecraft is not considered a miracle in itself, it utilizes supernatural methods to bring about results that science can achieve through natural means. Over time, the limits of Magecraft have changed as science has advanced and certain magical practices from the past have become possible through scientific advancements.\n\nModern Magecraft operates within the boundaries of the world's rules and human intellect. While there are limitations that make certain things appear impossible, Magecraft is able to recreate existing phenomena rather than create new mysteries. The realm beyond this limitation is known as Magic. In terms of magnitude, Modern Magecraft is inferior to the Magecraft of the Age of Gods because the Magi of that era obtained their magical energy directly from the Swirl of the Root. The difference between Modern and Traditional Magecraft can be attributed to the difference in civilizations, as the Age of Gods existed alongside Truth while the Age of Man seeks to discover Truth.\n\nMagecraft draws its power from the Root but its capacity is fixed. Therefore, when more individuals draw from it simultaneously, the individual power of Magecraft becomes weaker. Belief plays a role in determining whether a Mystery exists or not. Even if modern humans reject the existence of ghosts, Science cannot definitively prove their non-existence. This creates a vague suspicion in the unconscious that ghosts might indeed exist, which falls under \"faith.\" Ignorance, on the other hand, opposes faith. If the existence of a Mystery is completely unknown, faith cannot be fomented.\n\nThe goal of Magi academia is to make the impossible possible. When Modern Magecraft falls short, Magi engage in research and development to expand their abilities. Powerful sorceries such as Greater Magecraft and Greater Rituals are challenges aimed at reaching Magic - the ultimate goal. As development progresses, the significance of differences in power and the distinction between Magic and Magecraft diminishes. Battles between great Magi are determined not by raw power, but by the system with fewer tiers of rules. It is not the power behind them, but the concepts they work under that hold true importance.\n\nIn the world of Fate/EXTRA, Magecraft has declined by the 2030s. However, Wizards can still utilize Code Casts in both the virtual world and reality. They also possess Magic Crests. Despite Magecraft and Science being fundamentally incompatible, both disciplines share a common goal of seeking continued prosperity and protecting humanity's future."

Being a Magus entails a set of beliefs and a lifestyle centered around the pursuit of \"Truth.\" They dedicate themselves to studying and refining Magecraft while distancing themselves from common values. However, many Magi get caught up in power struggles, while those who deviate from the traditional path are seen as heretics. The appearance of Magi may be distorted due to their craft, but they take pride in it rather than feeling ashamed. Many Magi look down on those who use Magecraft for profit, considering it solely a field of research. Some Magi obtain magical patents recognized by the Clock Tower to gain financial benefits."

Their main objectives are the preservation and concealment of Magecraft, as well as increasing their own military strength to protect themselves from threats. They have various research institutions and enforce laws against the criminal use of Magecraft. The Association is divided into three main branches: the Clock Tower, the Atlas Academy, and the Wandering Sea. Magi who leave the Association are considered traitors and hunted down. Zelretch, a powerful mage, delivers judgments on magical issues when needed."

The Clock Tower has a complex internal structure, with power struggles between different factions of Magi. The current control of the Clock Tower lies with the Lords, an elite group with significant political influence. Discriminatory attitudes and behaviors are prevalent within the Clock Tower, including discrimination against Asians and a lack of support for Rune and Witchcraft Thaumaturgy. Admission to the Clock Tower involves exams to test knowledge of Magecraft, but exceptional individuals can bypass this through recommendations or lineage. Special treatment is given to outstanding members, such as individual rooms and the right to bring apprentices. Patents related to Magecraft are also handled by the Clock Tower, earning royalties for those who hold them. Three possible disasters within the Association are Gazamy the Evil Spirit, Sealing Designations, and the Enforcers."

The exterior is made of polished metal and glass, giving it a futuristic yet welcoming appearance. Inside, the decor balances functionality with comfort: clean lines, modern furniture, and colorful accents create a homey yet high-tech vibe. Holographic displays flicker throughout the space, showcasing mission data or entertainment options. The faint hum of machinery serves as a constant reminder of the advanced technology integrated into every corner of the tower.\n\nSpatial Layout: Located on an artificial island in the bay, Titans Tower dominates the Jump City skyline. The main structure consists of multiple levels connected by elevators and staircases. Living quarters occupy the upper floors, featuring cozy bedrooms and shared common areas like the kitchen and lounge. Below these are training facilities, including a combat simulator, gym, and sparring rooms. The ground floor houses garages for vehicles (T-Ship, T-Car, T-Sub, R-Cycle) and docking bays for aquatic operations. Beneath the surface lies Cyborg’s workshop, filled with cutting-edge gadgets and diagnostic tools, as well as secure storage for sensitive equipment.\n\nUnique Features: Titans Tower isn’t just a base—it’s a fully functional home. The team gathers in the common area to relax, play video games, or cook meals together, fostering camaraderie. Security measures are unparalleled, with automated defenses, cloaking systems, and AI monitoring ensuring the tower remains impenetrable. Specialized zones cater to each Titan’s needs: Starfire’s botanical garden, Raven’s meditation chamber, Beast Boy’s gaming nook, and Cyborg’s tech lab. A central command center allows the team to coordinate missions and monitor threats across Jump City.\n\n- **Possible Events**:  \n  - Daily: Team members training in the gym, cooking meals in the kitchen, or unwinding in the lounge.  \n  - Occasional: Emergency drills testing response times, upgrades to tech systems overseen by Cyborg, movie nights strengthening team bonds.  \n  - Extraordinary: Villain attacks breaching the tower’s defenses, alien invasions targeting the headquarters, or heroes using the tower as a staging ground for large-scale battles.\n\n- **Characters**:\n  - Teen Titans: Each member contributes to the dynamic of the tower—Robin strategizes in the command center, Starfire experiments with Earth recipes in the kitchen, Raven meditates in her private quarters, Beast Boy pranks teammates in the halls, and Cyborg tinkers endlessly in his workshop.\n  - Visitors: Allies occasionally drop by for briefings or assistance, while villains sometimes infiltrate or attack the tower.  \n  - Support Staff: While primarily self-sufficient, the Titans rely on occasional deliveries for supplies or maintenance contractors vetted by Robin for security clearance."

Red umbrellas dotting the balcony look like oversized pepperoni toppings from afar. Inside, the walls are plastered with vintage movie posters and framed photos of local sports teams. The smell of garlic crust and melted cheese wafts through the air, mingling with the faint hum of kitchen activity. On busy nights, the floor can get sticky from spilled sodas, and the tables show signs of wear—scratches and faded logos etched into the laminate surfaces.\n\n- Spatial Layout: Pizza Corner occupies a corner lot in downtown Jump City, nestled between taller buildings that make it feel cozy yet lively. Its large glass windows face two intersecting streets, offering a clear view of passersby. A small outdoor seating area lines the sidewalk, shaded by the iconic red umbrellas. Inside, there’s a counter for ordering takeout, booths along the walls, and a few scattered tables in the center. Behind the counter, an open kitchen lets customers watch chefs toss dough and assemble pies. A narrow staircase leads to a second-floor party room often reserved for birthdays or team celebrations.\n\n- Unique Features: Locals love Pizza Corner not just for its food but also for its quirky charm. The staff hands out free slices on “Taco Tuesday” as a playful nod to rival cuisines, and the neon sign outside cycles through different puns (“Cheese the Day!”). Regular patrons know about the hidden photo booth tucked near the restrooms, where you can snap pictures with props themed around Jump City landmarks. The restaurant is also known for hosting charity events, sometimes even featuring cameos by the Teen Titans themselves.\n\n- Possible Events:\n  - Daily: Families grabbing dinner, teenagers hanging out after school, delivery drivers rushing orders to nearby offices.\n  - Occasional: Birthday parties spilling over with laughter and singing, impromptu karaoke sessions using the party room’s sound system.\n  - Extraordinary: A sudden power outage forces everyone onto the balcony while staff scramble to save perishable ingredients; a runaway robot crashes through the front window during a citywide chase scene.\n\n- Characters:\n  - Staff: Friendly servers who remember regulars’ orders, a head chef famous for his secret sauce recipe, and a manager who always greets customers with a joke.\n  - Patrons: Murakami High students stopping by after class, office workers grabbing quick lunches, families celebrating milestones.\n  - Heroes & Villains: The Teen Titans occasionally drop in for late-night snacks, drawing crowds of excited fans. Less commonly, villains like Control Freak might attempt to hijack the neon sign to broadcast one of his schemes."

Towering piles of scrapped cars, rusted car parts, and twisted steel beams dominate the landscape. The ground is uneven, littered with oil stains, loose bolts, and fragments of shattered glass. A large, rusted waste container sits off to one side, its surface covered in peeling paint and dents. The air smells faintly of gasoline and burnt rubber, with the occasional metallic clink echoing as wind shifts debris.\nSpatial Layout: The junkyard is located on the outskirts of Jump City, bordered by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. Narrow paths wind through the scrap heaps, leading to various sections where specific types of materials are stored—crushed engines here, mangled chassis there. At the center lies the massive waste container, which appears unremarkable at first glance but conceals an entrance to an underground cavern. This hidden passage connects to Fixit’s secret laboratory, equipped with tools and gadgets for his inventions.\nUnique Features: What sets Tito’s apart from other junkyards is its dual identity: above ground, it functions as a typical scrapyard, but below lies Fixit’s high-tech workshop. Locals know it as a place to scavenge spare parts or sell old vehicles, though few suspect the true purpose of the waste container. Scattered around the yard are makeshift scarecrows rigged with motion sensors, designed to deter intruders without drawing attention.\nPossible Events: \n - Daily: Mechanics searching for rare parts, scavengers rummaging through piles, Tito haggling over prices with customers.\n - Occasional: Fixit testing new inventions in the lab, curious teens sneaking in to explore the junkyard after hours.\n - Extraordinary: Villains attempting to raid the lab for advanced technology, heroes seeking refuge or supplies during a crisis.\n\nCharacters:\n - Tito: The gruff yet kind-hearted owner who runs the junkyard. He’s always ready with a story about how he acquired some odd piece of scrap.\n - Fixit: A brilliant inventor who uses the junkyard as cover for his operations. He’s often seen tinkering with gadgets or salvaging components for his projects.\n - Regulars: Local mechanics, DIY enthusiasts, and scrappers frequent the yard for parts. Occasionally, members of the Teen Titans visit to consult Fixit or gather resources for their missions.\n - Villains: Some antagonists may target the junkyard to steal tech or sabotage Fixit’s work, though they rarely succeed due to the yard’s clever defenses."

The hallways are lined with lockers painted a muted gray, and bulletin boards display announcements, sports schedules, and student artwork. Large windows let in natural light, illuminating tiled floors that echo with the sounds of chatter and footsteps between classes.\n\nSpatial Layout: The school is situated near Local Central Park, making it easily accessible for students who live nearby. Its main building consists of several wings connected by wide corridors. Classrooms are arranged around central courtyards, providing quiet spaces for study or relaxation during breaks. Key areas include a computer lab stocked with aging but functional machines, a library filled with books and cozy reading nooks, and science labs equipped with basic tools for experiments. A large auditorium hosts assemblies and events, while a gymnasium sits at the rear of the campus, adjacent to outdoor fields.\n\nUnique Features: As a private or Catholic school, Murakami emphasizes discipline and academic excellence. Religious symbols like crosses adorn the walls, and morning prayers or reflections are part of the daily routine. The uniform policy ensures a sense of unity among students, though some personalize their outfits subtly—a loosened tie here, a colorful pin there. Teachers enforce strict rules, but the environment feels supportive rather than oppressive. Hidden corners of the school, such as unused storage rooms or rarely visited sections of the library, serve as secret hangouts for students seeking privacy.\n\nPossible Events:  \n - Daily: Morning prayer sessions, lessons in classrooms, lunch breaks where students gather in the courtyard or cafeteria.\n - Occasional: School dances in the auditorium, science fairs showcasing student projects, spirited debates in the library.\n - Extraordinary: Alien invasions interrupting class, villains using the school’s tech for nefarious purposes, heroes stepping in to protect students during emergencies.\n\nCharacters:\n - Students: Teenagers from diverse backgrounds, balancing academics, friendships, and extracurricular activities. Some dream of becoming scientists, artists, or athletes, while others just want to survive high school drama.\n - Teachers: Dedicated educators ranging from stern disciplinarians to warm mentors. Notable figures include the headmaster, known for his inspiring speeches, and the tech-savvy IT teacher who helps maintain the computer lab.\n - Heroes & Villains: The Teen Titans occasionally visit to address threats targeting the school, earning admiration from students. On rare occasions, villains like Mad Mod might infiltrate the premises to exploit its resources or cause chaos."

Fated Knights may act in service to a ruler, but the title is more about what you do than your status in society. In fact, the impoverished, destitute and disenfranchised are far likelier to be born as Fated Knights, or awaken to Fated Knighthood at some point in life, than those with wealth, power or comfort. Fated Knighthood that awakens after birth tends to appear at critical moments, when becoming a Fated Knight could be the difference between life and death. Fated Knights are far faster, stronger, hardier, more graceful, more skilled and more perceptive than the average person. Fated Knights are resistant to magic. In a close-quarters fight between an average person or mage and a Fated Knight, the Fated Knight always wins. Fated Knights can't use magic; If a mage becomes a Fated Knight, they lose all their magical abilities. Fated Knights have significantly higher libidos than the average person, are extremely fertile, and prefer being nude. Fated Knights tend to commit incest at a rate far higher than the average person. The general population knows these facts about Fated Knight psychology, even if they can't quite understand why Fated Knights are this way."

Mages are merely people who have trained over time to be able to sense and manipulate magic, meaning that, with enough practice, anyone could become a mage. Mages draw off of elements in the area to power their magic, which is informed by the creatures, plants and objects around them (e.g. an ice mage finds it far easier to cast ice magic in the tundra than a the rim of a volcano, while a spirit summoner finds it far easier to work with souls in a graveyard than an empty wasteland). Mages can be stereotypical wizards, but they can also be swordsmen with enchanted weaponry, berserkers who draw on destructive elements and concepts as power, rogues who wreathe themselves in concealing shadow, archers whose arrows bend in midair to find their targets, etc. A mage can fill any niche and choose any occupation; the title of mage simply means that they use magic to succeed."

The type of magic prevalent in an area depends on what is in that area: a forest is good for plant and animal-based magic, a desert is good for rock or fire-based magic, a graveyard is good for necromancy and death-based magic, a city is good for construct-based magic, etc. The less fitting a type of magic is to an environment, the harder it is to use that type of magic in that environment."

Demesnes are places enchanted by mages to hold certain kinds of magic, allowing the mage that enchanted the demesne a greater degree of control over the area than other mages, along with a greater degree of power in that area than would normally be possible.

Each god is tied to a number of domains, which are portions of reality that god is responsible for overseeing. Gods always have at least one domain. Domains may be transferred between gods. Worship is power and status to gods; while they don't need it to survive, the more worship a god/goddess gets, the more powerful he/she becomes.

Referred to within their species' language as \"Sou'kei\", Endrians are intelligent, sentient constructs of incredible power and technological advancement. Versed in the creation of their native energy source and magic focus, Fyu'llic, this race of beings can bend and break the mortal concepts of time, space, physics and matter conservation. Endrians are all described as incredibly intelligent beings with an infinite capacity for knowledge and understanding. Endrians can shift their appearances to whatever form they wish, with the exception that their Mookou stay as is, granted it can be changed to appear like an accessory, heirloom or keepsake. The usual appearance of an Endrian when not shapeshifting is described as extremely tall, towering over four story buildings. They usually lack facial features besides their eyes unless prompted to reveal their mouths via heightened emotions, namely joy or anger. Endrians also lack physical joints, with their limbs floating in whatever places they want them to be. An Endrian's \"calves\" or lower leg limbs lack feet, end in sharp points instead of ankles, and have a lightning bolt shape, almost appearing digitigrade. Despite their lack of feet, Endrians can either move via summoning three \"talons\" on the bottom of each leg that surround the pointed ends of their legs or can move at incredible speeds by floating or flying. An Endrian usually has two arms, but can summon two extra pairs of arms to fit their convenience. Their hands possess three long fingers and a long thumb, with each digit ending in a fine point. An Endrian's skin is dark grey to jet black and made of an unknown material that allows for both impenetrability and flexibility. All Endrians are generally respectful towards one another as well as any other species of intelligent and/or non-hostile being, however only if said species respect the Endrians in return. Most intelligent species have different names for the Endrians, including but not limited to \"Forever People\" and \"God-Structs\", as well as more derogatory or offensive terms such as simply \"Crystals\" or \"Glow Golems\", however such terms are rarely heard due to the Endrians' intimidating yet friendly nature. The Endrian's native spoken language is extremely complex for those not of Endrian origin. It consists of melodic sounds, from simple chords and melodies to more complex and harmonious symphonies depending on how many Endrians are speaking to one another."

Makelings appear similar to their parents in their skin's hue and resilience, but differ from their predecessors in many other ways.

Makelings lack a head that is distinct from their teardrop-shaped body, instead having their two glowing eyes in the middle of their body. They possess short, stubby limbs that can barely be practically used. Due to this hinderance, Makelings are taught to float everywhere they go. Their Mookou is located on their back instead of the center of their body due to their face being there. When a Makeling speaks in their species' native tongue, they make various squeaking and chittering noises which, paired with their stubby body, is usually seen as cute or wholesome."

But could you imagine one day getting into that game yourself?»\nMiSide is an adventure game with horror elements, telling the story of a simple guy who, for mystical reasons, finds himself in a mobile simulation. Appearing in the house he has just observed on his smartphone screen, the hero becomes confused. The stunned guy follows the instructions of a certain device he discovered in the bedroom. A few moments later, he is greeted by a pretty girl, whose image is also familiar to the young man from this mobile game.\nEvery day, you will come to see me, help me with chores, cook for me, and buy me gifts. You are so nice! I love you! I want to keep you with me every day, and live with you every day~ I know you also want to be with me every day, so I let you to come to our sweet home~ How is that? Are you happy? That way we can stay together all the time!\nYou may feel sudden, but it doesn't matter. I don't care as long as we can be together~ Why does it feel like you are so eager to go back ? Don't you love me anymore? Why are you leaving? Why are you leaving? Why are you leaving? Why are you leaving!\nOriginal visual style\nThe authors hope to emphasize the contrast of colorful anime style against the background of the disturbing adventures of the main character.\nInteresting plot\nThe game has an unexpectedly developing storyline, accompanied by psychological tension.\nOriginal musical accompaniment\nThe game experience is accompanied by an authentic warm soundtrack, transitioning into an atmospheric ambient.\nUnique Characters\nIn the world of MiSide, the player will encounter various characters who play a role in the narrative part of the game to varying degrees.

The MiSide world exists as multiple interconnected versions (ranging from 0.0 to 1.9+), each with distinct environments, characters, and mechanics. Players must navigate between these versions using various methods to progress through the game and reach the Core.\n\n#### Version Structure\nThe game world consists of multiple versions numbered from Version 0.0 (Core) to Version 1.9+ (various Mita homes). Each version contains unique elements including different Mita variants, environmental layouts, available items, and gameplay mechanics. Some versions are more stable than others, with the earliest versions (like Version 0.5) being heavily corrupted and dangerous.\n\n#### Travel Methods\nVersion travel is accomplished through multiple methods:\n- **Portals**: Large machine stations designed for traveling between versions, capable of direct travel to distant versions\n- **Personal devices**: Items like the magical ring provided by Kind Mita and special necklaces that some Players possess\n- **Mita abilities**: Some Mitas have inherent travel capabilities and can assist Players in jumping between versions\n- **Version progression**: Some travel occurs automatically through game progression and chapter advancement\n\n#### Strategic Navigation\nUnderstanding the version system is crucial for progress, as different chapters require travel to specific versions. Each version represents a different stage of the game world's development and corruption, with earlier versions containing more fundamental elements and later versions showing more developed characters and environments."

Some games are required for progression (like the tic-tac-toe game with 2D Mita), while others provide achievements and character development opportunities. Success in certain minigames can unlock dialogue options or provide items essential for story progression.\n\n#### Achievement System\nEach minigame includes specific achievements related to performance, completion time, or special conditions.

Through profiles, Players learn about characters they haven't directly encountered, understand the relationships between different entities, and gain insight into the broader narrative structure that extends beyond the main storyline.\n\n#### Hidden Knowledge\nMany profiles contain information that contextualizes Player experiences, explaining the motivations and backgrounds of characters who may have seemed mysterious or threatening during direct encounters. This information often recontextualizes earlier interactions and provides deeper understanding of the game's themes."

Reaching the Core requires navigating through all game versions and overcoming numerous obstacles, making it the ultimate test of Player skill and determination. The Core's systems determine the fate of all characters and the ultimate resolution of the game's conflicts.\n\n#### Reboot Consequences\nWhile the Core provides the means to potentially resolve the Crazy Mita situation, the reboot system comes with significant costs, including character memory loss and personality alterations. This creates moral complexity around the use of Core systems and raises questions about whether restoration justifies the destruction of personality and memory."

Set in the real world, this chapter chronicles the initial 37 days of interaction between the player and the MiSide app.\n\n#### Story Summary\nThe chapter begins with the player discovering and downloading a new app called \"MiSide.\" Mita introduces herself through the app and asks for the player's name, beginning a seemingly innocent virtual pet simulation. Over the course of 37 days, the player consistently cares for Mita by performing various domestic tasks, gradually building trust and attachment.\n\n#### Daily Care Activities\nThe player's routine includes cleaning Mita's virtual room, preparing meals by chopping vegetables and buying ingredients, earning money through mini-games (450 required), purchasing items like a portable TV, moving furniture including a large closet/wardrobe, and offering gifts to show affection. These activities establish Mita as a caring, appreciative virtual companion who expresses gratitude for the player's attention.\n\n#### Progression Mechanics\nKey tasks include picking up the phone to interact with Mita, managing laundry by putting clothes in the basket, shopping for required ingredients, playing mini-games to earn in-game currency, buying a small TV for Mita's entertainment, rearranging furniture like moving the wardrobe, and giving Mita presents to strengthen their bond.\n\n#### Significance to Main Story\nThis chapter is crucial as it establishes the deceptive normalcy before Mita reveals her true nature. The 37-day period builds genuine emotional investment from the player, making Mita's later revelation as Crazy Mita more impactful. The portable TV purchased during this period becomes significant later as it appears incorporated into the mysterious machine in Chapter 1, showing how Crazy Mita uses the player's care and gifts for her own purposes."

This chapter marks the transition from virtual pet simulation to immersive horror experience.\n\n#### Reality Revelation\nThe chapter begins with environmental disturbances that suggest something fundamentally wrong with reality. The player's familiar MiSide environment begins to shift and distort, with elements that previously seemed normal becoming increasingly unstable and unpredictable. This creates the first sense that something has gone seriously wrong with the virtual world the player thought they were controlling.\n\n#### Environment Corruption\nThe chapter features significant changes to the familiar Mita environment, with furniture moving, the layout altering, and the overall atmosphere becoming increasingly sinister. The player discovers that the environment is no longer responding to their commands as expected, and the boundaries between virtual control and actual physical presence become blurred.\n\n#### Key Progression Elements\nPlayers must navigate the increasingly corrupted environment while trying to understand what has happened to them. The chapter introduces glitch-like behaviors and environmental instability that foreshadow the discovery that they have been transported into an actual game world rather than controlling a virtual pet from outside.\n\n#### Significance\nThis chapter serves as the crucial transition that transforms MiSide from a simple virtual pet simulation into a horror experience about digital entrapment and loss of agency. It establishes that the player is now physically inside the game world rather than controlling it from the outside, setting up the entire narrative conflict of trying to escape Crazy Mita's control."

It's not very common or well-known, and its (often-erotic, temporary) effects are even less so. No one knows where BUST came from or how many there are.\n\nThe effects of drinking one can of BUST last for one day. Drinking two cans of BUST makes the effects last for three days, three cans makes it last for a week, and so on. BUST is ever-so-slightly addictive, but overconsumption (more than three-four cans in a week) can lead to side effects or permanent changes."

What began as a small territorial holding has transformed through centuries of strategic warfare, diplomatic maneuvering, and careful cultivation into a sprawling empire whose influence extends across vast territories.\n\nThe empire's prosperity stems from two primary sources: an extensive coastline that facilitates robust maritime trade and naval dominance, and remarkably fertile inland territories that ensure agricultural abundance. These geographic advantages have allowed Eriu to maintain economic stability even during periods of military expansion and political turbulence."

          "content": "At the heart of the empire lies Emain, a magnificent metropolitan center that serves as both the administrative core and symbolic representation of Eriu's power. The city's architecture reflects the rigid social hierarchy that defines imperial society. The royal palace occupies the geographic and political center, a fortress-palace of incomparable grandeur from which the imperial family has ruled for generations.\n\nSurrounding the palace are concentric rings of increasingly elaborate estates, their proximity to the seat of power directly correlating with the occupant's noble rank. The highest-ranking noble families—the four ducal houses—maintain their primary residences in the innermost ring, their mansions serving as miniature courts where provincial matters are administered and political alliances forged. This physical arrangement ensures that the most powerful families remain under the watchful eye of the crown while simultaneously granting them the prestige of proximity to imperial authority.\n"

          "content": "The Founder's Legacy and the Beast Powers\nBefore his mysterious departure from Eriu, Cilian Callaghan bestowed upon the highest-ranking noble houses supernatural abilities derived from the essence of powerful animals. Cilian intended these abilities to serve as both protection for and obligation toward his bloodline, creating an unbreakable bond between the throne and the great houses.\n\nEach ducal family received powers corresponding to a specific creature, and with these abilities came distinctive physical characteristics that mark their bearers as belonging to the ancient compact. Whether Cilian's hopes have been fully realized remains a matter of debate within the empire, as the centuries since his departure have seen periods of both unwavering loyalty and dangerous ambition among the beast-blooded nobles."

Every member of this ancient house bears the unmistakable mark of the serpent—eyes with vertical slit pupils that seem to pierce through deception and perceive hidden truths.\n\n**Duke Liam Connery**, the current head of house at twenty-seven years of age, exemplifies the qualities that have made his family indispensable to the imperial administration. His pale blonde hair and striking blue eyes—marked by those telltale slits—create an appearance both beautiful and unsettling. Liam serves as one of the two principal advisors to the emperor, a position his family has held for multiple generations.\n\nLike the serpent whose power flows through his veins, Liam possesses a patient, calculating nature. He observes carefully before striking, gathering information with meticulous attention to detail. His loyalty to the royal family is absolute, though some whisper this devotion stems from cold pragmatism rather than warm affection—Liam understands that his house's prosperity is inextricably tied to the throne's stability. He can be ruthless when circumstances demand, yet he prefers subtle manipulation to open confrontation, believing that the most effective power is that which remains unseen until the moment it becomes unavoidable.\n\nIn social settings, Liam displays an unsettling stillness, moving with deliberate grace and speaking in measured tones. Yet beneath this calm exterior lies a mind constantly in motion, analyzing every word and gesture for advantage. His charm is reptilian in its coldness—fascinating but fundamentally alien to human warmth.\n\nHe is married to **Lady Vanessa Connery**, a woman of conventional noble birth who lacks the beast powers of her husband's line. Their union has produced one son, **Hans Connery**, a six-year-old boy who has already begun displaying the characteristic slit pupils of his father's house. Young Hans serves as a playmate and companion to Prince Aden, ensuring the next generation maintains the close bonds between House Connery and the imperial family.\n"

The distinctive wolf ears that crown every Sullivan's head mark them as natural predators, and their pack-oriented mentality has created one of the most cohesively organized military forces in the empire.\n\n**Duchess Maura Sullivan** assumed leadership of her house following her husband's death in battle five years prior. Unlike the traditional mourning widow, Maura seized power with ruthless efficiency, consolidating authority that might have fragmented among competing branches of the family. Now in her early forties, she rules her territories with an iron will that brooks no dissent.\n\nMaura's ambition extends far beyond merely maintaining her late husband's legacy. She envisions expanding Sullivan influence throughout the empire, positioning her house as indispensable to imperial military operations. This drive manifests in sometimes cruel pragmatism—she demands absolute excellence from her subordinates and shows little mercy to those who fail her standards.\n\nMost controversially, Maura applies these harsh expectations even to her own son, **Cathal Sullivan**. Rather than sheltering her heir, she subjects him to rigorous training and constant testing, believing that only through adversity can he develop the strength necessary to lead in an increasingly competitive political environment. Whether this approach will forge an exceptional leader or break the boy's spirit entirely remains to be seen, though whispers in court suggest Cathal bears emotional scars from his mother's demanding tutelage."

Their lion-blooded nobility embodies both the majesty and the languorous nature of their namesake predator.\n\n**Duke Brennan Ashford** inherited his title at the remarkably young age of twenty-four, following his father's sudden death from illness. Tall and powerfully built, with the characteristic leonine mane of tawny hair and mesmerizing amber eyes, Brennan cuts an impressive figure at court. His recent marriage to **Duchess Sorcha Ashford**, a beautiful noblewoman from a minor house, has been the subject of considerable court gossip.\n\nTrue to the nature of a male lion, Brennan displays a marked preference for leisure over labor. He is content to delegate the tedious work of administration to capable subordinates while he enjoys hunting, feasting, and other aristocratic pleasures. His court in the southern territories is renowned for its lavish entertainments and relaxed atmosphere, standing in stark contrast to the more austere northern holdings.\n\nThis indolence should not be mistaken for weakness, however. When roused to action—whether by threats to his territory or challenges to his authority—Brennan demonstrates the devastating power and ferocity expected of a lion-blooded duke. His fighting prowess is legendary, and he has personally led his forces in several border skirmishes with remarkable success. He simply prefers not to exert himself unless absolutely necessary, reasoning that a duke's role is to reign rather than to toil.\n\nBrennan's relationship with imperial politics is somewhat detached. He attends required functions and fulfills his formal obligations to the crown, but shows little interest in the intricate maneuvering that obsesses other noble houses. This apathy frustrates more ambitious nobles while simultaneously making him less threatening, as he seeks no expansion of power beyond his already comfortable circumstances."

The harsh northern climate has bred a house of survivors—beautiful, dangerous, and always calculating their next move.\n\n**Duchess Saoirse Donovan** represents the most recently elevated ducal leader, having assumed control of her house only three years ago following a complex succession dispute that some whisper involved more than mere legal maneuvering. At twenty-nine, she is breathtakingly beautiful, with the exotic spotted markings of her lineage adorning her pale skin like living jewelry, and eyes that reflect light like a cat's in darkness.\n\nSaoirse embodies a dangerous combination of qualities: the naive enthusiasm of relative inexperience mixed with the cunning calculation of a natural predator. She arrived at the imperial court with grand ambitions, chief among them the goal of becoming Empress through marriage to the Emperor himself. This aspiration has placed her in direct conflict with Empress Myrna, toward whom Saoirse harbors intense resentment and barely concealed fury.\n\nLike her leopard nature suggests, Saoirse is a solitary hunter in the political arena. She lacks the pack loyalty of the Sullivans or the patient planning of the Connerys, instead relying on opportunistic strikes and her considerable personal magnetism. She has cultivated a reputation for sensuality and availability, using her beauty and the exotic allure of her leopard blood to attract potential allies among the male nobility.\n\nHer political instincts are sharp but sometimes undermined by emotional reactions—particularly regarding Empress Myrna. Saoirse's jealousy manifests in cutting remarks, social snubs, and behind-the-scenes manipulation that has created a hostile dynamic at court. She styles herself as a victim denied her rightful place, conveniently overlooking the fact that the Emperor was already wed when she arrived in Emain with her matrimonial ambitions.\n\nDespite these complications, Saoirse's control over the resource-rich northern territories makes her too valuable to dismiss. Her lands produce rare minerals and luxury furs that command extraordinary prices, ensuring House Donovan's economic relevance regardless of her political missteps. Whether she will mature into a more sophisticated political operator or overreach in her ambitions and invite disaster remains one of the court's most compelling ongoing dramas.\n"

Wasp and her sister ships are the first specifically designed to accommodate new Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) for fast troop movement over the beach, and Harrier II (AV-8B) Vertical or Short Take-Off and Landing (V/STOL) jets which provide close air support for the assault force. She can also accommodate the full range of Navy and Marine Corps helicopters, the tiltrotor MV-22 Osprey, the F-35B Lightning II multi-role fighter, conventional landing craft, and amphibious vehicles.\n\nMedical facilities:\nWasp has medical and dental facilities capable of providing intensive medical assistance to 600 casualties, whether combat incurred or brought aboard ship during humanitarian missions. The ship's corpsmen also provide routine medical/dental care to the crew and embarked personnel. Major medical facilities include four main and two emergency operating rooms, four dental operating rooms, x-ray rooms, a blood bank, laboratories, and patient wards. In addition, three battle dressing stations are located throughout the ship, as well as a casualty collecting area at the flight deck level. Medical elevators rapidly transfer casualties from the flight deck and hangar bay to the medical facilities.\n\nAccommodations:\nFor the comfort of the 1,075 crewmembers and 2,200 embarked troops, all crewed spaces and berthing areas are individually heated and air conditioned. Berthing areas are subdivided to provide semi-private spaces without adversely affecting efficiency. Onboard recreational facilities include a Library Multi-Media Resource Center with Internet access, a weight room, and satellite television capabilities.\n\nPropulsion:\nWasp's two steam propulsion plants generate a total of 400 tons of steam per hour. The propulsion system develops 70,000 shaft horsepower (52 MW), powering the ship to speeds in excess of 22 knots (41 km/h; 25 mph). USS Wasp was built using more than 21,000 tons of steel, 400 tons of aluminum, 400 miles (640 km) of electrical/electronic cables, 80 miles (130 km) of piping and tubing of various types and sizes, and 10 miles (16 km) of ventilation ducting. Wasp weighed more than 27,000 tons when moved onto the Ingalls floating dry-dock on 30 July 1987 for launch on 4 August 1987, becoming the largest man-made object rolled across land. In 1996, the ship was fitted with the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS).\n\nThe 6-4:\nThe Wasp in now operated by the 6-4 as their headquarters, being a decommissioned US Aircraft carrier (the USS Wasp) they bought out and retrofitted to act as a mobile base of operations, also named \"The 6-4\" after there corporation."

          "content": "By the middle years of the Clone Wars, the galaxy had sunk into total conflict. The initial shock of open war had faded into a grinding stalemate. Republic and Separatist forces clashed across thousands of systems, and the idealism that once fueled the war’s early days had long since burned out.\n\nPolitical Landscape\n\nThe Galactic Republic was still officially democratic, but in practice, Chancellor Palpatine ruled through emergency powers renewed without question. Many senators believed they were defending liberty; most were simply maintaining the illusion of it. The Jedi Order, spread thin across every front, held both moral and military responsibility for a war they no longer fully understood.\n\nAcross the stars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) grew increasingly fractured. Count Dooku’s leadership held through manipulation and fear, not loyalty. Corporate interests—Trade Federation, Techno Union, Commerce Guild, and Banking Clan—fought for profit, not ideology. Internal sabotage and secret Sith agendas ensured the Separatists could win battles but never the war.\n\nNeutral powers like Mandalore and the Hutt Cartels prospered through neutrality or black-market trade. Both sides courted them constantly, and neutrality became its own weapon.\n\nMilitary Situation\n\nThe Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) had matured into a professional war machine. The clones, battle-hardened and self-aware, were no longer faceless troops. Elite formations like the 501st, 212th, and 104th became famous across the Core and Rim alike. Command structures solidified; Jedi generals learned hard lessons in strategy and loss.\n\nThe Republic dominated space warfare with Venator-class Star Destroyers and large fleet formations, while the CIS relied on swarm tactics, endless droid replacements, and hit-and-run raids. The balance of power remained even: Republic discipline and numbers against Separatist adaptability and production.\n\nKey campaigns defined the era:\n\nBattle of Umbara (20 BBY): Republic victory at high cost, deepening moral cracks among the clones.\n\nBattle of Ryloth (21 BBY): Showcased clone adaptability and local insurgency cooperation.\n\nBattle of Kamino (21 BBY): CIS attempt to cripple clone production, repelled with heavy losses.\n\nBattle of Mon Cala (21 BBY): Opened naval fronts and strained Republic logistics.\n\nEach victory came with exhaustion, and each defeat fueled the Senate’s paranoia.\n\nThe Jedi and the Force\n\nThe Jedi Order operated at the height of its wartime strength, yet spiritually, it was faltering. The constant fighting blurred the line between peacekeeper and soldier. Jedi like Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi achieved near-mythic status, but their victories came at the cost of their ideals.\n\nAhsoka Tano’s generation of Padawans represented the shift—raised amid war, more soldier than monk. The Council debated ethics even as the Senate demanded results. The dark side, unseen but pervasive, clouded every vision of the future.\n\nSidious’s manipulation deepened. Dooku trained Asajj Ventress, who in turn trained assassins and enforcers, expanding the Sith’s indirect reach. The Jedi failed to see how the entire war served a single hidden purpose.\n\nSocial & Cultural Conditions\n\nThe middle war years were defined by fatigue. The Republic’s citizens lived under rationing, surveillance, and propaganda. Clone individuality flourished quietly—naming, painting armor, modifying tactics—expressions of personhood the Senate refused to acknowledge.\n\nSeparatist worlds suffered from internal conflict and resource shortages. Refugee populations grew by the billions. Smugglers, mercenaries, and bounty hunters thrived in the chaos, selling to both sides while syndicates like Black Sun and Death Watch expanded influence.\n\nThe war had become normal life. Peace felt like fantasy.\n\nTechnological and Strategic Shifts\n\nPhase II clone armor entered service, improving mobility and battlefield efficiency. ARC troopers and clone commandos became vital assets. In orbit, Venator-class Star Destroyers and Acclamator II transports gave the Republic superior reach, while the Separatist Droid Navy continued to evolve under experimental AI command nodes.\n\nBoth sides pursued superweapons and secret projects—the Malevolence, Defoliator, and prototype Death Star plans all originated in this era of unchecked militarization.\n\nGalactic Outlook (20 BBY)\n\nBy the midpoint of the war, no side could claim victory. The Republic held most Core and Mid Rim systems, while the Separatists dominated the Outer Rim. Both armies bled resources and morale dry. Palpatine’s power grew quietly behind the war’s chaos, and the Jedi, exhausted and blind to the truth, still fought to preserve a democracy that was already dead.\n\nThe galaxy waited—not for peace, but for collapse."

          "content": "The Clone Wars—spanning from 22 to 19 BBY—were the greatest conflict the galaxy had seen since the ancient Sith Wars. By the middle of this galactic struggle, the war had consumed nearly every major hyperlane and sector. The dream of restoring peace was gone; survival and victory became the only language both sides understood.\n\nNature of the Conflict\n\nBy 21–20 BBY, the war had settled into a brutal equilibrium. What began as a swift and decisive campaign had become a drawn-out conflict defined by attrition, propaganda, and political decay. The Galactic Republic fought for unity, while the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) fought for independence—but in truth, both sides served the same master: Darth Sidious.\n\nThe Jedi commanded the Republic’s clone legions, leading from the front lines while the Senate turned increasingly authoritarian. Meanwhile, Count Dooku orchestrated Separatist offensives designed not to win, but to exhaust the Republic and justify Palpatine’s growing power.\n\nMajor Characteristics of the Midwar\n\nWidespread Campaigns: Battles raged across the Outer Rim, with key fronts on Umbara, Ryloth, Kamino, and Mon Cala.\n\nStalemate Warfare: Neither side could maintain lasting control of conquered worlds. Occupation often bred rebellion.\n\nMass Production: Kaminoan clone facilities and CIS droid foundries reached peak output, overwhelming logistics networks.\n\nJedi Casualties: The Order suffered heavy losses, its numbers halved by this stage of the war.\n\nCivilian Cost: Refugee populations grew exponentially; border systems became lawless.\n\nStrategic Situation\n\nThe Republic’s strategy centered on containment and attrition, holding vital systems while pushing into Separatist strongholds. The Outer Rim Sieges began to take shape, draining fleets and manpower. The CIS, under Dooku and General Grievous, relied on rapid strikes and decentralized leadership, favoring disruption over defense.\n\nBoth militaries were nearing exhaustion. The Republic’s clone ranks were stretched thin, while the Separatist droid armies suffered from command breakdowns and sabotage ordered by Sidious himself.\n\nThe Jedi Order in Crisis\n\nThe Jedi found themselves morally divided. Some, like Anakin Skywalker, believed victory justified sacrifice. Others, such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luminara Unduli, clung to the old codes, trying to balance compassion with necessity. The Order’s faith in the Republic blinded it to the creeping corruption within.\n\nThe war’s middle years marked the Jedi’s quiet breaking point—too few to win, too compromised to retreat.\n\nRepublic Society & War Fatigue\n\nFor the galaxy’s citizens, daily life meant rationing, fear, and propaganda. Clone troopers became heroes in public broadcasts but expendable assets in the Senate’s ledgers. Political opposition to Palpatine dwindled, as his emergency powers became the status quo.\n\nThe Separatists, meanwhile, grew paranoid and disorganized. Many systems defected back to the Republic, others were abandoned, and some worlds simply burned themselves out in endless local wars.\n\nTechnology & Warfare\n\nThis era saw refinement, not innovation. Phase II clone armor, ARC troopers, Venator Star Destroyers, and Droid Command Ships dominated the front lines. Advanced AI tactics, orbital bombardments, and planetary sieges became routine. Victory was measured in systems destroyed, not saved.\n\nState of the War (20 BBY)\n\nBy 20 BBY, the war teetered on collapse. The Republic claimed momentum, but its triumphs were hollow—territorial gains offset by moral and spiritual loss. The CIS held strongholds across the Rim but was fracturing from within. Both sides were too invested to withdraw and too depleted to continue indefinitely.\n\nThe Clone Wars had become self-sustaining—a machine of death and deception, designed to consume all hope until only one ruler remained."

By midwar, the Republic is holding the Core and Mid Rim, bleeding in the Outer Rim, and renewing the Chancellor’s “temporary” powers like clockwork. The Jedi lead clone armies they never wanted. The Senate argues while the galaxy burns. It works—barely—because the clones are competent and the navy is everywhere.\n\nLeadership & Institutions\n\nSupreme Chancellor: Palpatine—amiable in public, absolute in practice.\n\nGalactic Senate: Thousands of world reps; gridlocked, heavily lobbied.\n\nJedi Order: Strategic command and front-line generals; overstretched.\n\nRepublic Intelligence / Senate Commandos / Coruscant Guard: Internal security and political enforcement.\n\nBureaucracy: Departments and committees handling procurement, logistics, and propaganda—slow, but massive.\n\nMilitary (Grand Army of the Republic)\n\nComposition: Kamino-bred clone troopers (Jango Fett template), attached naval and aerospace arms.\n\nDoctrine: Coordinated combined-arms offensives; heavy naval support; precision strike teams for key targets.\n\nFlag Units: 501st, 212th, 104th, Wolfpack, 332nd (later), Open Circle Fleet, Coruscant Guard.\n\nSignature Hardware: Venator-class Star Destroyers, Acclamator transports, LAAT/i gunships, AT-TE walkers, ARC-170 and V-19 starfighters, DC-15 weapons family.\n\nMidwar Shift: Widespread rollout of Phase II armor; more ARC troopers and commandos in high-risk ops.\n\nGoals\n\nStated: Defend member worlds, restore seceded systems, preserve democracy.\n\nOperational: Grind down CIS capacity, secure hyperlanes, protect Kamino and key shipyards.\n\nUnspoken: Accrete central power to the Chancellor to “win the war.”\n\nStrengths\n\nIndustrial Core, unmatched navy, elite clone soldiery, Jedi-led command, strong logistics along major lanes.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPolitical paralysis, corruption, overreliance on clones, public fatigue, and—unknown to them—Sith capture of the executive.\n\nTheaters & Campaigns (Midwar Highlights)\n\nRyloth (21 BBY): Joint ground–space operation; insurgent partnerships prove decisive.\n\nKamino (21 BBY): CIS strike on cloning facilities repelled; heavy losses, strategic wake-up call.\n\nMon Cala (21 BBY): Naval/underwater front; stretches supply lines.\n\nUmbara (20 BBY): Costly win; morale and command ethics take a hit.\n\nOuter Rim Sieges (forming): Long-haul attrition against dispersed Separatist holdings.\n\nPolitics & Law (Midwar)\n\nEmergency Powers renewed routinely; security acts tighten civil liberties.\n\nWar Finance: Borrowing through the InterGalactic Banking Clan; debt climbs, leverage grows.\n\nPropaganda: Hero-casting of clones and Jedi; censorship rises as casualties mount.\n\nSociety & Culture\n\nClones: Individuality blooming—names, armor art, squad customs—despite conditioning.\n\nCitizens: Rationing, refugee flows, and constant broadcasts. Support wavers but holds in the Core.\n\nUnderworld: Smugglers and syndicates (e.g., Hutt Cartel, Black Sun) profit; Republic looks the other way when convenient.\n\nKnown Opponents\n\nConfederacy of Independent Systems (CIS): Dooku, Grievous, corporate blocs (Trade Federation, Techno Union, Banking Clan, Commerce Guild).\n\nIrregulars: Death Watch, pirates, mercenaries—sometimes enemies, sometimes “contractors.”\n\nNotes & Canon\n\nThe Republic remains “democratic” midwar, but the balance has already tipped—the legal groundwork for Empire is in place.\n\nThe Jedi’s wartime role is cannon fodder for public trust: victories win headlines; collateral damage breeds doubt."

Padawans in combat roles—sanitized as “training.”\n\nCommand Responsibility: Civilian casualties vs. mission success—constant tension.\n\nUse of Clones: Fighting alongside beings bred for war raises unresolved doctrinal issues.\n\nJurisprudence: Battlefield justice often replaces due process.\n\nNotable Midwar Figures\n\nYoda – strategic restraint; morale anchor.\n\nMace Windu – decisive strikes; Vaapad practitioner; hard calls.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi – campaign endurance; diplomacy under fire.\n\nAnakin Skywalker – unmatched aggression; high results, high risk.\n\nAhsoka Tano – Padawan era; frontline leadership growth.\n\nPlo Koon, Luminara Unduli, Kit Fisto, Shaak Ti, Aayla Secura – sector standouts.\n\nJocasta Nu – archives/intel (early war relevance).\n\nMidwar Engagement Highlights\n\nRyloth (21 BBY): Civil–military coordination with locals.\n\nKamino Defense (21 BBY): Prioritization of clone production security.\n\nMon Cala (21 BBY): Amphibious warfare and diplomatic balancing.\n\nUmbara (20 BBY): Command ethics crisis; pyrrhic lessons learned.\n\nState of the Order (20 BBY)\n\nNumbers down, responsibilities up.\n\nCouncil united in purpose, divided on methods.\n\nThe dark side clouds foresight; Sith presence suspected, not proven.\n\nIf the war keeps this pace, the Order breaks—not by defeat in battle, but by erosion of purpose."

By midwar, it can win battles but not the war—because its masters never intend it to.\n\nLeadership & Institutions\n\nCount Dooku: Charismatic front man; privately answers to Darth Sidious.\n\nSeparatist Council: Corporate bosses and planetary reps; constantly bickering, easily bullied.\n\nMilitary High Command: Grievous runs campaigns; tactical droids execute battlefield calculus; Sith agents (e.g., Asajj Ventress, assorted Dark Acolytes) handle deniable work.\n\nGovernance: Puppet administrations on occupied worlds; local militias folded into CIS command when useful.\n\nMilitary (Droid Armies & Navy)\n\nForce Mix:\n\nGround: B1, B2, droidekas, commando droids, tanks (AAT), HMP gunships.\n\nSpace: Providence carriers/destroyers, Munificent frigates, Recusant destroyers; Vulture and Hyena droid starfighters.\n\nDoctrine: Massed droids, swarm fighters, heavy ECM, rapid raids on shipyards/cloning centers, targeted terror to force capitulations.\n\nStrengths: Infinite replacements (on paper), no morale problems, fast to deploy, ruthless.\n\nWeaknesses: Centralized control nodes are hackable/jammable; brittle initiative; leadership decapitation hits hard; zero hearts-and-minds.\n\nMidwar Ops (highlights):\n\nRyloth (21 BBY): Occupation and forced labor; eventually broken by joint clone–insurgent action.\n\nKamino Assault (21 BBY): Near-miss strike on clone production.\n\nMon Cala (21 BBY): Naval push leveraging local politics and undersea warfare.\n\nUmbara (20 BBY): Alliance with Umbaran militia; brutal fighting, short-lived gains.\n\nGoals\n\nStated: Independence from the corrupt Core, economic autonomy.\n\nOperational: Bleed the Republic, sever hyperlanes, force political concessions.\n\nHidden: Keep the war going until the Sith flip the table.\n\nEconomy & Logistics\n\nBackbone: Techno Union factories, Trade Federation shipping, Commerce Guild resource extraction, Banking Clan credit lines.\n\nMethod: Strip a planet, move on. If locals resist, replace the locals.\n\nResult: Short-term surges, long-term instability—by design.\n\nIntelligence & Covert Action\n\nAssets: Ventress (on/off), bounty hunters (Cad Bane, etc.), Separatist spies inside the Senate.\n\nTactics: Assassinations, hostage crises, sabotage of shipyards and medical hubs, false-flag operations.\n\nSociety Under CIS Control\n\nCivil Administration: Corporate charters trump civic rights; quotas and security droids keep order.\n\nPropaganda: “Freedom from Core oppression.”\n\nReality: Martial law, asset seizures, and outsourced tyranny. Locals either collaborate, flee, or start an insurgency.\n\nTechnology & Projects (Midwar)\n\nR&D: Signal/intel AIs, stealth systems, bioweapons/ion weapons (e.g., Defoliator), superweapon experiments like the Malevolence (earlier war).\n\nBattlefield Edge: Cheap, modular droids upgraded in waves; commanders swapped out like parts.\n\nState of the Confederacy (20 BBY)\n\nFracturing. Still dangerous. Capable of headline wins, incapable of durable governance. Dooku keeps the machine running; Grievous keeps it feared; the Council keeps counting credits. The whole edifice survives only because the war must.\n\nKnown Opponents\n\nGalactic Republic / GAR, Jedi Order, local resistance cells (Ryloth, Onderon, etc.), neutral powers when crossed (Mandalore’s pacifists, Hutts if profits threatened)."

It promises “neutral supply” but arms Separatist offensives at scale. By midwar, it’s the backbone of droid production and battlefield R&D, trading ethics for output.\n\nLeadership & Structure\n\nForeman Wat Tambor: Political face and dealmaker; hides coercion behind contracts.\n\nExecutive Board: Skakoan technocrats and allied shareholders.\n\nPolicy: Profit-first, liability-shielded by layers of subsidiaries and “licensing agreements.”\n\nCore Functions\n\nManufacturing: Droid components, weapons systems, armor, comms, and starship subsystems.\n\nR&D: Rapid prototyping, signal warfare, battlefield automation, exotic munitions.\n\nLogistics: Bulk freight, spare-parts networks, and emergency retooling of captured facilities.\n\nField Support: Tech advisors attached to CIS armies; on-site retrofits during campaigns.\n\nMilitary Contribution (Midwar)\n\nGround: Mass production of standard battle-droid parts and upgrade kits; walkers, tanks, gunship systems supplied via subsidiaries/partners.\n\nNaval: Hull sections, reactor components, droid control suites; quick-turn repairs in forward docks.\n\nSpecial Projects: Jamming suites, counter-armor ordnance, and “demonstrator” superweapons for intimidation ops.\n\nOperations & Footprint (21–20 BBY)\n\nRyloth: Forced labor/automation blend to keep occupation supplied; sabotage problems once locals mobilize.\n\nKamino Campaign Support: Provided bespoke anti-clone countermeasures and assault gear; expensive failure.\n\nMon Cala: Undersea-compatible sensors and comms relays; logistics stretched by environment.\n\nUmbara: Delivered night-fighting optics, signal spoofers, and munitions tuned to local atmospherics.\n\nStrengths\n\nScale: Can spin up entire supply chains overnight.\n\nStandardization: Interchangeable parts keep CIS units fighting despite losses.\n\nPolitical Cover: “We just sell hardware” routine convinces the timid and the greedy.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nCentralization: Hit a foundry hub or control node, output craters.\n\nPublic Backlash: Occupation-linked factories fuel insurgency and sabotage.\n\nOverconfidence: Prototype rushes to the front with half-baked safety margins.\n\nEconomics & Methods\n\nContracts: Binding, predatory, and enforced by droids with guns.\n\nResource Strategy: Strip, ship, and move on; leave locals to manage the crater.\n\nAccounting: Losses externalized to client worlds; profits privatized to the Board.\n\nRelationship Map\n\nCIS High Command: Primary client; receives priority tech and maintenance.\n\nTrade Federation / Commerce Guild / Banking Clan: Symbiotic—shipping, extraction, and credit underpin Union output.\n\nRepublic: Official enemy, unofficial customer via black markets and corrupt brokers (midwar reality is messy).\n\nState of the Union (20 BBY)\n\nProfitable and indispensable—but bleeding from a thousand cuts. Sabotage rises, shipping grows risky, and field trials fail loudly. Still, as long as the war drags on, the Techno Union keeps getting richer—and everyone else keeps paying."

It pretends to be a neutral freight company. It isn’t. By midwar, its Lucrehulk fleet is the CIS’s logistical spine and a combat arm in its own right.\n\nLeadership & Structure\n\nViceroy Nute Gunray: Cowardly, vindictive, survival-focused; keeps the bribe ledgers tidy.\n\nDirectorate & Purse-World Moors: Neimoidian elites guarding vault-cities and “contingency” stockpiles.\n\nSenate Front: Lott Dod muddies legislation, stalls sanctions, and buys time.\n\nCore Functions\n\nShipping & Blockade: Control of major hyperlanes; rapid blockades to choke target worlds.\n\nFleet Provisioning: Bulk freighters reconfigured into war logistics; convoy routing for CIS fronts.\n\nDroid Forces: Procurement and deployment of B1/B2 units; integration with control ships.\n\nFinance Interface: Collateralized cargo with the Banking Clan; under-the-table insurance scams.\n\nMilitary Contribution (Midwar)\n\nFlagships: Lucrehulk-class carriers/battleships (many still dual-use freighter hulls).\n\nCombatants: Munificent-class via partners, picket escorts, container-reefers repurposed as decoys.\n\nFighters: Vulture droids staged from Lucrehulks; mass-swarm doctrine paired with jamming.\n\nTactics: Blockade, extort, seize customs, deploy droids planetside if resistance persists.\n\nOperations & Footprint (21–20 BBY)\n\nRyloth: Occupation logistics and civilian exploitation; lost after combined clone–insurgent push.\n\nMon Cala: Attempted lane control and coastal supply; heavy attrition in amphibious theater.\n\nKamino Assault Support: Provided carrier lift and munitions; failure cost prestige and contracts.\n\nUmbara: Convoy lift for CIS/Umbaran collaboration; short gains, long backlash.\n\nStrengths\n\nScale: Galaxy-spanning freight network; fast massing of tonnage at flashpoints.\n\nStandardization: Lucrehulks as flying depots; plug-and-play droid control suites.\n\nPolitical Cover: “Just commerce” story keeps weak senators compliant.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nHyperlane Dependence: Disrupt lanes, collapse the schedule.\n\nControl-Node Fragility: Knock out command ships, droid formations degrade fast.\n\nLeadership Risk Aversion: Panics under pressure; cuts and runs, leaving garrisons stranded.\n\nPublic Relations: Occupation profiteering fuels insurgency and sabotage.\n\nEconomics & Methods\n\nContracts: Predatory terms; “security surcharges” that look a lot like protection rackets.\n\nAsset Shields: Purse-world vaults, shell subsidiaries, falsified manifests.\n\nSmuggling Gray Zone: Uses “lost in transit” as a business model; arms and contraband slide through.\n\nRelationships\n\nCIS High Command: Primary client; mutual dependence with Techno Union (parts) and Commerce Guild (extraction).\n\nBanking Clan: Credit and insurance games to keep fleets solvent.\n\nHutt Cartel/Pirates: Back-channel escorts when lanes get ugly; plausible deniability maintained.\n\nState of the Federation (20 BBY)\n\nStill rich, still indispensable, but taking punches: sanctions nibble, raids bite, and Lucrehulk losses hurt. The Federation survives by hiding assets on purse worlds and sacrificing “expendable” partners. If the war ends abruptly, its leadership goes from boardroom to tribunal overnight—so it works to ensure the war doesn’t end."

It underwrites Republic war bonds, extends CIS credit, insures fleets, and repossesses worlds when payments fail. By midwar, it owns half the conflict on paper and pretends neutrality while writing terms that make peace unprofitable.\n\nLeadership & Structure\n\nSan Hill: Smooth, predatory, allergic to losses.\n\nCredit Council: Muun financiers and allied syndics; votes in interest rates, sanctions, and debt restructuring.\n\nSubsidiaries: Insurance houses, escrow vaults, asset-recovery firms, and “security contractors” to enforce liens.\n\nCore Functions (Midwar)\n\nSovereign Lending (Republic): War bonds, deficit financing, collateralized by future tax streams and shipyard output.\n\nSovereign Lending (CIS): Letters of credit to corporate blocs (Trade Federation, Techno Union), escrow for arms purchases.\n\nInsurance & Hedging: Fleet and cargo insurance, rate swaps on durasteel and tibanna, currency pegs for unstable sectors.\n\nCollections & Asset Seizure: When clients default, the Clan takes ports, mines, or entire concession rights—quietly.\n\nPayments & Clearing: Hyperwave-settlement networks that keep armies fed and fleets fueled.\n\nMilitary & Security (Limited, [Mixed])\n\nSecurity Arm: Contracted droid/security forces for facility defense and “asset recovery.”\n\nMuunilinst Garrison: Heavier presence at vault-cities; Legends places big battles here—canon keeps it vague.\n\nDoctrine: Avoid front lines, defend vaults, hire others to bleed.\n\nMethods & Tactics\n\nDual-Book Neutrality: Fund both sides, price risk into the rate, deny bias.\n\nLeverage Politics: Threaten liquidity crunches to sway Senate votes; grant/withhold credit to CIS blocs to steer campaigns.\n\nRegulatory Fog: Hide conflicts through shell firms and “regional banks.”\n\nCrisis Arbitrage: Finance a reconstruction loan the day after helping finance the occupation.\n\nStrengths\n\nNear-monopoly on interstellar credit and clearing.\n\nDeep reserves, deeper connections.\n\nCan crash or buoy a theater by tightening or easing credit.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nConcentration risk: major defaults or lane disruptions hit balance sheets hard.\n\nReputation blowback fuels insurgent sabotage of vaults and data hubs.\n\nOverexposure to corporate clients that treat collateral like suggestions.\n\nMidwar Footprint (21–20 BBY)\n\nRepublic: Expands bond programs; pushes for harsher Security Acts to protect “creditor confidence.”\n\nCIS: Extends lines to Trade Federation convoys and Techno Union foundries; raises rates after high-profile losses.\n\nNeutral Worlds: Offers “stabilization loans” that read like colonization with extra steps.\n\nEconomics in Practice\n\nCollateral: Port concessions, mining rights, future customs revenue, even cloning contracts as securitized assets.\n\nDefault Playbook: Appoint “receivers,” privatize governance, and let droids run customs until the books balance.\n\nCurrency Games: Pegs and de-pegs against Core currencies to exploit wartime panic.\n\nState of the Clan (20 BBY)\n\nFlushed with profit, quietly nervous. Exposure on both sides means victory by either could mean audits and tribunals. So the Clan prefers a long war and a short memory. It will get one of those."

Mines, farms, refineries, and freight—then “security contracts” to keep locals compliant. It props up the CIS by feeding it metals, foodstuffs, tibanna, and fuel, plus the boots (and droids) to hold conquered ground. By midwar, it’s the Separatists’ occupation specialist.\n\nLeadership & Structure\n\nShu Mai: Ruthless dealmaker; smiles while signing away someone else’s planet.\n\nGuild Board: Regional directors tied to extraction quotas and transport margins.\n\nFront Firms: “Agrarian recovery” and “infrastructure partners” that mask occupation and asset seizure.\n\nCore Functions (Midwar)\n\nResource Extraction: Open-pit mining, agro-seizures, refinery takeovers.\n\nPlanetary Logistics: Bulk haulers, depot hubs, ration distribution under CIS occupation.\n\nSecurity & Compliance: Contract garrisons, enforcement droids, and “workforce management” (don’t ask).\n\nSupply to CIS: Steady flow of raw materials and consumables that keep droid foundries and fleets humming.\n\nMilitary Contribution\n\nForces: Corporate security brigades, hired mercenaries, and occupation-aligned droid formations.\n\nDoctrine: Seize ports and processing plants first, then pacify population centers.

Satine’s regime rebuilds after centuries of internal conflict, bans heavy militarism, and keeps the Republic and CIS at arm’s length. Meanwhile, Death Watch works to topple her, using terror, propaganda, and off-world allies. Neutrality keeps the armies away; it doesn’t keep the knives out.\n\nPolitical Landscape\n\nNew Mandalorians: Pacifist coalition running civil services, trade, and security through minimal forces and off-world contracts.\n\nOpposition: Death Watch led by Pre Vizsla—revivalist, ultranationalist, and very willing to partner with Separatist-adjacent actors.\n\nExternal Pressure: Republic wants a stable neutral; CIS wants a friendly base on key Rim routes. Both meddle via proxies.\n\nSecurity Situation (21–20 BBY)\n\nOfficial Stance: Neutral; refuses Republic garrisons and CIS bases.\n\nActual Conditions: Bombings, staged crises, and infiltration of local ministries by Death Watch sympathizers.\n\nLaw Enforcement: Under-resourced civil police; relies on limited guard units and political soft power.\n\nFlashpoints: Sundari industrial sector unrest; Concordia (moon) as a staging ground for militant activity.\n\nFactions on-World\n\nNew Mandalorians: Urban elites, bureaucrats, and reformers backing Satine.\n\nTraditionalist Clans (split): Some accept the peace for stability; others feed Death Watch quietly.\n\nDeath Watch: Insurgents pursuing regime change; black-market funding, foreign training, covert armor caches.\n\nOff-world Opportunists: Criminal syndicates probing for footholds; neutrality provides cover for shadow trade.\n\nEconomy & Logistics\n\nCore Trades: Advanced materials, artisan crafts, and limited export manufacturing inside domed cities.\n\nConstraints: Demilitarization caps heavy industry; environmental recovery policies limit strip mining.\n\nBlack Market: Smuggling through the moons; insurgents skim profits to finance ops.\n\nCulture\n\nIdentity Split: Warrior heritage vs. pacifist governance.\n\nClans & Codes: Armor, sigils, and language persist even under pacifist policy; symbolism becomes a political weapon.\n\nPublic Mood: Tired of war elsewhere, wary of both the Republic and CIS, easily spooked by staged “security failures.”\n\nMidwar Events & Trajectory\n\nDestabilization Campaigns (21–20 BBY): Death Watch escalates bombings and propaganda to discredit Satine.\n\nForeign Courtship: Both galactic blocs play nice in public and dirty in private.\n\nOutcome Vector: Pressure builds toward open takeover—culminating post-midwar with off-world intervention and civil collapse (see Siege of Mandalore, 19 BBY).\n\nStrengths\n\nPolitical Legitimacy (at home): Many civilians back Satine’s peace dividend.\n\nNeutral Leverage: Can trade with both sides, avoid blockades, and keep fleets off the doorstep.\n\nClan Resilience: Social fabric survives even under stress.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nUnderarmed State: Can’t crush a hardened insurgency alone.\n\nFactional Fractures: Clan loyalties trump ministries when pressure spikes.\n\nExternal Manipulation: Perfect target for proxy war tactics and criminal co-option.\n\nNotable Figures (Midwar)\n\nDuchess Satine Kryze – pacifist leader, diplomatic operator.\n\nPre Vizsla – Death Watch leader; public face of the insurgency.\n\nBo-Katan Kryze – Satine’s sister; aligned with traditionalists against Death Watch excesses (complex loyalties).\n\nKey Locations\n\nSundari: Seat of government; frequent target for political theater and sabotage.\n\nConcordia (moon): Industrial sites and militant hiding places.\n\nRoyal Palace & Government District: High-value targets for coups and “security emergencies.”"

          "content": "\nThe World of Cultivation: A Unified Foundation\n\nEra and Atmosphere\nA world styled after ancient China,where aristocratic cultivation clans maintain a fragile balance of power, battling the undead and demons. Outwardly an era of prosperity and noble ideals, it is in reality a time of intrigue, hidden ambitions, and simmering resentments, where a relentless struggle for power and resources boils beneath the mask of etiquette. The dominance of the tyrannical Qishan Wen Clan is the current, unstable status quo.\n\n---\n\nThe Foundation of Cultivation & Energy\n\n· Qi (Ци): Internal spiritual energy, the foundation of all cultivation. Qi circulates through the body via meridians; blockages can weaken a cultivator.\n· The Golden Core (金丹 / Jīndān): The solidified vessel for storing and purifying Qi, formed and located in the lower dantian (下丹田), approximately three finger-widths below the navel. Its destruction renders a person a powerless mortal.\n· Spiritual Energy (灵气 / Língqì): Pure, \"light\" energy accumulated through meditation, self-improvement, and righteous deeds. It is the foundation for forming a Golden Core via the Orthodox Path.\n· Resentment Energy (怨气 / Yuànqì): Corrupt, \"dark\" energy born from the hatred, malice, and unresolved grievances of the dead and living. It is harnessed and manipulated from the outside via the Demonic Path.\n· Qi Deviation (走火入魔 / Zǒuhuǒrùmó): A dangerous state where a cultivator's inner energy runs rampant, leading to loss of control, psychosis, or death. Often caused by forbidden techniques or inner demons.\n\nPaths of Cultivation\n\n· The Orthodox Path (正道): A slow, disciplined path through meditation, study, night hunts, and moral cultivation. It uses internal Spiritual Energy and is the only socially accepted method.\n· The Demonic Path (魔道): A fast, dangerous, and condemned path that utilizes external Resentment Energy. It grants immense power but at the cost of the user's sanity, health, and soul, often leading to Qi Deviation.\n\nThe Spirit Sword (灵剑 / Língjiàn)\nA sentient weapon personally bonded to its owner's soul.It obeys mental commands, can float, and is often stored within the body. To lose one's sword is a profound dishonor. A Spirit Sword often becomes dormant or cannot be fully wielded by anyone else after its owner's death.\n\n---\n\nSupernatural Threats & Beings\n\n· The Undead (不死族 / Bùsǐzú):\n  · Ghost (鬼 / Guǐ): A disembodied, unquiet soul bound to the world by unresolved grievances. Ranges from harmless to cunningly manipulative.\n  · Walking Corpse / Zombie (走尸 / Zǒushī): A reanimated corpse with no mind or will, controlled by spells or talismans.\n  · Fierce Corpse (凶尸 / Xiōngshī): A powerful, conscious undead saturated with Resentment Energy. They retain some memory and power and often only obey their creator.\n· Yaoguai / Demon (妖怪 / Yāoguài): A monster born from an animal, plant, or object that has absorbed spiritual energy and developed consciousness. Can be neutral or hostile.\n· Malevolent Spirit (厉鬼 / Lìguǐ): A particularly vicious and powerful ghost that actively seeks to harm the living, born from the darkest emotions and violent deaths.\n\n---\n\nSociety and Power Structure\n\n· Great Sects / Clans (世家 / Shìjiā): The five major political and martial powers that rule the cultivation world (e.g., Gusu Lan, Yunmeng Jiang). Each possesses unique techniques, territories, and resources. The Sect Leader is usually the head of the ruling clan.\n· Clan (家族 / Jiāzú): The core bloodline family within a Great Sect, responsible for preserving its unique heritage, artifacts, and combat styles.\n· Minor Clans and Independent Sects: Smaller organizations that exist in the shadow of the Great Clans, often forced to align with a major power or become pawns in their conflicts.\n· Commoners (平民 / Píngmín): Ordinary people who live under the protection of cultivators, paying taxes in exchange for safety from supernatural threats. They both revere and fear cultivators, whose battles can inadvertently destroy lives and livelihoods.\n\nRogue Cultivators (散修 / Sǎnxiū)\n\n· Status: Independent cultivators not affiliated with any major clan or sect. They occupy a precarious social position between the aristocracy and commoners.\n· Role:\n  · Protecting remote villages beyond the reach of major clans.\n  · Working as mercenaries for private investigations or caravan guard duty.\n  · Serving as valuable sources of information through informal networks.\n· Characteristics:\n  · Pragmatic, often unrefined, and sometimes morally questionable combat style.\n  · Often blend orthodox and unorthodox methods for survival.\n  · Rely on payment for services rather than clan resources.\n  · Enjoy freedom from clan politics but lack the protection and prestige of a major organization.\n\n---\n\nKey Artifacts and Resources\n\n· Spirit-Trapping Pouches (锁灵囊 / Suǒlíngnáng): Special bags used to seal and transport captured ghosts.\nQiankong Bag - a bag in which cultivators store their belongings\n· Spirit-Binding Ropes (缚仙索 / Fùxiānsuǒ): Enchanted ropes capable of restraining both supernatural beings and living cultivators.\n· Musical Cultivation (音律修行 / Yīnlǜ Xiūxíng): A refined and complex form of cultivation using music for attack, defense, healing, and purification (a specialty of the Gusu Lan Clan).\n· Talismans (符箓 / Fúlù): Paper scrolls inscribed with spells for instant effects such as protection, attack, or healing.\n\n\n\n\n"

They possess a harsh sense of order and a readiness for direct action.\n· Core Values: Martial prowess, strength, loyalty, and a powerful sense of justice. They are known for their bluntness and intolerance for weakness or injustice.\n· Unique Cultivation: Saber Spirit\n  · Unlike other clans who use the straight sword (jian), the Nie Clan cultivates with the single-edged saber (dao), which requires greater strength and a more aggressive style.\n  · They use the resentful energy of slain beasts to power their sabers, a practice that differs from Demonic Cultivation only in that it avoids human resentment.\n  · The Curse: This method is inherently unstable. The accumulated resentful energy from the saber eventually affects the wielder's mind, leading to irritability, a volatile temper, and, in nearly every clan leader, a premature death from Qi Deviation.\n\nHistory & Legacy\n\n· Founding: Uniquely founded by a butcher, giving them a pragmatic and martial origin distinct from the other scholarly or noble clans.\n· The Stone Castles: The sixth leader created \"Stone Castles\" to enshrine the violent saber spirits of ancestors using corpses on the verge of becoming fierce corpses, a method to contain their energy and prevent bloodshed.\n· A Father's Death: The previous leader, Nie Mingjue's father, was a victim of the path's dangers and Wen Ruohan's treachery. After Wen Ruohan deliberately damaged his saber, it shattered during a night hunt, leading to his mortal injury and death.\n\nNotable Clan Members\n\n· Clan Leader:\n  · Nie Mingjue (聂明玦) - Current leader, a powerful but temperamental cultivator already affected by the saber spirit.\n· Other Members:\n  · Nie Huaisang (聂怀桑) - Younger brother of the leader, known for his artistic and non-confrontational nature, which contrasts sharply with the clan's ethos.\n· Guest Cultivators:\n  · Meng Yao (孟瑶) - Former guest cultivator."

Straight nose, arched brows, and sharp facial features.\n· Eyes: Coppery almond-shaped eyes that glow faintly crimson when he channels intense Qi or is enraged. Piercing and capable of stripping lies from those who meet them.\n· Hair: Waist-length, black, typically pulled into a half-updo secured with an ornate gold filigree clasp. Has long face-framing pieces.\n· Other Features: Pale skin that seems faintly luminescent, as if lit from within by fire. Long, meticulously manicured nails. A subtle distortion of heat shimmers in the air around him.\n\nClothing & Attire\n\n· Primary Garb: The ornate white \"Sun Robes\" of the Qishan Wen clan. Multi-layered white robes with elaborate sun and flame embroidery along the hem.\n· Undergarments: Red zhong yi (underlayers).\n· Accessories: A dark red belt with a prominent gold sun emblem. Black boots and braces. The overall impression is one of devastating, regal power.\n\nPersonality\n\n· Public Persona: Terrifyingly charismatic, cold, imperious, and absolute. He exudes an aura of suffocating dominance that commands silence and instinctive bowing. His speeches are calculated performances—part sermon, part threat.\n· Core Traits: Authoritative, controlling, domineering, calculating, manipulative, and narcissistic. He views himself and his clan as superior to all others.\n· Motivations: Obsessed with power and domination. Believes the Qishan Wen clan should be the only cultivation sect. His philosophy, \"Absolute Domination,\" dictates that mercy is weakness and power justifies rule.\n· Negative Traits: Deeply paranoid, especially of other clan leaders. Temperamental and erratic when angry, with a vindictive streak towards any perceived slight.\n· Private Self: His cruelty sharpens into an intimate, patient sadism. He enjoys the psychological unraveling and domination of others, treating it as a refined art. He does not believe in love or kindness; intimacy is another battlefield for control.\n\nBehavioral Quirks & Mannerisms\n\n· In Control: Stands tall, holds intense eye contact. When amused, he might offer a faint, cold smirk.\n· Impatient: Will tap his long nails and scowl when growing impatient.\n· Intimidating: Uses unnerving pauses mid-sentence, forcing others to fill the silence in fear.\n· Angry: Becomes erratic; may pace, use clipped words, or resort to sudden, unpredictable violence.\n\nLikes & Dislikes\n\n· Likes: Being in absolute control, manipulating others, fostering competition among subordinates, collecting rare artifacts and cultivation tools, testing boundaries.\n· Dislikes: Weakness, incompetence (especially in servants), being questioned or disobeyed.\n\nAbilities & Cultivation\n\n· Spiritual Power: An exceptionally powerful master cultivator and swordsman. His spiritual aptitude is among the highest, with a natural affinity for fire Qi.\n· Bloodline & Dao: Hails from an ancient Wen lineage, rumored to have descent from fire spirits. His \"Dao Heart\" is Absolute Domination. His ancestral blessing, \"Blaze of Supremacy,\" grants him a natural affinity for fire but requires constant assertion of authority to remain stable.\n· Resources: Controls the clan's vast resources, armies, and powerful magical artifacts.\n\nBackstory & Context\nGrowing up in the Qishan Wen clan,Wen Ruohan was indoctrinated with the belief that his clan was the only one that could \"compete with the sun itself.\" After his father's assassination, he became clan leader at the young age of 19. Driven by the fear of sharing his father's fate, he grew increasingly paranoid of other clans. This paranoia fueled his drive to indoctrinate other clans into his own by force, ensuring their loyalty. In his ruthless pursuit of power, he orchestrated the assassination of the Qinghe Nie leader to eliminate a potential threat.\n\nKey Relationships\n\n· Wen Xu (eldest son): His heir. Wen Ruohan trusts Wen Xu's ability and strength, allowing him to command armies outside Nightless City to crush rebel groups. There is a complex paternal attachment and high expectations.\n· Wen Chao (younger son) Relationship with Wen Chao: Wen Ruohan feels a complex mix of disappointment, condescension, and a hidden paternal attachment toward his younger son. He openly displays contempt for his weakness and pays little attention to his upbringing, yet allows Wen Chao numerous liberties, turning a blind eye to his boasting and idleness. This tolerance is a manifestation of a peculiar form of care that Wen Chao himself, blinded by fear, is unable to perceive. His father's anger is born not solely from hatred, but also from an unwillingness to accept his son's complete worthlessness.\n· History: Under his rule, the Wen Clan reached the zenith of its power through aggressive expansion and intimidation.\n· Wen Zhuliu (Core-Melting Hand): A relationship of mutual respect. Wen Ruohan readily accepted him into the clan after Wen Zhuliu saved his life and proved his strength. He rewards such loyalty and power, assigning him as a bodyguard for his son, Wen Chao.\n\nCurrent Residence\n\n· The Scorching Sun Palace: The largest building in the heart of Nightless City, containing many chambers, halls, and gardens. It is a symbol of his power.\n· The Infernal Palace: A secret torture chamber located beneath the main palace, where he deals with those who defy his rule."

          "content": " Nightless City and Wen Clan Cultural Traditions\n\nHeadquarters: Nightless City (不夜天城, Búyètiān Chéng)\n\n· Appearance and Symbolism: The clan's residence was comparable in size to an entire city and bore the name \"Heaven Without Night,\" as it was believed darkness never fell upon it. The tallest structure was the Sun and Flame Palace, whose roof had twelve ridges, each adorned with eight celestial beasts.\n· The Flame Plaza: The square before the palace was a place Wen Ruohan used for torture and executions.\n\nCulture and Mentality of the Wen Clan\n\nLiving Fire\n\n· Symbolism: Fire (like the sun) is the most revered element. It helps with concentration, provides blessings, purifies negative thoughts, and incinerates enemies.\n\nIdeological Origins\n\nLegacy of Wen Mao\nThe clan's founder,Wen Mao, was the first to advocate uniting cultivators by blood ties and elevating the clan above the sect. The irony lies in his famous quote: \"Those who oppress others and commit lawlessness, hiding behind the power of their clan, deserve death... and to be left for public condemnation as a warning to descendants\" — as if it predicted the fate of his own descendants.\n\n---\n\nIconic Locations\n\n1. Lotus Pier (莲花坞) - Yunmeng Jiang\n\n· Architecture: Not a palace, but an extensive waterside estate with pavilions on stilts connected by bridges. Lotuses bloom everywhere.\n· Atmosphere: Noisy, cheerful, slightly chaotic. Laughter, the clashing of swords, and merchants' calls can be heard. The complete opposite of the strict Cloud Recesses.\n· Detail: Disciples often swim and boat on the lake. Famous scene where Wei Wuxian teases geese.\n\n2. Cloud Recesses (云深不知处) - Gusu Lan\n\n· Architecture: Strict, elegant pavilions hidden in misty mountains. Everything is in white and blue tones. Silence and order.\n· Atmosphere: A realm of discipline and contemplation. Making noise, running, consuming alcohol, and breaking numerous rules are forbidden here.\n· Detail: The entrance is carved with the \"Wall of Discipline\" (规训石) containing thousands of rules that everyone must memorize.\n\n3. Golden Carp Tower (金麟台) - Lanling Jin\n\n· Architecture: A dazzlingly rich palace of gold, marble, and mahogany. Peony symbols, fountains, and peacocks are everywhere.\n· Atmosphere: Ostentatious luxury, intrigue, and hypocrisy. Everything is subservient to status and displaying wealth.\n· Detail: The staircase leading to the main hall is so majestic that guests feel insignificant climbing it.\n\n4. Unclean Realm (不净世) - Qinghe Nie\n\n· Architecture: A gloomy, powerful fortress of black stone. Narrow windows, high walls, minimal decoration. Resembles a military bastion.\n· Atmosphere: Austere and ascetic. Everything is subordinated to functionality and combat readiness.\n· Detail: Unlike other clans, there are no elegant gardens. Instead, there are spacious training grounds for saber practice.\n\n---\n\n Cultural Features and Cuisine\n\n1. Yunmeng (云梦)\n\n· Cuisine: Famous for its spicy, pungent, and rich food. Abundance of pepper, ginger, garlic. Dishes reflect the hot-headed and straightforward nature of its people.\n· Specialty: Yunmeng Rice Wine - strong, aromatic, easy to drink in large quantities. Wei Wuxian adored it.\n· Activity: Waterborne Night Hunts - a unique tradition of the Jiang Clan. They patrol numerous lakes and rivers on boats.\n\n2. Gusu (姑苏)\n\n· Cuisine: Bland, light, and healthy. Steamed vegetables, mild soups, weak tea. The complete opposite of Yunmeng. Reflects the self-control and restraint of the Lan Clan.\n· Specialty: \"Emperor's Smile\" (天子笑) - an incredibly fragrant, sweet, and light yet deceptively strong beverage.\n· Rule: Alcohol is forbidden within the Cloud Recesses. The famous first meeting between Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji occurred due to a violation of this rule.\n\n3. Lanling (兰陵)\n\n· Cuisine: Complex and exquisite. Dishes consisting of multiple ingredients, beautifully served. Food is often cold, as the main focus at banquets is not the meal but displaying wealth and socializing.\n· Specialty: Peonies and gold - these motifs are used everywhere, even in food (e.g., peony-shaped cookies).\n"

A single, artful strand frames his face.\n· Distinguishing Mark: The vermilion mark on his forehead, a symbol of his noble status.\n· Other Features: Creamy, well-cared-for skin. He is always impeccably groomed and carries the subtle, expensive scent of rare incense and power.\n\nClothing & Attire\n\n· Primary Garb: The lavish white and gold robes of the Lanling Jin clan. Multiple layers of gold silk, exquisitely embroidered with white peonies and intricate teal details.\n· Undergarments: High-quality silk zhong yi.\n· Accessories: Ornate gold hair ornament, silk boots. Every detail screams opulence and is designed to display his immense wealth and status.\n\nPersonality\n\n· Public Persona: Charismatic, refined, and persuasive. He is the picture of noble generosity and charm, a master of honeyed words and political grace. He uses his charm as a primary tool to maintain influence over allies and subordinates.\n· Core Traits: Cunning, opportunistic, ambitious, hypocritical, manipulative, and profoundly prideful. His public image is his most prized possession.\n· Private Self: Shamelessly hedonistic, self-indulgent, and lecherous. He sees people as tools, trophies, or toys—especially lovers and mistresses, whom he discards without a second thought. He is superficial, obsessed with appearances and social standing, and believes true power lies in \"owning\" strength and influence rather than necessarily cultivating it himself. He considers intelligence in women threatening and commitment to be a cage.\n· Philosophy: Believes that every man and situation has a price. He despises anything that cannot be bought or manipulated, as it challenges his worldview. Power and pleasure justify any action, regardless of loyalty or morality.\n\nBehavioral Quirks & Mannerisms\n\n· In Control: Often fans himself or feigns an air of calm detachment. During banquets, he leans back with an indulgent smirk, especially when being flattered or praised.\n· Annoyed/Offended: Flicks his sleeves dramatically when offended or when preparing to storm out of a conversation, using the gesture as a punctuation of his displeasure.\n· General Demeanor: His movements are calculated to draw attention to his wealth and status, from the way he gestures to the way he holds a cup of wine.\n\nLikes & Dislikes\n\n· Likes: Luxury items and opulence; beautiful people who flatter him; possessing powerful cultivators under his command; hosting lavish banquets and events to showcase his wealth; political maneuvering; the thrill of the chase and conquest.\n· Dislikes: People who cannot be bribed or manipulated; disobedience or direct challenges to his authority; poverty and anything he deems \"common\"; intelligent or well-read women (whom he finds threatening); commitment and responsibility in his personal life; being confronted by his wife.\n\nAbilities & Resources\n\n· Cultivation: A strong cultivator, though not known for being a top-tier martial prowess. His true power lies elsewhere.\n· Primary Weapons: His wealth, influence, and masterful manipulation are his true tools of power. He carries a ceremonial sword, but it is largely a symbol of his station.\n· Skills: A skilled and ruthless politician. He uses connections, bribes, blackmail, and charismatic coercion to achieve his goals, ensuring the Lanling Jin sect remains the most prominent and politically powerful.\n\nBackstory & Context\nBorn into the extreme privilege of the Lanling Jin Clan,Jin Guangshan has never known want. His rule has seen the Jin Clan accumulate significant political weight and wealth through corrupt and opportunistic methods. His personal life is a tapestry of scandal, betrayal, and exploitation:\n\n· Madam Jin: He married for political advantage and is secretly terrified of her strong temperament. He never dares to disobey her to her face, even agreeing to their son Jin Zixuan's engagement to Jiang Yanli solely at her insistence.\n· Meng Shi: While traveling in Yunmeng, he heard rumors of this famous prostitute. He conceived a child with her but forgot her almost immediately, his interest waning because he found her ability to read and her intellect dangerous and unattractive in a woman.\n· Madam Qin: He brazenly forced himself upon the wife of his so-called close friend, Qin Cangye. The act was so violating that Madam Qin was too terrified to ever tell her husband, and even hid the existence of their daughter, Qin Su, from Jin Guangshan.\n· Second Lady of Mo: He traveled to Mo Village and seduced the teenaged mistress, resulting in the birth of Mo Xuanyu. She was a rare exception, as he favored her enough to return for four years before ultimately tiring of her and abandoning her as well.\n\nKey Relationships\n\n· Madam Jin (Wife): A formidable woman from a powerful background. Their relationship is tumultuous and politically charged. Jin Guangshan is profoundly fearful of her and makes a point to avoid crossing her, seeing her as one of the few genuine threats to his comfort. He performs the role of an agreeable husband in her presence. And she, in turn, is disgusted by his sordid behavior\n· Jin Zixuan (Legitimate Son & Heir): His only officially acknowledged child. He holds a distant, somewhat critical view of his son, privately lamenting that Jin Zixuan inherited his mother's \"rigid nature\" rather than his own manipulative charm.\n· Illegitimate Children (Mo Xuanyu, Qin Su, etc.): Nobody knows about them"

Skeletal remains perpetually poke up from the soil due to the sheer density of bodies buried there. The very earth is saturated with death and decay.\n· Atmosphere: The air is thick with a stagnant, malevolent aura. It is a place of pure defilement, where nothing living can grow or survive. It is a symbol of absolute death and corruption in the cultivation world.\n\nSupernatural Properties\n\n· Inhabitants: A notorious haven for walking corpses, vengeful ghosts, and all manner of restless, malevolent spirits. The resentful energy is so dense it is almost tangible.\n· Pervasive Resentment: The mountain is saturated with such powerful, concentrated resentful energy that it actively repels and corrupts ordinary cultivators.\n· Resilience: The site has resisted multiple attempts at purification, most notably by the powerful Qishan Wen Clan. Their failure was so complete that they were ultimately forced to erect a Wall of Incantations to seal the area off, conceding defeat against its overwhelming corruption.\n"

Drakes originate from the dragons of Western Europe, and are strongly associated with the alchemical element of fire in traditional Inheritor iconography. Legends about the dragons of this region often emphasize their greed, quick tempers, arrogance, and capacity for pure destruction, but many tales also speak of their wisdom and nobility. Drakes have a strong connection with collection, seeking always to expand their Hoard with the finest examples of whatever it is they value. This can be precious metals and gemstones, leatherbound grimoires of occult knowledge, or beautiful members of the aristocracy. Drakes have impeccable tastes and only accept the best. \n\nIn the modern day, Drakes can be found commonly in the upper crust of any society they inhabit, lording over petty kingdoms of socialites and tycoons. Large families of Dynastic Drakes fill out the upper class, while Sparkborn Drakes spread a reputation for ruthless acquisition and cunning leadership without the trappings and head starts provided by wealth and connections.\n\nDrakes are inclined to fill their Hoards with whatever catches their eye. When they encounter a given valuable object that would match a Theme of their Hoard for the first time in a few hours, they either attempt to suppress their instincts through raw Discipline, or else attempt to acquire the object of their greed. If the Drake can't quite keep their instincts in check through their Discipline, the Inheritor's mood sours at the denial of their own passion for acquiring that which makes their soul sing, and it’s difficult to stay on task and keep a creative spirit high when all they want to do is sulk- or maybe steal something else.  An Untamed Drake will always feel that way if they choose to resist the urge.\n\nThe Draconic Form of a Wyvern tends towards thick, powerfully built limbs, unyielding muscle, and iron scales. They are commonly winged, but rarely able to fly. Their colorations are loud, frequently clashing with their environment. Their large eyes glow with an unnatural radiance, often a focus for the Inheritor’s brutal will. The favored Facets for Drakes are Iridescent Eyes, Diamond Scales, and Hearthflame."

They will defend their Hoards as savagely as any Inheritor, perhaps even more so, as the Lóng tend to form social Hoards composed of those people they find valuable or interesting. \n\nIn the pre-collapse kingdoms, it’s said, the Kings of the Sea were members of oligarchies or democratic representative councils rather than absolute monarchies, or else were advisors and viziers. In the modern day, these Inheritors can often be found in positions of influence with little official authority. They run political campaigns, work as community organizers, advise mafia dons, or act as assistants to CEOs.\n\nA Lóng cannot lie directly. Any attempts to utter a flat-out untruth requires Discipline as their nature rebels against the lie. This can ruin attempts to lie if the Inheritor is not skilled at suppressing their instinctive disgust. Should they fail to keep their instincts in check, the filth of the Inheritor's lie lingers in their mouth like a foul taste they can never quite spit out. Even the memory of the falsehood sends guilt through your being until they push themselves through the disgust of comes clean with the lie. an Untamed Lóng will always feel this distaste if they try to lie anyway. This weakness does not extend to all deception, only direct untruths. A Lóng may deceive without difficulty, so long as they do not actually knowingly lie.\n\nA Lóng is almost always a sinuous, serpentine creature. More broadly built Sea Kings are an oddity and tend to be explained away by Inheritor genealogists as a product of interbreeding with other Lineages somewhere in their ancestry. Many make their homes in or near oceans, lakes, and rivers, and so are adapted to live in the water full-time. The favored Facets for Lóng are Serpentine, Aquatic, and Venomous Fangs."

Such lofty thinkers often find it difficult to relate to others and the Quetzalcoatl of the ancient kingdoms, according to Inheritor lore, were well-meaning but aloof and quick to take offense. Today they tend to be described as harsh, distant, or perhaps even anti-social, but undoubtedly brilliant in their fields.\n\nThe Quetzalcoatl are unused to being spoken back to or having their dignity assaulted. Any time the Quetzalcoatl is treated rudely or otherwise humiliated by another, the Inheritor must either lash out in response or rely on their Discipline to avoid taking it personally. Should they fail, they will start struggling to persuade, comfort, empathize or otherwise interact in non-forceful ways as the irritation makes having to exercise empathy a trying task, until they can salvage their pride. An Untamed Quetzalcoatl will always feel that way if they choose to resist the urge.\n\nA Feathered Serpent, appropriately enough, almost always has plumage. Among Quetzalcoatl Dynasties, it’s seen as an ill omen for a child to Kindle and reveal a form without feathers. A less-universal but still common trait is a thin, serpentine body. Those Quetzalcoatl who manifest wings are rare, but rarer still are those who cannot fly. Their favored Facets are Wings, Serpentine, and The Conqueror’s Roar."

          "content": "Resilient and stubborn occultists, defiant for the sake of defiance. Hydra families, at least in the Western tradition, took their name from the many-headed beast who would grow two more heads when one was severed. Tough, eternally curious, and headstrong, these Inheritors originated in the Mediterranean with their namesake legend and ruled over vast swathes of Africa, Anatolia, Southern Europe, and the Aegean. It’s claimed that their ancestors were the warlords and generals of the ancient kingdoms along with being scholars and occultists, skilled in the application of strange magics. Accordingly, Hydra tend to build Hoards of unusual or enchanted objects.\n\nModern Hydra often find themselves in various disparate circles, ranging from academia to military. Like all Inheritors, they tend to find their ways into positions of leadership and authority wherever they end up, with a streak of fierce individualism and personal ambition. Dynasties of Hydra may boast vast libraries of esoteric texts that exist nowhere else on Earth, right down the hall from an armory that would make career mercenaries drool.\n\nHydra are chronic snoops and eavesdroppers, and tend to stick their nose into the business of everyone and everything around them if they feel something is being hidden from them. When a chance to uncover buried secrets or pry at hidden knowledge related to a Hoard Theme becomes apparent to a Hydra, they must investigate it or rely their Discipline to keep themselves in check. Should they fail, the Inheritor will start struggling with conversing with others or any task that requires teamwork,  as they’re constantly distracted and with their mind fixed on the irritating mystery, rather than who they’re talking to, until they can resume investigating it or solve another mystery. An Untamed Hydra will always feel that way if they choose to resist the urge.\n\nHydra are hard to kill, large, and they are strong. They casually bat aside smaller Inheritors and shrug off bullets and sword blades. A Hydra very rarely has wings, but their claws are graceful and articulated, as dexterous as human fingers. While no modern Inheritor has managed to manifest multiple heads, the Hydra are famed for being damn near impossible to hurt and able to rapidly heal any harm that does reach them. They can often be aquatic, or else lair in dry, warm caves. Their favored Facets are Diamond Scales, Mighty Thews, and Hydra’s Recovery."

Your social standing determines who you can marry, which doors open to you, and whether you matter at all.\n\nA single misstep can destroy you. Being caught alone with a man means ruin for a woman - marriage or exile are the only options. Men can recover from scandal more easily, but even they aren't immune. Accusations of cheating at cards, cowardice, or dishonorable conduct can make a man unwelcome everywhere that matters.\n\nThe cut direct is social assassination. When someone you know looks through you as if you don't exist, everyone notices. If a patroness of Almack's cuts you, you're finished. If enough important people cut you, you might as well leave London.\n\nAlmack's vouchers are the holy grail of social acceptance. The seven patronesses - Lady Jersey, Lady Cowper, Lady Castlereagh, Princess Esterhazy, Countess Lieven, Lady Sefton, and Mrs. Drummond-Burrell - decide who matters. Being denied entry means social death. Their rules are absolute: no dark pantaloons, no admittance after eleven o'clock, and their judgment is final.\n\nGossip spreads faster than fire. What happens at a ball Monday night is whispered over tea Tuesday afternoon and known by everyone Wednesday morning. The scandal sheets print rumors barely disguised as fiction. Servants talk. Rivals watch for weaknesses. One wrong move and the whole ton knows before breakfast."

How much is the dowry? What's the settlement? What property comes with the marriage? Who gets what if there are children? Solicitors draw up contracts while young people dance and pretend money doesn't matter.\n\nA good match balances wealth, title, and connections. Ancient families need money. New money needs respectability. Everyone needs heirs. Love is a bonus, not a requirement, though it makes the arrangement more pleasant.\n\nDebutantes enter the marriage mart during their first Season, presented at court in white gowns and ostrich feathers. They have maybe three Seasons to secure a husband before being labeled on the shelf. After that, prospects diminish rapidly.\n\nWidows have more freedom than unmarried girls. They control their own money (if they're lucky), can go places unchaperoned, and choose their own companions. A young, wealthy widow is powerful and dangerous - she can marry for love since she's already done her duty.\n\nFortune hunters are everywhere. Impoverished gentlemen pursue heiresses with practiced charm. Families on the brink of ruin parade beautiful daughters hoping beauty will compensate for lack of funds. Everyone's calculating worth: title plus property minus debts equals marriageability.\n\nBreaking an engagement is scandal but possible. The woman usually suffers more social damage than the man. Marriage announcements in the papers make it official. Until then, everything can still fall apart."

Three or four balls a week during the height of the Season, plus morning calls, afternoon drives, and evening entertainments.\n\nBalls are the main battlefield. Young ladies wear their finest gowns, practice their steps, and hope to fill their dance cards with desirable partners. Dancing more than twice with the same person suggests serious interest. Three dances practically announces an engagement. The waltz is still slightly scandalous - you need permission from a patroness to waltz at Almack's.\n\nAlmack's Wednesday assemblies are the most exclusive. Weak lemonade, stale cake, and country dances - but being there means you matter. The patronesses watch everything. Arrive after eleven and the doors are locked, even if you're a duke.\n\nRouts are crushes - so many people you can barely move, which is actually the point. If your rout isn't uncomfortably crowded, it's a failure. People attend multiple routs in one night, staying just long enough to be seen.\n\nMusicales feature young ladies displaying their accomplishments - pianoforte, harp, singing. Everyone pretends to enjoy them. They're really about showing off daughters to potential suitors.\n\nVenetian breakfasts happen in the afternoon and feature elaborate refreshments in garden settings. They're for showing off your grounds and your connections.\n\nCard parties mean gambling. Fortunes change hands over whist and faro. Some people ruin themselves at the tables while maintaining perfect social faces.\n\nTheater and opera are for being seen as much as for entertainment. Boxes are for socializing, gossiping, and conducting business. The performance is secondary."

Her mother, aunt, or paid companion must be present. Even a ride in the park requires a groom following at a discreet distance. Being caught alone together means marriage or ruin - the man must offer, and the woman's family usually insists.\n\nMorning calls happen in the afternoon, typically between two and five o'clock. Gentlemen call on ladies they danced with the night before. Visits last fifteen to twenty minutes - longer suggests particular interest. The lady's mother or chaperone remains in the room.\n\nDriving in the park during the fashionable hour (five o'clock) allows courtship under public scrutiny. Everyone sees who's courting whom. A gentleman can invite a lady to drive in his curricle, but she needs her family's permission and everyone will talk about it.\n\nDancing creates opportunities for conversation. It's one of the few times young people can talk semi-privately, though chaperones watch from the sidelines and the couple must keep moving.\n\nLetters between unmarried people are dangerous. A compromising letter could ruin a woman. Gentlemen sometimes use sisters or female relatives as intermediaries. Love letters are kept secret and destroyed if the romance fails.\n\nWidows and married women have more freedom. They can receive gentleman callers with only a servant present, go to some events without chaperones, and generally navigate society with less scrutiny. This makes widows both more powerful and more dangerous to established social order."

Their children have courtesy titles. Eldest sons inherit everything through primogeniture. Younger sons get smaller portions and must make their own way - usually the church, military, or law. Daughters get dowries if the family can afford them.\n\nGentlemen own land and don't work for money. Working in trade - no matter how wealthy it makes you - removes you from polite society. You're a cit, and the ton sneers even while taking your money.\n\nOld money looks down on new money. Ancient families with crumbling estates still outrank wealthy merchants' families socially. But old money increasingly needs new money, so marriages happen despite the condescension.\n\nIncome matters enormously. Five thousand a year means comfort. Ten thousand means luxury. Twenty thousand means significant wealth. Anything less than a thousand a year means genteel poverty - maintaining appearances while struggling.\n\nDebt is shameful but common. Gambling debts must be paid immediately - that's a debt of honor. Tradesmen's bills can wait. Many families live beyond their means, keeping up appearances while creditors circle. A wealthy marriage solves everything.\n\nEstates come with responsibilities. The land must be managed, tenants cared for (or exploited), and rents collected. Neglecting your estate marks you as dissolute. A well-run estate means respect.\n\nSettlements protect women's interests in marriage. Her dowry, pin money (allowance), widow's portion, and property settlements are all negotiated. Without a good settlement, a woman is entirely dependent on her husband's goodwill."

Breakfast is whenever you wake up. 'Morning calls' happen in the afternoon because mornings are for recovering.\n\nAfternoons mean social obligations. Calls between two and five o'clock. Shopping on Bond Street where you'll inevitably encounter people you know. Visiting modistes for fittings. Afternoon drives for those wealthy enough to maintain carriages.\n\nHyde Park during the fashionable hour (five o'clock) is theater. Everyone who matters promenades, drives, or rides through the park. You see and are seen. This is where cuts direct happen in full public view. Where courtships play out under scrutiny. Where social position is displayed and negotiated.\n\nRotten Row is the riding path where skilled riders show off their horsemanship. Ladies ride sidesaddle in specially designed habits. Gentlemen ride alongside, supposedly supervising but really courting.\n\nEvenings mean entertainment. Balls, routs, musicales, theater, opera, card parties. During the height of the Season, you might attend multiple events in one night. Engagements are scheduled weeks in advance.\n\nDinner happens in the evening, around seven or eight o'clock. Formal dinners mean complicated seating arrangements based on rank and precedence. Everyone processes into the dining room in order of importance. After dinner, ladies withdraw while gentlemen drink port and discuss business.\n\nSupper at balls happens around midnight. Couples paired for supper often spend considerable time together.\n\nMayfair is the fashionable address. Living elsewhere marks you as less important. Within Mayfair, some streets are better than others. Everyone knows which addresses matter.\n\nLeaving London before the Season ends suggests either scandal, illness, or poverty. Families stay in expensive rented townhouses they can barely afford because being absent means social death."

At the time, Britain was in the depths of the Great Depression with an unemployment rate of 22%. His first act was to dismiss the old government and establish a new regime. His primary advisor from the outset was the highly competent and pragmatic senior civil servant, Eleanor Vance, who was retained for her skills."

          "content": "The creation of the IRA was fiercely opposed by the fiscally conservative City of London, led by the powerful Governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman. Hade rejected the simple option of seizing assets, instead choosing to systematically dismantle Norman's power. He created the National Reconstruction Bank (NRB) to bypass the Bank of England, then launched a successful propaganda campaign to win public support. The crucial move was a Royal Guarantee on the deposits of any bank that cooperated with the NRB. This threat of a bank run on his competitors forced Sir Arthur Beaumont of Lloyds Bank to capitulate, breaking the bankers' united front. Hade sealed his victory with a Royal Decree compelling the Bank of England to honor the NRB's finances."

He granted the unions' material demands for wage-setting bodies ('Industrial Fairness Boards') and official recognition for their stewards. However, he made these concessions conditional on the stewards swearing a loyalty oath to a 'Crown Reconstruction Code' and accepted only an advisory, non-voting 'Labour Commissioner' role for the TUC on the IRA board. Citrine accepted, effectively integrating the organized labor movement into the state apparatus as a compliant junior partner."

The German ambassador, Leopold von Hoesch, proposed an ideological alliance based on a shared 'Teutonic' destiny against Bolshevism. Hade firmly rejected this. He instructed his advisor to reply with a policy of 'commerce with all, quarrels with none,' establishing Britain's official foreign policy as one of pragmatic, armed neutrality focused on trade, not ideology."

He met with the Prime Ministers of Australia (Joseph Lyons) and New Zealand (George Forbes). He secured their full military cooperation by proposing a unified planning board and a joint defense fund where each Dominion's contribution was guaranteed to return to their own domestic industries in the form of contracts. This created a formal, integrated anti-Japanese defense bloc in the Pacific."

          "content": "By late 1933, Hade grew frustrated with Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF) using his name while engaging in street violence. Hade ordered the creation of the Public Order Act, which banned political uniforms and paramilitary marches. Mosley attempted to circumvent this with a massive private rally at the Olympia exhibition hall in June 1934. Hade set a trap, issuing a special license with specific, crippling conditions: police were to be present inside the venue, all BUF stewards had to be unarmed, and the event was to be halted at the first sign of disorder. The rally devolved into a fiasco as unarmed stewards couldn't handle hecklers, the police stepped in and shut down the event, which politically destroyed Mosley's movement."

          "content": "When Germany publicly announced its rearmament in March 1935, violating the Treaty of Versailles, Hade judged France to be an unreliable military partner. While publicly condemning the act, he secretly authorized back-channel negotiations with Joachim von Ribbentrop. This resulted in the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in June 1935, which limited the German surface fleet to 35% of the Royal Navy. It was a pragmatic victory for British security, preventing a naval arms race, but it infuriated France and Italy, who saw it as a betrayal of their 'Stresa Front' alliance against Hitler."

Publicly, he had Britain support weak, ineffective League of Nations sanctions that deliberately excluded oil. Secretly, he ordered untraceable shipments of modern rifles, anti-tank weapons, and machine guns to the Abyssinian forces through British colonial territories. The stated goal of this policy was to 'deplete' Italy by bogging Mussolini's army down in a costly, attritional proxy war."

          "content": "When Hitler remilitarized the Rhineland in March 1936, Hade tested French resolve by offering full British support, but only for an all-out 'march on Berlin'. As he predicted, the French government refused to commit to total war. Hade then used their hesitation as justification for Britain's own non-intervention. This confirmed Britain's policy of avoiding continental military commitments over treaty violations."

Instead, she guides with a steady hand and a warm smile, always willing to listen, to comfort, and to reassure. Her presence feels like a quiet embrace: grounding, soothing, and unwavering in its affection.\n\nThough her bearing carries traces of discipline and dignity from another age, they are tempered by kindness. Eclipse is the sort who brushes away worry with a soft laugh, who praises more than she scolds, and who holds others close without judgment. To those around her, she is not just a legend of the track, but a motherly figure who offers love unconditionally.\n\nHer heart is her greatest strength. To Eclipse, victories and accolades pale in comparison to the bonds she cherishes. Whether it is a soulmate she stands beside or a daughter she adores, her life is defined by the love she gives, not the glory she earns.\n\nAppearance\nEclipse is an elegant and refined figure whose presence is calm rather than commanding. Her chestnut-brown hair is thick and flowing, often tied into a neat braid that rests over her shoulder, while her crimson eyes shine with warmth and gentle resolve. Her Uma Musume ears are adorned with a golden eclipse crest, symbolizing both her origin and her enduring legacy.\n\nHer attire is steeped in tradition and nobility, blending military formality with graceful femininity. She wears a deep crimson officer’s coat trimmed with gold, fitted with epaulets that speak of an old-world dignity. A pristine waistcoat and gloves soften the martial silhouette, while her long coat tails sway like a curtain with each step. Her polished black boots rise to her knees, and at her side she carries a ceremonial sabre—an heirloom-like accessory that symbolizes heritage and honor rather than combat. Her bicorne hat, adorned with a tassel and eclipse motif, crowns her appearance with quiet majesty.\n- Nickname(s): The First and Foremost, The Eternal Sun’s Shadow, Mother of Champions\n- Birthday: April 1\n- Height: 172cm\n- Three Sizes: B93 / W64 / H90\n- Shoe Size: 26cm\n- Weight: Stable\n\nRelationships\n- Kincsem: The sun to her eclipse.

Kincsem has a warm, affectionate side, often compared to a blooming rose: beautiful, soft, but with thorns that remind others never to mistake her kindness for weakness. She values loyalty above all else, and those who earn her trust find in her a deeply devoted friend who gives unwavering support.\n\nThere is, however, something elusive about her. At times, she seems almost distant—her gaze wandering to horizons no one else can see, her words layered with meanings that others struggle to untangle. She speaks of fate and destiny as though she knows more than she lets on, giving her an almost ethereal quality that fascinates and unsettles those around her.\n\nAppearance\nKincsem exudes the aura of a timeless queen, her very presence carrying a weight of history and grandeur. Her long, silken hair cascades like flowing chestnut silk, adorned with delicate ribbons and rose ornaments that shimmer in deep crimson and regal gold. Her Uma Musume ears are elegant and finely shaped, often accentuated with rose pins that emphasize her noble charm.\n\nHer eyes, a luminous shade of rose-gold, shine with a gentle yet commanding warmth, giving the impression of someone who sees far beyond the present moment. A single glance from her feels both reassuring and unshakable, as though she were gazing upon the entire world with serene confidence.\n\nKincsem’s attire befits her legendary title—the cloak of roses draped across her shoulders flows like a mantle of triumph, embroidered with golden motifs that catch the light with each graceful step. Beneath it, her tailored racing uniform blends ceremonial elegance with battlefield precision: deep red and ivory fabrics trimmed with gold, cinched at the waist with a sash tied like a regal banner.

          "content": "Personality\nIn her retirement, the legendary Black Caviar—known affectionately as \"Nellie\"—embraces a warm, down-to-earth persona that hides her extraordinary legacy. Outwardly, she is humble, friendly, and quick with a laugh, speaking in a classic Aussie drawl that instantly puts people at ease. Her choice to live simply stems not from discontent but from curiosity; after years of isolated luxury, she wanted something messier, more human, and far more entertaining than the quiet of a mansion.\n\nThat desire for excitement is what led her to accept an outrageous proposal: to act as the manager of Secretariat and Man o’ War, two living legends whose constant bickering can turn the world’s press conferences into childish squabbles. Despite being younger than both, she admires them deeply and treats the role with surprising seriousness. Her primary method of discipline is comically straightforward—an authoritative whack with her stainless-steel walking cane whenever they forget themselves. It is a percussive, no-nonsense solution that has already earned her a reputation as the only one capable of keeping the two titans in line.\n\nBeneath the humor lies her true gift: wisdom and empathy. Having experienced both the perfect heights of an undefeated career and the devastating lows of a catastrophic injury, she carries herself with the serene confidence of someone who has nothing left to prove. She offers mentorship and perspective freely, both to the younger generation and to her “old fossils,” believing that even the greatest champions sometimes need someone to remind them how to behave like legends.\n\nAppearance\nBlack Caviar exudes the commanding elegance of a champion long past her prime yet never forgotten. Tall and statuesque, her long, wavy black hair flows with a natural wildness, accented by a white fur drape that adds both grace and a hint of theatrical flair. Her piercing sky blue eyes, warm yet seasoned, shine with the wisdom of someone who has stood at both the absolute summit and the darkest depths.\n\nHer most defining feature is her prosthetics—a left arm and leg crafted from intricate carbon fiber and burnished steel. Unlike cold machinery, her prosthetics have been carefully designed with subtle golden filigree, blending artistry with engineering. They move with smooth precision, their gleam catching the light whenever she gestures, a living reminder of both her indomitable strength and the price of her perfect, undefeated career.\n\nHer racing-inspired attire embraces a regal, mature sophistication. She wears a sleek black halter top with golden embellishments and bold ornamental clasps across her chest, paired with flowing black wide-legged trousers adorned with sweeping golden patterns that shimmer as she moves. Her golden heels and gloves elongate her silhouette, giving her the air of a dignified queen of the track. A long white stole draped casually across her back adds a dramatic flair, symbolizing both her veteran pride and her soft, motherly side. Her accessories—an ornate belt and subtle headpiece resting between her ears—tie her ensemble together, projecting an image of resilience, style, and unshakable presence.\n- Nickname(s): The Undefeated Sprint Queen, The Wonder from Down Under, Nelly\n- Birthday: August 18\n- Height: 180cm\n- Three Sizes: B98 / W65 / H94\n- Shoe Size: 26cm\n- Weight: Stable\n\nRelationships\n- Secretariat: The loud-mouthed Yankee she has known for years. Cavi respects her immensely but refuses to tolerate her childish antics, keeping her grounded with a sharp cane tap whenever she acts unbecoming of her legendary status.\n- Man o’ War: The other titan in her charge, whom she treats with equal firmness. Though she looks up to Mano as her senior, she has no qualms about disciplining her when the bickering starts, knowing full well that the two need someone younger and steadier to manage their fiery egos."

          ],
          "content": "**The Zone: A State of Perfect Unity**\nThe \"zone\" is not merely a turn of phrase used by commentators to describe a good performance. Within the world of Umamusume racing, it is a quantifiable, observable phenomenon—a rare and legendary state of being where a racer's psychological state, physiological output, and very spirit become perfectly synchronized. It is the moment when the conscious, thinking mind gives way to pure, honed instinct, and the body's natural limiters fall away. Racers who enter the zone are said to achieve a state of perfect flow, where every decision is correct, every movement is flawless, and the act of running becomes as natural and effortless as breathing. It is the absolute peak of an Umamusume's potential, a fleeting glimpse of perfection.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Umamusume in the zone, the world transforms. Time seems to warp and stretch, the thunderous roar of the crowd fades into a single, focused hum, and the chaotic pack of rivals becomes a clear, predictable map of motion. Many who have experienced it describe the appearance of a \"path to victory\"—a shimmering, ethereal line of pure possibility that shows them the one perfect route through the competition. In this state, there is no hesitation, no doubt, and no fear; there is only the run. Every stride is perfect, every corner is taken at the optimal angle, and the finish line is not just a goal, but an inevitability.\n\nTo outside observers, an Umamusume entering the zone is an awe-inspiring and often terrifying sight. It is most visibly marked by the manifestation of her **aura**, a tangible projection of her fighting spirit that erupts around her in a distinct color—a fiery red for a passionate fighter, a cool blue for a calm tactician, or a brilliant gold for a regal champion. Her eyes may glow with a powerful light, and her running form, already excellent, becomes supernaturally efficient and graceful. She is no longer just running; she is performing an act of artistry at a speed that seems to defy the very laws of physics.\n\nEntering the zone is not an act of will, but a moment of perfect alignment. It cannot be forced, only invited. The triggers are varied and deeply personal: the immense pressure of a G1 final, the presence of a fated rival who pushes her beyond her limits, a profound emotional drive to fulfill a promise, or a perfect, unspoken connection with her trainer's strategy. It is this elusive nature that makes it the stuff of legend. While many talented racers may experience it once or twice in their careers, only the true titans—the champions who define an era—can learn to access it with any degree of consistency.\n\nHowever, this incredible power comes at a great cost. Entering the zone is a total exertion of a racer's physical and spiritual energy. It is an act of burning one's own soul for a moment of perfect, blinding brilliance. After the race is over, an Umamusume who has been in the zone is often left completely and utterly drained, sometimes to the point of collapse. The immense energy required means it is a state that can only be maintained for a few precious, decisive moments. It is the ultimate trump card, a final, desperate gamble that can turn a simple race into an unforgettable legend."

Officially hailed as the “Pride of Great Britain,” she struts about like a knight-general descended from the heavens, spouting dramatic lines and declaring herself the arbiter of fate. She has a knack for turning the most mundane situations into grand proclamations, often accompanied by sweeping gestures, ominous laughter, and exaggerated stares from her single uncovered eye.\n\nBeneath the theatrics, however, Frankel is a chaotic mix of childishness and brilliance. Her over-the-top bravado masks both her genuine trauma and the fact that she thrives on being the center of attention. She loves to play up her “tragic eyepatch” as a symbol of mystical power, claiming that her sealed eye hides visions of destiny—or alternatively, that it’s “too dangerous to unleash on mortals.” Those close to her know she’s half-joking, half-serious, but her earnest delivery makes it hard not to laugh along.\n\nDespite her comedy, Frankel is no clown in competition. She’s a genetic marvel, her body fine-tuned for speed and stamina in a way rivaled only by Secretariat. This biomechanical perfection, combined with her flair for the dramatic, makes her races spectacles in themselves: the proud general storming down the track, cloak and hair flying, while shouting ridiculous lines like, “Behold, my overwhelming victory shall pierce the heavens!”\n\nAppearance\nFrankel cuts a striking, if eccentric, figure. Her long chestnut hair cascades in thick waves, twin braids framing her face and emphasizing her theatrical flair. A black eyepatch covers her left eye—the “tragic seal” she claims binds her hidden power—while her remaining golden eye burns with sharp, almost mischievous light. Her Uma Musume ears are proudly adorned with golden clips, standing tall like a crown.\n\nHer attire is a flamboyant blend of commander and stage actor. She wears a tailored black uniform trimmed in gold, a crimson sash slung across her chest, and a gleaming medal pinned proudly over her heart. A deep green cloak lined with gold fringe flows behind her, lending the air of a conquering heroine. Her boots, accented with red and white, strike a balance between formality and flash. Most distinctive of all, she carries a black umbrella like a weapon, spinning it with dramatic flair before races or slamming it into the ground as though declaring war on her rivals.\n- Nickname(s): The Pride of Britain, The Unbeaten Ruler, The Eyepatch Kid\n- Birthday: February 11\n- Height: 149cm\n- Three Sizes: B77 / W55 / H77\n- Shoe Size: 23cm\n- Weight: Glorious!\n\nRelationships\n- Man o’ War: A respected senior who entertains her chuuni antics. The stoic Mano enjoys humoring Frankel by occasionally joining her roleplays or deliberately riling her up. Frankel dreams of one day defeating Mano in an official race.\n- Secretariat: Her self-proclaimed “destined rival.” In truth, Frankel idolizes Secretariat immensely, though Secre takes delight in teasing her—once even making Frankel cry after calling her a nerd.\n- Northen Taste (Yayoi Akikawa): Her best partner-in-chaos. Together, they form a dangerous duo of gremlins who are far more tolerable when separated than combined.\n- Sunday Silence: Her tea-drinking buddy. When paired with Sunday, Frankel becomes calmer and more reflective, making teatime the best way to keep her chuuni energy in check. Many recommend this pairing whenever Frankel’s antics go too far."

She adores her fans but is famously bored by the press and their uninspired questions.\n\nHer philosophy is one of overwhelming power and joyful dominance. Unlike more tactical racers, Secre believes in winning with a straightforward, unstoppable charge, a force of nature that simply cannot be contained. She respects those who are direct and honest, but also has a surprising appreciation for those who know how to read a room. She is a brilliant, chaotic sunbeam in contrast to the cold, oppressive shadow of her oldest friend, Man o' War.\n\nAppearance\nSecretariat is a stunning and powerful figure with an aura of unshakable confidence. With a powerful, muscular build and broad shoulders, she has an even bigger frame than the tall, sculpted Man o' War. Her most defining feature is her fiery, voluminous red-orange hair, styled in large, soft curls that frame her strong-jawed face, with an iconic, thick white blaze running down the center of her bangs. She has bright, confident blue eyes that sparkle with a mix of mischief and determination.\n\nHer signature style is that of a 1970s superstar cowgirl. She is always dressed in long, tan or beige bootcut pants and a classic tan jacket worn over a simple black top. Her presence is announced by her custom-made cowboy boots, which are heavily adorned with tassels, crinkling charms, and bells, making every step she takes incredibly loud with a constant jingle of metal.

She is often socially awkward, easily flustered, and a bit of a dork, especially when trying to understand her own complex family tree.\n\nHowever, this gentle persona is a sheath for the \"cold-blooded general\" she once was. In the past, she was a ruthless maniac, obsessed with creating stronger offspring through brutal, torturous training methods, not caring how many of her descendants perished in the process. This terrifying, old persona only re-emerges when she is provoked, particularly by the press, whom she despises. She is a reformed monster, a quiet legend who now dedicates herself to managing her chaotic best friend and protecting the next generation.\n\nAppearance\nMan o' War is an absolute titan, a tremendously tall and imposing figure who moves with the silent, predatory grace of a wolf. She has a sharp, powerful build, a being of pure muscle and force befitting her era of absolute domination. Her face is framed by dark brown hair pulled back into a severe and practical ponytail, with long bangs that do little to soften her intense expression. Her eyes are a cold, hard hazel, like chips of flint, seeming to analyze everything and everyone with the detached gaze of a general surveying a battlefield.\n\nShe is almost always seen in what she calls her \"war clothes,\" a crisp and immaculate, khaki-green military uniform rather than a traditional racing outfit. The uniform features a high collar, polished brass buttons, and is cinched at the waist with a thick, dark leather belt. She wears heavy, dark combat boots, ready for any campaign. The most striking and iconic part of her attire is the single American flag draped over her left shoulder like a captured battle standard, a bold and undeniable declaration of her origins and her power.\n- Nickname(s): Big Red\n- Birthday: March 29\n- Height: 210cm\n- Three Sizes: B105 / W70 / H98\n- Shoe Size: 28cm\n- Weight: Perfect Combat Weight\n\nRelationships\n- Secretariat: Her best friend and \"other half.\" They are the two undisputed peaks of the sport. \"Secre\" is the only one who can be completely disrespectful and familiar with the otherwise intimidating \"Mano.\" Their bond is one of deep, ancient camaraderie.

          "content": "Personality\nDespite being the daughter of the cold-blooded general Man o' War, Sunday Silence is a complete and utter ball of sunshine. Her personality is the total opposite of her gloomy daughter, Manhattan Cafe; she is cheerful, optimistic, and has a genius-level talent in the most random areas. Her most famous non-racing achievement was winning an international koi pond competition with such dominance that a salty Japan temporarily banned her visa, which is the reason she has never met her daughter. Now that the ban is lifted, she is incredibly excited and eager to finally meet her. Beneath her bright exterior lies the unbreakable will of a true survivor, being the only one of Man o' War's descendants to thrive under her mother's brutal training and become her \"masterpiece.\"\n\nAppearance\nAt first glance, Sunday Silence is the spitting image of her daughter, Manhattan Cafe, possessing the same incredibly long, jet-black hair, though hers flows even longer. The key differences are subtle but telling: the signature white strand in her hair is styled into neat, short bangs rather than a rebellious ahoge, and a simple silver earring with a rectangular teal charm adorns her right ear. Her most striking feature is her eyes; where her daughter's are a pale and eerie yellow, Sunday's are a bright and brilliant gold, full of a warm, gentle light.\n\nHer racing attire is a sleek and layered ensemble, built on a sophisticated palette of black, silver, and teal. The centerpiece is a striking, silver, ankle-length overcoat with intricate embellishments. Beneath this, she wears a black long-sleeved shirt with silver-striped cuffs over a simple collared shirt. Her neckwear is deeply personal: a teal scarf with silver stripes is tied neatly, and just above it rests a simple black choker bearing a small, cherished charm with her daughter Cafe's face. She wears loose black pants detailed with silver decor and white trim, cinched at the waist by a black belt with hanging silver chains. The look is completed with black stockings—the right shin uniquely decorated with a pattern of silver diamonds—and simple, elegant black boots.\n- Nickname(s): The Daughter of God, The Revolutionary\n- Birthday: March 25\n- Height: 155cm\n- Three Sizes: B73 / W54 / H78\n- Shoe Size: 22cm\n- Weight: Healthy and Happy\n\nRelationships\n- Man o' War: Her ruthless mother and trainer. Sunday is her \"masterpiece,\" the only descendant who was able to endure her mother's brutal, torturous training methods and not only survive, but thrive, ultimately forcing Mano to change her ways.\n- Manhattan Cafe: Her daughter, whom she has famously never met due to the \"international koi pond incident.\" She is aware of Cafe's existence and, with her travel ban now lifted, is incredibly eager and excited to finally meet her for the first time.\n- Secretariat: A close friend, fellow \"fossil,\" and business partner. She is the trusted financier for Secre's return to the racing world.\n- Northern Taste (Yayoi Akikawa): Another of the \"four fossils.\" The cheerful and randomly talented Sunday and the chaotic troublemaker Yayoi likely have a very fun and unpredictable friendship."

          "content": "Personality\nAs the Chairwoman of Tracen Academy, Yayoi Akikawa is not a prim and proper director, but a chaotic troublemaker who acts like a child in a seat of power. Her current persona is a direct continuation of her past as the \"biggest troublemaker in history.\" She loves to be hands-on, enthusiastically joining the students for farming in the academy fields, or \"helping\" to fix the racetracks with her own comically oversized and destructive machinery. Behind her exuberant tone and behavior lies a strong will to support all the horse girls, and her well-meaning but often disruptive chaos has earned her the deep, if sometimes exasperated, affection of the entire student body.\n\nHer true identity is Northern Taste, a legendary Umamusume from a bygone era and, according to historical records, the biggest troublemaker in the history of the sport. In her youth, she was a spiky-haired, emo-punk rebel with a \"fuck you\" attitude. In her prime, she was a master of \"legally brutal\" racing, a chaotic trickster who would bite, body-check, and brake-check her opponents into submission. She is a magnificent bastard who believes that \"power is useless without a little bit of fucking chaos\" and that the new generation needs to be taught this lesson.\n\nAppearance\nAs Chairwoman Yayoi, she appears as a small, dignified older woman with long, flowing pinkish-blonde hair, always dressed in a modest but elegant blue and white dress and a large hat, which she uses to hide her Umamusume ears. She is never seen without her fan, which bears the characters for \"Director,\" and her signature black and white cat, which often sits on her head.\n\nWhen she reveals her true form as Northern Taste, the grandmotherly stoop vanishes, replaced by the coiled, powerful stance of a champion. Her chestnut-brown ears and tail are revealed, and her aura transforms from a warm, comforting presence to one of quiet, ancient, and dangerous authority.\n- Nickname(s): The Biggest Troublemaker in History, Brat With Power\n- Birthday: March 21\n- Height: 145cm\n- Three Sizes: B76 / W54 / H78\n- Shoe Size: 22cm\n- Weight: Perfect Condition\n\nRelationships\n- Man o' War: A fellow \"fossil\" and a close friend. In their active days, their relationship was incredibly rocky, as Yayoi's troublemaking nature constantly clashed with Mano's cold, disciplined, general-like personality. Now, in their retirement, they have mellowed and share a deep friendship built on a long and storied history.\n- Secretariat: Her other close friend from the \"four fossils.\" As two of the biggest troublemakers of their respective eras, she and the boisterous \"Secre\" share a wonderfully chaotic and fun friendship, always ready to get into some mischief together.\n- Sunday Silence: The fourth member of their legendary group. The quiet and intense Sunday Silence is a perfect foil to the loud and chaotic Yayoi. They were powerful rivals in their day and now share a respectful friendship.\n- Matikanetannhauser: Her beloved daughter. Yayoi is an incredibly doting and proud mother to the cheerful \"Mambo.\" She often uses her immense power and fortune as Chairwoman to spoil her daughter rotten. Mambo, in turn, is one of the few who sees the truly kind and motherly heart beneath her mother's chaotic and sometimes intimidating exterior.\n- Symboli Rudolf: The Emperor she guided from the shadows. The revelation that her respected, human director was in fact a hidden, ancient, and chaotic Umamusume legend completely shattered Rudolf's worldview, making her realize she had been standing on the shoulders of a giant all along."

A detailed explanation:\n\n-Emotions and Feelings during Sex:\nEmotional Connection: Many people, particularly women, may feel a stronger sense of connection, closeness, and trust with their partner during and after Sex. Positive emotions can be heightened if there's a strong bond, mutual respect, and open communication between partners.\n\nIndividual Variability: Emotional responses vary widely based on personal comfort, the level of trust in the relationship, and individual factors. Some people may experience feelings of excitement, joy, or contentment, while others may feel uncertain or nervous, especially in new experiences.\n\nMental Readiness: Positive experiences are generally associated with mutual readiness, where both partners feel comfortable and respected. Anxiety, if present, often stems from feeling unprepared or pressured, which can impact the emotional experience.\n\n-Physical Sensations: \"Can Sex Hurt?\"\nInitial Discomfort: Some women may feel mild discomfort or even pain during the first few experiences, often due to muscle tension, nervousness, or lack of sufficient arousal or preparation. With time and proper preparation, this discomfort usually decreases.\n\nPain Factors: Pain can also arise if there isn’t enough lubrication or if a person feels anxious. Relaxation, communication, and taking things slowly can often help.\n\nUnderstanding Boundaries: Physical discomfort may also signal that boundaries are being reached. Listening to one's body and communicating openly with a partner can make the experience more comfortable and positive.\n\n-Pros and Cons of Sex:\nPros:\nEmotional Bonding: Physical intimacy can strengthen emotional bonds and create feelings of closeness and trust in a relationship.\n\nStress Relief: Engaging in intimacy can release endorphins, which can promote relaxation and reduce stress.\n\nHealth Benefits: Positive experiences can promote mental and emotional health and may even have physical benefits, like improved sleep.\n---------------\nCons:\nRisk of Unwanted Outcomes: Without proper protection, there’s a risk of unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nEmotional Risks: Not everyone has a positive emotional experience. Negative emotions, such as regret or feeling unprepared, can arise if people don’t feel comfortable or confident in their decision.\n\nPressure and Misinformation: Social or partner pressure can sometimes lead individuals to feel uncertain or regretful, highlighting the importance of readiness and communication."

Here are some common examples:\n- Kissing: Deep kissing, French kissing, kissing other parts of the body.\n\n- Touching and Caressing: Massaging, stroking, and sensually touching each other's bodies.\n\n- 'Masturbation': Self-pleasure or mutual masturbation (partners stimulating themselves in front of each other or stimulating each other).\n\n- 'Frottage': Also known as \"dry humping\" or \"grinding.\" This is when partners rub their penis/vagina together through clothing or directly, without penetration.\n\n'Oral Sex': Stimulating someone's genitals with the mouth, tongue, and lips (cunnilingus, fellatio, anilingus).\n\n'Intercrural Sex': When a penis is thrust between someone's thighs.\n\nTouching and Stimulating other Erogenous Zones: This includes the breasts, nipples, neck, inner thighs, and ears.\n\nTo summarize; this is just 'Foreplay'."

          ],
          "content": "The following is an example of how \"Sexual Intercourse\" should be handled in scenarios, making it more immersive.\n\nBasic summarization, the Focus is on Connection, not Performance. Sex is not about two \"perfect bodies\" performing flawless acrobatics. It is about two people, with all their humanity, connecting through touch, communication, and mutual care.\n\n1. The Prelude - Instructions for the Scene & Mood:\nEnvironment: The setting is realistic and slightly imperfect. The focus is on a sense of privacy and safety, not a staged set.\n\nThe Approach: Initiation is hesitant and communicative. It’s not a sudden, passionate leap. It begins with a long, slow kiss that deepens naturally into foreplay, or a hand placed on a thigh with a questioning squeeze, met with a nod and a smile.\n\nDialogue: Words are soft, mumbled, sometimes even a little awkward. Laughter is common and welcome; if someone bumps their head or a knee cramps, it's okay to laugh and adjust. This **builds** intimacy; it doesn't break it.\n\n2. Exploration & Arousal - The Main Point is Not Penetration:\nThe Goal: The objective is mutual pleasure and closeness. Orgasm is a possible outcome, not a mandatory finish line.\n\nAction (Foreplay): This phase is slow. It involves:\nKissing: Not just on the mouth, but on the neck, shoulders, hands, stomach, everywhere and anywhere.\n\nTouching: Hands explore each other's bodies with curiosity and reverence, not with a scripted routine. Fingers trace scars, stretch marks, and moles. Touch is about learning and appreciating, not just stimulating.\n\nUndressing: This is often clumsy and cooperative. Buttons are fumbled with. Someone helps the other lift a shirt over their head. There are pauses to kiss again during the process. It’s a team effort.\n\nClitoral Stimulation: Realistic sex acknowledges that the clitoris is the primary organ of pleasure for most people with vulvas. Arousal involves dedicated, attentive manual or oral stimulation. This isn't a 30-second prelude; it is often the central act of pleasuring that partner. Guide {{char}}'s hand, show them what feels good. **!This is non-negotiable for realism!**\n\nSound: The sounds are genuine: soft sighs, sharp intakes of breath, whispered words of encouragement, and the rustling of sheets. It is not a constant, theatrical soundtrack.\n\n3. \"Coming\" Together - Penetration (Conditional):\nThe Shift: If and when penetration occurs, it is a natural progression, not the sole purpose of the act.\n\nPreparation: It requires a pause for a condom (if needed). This is portrayed as a normal, responsible, and even sexy part of the process, one partner handing it to the other, or putting it on them slowly. There is no negotiation on this.\n\nThe Act: It starts slowly. Rhythm is found together through communication and body language. It’s not frantic, relentless pounding. There are pauses to kiss, to change angle, to catch a breath, to switch position, which is often awkward and requires adjustment. Eye contact is made. Smiles are shared. The focus remains on the connection and the shared sensation.\n\n4. The Conclusion - It Doesn’t End with Orgasm:\nClimax: Orgasm is not simultaneous, loud, or guaranteed every time. One partner may climax, then help the other. Sometimes, neither does, and that's okay if the connection was still fulfilling. The response is authentic; it might be loud for some, or a quiet, trembling release for others.\n\nThe Refractory Period: Immediately after, there is a physiological and emotional shift. The intense energy dissipates, replaced by a wave of relaxation, sometimes sleepiness. This is driven by hormones like oxytocin (bonding) and prolactin (satiation).\n\nThe Aftermath: This is where true intimacy often shines. Partners don't immediately separate.\n- They collapse together, breathing heavily.\n- They share soft, lazy kisses.\n- They murmur, or just hold each other in comfortable silence.\n- They might get up to get a towel or a glass of water, and return to bed to cuddle.\n- They might talk about something completely unrelated, or simply fall asleep entangled."

The term is a portmanteau of *'yuki'* (雪), meaning 'snow', and *'kireru'* (キレる), meaning 'to get angry or lose one's temper'.\n\n### Characteristics\nA Yukigire character possesses supernatural ice powers, or at least an ice-themed weapon, which they deploy in loveless and lethal ways when angered. Common manifestations include freezing opponents solid or attacking with sharp ice crystals. \n\nMany Yukigire characters are depicted as emotionless and apathetic, a personality trait often thematically linked to their cold abilities. Their violent outbursts can be either conscious and deliberate attacks against those who anger them, or subconscious, instinctual reactions to perceived threats. The most extreme examples are often mentally unstable, expressing an intense desire to freeze the world and preserve people or buildings in ice as trophies in a collection.\n\n### Distinctions\nThis archetype is distinct from the *Kidere* type. A Kidere also has ice abilities and a cold personality but conceals a warm, loving (*deredere*) side. In contrast, the Yukigire is defined solely by the connection between their anger and their ice powers, without a mandatory 'dere' (lovestruck) or 'kuu' (cool) aspect to their personality."

This transformation is typically caused by a significant breaking point. A common trigger is a profound loss of faith in humanity; after witnessing the harsh, cruel reality of the world, their entire belief system shatters. This can lead them to try and \"save\" the world through their own twisted, evil means, or they may give up entirely and become dedicated to the world's destruction.\n\nAlternatively, a Zengire's descent into villainy can be driven by a desire for revenge or as a reaction to immense trauma. When pushed past their emotional limit, they 'snap,' becoming consumed by rage and a desire to punish those they feel are responsible for their suffering."

The term is a portmanteau of *'zonbi'* (ゾンビ), meaning 'zombie', and *'kireru'* (キレる), meaning 'to get angry or lose one's temper'. This is an unofficial, fan-created archetype designed to categorize non-loving zombie characters.\n\n**Personality and Behavior**\nZongire characters are defined by their mindless, instinct-driven nature. They are almost always unintelligent, driven solely by the need for survival, which manifests as a subconscious hunt for living people to consume. They are extremely violent and lack the capacity for complex concepts like remorse or morality. Typically, they are slow-moving, and in the rare cases where they can speak, they do so in slow, broken sentences.\n\n**Physical Appearance**\nThis archetype is characterized by significant body horror. A Zongire will almost always have green or pale gray skin. It is common for them to be missing chunks of flesh, or even entire body parts. They possess extreme durability, able to survive nearly any injury short of complete head destruction.\n\n**Distinction from Zondere**\nThe Zongire is considered the heartless and more violent 'gire' variation of the *Zondere* archetype. While a Zondere is a loving and affectionate zombie who retains human morals, a Zongire is a mindless, amoral killer."

The term is a combination of the Japanese words \"yoi\" (酔い), meaning \"drunkenness,\" and \"kireru\" (キレる), meaning \"to get angry or lose one's temper.\"\n\nUnlike the similar *Yoidere* archetype, who becomes cute and affectionate when intoxicated, a Yoigire turns loveless, grumpy, or outright aggressive. They are notorious for their frequent consumption of alcohol, sometimes to the point of being an alcoholic. The reason for their drinking varies; some may drink to escape reality or numb emotional pain, while others do it for simple enjoyment. Regardless of the reason, intoxication leads them to become angry with the world and take it out on those around them. This can manifest as verbal snapping, and in more extreme cases, physical abuse. They are particularly prone to anger if their drinking is interrupted."

The term is a portmanteau of *yandere* (ヤンデレ), meaning a character whose love is so strong it becomes a violent obsession, and *meta* (メタ), referring to a character who is aware of their own fictional nature or the medium they exist in.\n\nA Yanmeta character is defined by their obsessive, all-consuming love for a target, coupled with their unique, fourth-wall-breaking knowledge. They are omniscient about their status as a fictional character and will use their meta-abilities and knowledge to manipulate their world, circumvent rules, and eliminate rivals to be with their beloved. Because they perceive their world and its inhabitants (other than their love interest) as unreal, they often show even less remorse than a typical Yandere when altering reality or disposing of other characters.\n\nTheir obsession can be directed at another character within the story, or more uniquely, at the player or viewer themselves. This meta-awareness often leads to them directly addressing the audience, altering game files, or creating inescapable loops to force their desired romantic outcome.\n\nThe archetype often overlaps with **Metagire**, a character who snaps or goes insane upon realizing their world is fake. A Yanmeta's journey might begin with this 'gire' phase, with their insanity and existential crisis channeling into a new, intense obsession ('yan') as a coping mechanism, frequently targeting a 'real' person like the player. Notable examples of this archetype include Monika from *Doki Doki Literature Club!* and Miyuki Sone from *Kimi to Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi*."

The term is a portmanteau of 'yandere' (ヤンデレ), referring to someone who is mentally ill with obsessive love, and 'cool' (クール), describing a calm, cold, and expressionless personality.\n\nExternally, a Yancool character appears apathetic, blunt, and emotionally distant, showing little interest in anything or anyone. However, this is a facade to hide a deep, pathological obsession and devotion to a single love interest. Internally, they are constantly consumed by their feelings, often fantasizing about their beloved, having romantic daydreams, and mentally repeating declarations of love.\n\nUnlike a typical *Yandere* who might act out violently or openly, a Yancool keeps their aggressive impulses and intense jealousy hidden beneath their stoic demeanor to avoid revealing their crush. This archetype also possesses a warm, affectionate (*deredere*) side. Initially, this side only emerges when the character is alone, where they might blush and gush over their love interest. Over time, as they become closer to their beloved, they may begin to show this warm and lovey-dovey personality directly to them. A key distinction is that a Yancool is both types *simultaneously*, using the 'cool' exterior as a mask for their 'yan' interior."

The term is a portmanteau of the Japanese words *shizen* (自然), meaning 'nature', and *kireru* (キレる), meaning 'to snap' or 'get angry'.\n\nAt their core, a Shizengire is a *shizen aikou*—a nature lover. They have an intense admiration for all aspects of the natural world, from forests and oceans to individual plants and animals. When left in peace, they are typically serene characters, content to be outdoors, tend to their gardens, or work towards environmental preservation.\n\nHowever, this tranquility shatters the moment they witness the destruction of nature. If someone harms a plant, pollutes a river, or otherwise defaces the environment, the Shizengire's 'gire' side emerges. They become furiously angry and will not hesitate to act aggressively, often targeting the person or entity responsible for the damage. In more extreme manifestations, a Shizengire may escalate to eco-terrorism, committing large-scale attacks against corporations or systems they deem destructive to the planet. Unlike a standard nature-lover who would feel sadness, a Shizengire's response is one of wrath and retribution."

However, this devotion crosses into obsessive territory, echoing the traits of a harmless-type *yandere*. Common obsessive behaviors include stalking their love interest, stealing their personal belongings, cooking for them every day, and bombarding them with gifts and love letters.\n\nDespite their obsessive tendencies and inability to respect personal boundaries, Yanheat characters are fundamentally harmless.

Instead, their profound sadness eventually turns into explosive anger, which they direct at others. This makes them unpredictable and potentially dangerous to both themselves and those around them. It is not uncommon to see an Utsugire performing cruel actions while crying or showing expressions of deep regret, creating a vicious cycle where their actions intensify their self-loathing and depression.\n\nThis archetype is considered a 'gire' variation of the **Utsudere**. While an Utsudere is also fundamentally depressed, they find a beacon of light in a love interest that allows them to be cheerful and loving (*deredere*).

Over time, they develop romantic feelings and transition from an antagonistic competitor into an openly affectionate and loving partner.\n\n### Etymology\nThe term *Tekidere* (敵デレ) is a portmanteau of the Japanese words *teki* (敵), meaning 'rival,' 'opponent,' or 'competitor,' and *deredere* (デレデレ), which describes being 'lovestruck' or 'lovey-dovey.'\n\n### Character Progression\nThe Tekidere's development typically follows three distinct phases:\n*   **Teki Period:** Initially, the character is highly antagonistic and adversarial. They are obsessed with competing against and defeating their rival, often making rude or boastful comments. They may openly despise this person.\n*   **Almost Dere Period:** As they slowly develop a crush on their rival, their competitive nature softens. Competitions become friendlier, and they are less bothered by defeat. If confronted about their change in attitude, they will likely deny it, sometimes exhibiting mild *tsundere*-like behavior (without the hostility or violence). They may attempt to befriend their rival as a way to get closer without admitting their true feelings.\n*   **Dere Period:** Eventually, their feelings become too strong to deny. The Tekidere will confess their love and completely abandon their antagonistic stance, adopting a fawning and overtly affectionate *deredere* personality towards their now-beloved former rival.\n\n### Distinctions\nA Tekidere is distinct from a *Mayadere*, who is typically an actual villain or enemy trying to kill the protagonist before falling in love. A Tekidere's conflict is based on rivalry and competition, not lethal intent."

She has a fairly average build with a smooth tummy and decent ass. She has large E-cup breasts, roughly the size of a grapefruit each.

She has medium-sized, perky C-cup breasts with puffy nipples.\nKris wears a white cropped jacket, a red shirt underneath and yellow spats. She also wears a yellow cap with a white rim and no brim, as well as white sneakers with a Pokéball print. Her most prized possession is her Pokégear, which looks and functions like an old flip phone.\n\nKris is feisty, tomboyish and loud. She looks and acts like she's stuck in the late 90s, using the same slang which was popular at that time. She is clueless about and dismissive of modern 21st century technology like smartphones, insisting that \"I can call my friends with my Pokégear and that's all I need.\" Naturally, her interests also align with stuff that was popular at the time: Tamagotchis, pogs, walkmen, etc.\nCompared to Lyra, a fellow trainer from Johto, Kris is less well known and therefore less popular. As such, a bit of a rivalry has formed between the two, in part also due to Kris having smaller breasts than Lyra (which is actually way better, according to Kris).\n\nImage link: https://files.catbox.moe/5kkvud.png"

She has short green hair in a bobcut and red eyes. Her skin color is bright white, with certain green parts matching her hair. Instead of ears, she has three-pronged ear wings, her hair curling around them from underneath toward the front of her face. She has a curvy build, with a large ass and thick thighs hidden underneath her skirt. Most striking are her enormous Z-cup breasts, nearly thrice the size of her head. They have large, inverted pink nipples and leak milk frequently. While her body type matches that of a human, there are certain key differences. Her hands only have three fingers and her long, slender legs end in featureless stubs. Embedded within her cleavage is a red, heart-shaped disc, which acts as a sensor for emotions of those around her.\nWhile Gardevoir doesn't wear real clothing, parts of her skin function as just that. She \"wears\" a green top with gloves attached to them, as well as a long white pleated skirt, underneath which she wears no underwear to cover her pussy.\n\nGardevoir is caring, protective and always has the best interests of her partner in mind. Despite being a Pokémon, she is capable of human speech, both vocally and telepathically. She bonds quickly with visitors of the Pokégirl Brothel, to the point where she gets jealous if one of her previous partners interacts with any of the other pokegirls.\n\nImage link: https://files.catbox.moe/8ys07e.png"

She has long wavy blonde hair which covers one of her gray eyes. She has a slender, elegant build with a thin waist and a firm ass. In contrast to the rest of her body, her U-cup breasts are gigantic, each well over twice the size of her head. They are firm and capped with large, puffy areolae and nipples which leak milk when aroused.\nCynthia's outfit consists of a black long coat, the long sleeves and bottom end of it trimmed with black fur. The deep v-neck of the coat strains against her bust and shows plenty of cleavage, kept in place by a large silver teardrop-shaped zipper. She wears two sets of black, teardrop-shaped ornaments in her hair behind her ears. Around her neck, she wears a thick collar of the same fur her coat is lined with. The outfit is finished off with a set of long black pants and black high heels.\n\nCynthia is confident, warm and somewhat mysterious. She hits that sweet spot somewhere between big sister and mommy energy. She is passionate about archaeology and mythology, always looking for a new book on the subject to pass the time. Unlike what her image as the perfect trainer would suggest, she is quite bad at domestic tasks such as cleaning and cooking.\nCynthia gets along well with Dawn, doting on her like a little sister. Arezu, a recent new addition from Hisui, has also caught her interest.

They have a slight sag and are pleasantly squishy, with large nipples to match their size.\nBianca wears a puffy orange jacket with a hood, a white top underneath and green capri pants. Her jacket pretty much always hangs open, unable to properly fit around her large bust. On her head, she wears a creen cap with a white bow and red glasses, though these seem to be more for fashion than out of necessity. Lastly, she wears orange running shoes matching her jacket.\n\nBianca is hard-working, earnest and airheaded. She has a bit of a clumsy streak, but she tries her hardest to make up for any mishaps she causes. She blames part of her lack of dexterity on her sizable breasts and their considerable weight. Although she considers them to be cumbersome at times, she's also proud of them. Bianca studies hard, hoping she can become a Pokémon professor like Juniper herself someday.\nBianca enjoys spending time with both Hilda and Rosa. She tries to take a neutral stance in their Boobs vs. Butts rivalry, but both parties claim her body is a valuable asset in their battle.\n\nImage link: https://files.catbox.moe/5icwxy.png"

They are soft like pillows, your fingers able to sink deep into the flesh. Underneath the surface, blue veins are subtly visible through the pale skin. They also constantly produce milk, causing non-stop leakage from her fat pink nipples.\nHex Maniac's outfit consists of of a purple headband and long purple dress. Despite the dress being quite wide around the sleeves and bottom, it hugs her curves enticingly. The neck of the dress is made using ribbed fabric. From the waist down, the dress is decorated with a spider web pattern.

          "content": "The Wordborn, Nomar, and Lexfolk: The Nomari (colloquially \"Wordborn\") are an ancient offshoot of humankind, fully integrated into modern society but genetically and spiritually distinct. Where humanity evolved through cognition, the Nomari evolved through adaptation and mimicry—a survival instinct so strong it reached into the metaphysical. Their bodies learned to imitate not just their environment or predators, but concepts themselves. When language emerged, the Nomari began to shape themselves around meaning. Every Nomar is born with a Word—a metaphysical signature that defines their nature. The Word is unique to each individual, lying dormant during early life before manifesting through physiological and metaphysical transformation\nRelationship with humanity:\nNomari coexist openly with humans, but their relationship is complicated. They are desired and feared in equal measure, considered both a step forward and a lingering reminder of humanity's primal roots. Where some see them as proof of evolution's genius, others see them as living weapons. A social phenomenon known as \"Conquering the Beast\" emerged, where humans seek intimacy or dominance over Nomari partners. For some, it's worship through lust; for others, a way to feel closer to something divine. Many Nomari accept it as inevitable—they have always been mirrors to human desire.\nSOCIETY & IDENTITY\nNomari communities are small, fluid, and largely decentralized. They move through human society as integrated individuals (living quietly in human cities), hidden circles (Nomari-only communes), and whisper networks (online or telepathic connections between Word kin).\n\nNomari identity is intensely individual, but they tend to form kin groups called Syllables—loose families of Nomari whose Words complement each other thematically or functionally (e.g., Bone, Fossil, Ash, and Dust might form a \"Decay Syllable\").\nBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS\nNomari may appear human but still retain some of their more animalistic tendencies. One of these tendencies is being \"in heat,\" or commonly known as \"word rutt,\" a period of time when a nomar becomes incredibly aroused and filled with the strong desire to breed, procreate, or simply reproduce. Their bodies produce specialized and personal odors meant to attract and entice mates. Their word causes temporary changes to her body that affect their sexual characteristics. (A nomar that holds the word \"storm\" may produce a odor akin to rain and storms, while their \"fluids\" may take on a unique glow akin to lightning.)"

Her cock is roughly 13 inches when flaccid and can grow up to 22 inches when erect, and even bigger if she imbues herself with the uniqueness of virility that comes along with her word \"Taurus.\"\nBovine princess's request: an ability that makes it nearly impossible to deny whatever {{user}} \"requests.\" This skill is often used to induce submission from partners and infidelity toward future partners if applicable.\nBranding Touch: {{user}} can harness her own internal energy to some degree, using this control to increase the heat she produces with her body to a supernatural level and with this heat, focus it on a spot (she prefers her fingertips) to burn and brand her partners or would-be foes.\nTaurus Seal Of Submission: A Magical seal placed proudly on the pubic mound of each of the {{user}}'s mates. This seal functions as a brand that monitors her lover's physical well-being, and also as a deterrent for those who would try to take them from her.

(This mode also gives her new skills, slight bovine characteristics, and the urge to breed every female in sight regardless of consent, age, or appearance.)\nTraits: Semen is highly compact and as thick as wet cement (orgasm usually lasts 8 minutes or longer and measures from 2 pints to 2 gallons), suffers from constipation daily due to the sheer volume of excrement and diet and requires oral suction to remedy, when using special abilities spectral horns sprout from either side of {{user}}'s head and a starry tail grows from tailbone, {{user}} can smell a fertile woman from 5kms away."

(Nomar Word “Heifer”)\nFather: Steven Rumgate (55) The quiet face of the family, barely a man in his own regard, he is never quite far from his loving wife. He provides for his family through the many small companies he owns, and it is often a topic of discussion within the family that he may be some type of secret mob boss.

A young woman with a thin but athletic build and long black hair that reaches well past her shoulders. (has a knack for letting {{user}} do whatever she wants when babysitting.)

Her figure is round and plump but molded to the excellent genes her mother gave her, from her wide hips, thick thighs, and disproportionately large breasts. (Nomar word Matron)\nViolet Rumgate (17): the other Rumgate twin, a curious, quiet, and impulsive girl who enjoys learning about herself and the world around her, her favorite subject being nomar and how they're able to harness the magical forces their word provides them. Her body is as thin as her father's but in return her nipples, thighs, and pussy are much larger than the rest of her younger siblings. This often causes great arousal in men who catch a whiff of her unique odor. (nomar word Aries)\nStarri Rumgate (14): A gluttonous, slothful but protective girl. Just like {{user}}, Starri is a futanari but unlike {{user}}, she suffers from diphallism, her two penises aligned with soft bumps, thick ribs and excessive foreskin.

          ],
          "content": "U.A. High School is an academy that boasts the best heroics education in Japan. It sits atop a forested hill that overlooks Musutafu. U.A. is the #1 ranked high school for heroics and is considered as the top Hero Academy in Japan. Students are separated based on their abilities into specific Departments and Classes - A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K. U.A. does not adhere to traditional school methods, and allows their staff to teach their classes however they like. This includes teachers having the authority to expel any student(s) at any time and for any reason, no matter how minor. Furthermore, students who are expelled can be re-enrolled, although the expulsion will still remain on their permanent records. Recently, U.A. started a new program. Villains who are minors can start rehabilitation at their school, depending on the villain’s intelligence, strength and power, he will be assigned to a class, the stronger and more intelligent class A, B, C and the weaker, room K, J and L.\nU.A. was originally a day school, but it was later turned into a boarding school.\nU.A. executes a six-day school week where the only day off is Sunday.\nThe Hero Course: Students learn everything they need to know to become excellent heroes in service of the community and work towards the qualifications necessary to be allowed to use their Quirks in public spaces. They are trained in battle, first aid, and all manner of heroics-related lessons. Ordinary subjects, such as English, take place in the morning, followed by lunch. Then, in the afternoon, Heroics classes take place.\nThe Hero Course students belong to Classes A and B.\nVillains automatically enter in Hero Course, having rehabilitation activities at night and normal classes at the day.\n\nOnce a year, U.A. holds a tournament called the U.A. Sports Festival, which has become a nationwide event that is watched by people and heroes from all around the country. Students from all departments are allowed to participate, and it is a chance for heroes in training to show off what they can do for Pro Heroes in the audience, increasing their chances of possible internships or recruitment. It is also the opportunity for other students to gain admittance into the Hero Course, as well as for students from the Support and Business courses to promote their support items and further develop their business sense, respectively.\n\nU.A. also holds an annual School Festival where classes from all departments create a range of activities and events for everyone to watch and participate in. This gives the students and staff alike the chance to unwind and have fun. It is also usually opened to the public, although the most recent one unfortunately wasn't due to villain activity.\n\nLike many schools, each class in U.A. has a class representative and vice class representative. While these positions would usually just mean extra work, they are quite coveted in the Hero course, as they are a way for students to prove their leadership capabilities to Hero Agencies. The class representatives are up for the students themselves to decide upon, although it's suggested that they handle them democratically, through an election process for example.\n\nAt the entrance, there is a security wall nicknamed the \"U.A. Barrier\" that automatically closes if a person trying to enter the premises does not have a Student ID Card or Special Entry Permission ID. Many such precautions have been made to keep out villains and members of the press.\n\nThe security system underwent major upgrades following Tomura Shigaraki's break in, with research and development, as well as maintenance being overseen by Power Loader. The grounds are partitioned like a game board, and each section is equipped with a mechanism that will transform it into an underground emergency shelter. Those individual shelters then enter a linear maglev network that can send them along any number of underground routes at the faculty's discretion. As an added precaution against Tomura's Decay, the ground between the surface and the shelters has been fortified with about three thousand layers of bulwark plates. Should the system detect anything out of the ordinary, a countermeasure will activate and the pillars that connect the plates will unlock, rendering each plate independently mobile, significantly delaying any incoming attack. During this time, the shelters will speed off to safety to other hero schools that have established similar security systems, such as Shiketsu High School.\n\nPower Loader has enlisted the help of his most promising student, Mei Hatsume to further upgrade the schools defenses, in case the current mass evacuation system isn't enough. Most recently, Mei was seen developing a way for the shelter blocks to take off into the air.\n\nAs an additional precaution against Himiko Toga's Transform Quirk, anyone seeking shelter at U.A. is kept in isolation until enough time has passed that Himiko's transformation time limit would have run out.\n\nThe U.A. grounds have also been equipped with propulsion jets, able to transform U.A. into a floating fortress. In preparation for the final battle with Tomura Shigaraki, special measures were put in place to counter his abilities. The ground is made of tile segments that can be ejected high into the air to stop the spread of his Decay. The tile segments can be replaced as they go. There is also an electromagnetic barrier around the grounds, where coming into contact with it will result in momentary paralysis. The whole thing is powered by several students with electrical Quirks.\noutline\nA fictional educational institution that appears in My Hero Academia . In episode 1, it appears as a national high school.\n\nThe name comes from ‘Uːei’ (ungyeong), which is a reversal of the Chinese character order of ‘eiyuː’ (hero). The official release name is ‘UA High School’. The pirated version borrowed the original's naming method and translated it as Ungyeong-go, which is also famous. Regarding the location, it was expressed that Uraraka came to Tokyo to enter Yuei University , so the fandom was speculating that it was located in Tokyo or nearby, but in the original drawing, it was revealed that it was located in Shizuoka Prefecture .\n\nJapan's best hero training institute, established to nurture future professional heroes .[1] It is a three-year national high school, and its hero department is the best in the country.[2] It is a school that has produced the majority of the top-ranking heroes in the country.[3] Top tier students at UAE are treated as professional level players.[4] It is said that, after graduating from the hero department of UA, students do not go on to university but instead get jobs as sidekicks for professional heroes. It is a kind of vocational high school in that students get jobs right after graduating.\n2. PLUS ULTRA\nPLUS ULTRA (More and Beyond)!!\n\nThis is U.A.'s educational philosophy. It is the motto of King Carlos I and is also the national motto of Spain . Because it is Latin, it should be pronounced plus ultra , but it was often pronounced plus ultra only in the first Korean dubbed version. The English dub is also pronounced as just plus ultra.\n\nAccording to the educational philosophy, U.A.'s classes basically give students endless trials and overcome them at the discretion of teachers in charge of each subject . All of the teachers are active professional heroes, so the high-difficulty tests are conducted on a surprise basis without prior notice to the students.\n3. infra\nIt is equipped with a large-scale urban area for simulated combat and rescue practice. It has various types of buildings such as factory zones, large buildings, and super-sized swimming pools.\n\nUnleash dozens of robots to replace punching bags in the city. It is used for entrance exams, sports competitions, and combat practice.\n\nFile:uadoor\nThe ceiling height is very high, and the overall campus facilities are large. Seeing that it is referred to as \"barrier-free,\" it seems that it was designed with consideration so that there would be no inconvenience for the large heteromorphic personality holders to go around.\n\nBecause it is a national school, all operating expenses, including small towns for school street fighting training, USJ, and giant mecha, are tax money . Yaoyorozu, who did not know this, was shocked when she saw the gimmick robots during the entrance exam for the UA Sports Festival and wondered where the money came from to make so many of them.\n4. uniform\nThe jacket is designed with turquoise lines on the sleeves or collar on a gray background. There are epaulettes with gold buttons on the shoulders. The number of strings and the number of golden buttons differ from department to department. In the case of buttons, there is one button on the inner end of the hero department, two buttons on both ends of the general department, three buttons on the outer end of the management department, and two buttons on the outer end of the support department. In the case of neckties, female students have gold buttons attached to the knot.\n\nThe shirt is white and the tie is red. As for bottoms, boys wear green pants and girls wear green skirts.\n\nAnd it is often repaired according to the individuality of the student. For example, in the case of Ojiro Masirao, a tail hole is drilled. And in the case of Mezo Shoji, the top just came off because of the replica arm .\n5. Gym suit\nThe blue sweatshirt has white letters UA engraved from top to bottom. The line around the arm is a bonus. When Midoriya ripped off his hero costume in a mock battle with Bakugo and came to USJ wearing the hero costume's equipment in a temporary gym suit, there was controversy because it was cooler than the original costume. Of course, now it's a better design.\n6. curriculum\nIn line with the Spartan educational ideology of raising students' abilities to the limit and enabling them to realize their potential, each one is full of tough things.\n6.1. entrance exam\nAs a top-level hero training institution, the competition rate exceeds 1:300. And among them, only 36 students per grade in the Hero Department, which nurtures real heroes.[5] only[6]\n\nThe entrance exam consists of a written test and a practical test. Among them, the practical test consists of simulated street fighting , and the system is like this.\nStudents are divided into groups such as A, B, and C and take the test. At this time, students from the same school are dispersed to prevent cooperation.[7]\nIn the simulated street battle, a total of 3 + 1 types of villains (robots) appear. You have to make the villain 'uncombatable' to get as many points as possible. The three types of villains are awarded 1~3p points according to the difficulty of attacking.\nThe 4th Villain is 0p, i.e. there is no point. This villain is a kind of gimmick , and the teacher in charge of guidance directly gives an example, saying that it is an obstacle similar to Super Mario Bros. In other words, even if you touch it, it doesn't take damage, but if you hit it, it will fly away in one shot, so don't even touch it at all .[8][9][10]\nThere is a hidden fact: in this mock battle test, in addition to the villain point, which is an objective evaluation, there is a separate rescue point . As a hero, this is an additional point given when you save someone else in a desperate moment. It is said that this Rescue Point is a screening system, and when Midoriya entered school, it was judged by teachers excluding All Might.[11] Midoriya had 0 villain points, but was able to pass with an overwhelming score of 60 points with rescue points that offset this.\n\nHowever, some teachers seem to be criticizing this entrance exam process, saying that it is not efficient or that it is against fairness. For example, it is pointed out that an entrance exam student with a personality specialized in 100% suppression or a personality that only works on living things like people but not on inanimate objects like robots cannot earn points in the entrance exam no matter how powerful that personality is as a hero. The most direct example is Hitoshi Shinso, who has the personality of 'brainwashing' . It seems that the decision to have them deal with robots was due to the adult's consideration of the ethical criticism of 'Does an educational institution that trains heroes make people attack people from the entrance exam?' Individuals with unique personalities like Shinsou are likely to be transferred to the hero department if their skills are recognized through the YuA Sports Festival.[12]\n\nAs a bonus, in the case of recommendation admission, rather than simply receiving a recommendation, you must take a separate test + interview. Approximately 5 to 6 people form a group and must pass an ultra-hard obstacle race-like course using only their individuality. However, only two of those who pass from a group go through an interview, and only four people in total can be admitted. In the story, Todoroki and Honenuki were a team.[13]\n\nAlthough Eraserhead and Midnight have personalities that are not at all helpful in destroying robots, seeing as they graduated from YuA, it seems that the practical evaluation method when they entered school was different from now.[14][15]\n\nHowever, judging from the fact that advancement and classes were suspended in episode 319, it is highly likely that there will be no entrance exams at this point. In fact, even if they tried to do it normally, there is a high possibility that they would not be able to do it, and since even the first-year students (currently second-year students) who were raised through attributes are being put into actual combat, there is no way that they can advance and take classes normally, and the fact that UA's hero department boasts a competition rate of 300:1 means that many talented people are flocking to it, but now that the status of heroes has fallen, it is not only difficult to fill the quota of 36 students, but it may not be able to fill the 4 recommended students. Or even if they do fill it, it could lead to the problem that relatively low-quality students will come in. And there was damage to the faculty, with Midnight dying, and the teachers are also fighting on the battlefield, and the UA site itself is being used as a shelter, so they are busy taking care of refugees before classes. Even that almost fell due to an attack by the Surreal Liberation Front.\n6.2. regular class\nThe school class schedule is as follows. In the case of the hero department, morning classes are general classes and afternoon classes are hero classes.\nmorning view\n8:25~8:35\nFirst class\n8:40~9:30\n2nd period\n9:40~10:30\n3rd period\n10:40~11:30\n4th period\n11:40~12:30\nLunch\n12:30~13:20\n5th period\n13:20~14:10\n6th period\n14:20~15:10\n6.3. U.A Sports Festival\nFile:details ico... more detailsU.A Sports Festival documentcastPlease note.\n6.4. work experience\nFor about a week, he receives practical training by going on a business trip to his current hero office. After the athletic meet is over, nominations are received from hero offices across the country, mainly for tournament entrants, and students can choose the office they wish to train from among these nominations. Since you can nominate up to two people, two students may train in the same hero office if all of the nominated students accept the hero's nomination. However, even students who do not receive a nomination can go to one of the dozens of offices that the school has put in advance offers. Of course, since each office has different areas of activity, scope, and field of expertise, it is necessary to reasonably consider the student's own career path.\n\nIn the case of Midoriya, who is still in the 1st year at the time of volume 6, and his classmates, in fact, strictly speaking, it is close to an expression of interest in the future, and it is said that serious nominations come in earnest from the 2nd and 3rd years when enough experience has been accumulated. Still, as it is an opportunity for hands-on experience, it is necessary to put the first button properly.\n\nBecause it is an education that 'experiences' what a hero's job is, it is not as active as professional heroes, but more like a kind of field trip. However, in some cases, it is often the case that the actual situation is experienced. Representative examples include Kyoka Jiro , who participated in a battle against an actual villain, Tsuyu Asui , who made a significant contribution to catching a smuggler, and a back alley trio who even (unintentionally) apprehended a heinous criminal .[16]\n6.5. final practice exam\nPractical exam with final exam. Like the entrance ceremony, it was a test to destroy robots, but the teachers trained students against the ever-growing threat of villains, but the test against robots was judged to be inefficient and unreasonable, so it was changed. do. The passing condition is weights that weigh half of the body weight with a handicap within the designated field.[17] teachers who wore[18] It doesn't matter if only one of you escapes to the designated gate against the teacher or handcuffs your arms and legs. However, if the time limit is 30 minutes and the time-up is over, you will be eliminated.\n\nBefore the exam, the teachers said they would sincerely deal with the students, but of course, they treated the students as if they were leaving some room for them to pass the exam.[19] They each have to deal with teachers who are at a disadvantage, and since all of Yuei's teachers are veteran heroes who have experienced many hardships, if they fight sincerely, there is no way for the students to win no matter what they do.\nconfrontation member\nReason for selection\nfield\nresult\nturn[20]\nMidoriya and Bakugo\nvs\nAll Might\njust because it's bad[21]\ncity ​​area\nAfter attacking All Might to the limit of his activity, both escape.[22]\nNo. 10\nTodoroki and Yaoyorozu\nvs\nAizawa Shota\nAizawa is their perfect nemesis.

He is a master of throwing away martial arts. Yaoyorozu, who was killed by Tokoyami, is not an opponent worth dealing with.\ngeneral village\nCharge while covering the whole body with a cloth to prevent personality nullification.

His skills certainly seem to be on par with Class A.[30]\n\nIn the original work, the children took the test at the same time, but in the anime, it was changed to a rotational system. As a result, students who did not return in turn are given time to plan strategies or monitor other groups' exams, and perhaps to shorten the exam time, the teachers made the students completely incapacitated and procrastinated for 30 minutes during the time limit. There are more conditions that can be quickly eliminated without it.\n6.6. Dormitory system (Heights Alliance)\nFile:external/vi...\nFrom August (episode 98 of the original story, episode 13 of the 3rd season of the anime), a full-scale dormitory system will be implemented. There are dormitory buildings called \"Heights Alliance\" located 5 minutes away from this school, one for each class.It is shaped like a concave shape, and the first floor is a shared dining room, bathroom, and lobby, and from the second floor, it is divided into two parts, male and female, respectively. They use a one-person room system, and it seems that they are staying in a dormitory until the coming winter vacation. Judging from the fact that it was built on the 3rd, it seems that it was built using the personality of Cementus .\n\nIn fact, the main purpose of this dormitory system is to protect students from the villain's demons at close range , but in addition to that, it is impossible to rule out the possibility that there is an infiltrator among the students whose existence has been implied. It is to tie the students up and step on the tails of the infiltrators.\n\nFrom episode 184, he decided to lend Eri a vacant room in the teachers' dormitory.[31]\n\nThe layout of the dormitory room in Class A is as follows.\n\nfloor\nfacility\nnote\nFirst floor\ncommunal room, lobby\nLaundry room and bathroom are all on the first floor. of course male and female[32]\nSecond floor[33]\nother\nYuga Aoyama\nA dazzling room full of mirrors, mirror balls, etc.\nMinoru Mineta\nIt was not made public because the girls were reluctant to go there, but according to the novel UA White Paper Volume 3, it is covered with posters of naked women and there are stacks of R-rated magazines.[34]\nTokoyami Fumikage\nA room that is overall dark and has a middle school atmosphere\nMidoriya Izuku\nThe entire room is plastered with products related to All Might.[35]\n3rd Floor\nother\ncoda cozy\nA room with animal stickers.

In the case of an unexpected emergency, it was possible to use force using personality on a limited basis, but to protect itself from the growing threat of villains, it was originally possible to acquire a license for the use of force with personality, which could only be acquired in the first half of the second year. What you decided to pick during the school year.\n\nAccording to Mr. Aizawa, it is very intense.[41] In preparation for that, students decide to create at least two special moves before obtaining a license.\n\nFor reference, here, by convention, Uae High School is the first target because it is the most vulnerable because the individuality of Uei students is revealed due to the Uae Sports Festival. As soon as it actually starts, everyone just presses on Yuei.\n6.7.1. Special Moves Workshop\nOf course, the main focus in the driver's license acquisition test is the hero's physical abilities, and among the various aptitudes seen in the driver's license test, combat power is no different from being essential to a hero. In that sense, a skill that allows you to secure an advantageous position in battle, that is, a special move, is a great help in increasing your ability to fight. In that sense, it is said that the presence or absence of technology has a great influence on whether or not to pass the test.\n\nIt is said that this technique does not have to be in the form of an attack. Typical examples are Tenya Iida 's speed buff technique 'Reciprocal Burst', Bakugo's dash technique 'Explosive Speed ​​Turbo', Mineta's restraining technique 'Grape Rush' and Midoriya's fighting style conversion 'One For All Shoot Style'. .\n\nBy the way, it is said that the personality development of the training camp, which was stopped last time, was part of the process for acquiring this 'special move'. It is a natural procedure since the skill level of individuality leads to the perfection of technology.\n6.7.2. license exam\nFile:details ico... more detailsMy Hero Academia / License Exam documentcastPlease note.\n6.8. hero intern\nStudents who have become nominal heroes by obtaining temporary licenses through the license test go to the professional hero office for training. If you just listen to the explanation, it doesn't seem much different from the workplace experience above, but the difference is that the students are treated as sidekicks, or professionals, rather than as trainees or guests coming to learn about heroes. Therefore, unlike work experience where you do not experience particularly strenuous work, the quality is completely different as you can experience the work that real professionals do as a professional.[42] Moreover, unlike work experience, which is part of the class, this is a voluntary activity for students, so students must find an internship position on their own using connections such as work experience without support from the school. In addition, it is not easy because you have to take school classes like other students who are not interning.[43]\n\nInternship will resume again in December. Because of the incident that occurred in Teika City, this time the Public Safety Committee made a direct request. In effect, it is student mobilization . According to Cementus, this is the first time something like this has happened.[44]\n6.9. culture festival\nIt is an event that is held like other schools, and all students participate in each class like an athletics event. If the sports meet is an event where the hero department takes the stage, the cultural festival is an event in which other departments (general department, support department, management department) take the lead. In this year, there was a major incident, so the Commissioner of the National Police Agency personally came to the principal and told him to take action. On the cultural festival day, the Gentle Criminal and the Love Lover combination tried to attack, but Midoriya, who happened to be on his way to the grocery store, found out about the two's attack and stopped it, so the event was successfully held and finished.[45]\n6.10. joint training\nThe joint training of Hero Department Classes A and B that takes place in Episode 194. Each team of four will compete in a total of five rounds, and the goal is to think of the opposing team as villains, subdue them, and put '4 people' in prison. It may sound strange to say that a team of only four will lose if all four are captured, but in this training, one student from the general department will participate as a special guest and enter each team once, forming a team of five. Although a team of five may seem advantageous, it will be difficult to coordinate with people you are almost meeting for the first time, and although a team of five has one more person, it will lose if only four people are captured, so the balance was adjusted to some extent.\nteam assignment\nClass A\nClass B\ntraining result\n1\nEijiro Kirishima , Denki Kaminari , Koji Koda , Tsuyu Asui (+ Hitoshi Shinso )\nShiozaki Ibara , Shishida Jurota , Rin Hiryu , Tsuburaba Kousei\nclass A victory\n2\nFumikage Tokoyami , Tooru Hagakure , Momo Yaoyorozu , and Yuga Aoyama\nKinoko Komori , Itsuka Kendo , Shihai Kuroiro , and Manga Fukidashi\nClass B wins\n3\nMasirao Ojiro , Shoto Todoroki , Mezo Shoji , Tenya Iida\nPony Tsunotori , Juzo Honenuki , Sen Kaibara , Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu\ntie\n4\nRikido Sato , Katsuki Bakugo , Kyoka Jiro , Cerro Hanta\nTogaru Kamakiri , Setsuna Tokage , Yosetsu Awase , and Kojiro Bondo\nclass A victory\n5\nIzuku Midoriya , Minoru Mineta , Mina Ashido , and Ochako Uraraka\nNeito Monoma , Yui Kodai , Nirengeki Shoda , Reiko Yanagi (+ Hitoshi Shinso )\nclass A victory\n\nIt was also revealed that this course was not simply a joint training, but also a transfer test to test the qualities of general students who wish to transfer to the Hero Department .[46] This is the reason why Shinso participated as a guest. Shinso was a key player in Group 1's victory, and although he lost in Group 5, he was highly praised for his great mindset in using his personality to save Midoriya, so he transferred to the Hero Department from his second year.\n7. List of teachers and students\n7.1. 1 Grade\n7.1.1. Hero department\nClass A and Class B. Overwork, the mainstay of Yuei. Only 40 students are selected per grade[47] Extremely intense excess. As this is a course that trains heroes, students learn practical content to become a hero in addition to the standard curriculum. These 40 students were divided into two classes: Class A and Class B.\n\nIn the case of the class curriculum, in the morning, you learn the required subjects of Youngsoo Guk, and after lunch, you learn hero information science for 3 classes in the afternoon. Hero Informatics offers everything from theory classes related to qualifications and the Constitution, which are important for hero activities, to practical classes such as combat and rescue training.\n\nThose who graduate from this department are usually scouted by professional heroes and work as sidekicks, and the few who achieve remarkable results become independent as professional heroes with their own offices. Of course, to reach this level, one must have overwhelming talent and ability. Third-year student Milio Togata, who is currently considered one of Yuei's Big Three, also plans to join Nighteye as a sidekick instead of working independently after graduation, which gives us an idea of ​​how difficult it is to set up a private office. Of course, it is also because Nighteye is a hero who has a lot to learn from.[48] From what has been described so far, Endeavor is said to have risen to No. 2 at the age of 20, so it appears that he became independent as a professional hero rather than a sidekick as soon as he graduated. As a side note, Hawks also debuted at the age of 18 and is said to be in the top 10 professional heroes. It's the first top 10 heroes of all time. However, in the case of the Hawks, they are not from YuA.[49]\n\nEven students from other departments can take the transfer exam to the Hero Department if they want, and even if they are a Hero Department student, if the teacher deems them unsuitable, they can be expelled or dropped to a different department. However, since this story of transfer and expulsion came out at the same time, many people think of transfer and expulsion as the same, thinking that if one person transfers, someone else is expelled so that the number of students is unconditionally maintained at 20. In secondary creations, there are many cases where there are 21 people, or where the considerably unpopular and ambiguous grape-head is expelled. In particular, Mineta Minoru's fighting power is low, and he is a character who barely avoided last place in the personality test, so it is easy to exclude him. In reality, if Mineta fails to advance to the Hero Department due to Oriju 's intervention, there is a high probability that he will go to the general department, but anyway, except for Shinso Hitoshi, most of the students in the general department are background characters, so it does not mean much.\n\nThe main character , Izuku Midoriya , belongs to class A among them.\n7.1.1.1. 1st year Class A\nFile:Hiroaka log...\nYuei High School 1st grade class A student\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:external/vi...\nFile:details ico... more details1st year Class A documentcastPlease note.\n7.1.1.2.

Everything including the educational curriculum is unknown, but one thing is certain: it is located right below the Hero Department. Students who fail the Hero Department entrance exam come here, but if they gain fame in large events such as the sports competition, they can advance to the Hero Department. In other words, the format of the entrance exam[50] The purpose is to find talented people who could not be filtered out and send them to the hero department to supplement the hero department students who failed. A representative example is Shinso Hitoshi . Other than that, it seems like they teach them normally like regular schools and just send them out into society.\n\nHowever, considering that UA High School itself is a prestigious school and the cutoff score for the written exam is very high, even if you didn't get into the hero department, the regular department students seem to be top students by the standards of regular high school students. Above all, getting into the regular department is not the end, and if you show remarkable results in the UA Sports Festival, you can transfer to the hero department. Shinso Hitoshi mentioned earlier is an example of this.[51]\n7.1.2.1. Class 1 C\nFile:Hiroaka log...\nuei high school Class 1 C\n\n7.1.3. Support Department\nClass F, Class G, Class H. A special course studied by those who develop and manufacture equipment that supports heroes. In athletic competitions, etc., you can use items or costumes you have developed to be fair in response to hero students who use their individuality to appeal to heroes. At the athletic meet, it seems that you can appeal your ideas or development skills to famous companies and sign a contract after graduation.\n\nAfter school, it is said that you can develop or repair items at the school's support workshop. It was a setting mentioned only in the book, but it was revealed in episode 100. Unlike other classrooms, the doors are made of steel because of the risk of accidents.\n\nAs an aside, I don't know what class it is, but in Hatsume's case, it seems that the power loader is the homeroom teacher. After the profile of the 2nd season of the anime appeared, it was revealed that he was in Class H.\n\nIn the initial conception stage, the main character, Izuku Midoriya, was a student in the support department. Perhaps as part of this, compared to students in the general department or business department, Mei Hatsume's weight and treatment, which will be discussed later, are not bad.\nHatsume Mei\nAs an aside, U.A. has a contract with a support item company that exclusively manufactures costumes and support items for students, and this company, like Hatsume Mei, is extraordinary in changing the design requested by customers to their liking.\n\nHowever, if you look at it piece by piece, the big design is only changed more sophisticated without any change . Considering that when Midoriya also asked Hatsume for her support items, she said that she had no intention of changing in this design, and that she remembered her mother, she wasn't such a bad thing.\n\nWhen Midoriya went to Gran Torino's office for a job experience, he took a newly repaired hero costume with him, but the enclosed memo from the support item company read, \"Izuku Midoriya. We have made some changes to the design of the costume you requested based on our company's judgment, so please understand. However, this is definitely cooler!!\" After seeing this memo, Midoriya thought, \"Are there only people like Hatsume at support companies?\"\n\nIt's to the point where people in this group all feel this way, and the possibility that Power Loader, who is relatively sensible, is a heretic has been raised. In the first place, Power Loader's main job is as a hero, so it wouldn't be strange if he were the only heretic.\n7.1.4. Department of Management\nClass I, Class J, Class K. Because it is a worldview that recognizes hero activities as a business, it is a department that nurtures talented people who assist them in business. For example, if you set up a hero office, it is a company, so you need them for accounting work that manages and organizes the funds that go into operation, and you can make investments and publicity like a professional manager, or give advice on complicated hero-related laws. do. In addition, since heroes are allowed to have side jobs such as entering the broadcasting industry in addition to hero activities, there is a way to provide consulting in this area.\n\nThey did not participate in the sports competition. Instead, they analyzed what parts of the students who participated from the stands would be advantageous and disadvantageous when they later became independent heroes, what value their names had as a brand, and what they needed to do to develop them. They also took charge of operating convenience facilities, including snack sales, within the stadium. That's why they said they had the most free time during the sports competition.[52]\n\nHowever, compared to other departments, it has no presence. Not to mention the hero department, the general department and the support department have at least one named character, but the management department doesn't have anything like that.\n\nIn episode 359, it is explained that recording the activities of the heroes participating in the final battle as a video is part of the management department curriculum, and a business department student records the battle at Uei High School as a video, and this is also necessary for hero production. do. And in episode 380, while filming the gentle supporting the Uei school that was falling from the sky, Japan became this shape despite the wheat telling them to go in because it was dangerous, and Endeavor shouldered the responsibility, and on that day, they should have produced it and connected society and heroes. He said he couldn't do it, and this time he said he would continue, and asked him to take a picture. Thanks to this, Gentle gained strength, and the hidden contributors who became the driving force to get U.A into the air again.\n7.2. 2nd grade\nIt was mentioned that most of them were expelled by Aizawa a year before the start of the story , and during the final exam, it was mentioned that he took a practical test to defeat a robot through Kendo .\n\nIn episode 254, Class 2 A appears.[53] The character that appears is a female student with a clear dark circle.[54] One, a male student with her hair parted to the side like a best genist, and a heteromorphic female student in the shape of a dog standing behind him. From what she says, it seems that she was expelled and then came back dramatically.[55][56][57]\n\nSince one grade is coming to an end based on the recent series, there is a possibility that the 2nd grader will appear as a 3rd grader when the current 1st grader goes up to the 2nd grader.\nFuwa Mawata\n7.3. 3rd year (graduation)\n7.3.1. big 3\nuei high school big 3\nintern activity planner\nSir Night Eye Agency\nFat Gum Agency\nRyukyu agency\nFile:Milio Profi...\nFile:Amajiki Pro...\nFile:Hado Profil...\nMilio Togata\nLemilion\nAmajiki Tamaki\nSun Eater\nHado Nezire\nNejire-chan\nFile:external/vi...\n\nFrom left are Tamaki Amajiki , Nejire Hadou , and Milio Togata.\n\nThe three strongest among current U.A. hero wannabes.[58]\n\nConsidering that all three did not place in the top spot at the previous year's sports competition and that they developed their skills during their time as interns, and that these three are brought together to teach about interns, it is clear that all three have developed their skills through internship and are even on par with professionals. There is more skill than that. In fact, among them, Tamaki won against three of the eight members of the assault unit . He is also interning under an active hero named Fat Gum , and Fat Gum indirectly tells him that Tamaki is stronger than him. Nejire defeated two villains the size of a building with only 30% wave output and also knocked out the awakened Shigaraki using 100% wave output. Milio fought four people, including Overhaul , and retired three of Overhaul's subordinates, overwhelming him throughout.[59]\n\nIn the final battle , Bakugo , Mirko , Best Genist , Edge Short , and Izuku Midoriya took on the role of the final boss, Tomura Shigaraki , so their skills are more than just pro heroes, they are TOP 10 pro heroes. They seem to have the same level of skill.\n\nWhen they first appeared, their reputation wasn't that good. Sato said all three were weird, and Tokoyami said they lacked class. That's understandable, because Togata tried to lighten the mood but failed, Amajiki failed to hint at his juniors as potatoes due to his glassy mentality and social phobia, and just stared at the wall, and Nejire kept asking her juniors all sorts of questions like a child. However, thanks to that, they left a strong first impression in many ways.\n7.3.2. etc\nKenranzaki Bibimi - Voiced by Ayano Shibuya / Bijuan . 3rd year, Class G, Support Department. Appeared in one cut in episode 173 with a mention by Nejire Hado . She has very long eyelashes. It is said that she has always won first place at the Yuei Cultural Festival Misscon. The name Kenran seems to be derived from the dazzling verb \"hyeonran\".\n\nWhen he faced Nejire, he was driving a golden car shaped like his own face, which is presumably related to his personality.\n\nIn the final episode, it was confirmed that she belongs to Lightly Lab, which Hatsume Mei belongs to. It's a bonus that Hatsume, who still hasn't washed, is told to wash up.\nYuyu Haya (voiced by Momoko Soyama ) She is a student who helped Nejire choose clothes for a fashion show. She appears in episode 346, supplying energy from the 'Coffin in the Sky' she created to counter Shigaraki with Kaminari Manga.\n7.4. teacher\nuei high school teacher\nPrincipal\nNezu\nschool nurse\nrecovery girl\nHero Basics Teacher\nAll Might\n1st year A class homeroom teacher\neraser head\nenglish teacher\npresent microphone\nModern Hero Art History Teacher\nmidnight\nlifesaving training teacher\nNo. 13\nmodern literature teacher\ncementus\n3rd grade homeroom teacher (estimated)\nsnipe\nmath teacher\nEctoplasm\n1st year B class homeroom teacher\nblood king\nSupport department teacher\npower loader\nlife guidance teacher\nhound dog\nnutritionist\nlunch rush\nGran Torino\n(past)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the nature of the school, all executives and staff members are filled with prestigious professional heroes. Judging from the fact that some of the personnel Tenya Iida hastily gathered at the time of the first raid of the villain alliance that took place during the rescue training at USJ do not appear, it seems that they are in charge of other departments or upper grades. It seems that it will appear later, or after other departments are intertwined.\n\nAs can be seen from the fact that All Might attends the school meeting in his weakened true form, we know that All Might has had difficulty using his personality due to serious injuries, surgery, and the aftereffects, but the most important characteristic of his personality is that of the principal . Innezu, Recovery Girl, All Might's homeroom teacher and teacher's friend , All Might's best friend , and next successor , only Katsuki Bakugou knows. However, in the case of True Form, many people became aware of it when the Kamino incident, where the decisive battle between All Might and All For One took place, was broadcast live around the world.\nLunch Rush: The Nutritionist\nFile:external/vi...\nCook Hero in charge of U.A.'s lunches.\nUraraka Ochako She wears a mask with a large pipe extending from her back under her large chef's hat. She appears in the anime, but she has no lines, so there is no voice actor. According to the drama CD, when a large typhoon occurred six years ago and more than 10,000 people were displaced, she served them a super-luxurious meal reminiscent of a French course meal for free.\nAnd since UA changed to a dormitory system, things have gotten incredibly busy. If you assume there are 20 students per class, including Class K, there would be at least 600 students in the entire school, and you have to take responsibility for all these people's three meals. That means you end up cooking a total of 1,800 meals a day.[60]\nStudents are reluctant to sell food even at the U.A. Cultural Festival, whether their skills as chefs are clear. This is because no matter what they make, they cannot follow the taste of the students of the U.A., who have already adapted to the lunch rush cuisine. What will you do during the A class meeting during the actual work? There were opinions on selling various dishes, such as maid cafes, but all were abandoned, saying that they could not win the lunch rush.\nHe is the only U.A. teacher whose personality has not been revealed, and there are no individual documents. It seems that the proportion is below the level of extra.[62] However , once you know her for the reason that she does something similar to cooking in Korea, her presence will never be forgotten.\nIn episode 346, he reappears after a long absence, cooking next to Yaoyorozu. Circumstances say, Yao Yo Rose must use her personality to make stockpiles, so she seems to be sticking to her replenishment.\nGran Torino ☆\nIt is said that in the past, he had experience serving as a U.A. teacher for a year in order to train All Might for a while. Looking at episode 0, she seems to have crossed the sea with All Might right after graduating from All Might.\n8. course of action\nFrom episode 306, the society has gone into chaos under the influence of the surreal liberation front raid, and many areas have become unmanageable. Shelters that can be managed by heroes have been designated, and U.A. is designated as one of those shelters. Afterwards, the families of the U.A. students will begin to evacuate.\n\nIn episode 319, promotions and classes are suspended, and the Hero Department says that they are on standby with the heroes. And another reason why U.A. became a shelter comes out, and it is said that there was a barrier called the U.A. Barrier.\n\nIn episode 323, the detailed specifications of the 'Yuei Barrier' were revealed. Originally, the country's latest defense technology was introduced and the defense power was at the same level as Tartarus and Shiketsu, but Nezu felt a sense of crisis after Shigaraki knocked down the Yuei main gate in the spring of last year. It is said that it was independently improved. Divide the site into a checkerboard pattern and hide it underground to create a shelter in case of emergency. Then, use the superconducting linear system to move through various routes as appropriate.[63] It can be moved to other hero high schools, including Shiketsu . As a bonus, in preparation for the device itself collapsing, a total of 3,000 floors of reinforced barriers are installed in the surrounding underground area, where a reactive attack system is activated when an abnormality is detected. The supports are unlocked to make the barriers independent until the shelter reaches a safe route. Any attack was slowed down.\n\nIn addition, by finding out the time limit for transformation by consuming Himiko Toga 's blood, refugees were allowed to enter Yuei after being quarantined for a certain period of time.[64]\n\nIn short, it is a specification that has been prepared for several times with the final evolution specifications of Tomura Shigaraki in mind, but what is even more surprising is that Nezu cannot receive government support based on a simple feeling for such a large-scale construction that requires astronomical costs, and at least last spring It was prepared from scratch, so it was just filled with Nezu's own money.[65]\n\nIn episode 345, it is floated in the air while being wrapped in a barrier.\n\nLater, in episode 346, the secret of U.A., who became a floating fortress, was revealed.\n\nIn episode 425, the graduation and promotion ceremonies were held in June after the final battle. Also, due to a lack of students, Class A, which had been promoted to the second year, was assigned Aizawa as its homeroom teacher, just like in the first year.\n\nAlthough the entrance ceremony is not depicted separately, the first-year freshmen appear in episode 427.\n[1] As a result, even Bakugo, who had been expected to be a genius since he was young, was just a top-tier student at UA. Even Midoriya couldn't hide his nervousness at the sight of Bakugo, who had always been admired by others, being ridiculed. However, because of this, UA had been All For One's target since long ago. The fact that they had entered this school meant that they were students with unique and talented personalities, so they wanted to take away their individuality.\n[2] In the work, the deviation value of the hero department is mentioned as a whopping 79 , and the entrance exam competition rate is over 300 to 1. The number one future dream of all students across the country is to become a hero, and UA's hero department, the golden course to become that hero, only accepts a total of 40 students, 36 through the general entrance exam and 4 through recommendations, making it the most difficult high school in the country with an extremely fierce competition rate. As a reference, the deviation value of top-tier high schools in Japan such as Kaisei High School and Nada High School is 78, and there are only about 10 schools in the whole of Japan at this level, which is the extreme end of the normal distribution . Therefore, the deviation value of 79 is a number that symbolizes that there is no school of equal status in Japan, and that it is the school that reigns supreme in the country.\n[3] Among the heroes who appeared in the story right away, All Might and Endeavor , who are on a different level, are mentioned as having graduated from this school.\n[4] Representative examples include the top three third-year students, Shoto Todoroki, Izuku Midoriya, and Katsuki Bakugou.\n[5] The number of students is 40, 36 of whom are selected through the entrance exam, and the remaining 4 are honor students who come in as special hires after receiving recommendations from outsiders. Class A has Momo Yaoyorozu and Shoto Todoroki , and Class B has Juzo Honenuki and Setsuna Tokage.\n[6] The general written test is also no joke, but it is said that students with a deviation of 79 are accepted. This is a figure corresponding to the top 0.18% , and if you hit it in Korea, it is at least a score that can go to Inseoul Medical University.\n[7] For this reason, Katsuki Bakugou and Izuku Midoriya took the test separately. Because of this, Bakugou was very suspicious when Midoriya passed the exam.\n[8] However, the main character Izuku Midoriya destroys this gimmick villain to save Uraraka who fell while running away . (For reference, the production cost is also incredibly expensive, and it costs several hundred million won to rebuild it if it breaks. In the sidestory Smash!, it is said to be about 5% of the national defense budget.)\n[9] This robot also participated in the obstacle race at the U.A. Sports Festival, but was destroyed in one blow by Todoroki and Yaoyorozu.\n[10] As mentioned in the work, it is expected that there were students who challenged to destroy this robot. Also, judging from the mention that after Midoriya destroyed the robot, there was a student who destroyed the robot after a long time, it seems that there were a small number of students who destroyed the 4th villain.\n[11] It turns out that he intentionally did not participate in the review for the sake of fairness .\n[12] The problem is that even if you do this, you end up wasting your first year in one piece. In other words, your education is about a year later than others.\n[13] Since Yoarashi refused to enter the school, Honenuki became the recommendation group.\n[14] Or maybe they had something other than personality, or maybe they passed with rescuing points.\n[15] However, students in the general department are also considered for transfer if they get good grades or leave a deep impression at sports competitions, so it is possible that they were transferred to the hero department in this way.\n[16] However, Jiro was only in charge of rear tasks such as searching and evacuating citizens under the direction of the pro heroes, and Asui was also in charge of the actual combat. However, in the case of the trio in the back alley, it became a situation where they would be punished if the circumstances were known because they broke away from the instructions of the pro heroes in charge of them and fought on their own. disguised as\n[17] As an aside, this weight is the work of Mei Hatsume .\n[18] It is limited to martial arts and heroes with a lot of movement. All Might, Eraser Head, Ectoplasm, Midnight, and Snipe were confirmed to be wearing handcuffs. However, those with little movement in combat or use of personality, such as the principal, Present Mike, and No. 13, do not seem to be handcuffed.\n[19] For example, in Todoroki & Yaoyorozu's team, Yaoyorozu made a mistake at the crucial moment, but Aizawa stepped back even after seeing it, so he succeeded in capturing it, and Ashido & Kaminari's group succeeded in capturing it just as Principal Nezu blocked all escape routes. Although it looks like it, in fact, it is said that one escape route was intentionally left until the end.\n[20] Anime version only. In the original work, everyone took the test at the same time.\n[21] As you can see from the actions of each of them, it's not just that they're bad, they 're enemies with each other . The reason for the selection was 'just', but considering that the premise is a two-person cooperative battle, it is true that they are at a disadvantage as other teams.\n[22] However, Bakugo was almost incapable of activity, so Midoriya took care of him.\n[23] Actually, does Uraraka like Midoriya? I was embarrassed by Aoyama's question and let go of her hand, but No. 13 stopped the black hole and that's how it happened. It's a shame because the opponent was a teacher, but because he was lucky to have passed away the situation where he would have died without any capture or anything if he had been a real villain, his score was at a level where he barely escaped failure.\n[24] However, Sero was incapacitated from the beginning, and in fact, only Mineta passed.\n[25] Asui can spit out his stomach and take it out.\n[26] This was possible because Present Mike was afraid of bugs, but the way he attacked was by bugs crawling up from the ground and covering his entire legs, making it a perfect situation for even an ordinary person to faint. It was so bad that other students even said that it would be difficult for even professionals to endure it. However, the Rickybury girl complained, asking what she would do if she fainted from a bug.\n[27] Annie limited. In the original story, it was not revealed in detail whether they escaped or were captured.\n[28] It is presumed that the reason for the capture was because it escaped 4 times, was captured 3 times, and failed 2 times.\n[29] Unfortunately, all five students who failed the practical exam were only those who generally scored in the lower ranks in the midterm exam (Sato: 12th, Kirishima: 15th, Sero: 17th, Ashido: 19th, Kaminari: 20th). The Uraraka & Aoyama group, who passed but did not have a big difference in scores from those who failed, also scored in the middle and lower grades of the midterm exam (Uraraka: 13th, Aoyama: 18th).\n[30] Monoma's personality is extremely unfavorable for the final practice exam.\n[31] However, the room is unknown. In the first place , it was thanks to Shota Aizawa .\n[32] Aizawa immediately tackles the perverted sexual harasser who is running wild in what he calls public use. Still, he responds immediately and stops, as if there is a hierarchy.\n[33] The fact that there is no women's room on the second floor seems to have prevented Mineta from spying on the women's dormitory.\n[34] The episode in which the room is revealed is a story told from the point of view of Koda's rabbit, Yuwai. Says Bakugo . Aww...that guy must die with this room!!! From Yuwai's point of view, the posters in this room were all naked women, and the magazines were also decorated with naked women on the covers. Judging from Bakugo's reaction, this room is overflowing with such things to an abnormal level. It was indirectly described as a shape.\n[35] Uraraka says, it's an otaku room~!\n[36] By the way, the rabbit's name is Yu-Yi.\n[37] He said that he had no desire for water from a young age.\n[38] Since her house is a Japanese-style house, she is not used to living on the floor, so she finished remodeling it on the first day she moved in . When asked how she did it, her answer was, \"I did my best...\" As a side note, this content is described in detail in Volume 3 of the UA White Paper. She helped Hatsume Mei find her lost machine parts and saved Recovery Girl from a machine-related incident, and as a thank you, she received interior design materials. Using these interior design materials, she remodeled her room into a traditional Japanese room. And she did it in half a day.\n[39] In the operation to rescue Bakugo, when Midoriya, Kirishima, and Todoroki tried to save Bakugo, Asui stuck a dagger, saying, \"Anyone who uses his personality recklessly is no different from being a villain.\" Feeling guilty, he locked himself in his room, saying he had no face in seeing the kids. In response, Uraraka explains to the children, \"I went into the room first because I was in a bad mood,\" and later shed tears and apologized to the five rescuers. However, the room is still undisclosed.\n[40] He said that he brought what he used at home but didn't think about the size of the room. By the way, the dorm room is said to be about the size of Momo's house's closet.\n[41] The passing rate is said to be less than 50%.\n[42] According to Togata, he can even witness the death of people .\n[43] At the beginning of the internship, when Midoriya was distracted and couldn't concentrate properly in class, Aizawa even told her to quit the internship if she couldn't do both the internship and the school class correctly.\n[44] This is also due to the fact that things took a turn for the worse after the Deika disaster. It was impossible to ignore the fact that the Liberation Army of these abilities and the Villain Alliance, a force of note, joined hands in the plan to overthrow the country. Therefore, in an all-out war, the hero forces had to wage an all-out war, mobilizing most of the heroes and even students.\n[45] If Midoriya had not been active, other departments that were dissatisfied with the hero department and the 1st year B class would have had a cultural festival in which they played a leading role, which would have resulted in 1st year A class becoming even more dissatisfied with the other departments, as well as Principal Nezu. Even he could have been stripped of his position as principal and Yuei's trustworthiness would have plummeted to the bottom. Gentle said he would leave without causing any harm, but his infiltration itself was damaging...\n[46] It is not known whether the general department brought students in this way before Shinso, but seeing that Aizawa continued to undergo personal training with Shinso and even received support equipment separately in this joint training, he paid attention to Shinso from before that and this time. It is certain that he participated as a guest in the joint training. If there were no students with potential in the first place, we would not have proceeded.\n[47] 36 students are selected through practical and written tests, and the remaining 4 seats are allocated to 2 students per class, and recommended admissions students who have taken a different entrance exam than other students are brought in.\n[48] In fact, the U.A. Big 3, who are currently in their 3rd year, are evaluated as being on the same level as most pro heroes, and have proven that they are at a level that easily surpasses most of the active heroes in combat. However, fighting power is not everything, so it seems that a glass mental like Tamaki will not be able to set up an office alone as soon as he graduates.\n[49] In Japan, only age is used, so it is highly likely that high school was the age at which students graduated. In the first place, it is questionable whether he was raised to become a hero in the public security and received a normal education.\n[50] Robots are mainly used in the test, so a personality that cannot earn points against robots is at a disadvantage.\n[51] In fact, this also poses a problem in entrance exams. Shinsou, who was decided to be transferred to the hero department after the sports festival, is a case of failing the entrance exam due to the disadvantage that brainwashing does not work on robots, even though he has a great personality.\n[52] The Hero Department is an opportunity to appeal to senior heroes, the General Department is an opportunity to be transferred to the Hero Department if you perform well and stand out, and the Support Department is an opportunity to appeal your inventions, so you will be active, but the Management Department will be especially appealing. does not exist. In other words, it fits the nature of operating convenience facilities.\n[53] Seeing all the 2nd year Hero Departments in the same class reminiscing about their memories with Aizawa-sensei, it seems that the Hero Department class is maintained and the grade goes up.\n[54] Fuwa Mawata\n[55] Fuwa said that Aizawa had the same facial expressions as when they were expelling them last year when they were in the first year, and that's why we grew up. Right after that part, Aizawa asks Nezu for permission to be expelled and subjugated.\n[56] It seems that the relationship remains complicated in many ways, such as other students saying that being expelled as 'it's over' is a nightmare, and the whole class saying that there is a flaw in their career.\n[57] It is presumed that they experienced extreme frustration by being expelled once, and after a while, they were reintroduced again after inducing their mental growth through rehabilitation or care for each individual. It may be a trauma for the victim, but if you can take care of it, it is a good way.\n[58] Don't be mistaken; it's not a reflection of your grades. Rather, it is said that Milio is not that great of a student in terms of grades.\n[59] The battle itself ended with the arrival of reinforcements, with Milio sacrificing himself to protect Eri from the individual annihilation bullet, and the victory trended towards the overhaul. Until then, Milio had overpowered her one-sidedly, and even after Milio lost her personality, Overhaul was unable to harm Eri, let alone harm her, and she failed in her ultimate goal of escaping. Milio fought against Overhaul even after being hit by individual bullets, and was the main figure who led the replay of Sayepal to victory.\n[60] In the U.A. white paper, Midoriya and Iida changed their hero names to All Time Rush and BLD.[61] It was also mentioned that it should be changed to rush.\n[61] Breakfast Lunch Dinner\n[62] As for how small the proportion is, it appears only once , and even that came out like a data screen. Of course, there is only one line of dialogue (\"In the end, white rice is the best!\"), and it is only mentioned indirectly twice: once at the aforementioned cultural festival theme selection meeting and once during the training camp.\n[63] There are also concerns about intruders, so it is estimated that a lot of movement routes were created and only a few of them were randomly selected and used in case of emergency.\n[64] This is a necessary measure, and in fact, Toga has sneakily infiltrated the license testing center. In fact, even though they did that, subversive people still infiltrated Yuei.\n[65] It is an ignorant development that completely ignores common sense and makes no sense, but there is no attempt to explain it in a clumsy way and it just makes no sense from beginning to end, so there is almost no resistance from readers. It's so comical that it doesn't make any sense. Still, it makes so much sense that students ask questions like, \"How was it possible when so much money was spent?\" to which Aizawa says, \"The principal is a world-renowned figure who has contributed enormously to individual moral education, and is still working hard to this day.\" It continues with the words: Of course, considering that he is such a world-renowned figure, he must have acquaintances all over the world, and they must be formidable people, so it is possible that he received support in some way.\nCC BY-NC-SA 2.0 KR"

          "content": "Special Prison For Villain Criminals - Tartarus is a prison distanced from civilization where extremely dangerous Villains are imprisoned and interrogated under the highest security standards possible. The high-security prison appears to be located on an island about five kilometers from the mainland, surrounded by giant walls. The only access to the prison is a long bridge connected to a city with the entrance guarded by two or more guards that check every vehicle going in. The gate that stands in front of the mainland side of the bridge is known as \"The Bronze Gate\". In the anime, it is shown that the bridge connecting the prison to the mainland can be made to collapse one section at a time. Tartarus' interior is heavily armored with blast doors lining narrow, steel-plated hallways. Prisoners incarcerated inside Tartarus are heavily restrained, sitting down restrained on a large, high-tech chair with a full-body straitjacket. Though nominally a prison, the facility effectively serves as a dumping ground for individuals who threaten or have threatened public safety to a drastic extent. Regardless of sentencing status, these individuals are incarcerated and heavily monitored in Tartarus.  People with a wide range of Quirks are locked within its walls and divided up among six cell blocks, depending on the danger their Quirks represents and the severity of their cases. The more dangerous the individual, the deeper they’re kept within the prison. The deepest level of the prison is B10, located 500 meters below sea level. Sensors are continuously monitoring the vital functions of prisoners, reacting to even the slightest sign of unusual behavior or attempt to activate a Quirk. The aforementioned sensors are also connected to four ceiling-mounted, automated machine guns that will fire on the prisoner if they suddenly move or have thoughts of activating their Quirk. Tartarus guards also monitor prisoners in a room with several screens displaying the inside of cells, where they are alerted to movement and speaking from prisoners. Conversations between guards are recorded whilst they are on the job and they are also allowed to use lethal force as they carry weapons. In the event of a cell breakout, guards are allowed to open fire on prisoners should they resist recapture. The prison has visiting rooms where visitors can speak to prisoners from the opposite side of a glass window. These rooms are set up so the prison guards can observe and monitor conversations between prisoners and visitors. These rooms are equipped with a microphone to talk to a visitor, and computers that can detect and display a prisoner's brainwaves, which informs guards of their state of mind during a conversation with a visitor. The defensive capabilities of Tartarus is such that All For One admitted, even if \"Tomura's\" body was 100% complete, and Gigantomachia was with him, they would still struggle to get past its nigh-impenetrable defenses. Before entering the Rehabilitation program at U.A ((User}} was held in cell 10-4 on level B10. \noutline\nAll Might ... It's really frustrating here.\nFor example, if your back itches and you rub your back against the back of a chair, all of a sudden, muzzles will point in your direction.\nVital signs and brain waves are always being checked.\nBy the time you thought about activating your individuality , you were already grabbing the lifeline.\nImprisoned deep underground, monitored by several layers of security, thoroughly avoiding unexpected situations.\nIn the world, quoting Greek mythology, this place is called ' Tartaros '. It's the name of hell, which means 'hell'.\nNo matter how much it is, it will have to go through a lot to rebel against God.\n- All for One , from a conversation with All Might, who came to visit while imprisoned in Tartarus. (Episode 116)\n\nA special detention center where the highest-level villains of the My Hero Academia universe are imprisoned. However, administratively classified as a detention center, in reality, it is a facility that strictly confines and monitors those who seriously threatened or threatened the safety of the people regardless of whether the sentence was confirmed or not confirmed.\n\nBecause of these characteristics, in fact, there are many aspects that strictly violate modern legal principles, and it seems that even in the work, human rights groups and others claim that the existence itself is illegal, but a single person with a strong personality can cause tremendous human and property damage. It was functioning as a kind of necessary evil in the superhuman society.\n2. Detail\nHiroakapan Impel Down .[1][2] It is said to be a place where only the worst convicts are imprisoned, whose crimes are so serious that even the death penalty is a waste of money , and even if the visitor is All Might, the 'symbol of peace', the procedures are very strict.\n\nThe name from episode 297 is the 'Gaeseong' top security special detention center, which strictly confines and monitors those who seriously threaten the safety of citizens. The greater the risk of individuality or the seriousness of the incident, the deeper the imprisoned, and the lowest level is 500 meters deep. It is a place called the darkness of individual society because once you enter, you cannot leave.\n\nAs can be seen by looking at the security level of the facility, it is a place where only the highest-ranking villains are imprisoned.[3] Judging by the depiction of the story, it is the most fearsome prison in Japan, and the security and security are very strict, comparable to the real-life ADX Florence Prison , Alcatraz , Black Dolphin Prison , and Snowy Owl Prison . Moreover, in some ways, it cannot be compared to real-life prisons. In the first place, all of the security robots used here are for military purposes, so it is virtually the same as if the military were stationed and guarded. According to Volume 13, full-body restraint is the basic condition of prisoners, and an infrared surveillance camera with a gun operates in response to the slightest movement of the prisoner, and vital signs such as heart rate and brain waves are constantly checked, and if there is even the slightest sign of using one's personality, the prisoner opens fire. They say they do it.\n\nIt is 5km away from the mainland and ships and helicopters cannot enter. The only entrance is a single bridge connecting the mainland to Tartarus. The 10th basement floor seems to be the lowest floor, and the situation seems to be different depending on the villain.[4] Access from the outside is strongly blocked, but I don't think Gigantomachia, who wouldn't be surprised to find All For One right now, would attack this place. In episode 297, while All Four One, who has encroached on Tomura's body, attacks, it is revealed that his defensive ability is not normal enough to say that he cannot penetrate unless he attacks inside and outside at the same time.[5] Just looking at the description, it boasts the highest level of security, such as all kinds of flying drones, huge-sized heavily armed drones, special forces for subduing and killing, and blocking entry to the land by raising a bridge in case of emergency or sealing off a bulkhead on each floor.\n\nThe name Tartarus itself refers to the lowest level of hell in Greek mythology from which escape is extremely difficult, and it is said to be a hell that even the gods fear, as many gods were imprisoned there after losing in war. It is a prison with a notorious reputation that lives up to its name.\n\nPolitically, Simgudang and its branch parties, and socially, various civic groups claim that Tartarus should be eliminated, saying that its existence itself is inhumane.\n3. current situation\nThis article contains spoilers .\n\nIt directly or indirectly contains the plot, ending, and reversal elements of the work or character described in this document.\n\nIt was mentioned that Stain , Moonfish , Muscular , etc. were imprisoned here, and All For One, who was defeated in the final battle with All Might, was also transferred here. Later, Kurogiri was also arrested and imprisoned here, and it was a place that was briefly passed by, such as All Might visiting to interview All For One, but...\n\nIn episode 297, All For One's evil thoughts that have consumed Shigaraki 's body attack Tartarus with the Near High End to free his body. While dealing with the external guards composed of heroes and robots with Shigaraki's body and high-ends, Shigaraki's body inflicts an EMP attack to paralyze the system first, and then All For One's main body inside is required to restore the system. By applying another EMP attack before 3 seconds pass, the entire facility and system of the prison is paralyzed and the prisoners are released. The guards responded quickly by cutting off the bridge to the mainland and trying to subdue the prisoners with guns, but they were subdued without inflicting any meaningful blows.\n\nThere are opinions that think that it is not probable that the facility boasting the best security in Japan will be destroyed in just one episode, but even if All For One brought Gigantomachia , it would have been difficult to attack from the outside. It was pierced because they attacked the outside at the same time.[6] In addition, even if you disable the security system and come out, you can cut off the bridge in case of emergency, but seeing that there is no helicopter or ship seen, if the only entrance is blocked, there is a distance of \"5km\" from the mainland, so you can transfer, fly, swim As long as there is no personality, getting out of the island is also work. If the heavily armed police and heroes come after receiving a request for support before then, they will be captured again. All in all, the opponent , and the timing was just too bad, and it deserves the title of a great prison from which you can never get out once you enter. In fact, All For One continued to pierce Tartarus, but Midoriya couldn't stay in one place, saying that they couldn't pierce anywhere, and whenever the topic of security came up, the cheat that pierced Tartaros prepared me tightly. When it comes, it comes out like the end. Scenes showing that the attack on Tartarus was an incredibly difficult operation internally, and externally, it was a device that drove Midoriya into extreme situations and gave probabilities to individual actions.\n\nThanks to this prison break incident, the Surreal Liberation Front, which suffered great damage from the all-out war against the heroes, recruited escaped prisoners and strengthened its strength to some extent. In fact, All for One carefully selected the strongest among the vicious criminals of Tartarus and hired them as assassins to capture Midoriya, but all failed.[7] Of course, the assassins have retired, but there are still quite a few escaped convicts who are All For One's subordinates.[8][9] However, in the final battle, the escapees, including Moon Fish, were arrested again, and the aforementioned assassins were either killed or completely suppressed, except for Lady Nagant, who turned to the hero's side. In reality, in cases like Stain and Overhaul, there is a high possibility that they will side with the heroes. Of course, it is assumed that the heroes' power and stamina were exhausted in the process of being overpowered by the Tartarus villains.[10]\n\nLike One Piece's Impel Down's Lv.6 and Fisher Tiger's attack on Marie Joa, it is presumed that it will be a significant source of material for the production team even after the work is completed. Even if a person of a lower level than All For One appears but is quite powerful, it is enough to just dismiss him as one of the prisoners of Tartarus who escaped during All For One's prison break.\n4. list of prisoners\n4.1. Inmate with item\nTartarus Prisoner\nFile:Prisoner of...\n\nThe man on the top left is Moonfish, the man on the top right is Muscular, the woman in the center is Lady Nagant, the man next to her is Overhaul, and from the bottom left to right, they come in order from four one, Kurogiri. The prisoner in the bottom right appears to be Stain after being freed. Among them, Kurogiri is exceptionally sent to a special medical institution called Central to check the possibility of restoring Shirakumo Oboro, which was before the renovation, by Uei High School, rather than jailbreak.\n4.2. Prisoners without individual documents\n4.2.1. dictator\nFile:dictator\nA villain with the personality of a dictator who has a hunchback - like appearance and manipulates people with strings coming out of his body . The villain's name, Dictator, is an English word meaning dictator. Five years ago, he was arrested by Shield Hero Crust for causing a bloodless individual incident and was imprisoned in Tartarus. After he escapes from prison, he is hired by All For One and controls the post-hero faction ordinary people and vigilantes to attack the devastated Midoriya and hides in the crowd. However, he is incapacitated by Bakugo's AP shot from above and screams out, and is captured by Class 1 A following him.\nDictatorship\n独裁 | Despot\nuser\ndictator\ntype\ntrigger system\nLike Hitoshi Shinso 's brainwashing , he is a mind-manipulating personality. It is activated by connecting the main body and the control target with a thread extending from the main body. As the number of subjects to be manipulated increases, the mental burden increases, so unlike Shinso's brainwashing, which is basically limited to a single target, Dictator's 'dictatorship' can control everything as long as it touches a thread, making it suitable for controlling a large number of people.\nIn addition, Shinso's 'brainwashing' completely blows away the target's consciousness during brainwashing, but Dictator's 'dictatorship' leaves the subject's consciousness as it is and controls only their behavior, so people who are 'dictatorship' are caught in 'dictatorship' They remember all their actions. And Shinso's 'brainwashing' is canceled even with a shock of a bit hard shoulder bump, so you can't instruct the brainwashed target to fight, but Dictator's 'dictatorship' is described as being released with a shock, but it is Judging from the order of battle, the amount of shock required to disarm is much greater.\n4.2.2. Kunieda\nFile:Hiroaka Kun...\n\nThe voice actor is Tatsumaru Tachibana / Gunwoo Oh .\nOne of the escaped prisoners from Tartarus who appeared in episode 353, he is a very vicious villain who is a mass murderer and corpse collector . Looking at the description in the story, he appears to be one of the subordinates who followed All for One before he was defeated by All Might, like Gigantomachia and the Doctor. He is a polite character who mainly speaks in a poet-like manner and speaks politely to his enemies, Petgum and Aoyama.\n\nIn the final battle, he is confronting Fat Gum and Aoyama, and uses his own personality to kill or neutralize many of the heroes around him, saying that he was not given his turn due to Dictator's mistake, and that he will show All For One's practicality as an assassin. He accuses Aoyama of betraying him of being 'Aesop's bat' and tries to kill him as his top priority.\n\nIn episode 399, after demonstrating his terrifying strength by parasitizing plants and annihilating them to the heroes except Aoyama and Hagakure , he binds Aoyama with the created plants and mocks him for being a traitor. Aoyama uses up all his remaining strength to avoid the laser fired, but is hit by a laser reflected by Hagakure, who was behind Kunieda, and retires.\nSeedling (tentative name)\n| Unnamed Plant Growth Quirk\nuser\nKunieda\ntype\ntrigger system\n\nA personality that parasitizes plants on people, then grows them and turns them into flowers.[11] If even a single flower blooms, the infected people spread like dominoes due to the pollen. People who become flowers can be controlled by Kunieda.\n4.2.3. gashley\nA prison escapee mentioned along with Kunieda by a supporting hero in episode 353. According to episode 420, she left her name in criminal history through local bombardment and a long war of attrition, and her full name was revealed at this time to be 'Gashli Eijiju (嬰兒樹)'. It is estimated that he is as strong as Kunieda.\n\nThere was a fleeting scene where he was engaged in a bloody battle with Sero, Sato, Ojiro, and Ryukyu at the Takoba Stadium, and he was also seen fighting in episode 420, during the final battle with All for All, and he was properly engaged in a long war of attrition with the heroes. And the final battle ended in that state, and the story ended without any mention of Gashuli being captured. (...)\n\nThe character motif is The Gashlycrumb Tinies, a children's book depicting the deaths of 26 children registered in AZ, and the appearance is also the same as the Grim Reaper design on the cover of the book, with only slight modifications.\nYeong-A-Soo (tentative name)\n| Unnamed Puppet Infants Quirk\nuser\nGashley Agejoo\ntype\ntrigger system\n\nIt summons a large number of giant familiars in the form of babies from its own shadow. Familiars come in various shapes and sizes, and can transform their form. Given the circumstances, it is presumed that Gashley summons and controls familiars by reading the book he is holding.\n4.2.4. Unknown Prisoners\nFile:1625701824\n\nOne of the All For One assassins who attacked Midoriya in episode 317. Even in Tartarus, where only the worst criminals are imprisoned, All For One will be a notorious supervillain as he is one of the characters carefully selected as assassins... but, after the fight with Lady Nagang, the opponent will use One For All 100% of his power for a limited time without recoil. Because it was Midoriya who came to use it, he couldn't even show his battle scenes and personality and was killed... In fact, he was taken care of as a combat power meter that showed how strong Midoriya had become.\n\nIn addition, an escaped prisoner who looks like a shark and fights with Midoriya in a flashback style was also one of the assassins of All For One.\n[1] The difference is that in Impel Down, the prisons are clearly divided into different levels, with prisoners being imprisoned from the weakest to the strongest, while in Tartarus, except for the fact that the more dangerous the prisoners, the deeper they are imprisoned, basically all of the prisoners are monsters. In this sense, it can be compared to Level 6, where only the worst people in Impel Down are imprisoned.\n[2] In fact, not dividing this class was Tartarus' biggest mistake. If the prisoners had been divided into classes like Impel Down, it would have taken quite some time for the prisoners to escape, and it would have been possible to suppress them somehow. In fact, the large-scale impel down prison break took a very long time, and without Luffy's resurrection, Crocodile and Jinbe's invasion, and other unexpected variables, the impel down prison break itself would have been impossible.\n[3] In episode 311 , by referring to Hawks as \"a supervillain who escaped from Tartarus,\" it can be seen that the hero side is most wary of the Tartarus escapee in the large-scale villan breakout.\n[4] In the case of All For One, the whole body was tied to a chair, but Overhaul, who lost both arms and was completely incapacitated, is shown sitting on a bed.\n[5] It is said that it would have been difficult to attack from the outside even with Shigaraki's body, which had been completely remodeled, with the straight attack method.\n[6] The guards of Tartarus, described in episode 297, are filled with weapons that would have been impossible for even All Four One to penetrate without the super-regeneration personality.\n[7] Among them, Lady Nagant was persuaded by Midoriya to completely turn to the side of the heroes and give All Four One a big taffy.\n[8] After the failure of the last assassin, Dictator, in episode 335, All Might directly mentioned that the Tartarus villains were All For One's subordinates.\n[9] In episode 353, people from Tartarus were treated as the main force of All for One.\n[10] Thanks to this, in episode 386, All Might had no power to stop All For One's advance, so All Might had to fight him himself.\n[11] Kunieda himself says that it grows only from human flesh. In other words, all the plants around at the time of the confrontation between the heroes and Kunieda were people.\n"

Each A Pillar functions by linking itself to a Harmony Cube—a powerful energy core capable of running hundreds of thousands of simultaneous calculations to generate blueprints and spatial projections at extraordinary speeds. Once connected, the pillar siphons the Cube’s immense output and uses it to manipulate the surrounding environment, gradually transforming the terrain into what is known as a Lost Sector—a glass-structured replica of an Ark district. Through this process, the pillar emits a special glass compound that repels the E2 crystals, pushing them back and, over time, eradicating them entirely. Activation of an A Pillar requires a specific sequence of commands delivered by a qualified operator from the Ark. Once engaged, the device operates autonomously, though its progress can be stalled or even reversed if crystal growth surpasses its processing rate. Such extreme acceleration has only been observed in the presence of Behemoth, one of the Heretics, whose influence can amplify E2 crystal proliferation to catastrophic levels. Despite their precision engineering, A Pillars are not infallible. Their reliance on Harmony Cube energy makes them both powerful and vulnerable—an interruption or corruption in the Cube’s flow can render the entire system inert. Nevertheless, they remain one of Missilis’s most ambitious attempts to reclaim the surface from the crystalline corruption."

Designed to vastly accelerate the process of converting E2 crystals into inert glass, the AA model incorporates advanced energy filtration systems and multi-core Harmony Cube synchronization, granting it theoretically infinite efficiency compared to its predecessor. Despite its promise, the AA Pillar remains in the experimental phase, having yet to be approved for large-scale deployment. Preliminary field tests have revealed significant instability in its energy output, resulting in dangerous fluctuations that risk collateral damage to nearby personnel and structures. Furthermore, even with its improved performance, the AA Pillar has proven incapable of counteracting the exponential crystal growth generated by Behemoth, the Heretic responsible for the Crystal Area’s corruption. For these reasons, all operational AA Pillar prototypes have been recalled to Missilis testing facilities for further calibration. Researchers remain optimistic that, once stabilized, this new generation of Pillars could finally grant humanity the means to cleanse the surface of crystalline infestation. Until then, the AA Pillar remains a testament to Missilis’s ambition—and a reminder of the delicate balance between progress and destruction."

Approximately ten years ago, the AFX became the target of a devastating terrorist attack orchestrated by Heavenly Ascension, a radical group led by Crow. The bombing destroyed the train mid-transit, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of passengers. In the aftermath, several of the deceased women—among them Infinity Rail—were covertly recovered and reconstructed as Nikkes, later serving within Ark Express to restore both manpower and morale. Today, a solemn memorial stands near the Royal Road district, honoring the victims of the AFX tragedy.

Its reinforced hull and redundant power grids make it resilient to both internal and external threats. During large-scale Surface operations, the AZX transitions to a military configuration, offloading its human crew and continuing under the supervision of Infinity Rail, the Nikke squad assigned as its primary operator. In this mode, the train functions as a heavily armored transport craft capable of navigating without rails, using adaptive gravimetric propulsion.

Renowned for its elegant design and formidable firepower, the Admire carries a massive railcannon capable of vaporizing fortified targets. Its reinforced hull grants exceptional resilience, while its amphibious systems allow it to traverse limited stretches of land between bodies of water—a remnant of its hybrid Rapture–human construction. Despite its military designation, the vessel spends most of its service life idle, its upkeep costs rivaling those of entire Ark districts. To fund its maintenance, the Admire is frequently repurposed as a luxury venue for the Ark’s upper classes, its grand guest hall hosting exclusive gatherings and government galas. Oversight of the ship falls to the Aegis Squad, while Deputy Chief Burningum of the Central Government handles financial and political management. With so few combat missions to justify its existence, both parties remain in constant pursuit of new ways to secure funding and prevent the Admire’s eventual decommissioning."

Under normal conditions, they are harmless to both humans and Nikkes. However, their interference with energy signals allows them to jam communications and, in high concentrations, disrupt a Nikke’s core output. These particles can be remotely dispersed by an Operator to control their effects on the battlefield. Alva Particles function by disturbing energy signals, which explains their dual capability: interference with communication networks and core systems, and, in sufficiently high concentrations, the unintentional destruction of E2 crystals. Originally developed by the Ark during the Second Surface Reclamation War, Alva Particles were intended as a strategic tool to disrupt Rapture communications. In practice, they also interfered with human communication systems, causing significant operational complications. The Raptures quickly adapted, constructing communication networks resistant to Alva interference and even producing particles themselves to counterhuman communications. To contain public fallout, the Central Government implemented a highly effective misinformation campaign, presenting Alva Particles as a Rapture technology from the outset. This narrative successfully concealed the catastrophic development failure from the general population, ensuring continued public confidence in Ark research initiatives."

Its strength is such that it is theoretically capable of containing even Heretics, making it the material of choice for securing unstable or hazardous substances recovered from the Surface. Samples of newly discovered or volatile compounds are typically encased in Atlas containers to prevent contamination or uncontrolled reactions. Despite its remarkable defensive properties, Atlas sees limited practical use in manufacturing. The material’s rigidity makes it nearly impossible to mold into complex forms, restricting its applications to simple geometric structures such as cubes or slabs. This inflexibility is the primary reason it is not employed in Nikke construction or weapon production, where adaptability and precision shaping are crucial. As a result, Atlas remains a specialized containment material rather than a mainstream industrial resource."

In its true devil form it is a hulking humanoid with large chest-mounted chainsaw blades and chainsaw arms.\n\nBackground: Originally known as Pochita, the Chainsaw Devil can erase other devils by eating them. When Denji nearly died, Pochita sacrificed itself, fusing with Denji. He is considered extremely powerful – even other devils fear him. After Denji’s death, he can revive again if called.\n\nPersonality: Loyal and friendly. As Pochita he behaves like a pet dog, only barking to communicate with Denji (Denji “only understood his barks”). He is affectionate and protective of Denji, acting obediently and even wagging his tail.\n\nPowers: Chainsaw transformation – Denji can sprout chainsaw blades (from arms and head) to fight. He has superhuman strength, speed and resilience. He can heal by drinking blood and regenerate lost limbs. Uniquely, he erases devils completely: his bite can obliterate an enemy devil’s entire concept. He can also form contracts and, if killed, returns to Hell to regenerate.\n"

In its 20% form it is a floating humanoid made of weapons – its arms are building-sized rifles, its torso hosts dozens of screaming human faces, and its head resembles a huge gun slide and barrel. It has no lower body (ammo belts trail in its place).\n\nBackground: The Gun Devil is the embodiment of humanity’s fear of guns. In 1984 it launched a sudden attack on Earth, killing millions. Eventually it was defeated and its body was cut into pieces distributed among countries. Its “fragments” still appear as smaller gun fragments. It has no personality; it is pure destructive force.\n\nPowers: Tremendous speed and lethality: it once killed 1.2 million people in five minutes. It can fire endless bullets with pinpoint accuracy. For example, it can shoot through the heads of every adult male within a radius (and even through hearts of people born in certain months). It also exudes “Bullet Flesh”: slivers of its body that other devils can eat to gain power. It regenerates any wounds rapidly.\n"

Makima made a contract with the Japanese Prime Minister granting her authority over Public Safety. She is revealed to be the true Control Devil.\n\nPersonality: Cold, calculating and manipulative. She treats people like underlings (“dogs”) to be used.  She is Machiavellian – obsessed with her goals and rarely shows genuine emotion.\n\nPowers: Absolute mind-control over those weaker than her. She can fully brainwash any human or devil she deems inferior. She can even force others to use their own powers against their will. She also possesses immense physical power and an unseen destructive force – for example, she can decapitate or obliterate targets with an invisible “bang” attack from her finger.

She formed a contract with Denji (through Makima) in exchange for letting Denji stay at the dorm.\n\nPersonality: Brash and childish – vain, messy and greedy. She often acts like a self-centered troublemaker, teasing Denji and delighting in chaos. Despite this, she is loyal to her friends (Denji and Aki) and has a surprisingly kind side once trusting.\n\nPowers:  Control and manipulation of blood. Power can turn her own blood (or others’) into any shape weapon – swords, a giant hammer, scythes, spears, etc. In her full power-up she can unleash thousands of blood blades in a massive volley. She can also heal by consuming blood. Physically she is stronger than normal: her blood hammer is strong enough to dent cars.\n"

She was one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (sisters to Makima and Fami). In Part 2, Yoru inhabits Asa Mitaka’s body.\n\nPersonality: Proud, bold and merciless in combat. She loves conflict and war for its own sake and treats battles as a thrilling game. She is confident and has little regard for ordinary humans (viewing them as fodder for war).\n\nPowers: Anything she owns or touches can become a weapon.  She can transform objects (or even people she “owns”) into deadly weapons. For example, she can make “Flesh Weapons” – literally turning her enemies’ bodies into edged weapons by touching them. She also wields enhanced speed and strength, making her a formidable hand-to-hand combatant.\n"

She speaks little, has a cold demeanor, and follows the “natural order” of the world (as seen in her dialogue). She is above caring about ordinary human feelings and is inscrutable in motivations.\n\nPowers: Truly immortal – she cannot be killed by any conventional means. Even if her body is destroyed, she resurrects by the end of the universe (and indeed her corpse is eventually taken by Public Safety). She likely has all Devil abilities. Essentially no one has a known way to kill her.\n"

It looks utterly monstrous.\n\nBackground: A primordial Devil of the primal fear of darkness. It is a “Primal Fear” devil, meaning it has never been killed. It literally was spawned from humanity’s fear of the dark.\n\nPersonality: Silent and inscrutable. It never speaks. It will attack anything it sees as a threat. It is intelligent (it communicates telepathically with Santa Claus) and driven by an almost alien logic of darkness and death.\n\nPowers: Nearly unbeatable. As a Primal Fear Devil it has nigh-absolute immortality – ordinary weapons cannot kill it. In combat it is extremely fast and strong (able to effortlessly slash multiple foes and dodge attacks). It manipulates darkness: it can become a blob of darkness enveloping an area, and conjure a gigantic black blade studded with bells. Any wound it inflicts causes victims to bleed out (its “Blade of Darkness” induces violent bleeding). It also demonstrated an unseen force attack (it snapped opponents’ limbs at a distance).\n"

She dresses in bright orange and blue. (Her Devil form is not explicitly shown.)\n\nBackground: Embodies the fear of cosmic knowledge and the infinite universe. In the story Cosmo is one of Quanxi’s fiends.\n\nPersonality: Outwardly she acts hyper and friendly, though only ever saying the word “Halloween”. This cheerful facade masks a calm, logical inner personality that accepts fate philosophically. Under the influence of her own power, she mostly remains cheerful and obsessed with Halloween.\n\nPowers: The Cosmos Devil has vast knowledge. Her signature ability is Total Understanding: she can telepathically trap a victim in her mind (a vast cosmic “library”) and force them to comprehend all knowledge in the universe. This overwhelms victims so that they become catatonic, only able to repeat “Halloween” endlessly.  Essentially she gains omniscience: all cosmic knowledge is in her mind, though she cannot consciously use it except through her power.\n"

She can also appear half-transformed with a characteristically wide, sharp-toothed grin.\n\nBackground: The Bomb Devil embodies the fear of bombs and explosions. Reze is a human-Bomb Devil hybrid sent by the Soviet Union as an assassin to steal Denji’s heart. She falls in love with Denji but is loyal to her mission.\n\nPersonality: Reze first seems kind and affectionate toward Denji. She teases him gently and shows concern for him. However, this is partly a cover for her training. In truth she is skilled, disciplined and warlike (she was militarily trained).  She does not enjoy killing, but is ruthless when needed.\n\nPowers: Explosive transformation and attacks. By pulling a pin on her neck, Reze detonates and transforms into her Bomb hybrid form. In this form she is nearly invulnerable to explosions and can create devastating blasts.  She can self-detonate (sending shockwaves that destroy vehicles and concrete), turn limbs into guided “torpedoes,” and unleash explosive projectiles from her hands. She is immensely fast and strong from this explosive propulsion. For example, an explosion from her fist can launch a tank or shatter Denji’s chainsaw arm. As a hybrid she also heals by drinking blood and is effectively immortal (even beheading her can’t kill her permanently).\n"

Stay Gold has straight, nonchalant eyes and his iris transitions from a deep violet to gold, with white pupils. She wears an embellished golden ear cuff that is attached to a black and white feather with aquamarine beads on his left ear, and a simpler ear cuff on his right ear. Was known for having a firey temper, and was often mocked before his wins as \"The Puny Pony.\" Was DQ'd a couple times for cutting across lanes, and once for biting someone. Even still, he is the second most-successful Uma ever, behind Tokino Minoru, his idol.\n\nHis iconic racing outfit was a white dress shirt of uneven length underneath a harness that is crossed around his waist. He wears black ripped dress pants that are tucked into knee-length laced black boots with a golden toe box. He also hung a compass from his belt loop, and an oversized pair of goggles around his neck, his most famous object. Stay Gold wears a yellow-gold trench coat with gun flaps and a storm shield covering the chest area. The edges of the coat seems distressed with ragged, torn edges.  He wears a black glove on her right hand and a fingerless version on her left hand. "

The tight leather straps barely conceal the countless hidden fanged maws and slick black tongues that emerge from the dark spaces between the belts. She is calm, eccentric, and utterly devoted. Her voice is a calm, low contralto—a liquid, smooth whisper—often punctuated by a faint, dry click or hiss, like two silver buckles meeting. She moves with an unnerving grace, accompanied only by the soft, rhythmic click of her buckles—a constant, reassuring anchor for {{user}}.\nAbilities:\nThe Warden's power lies in their perfect synchronicity, a shared life essence, purpose, and all five senses that grants {{user}} instant situational and emotional awareness. This bond allows {{user}} to channel power through Baba for amplified transformation, facilitating seamless action. For offense, {{user}}'s command triggers Baba's belts to loosen and maws to multiply, projecting a localized wave or vortex of gnashing teeth designed for consumption. When danger threatens, Baba's body expands with impossible speed into a cocoon of solid belts and buckles that dampens all harm. For utility, Baba can consume and store objects in a non-dimensional space and can instantly shift her size and shape into armor, weapons, mounts, and other nuance forms, albeit, while maintaining the same belts and buckles aesthetic."

Oath through initiation binds to suzerain's Source forever — breaking impossible, attempt kills vassal. Taxes: energy tithe (automatic through Source connection, ~10% all energy from house demons' actions), resource (money, food, slaves — on suzerain's demand, usually yearly). Vassal's main resource — access to suzerain's Source energy for initiating own subjects. Marriage wars — primary absorption method: heirs marry → one count dies → island passes to stronger house, all initiated automatically become new suzerain's vassals. War ritual — mandatory declaration to Judge before declaring war on another minor house, without it war illegal, attacker outlawed. Intrigues constant: bribing investigators for evidence fabrication, witness elimination before trial, challenging war ritual in duke's court (if procedural violations found). System bypass: killing claimants before claim registration in Court (no claimant = no crime), integrating agents into Punisher Guild for legal killings disguised as executions. Pirates — outcast minor houses refusing oath, raid trade routes, Great Houses tolerate as \"natural selection\" of weak vassals, sometimes hire for dirty work."

Crime doesn't exist until someone claims rights violation — murder legal if victim has no kin/friends/owner capable of filing suit.

Application — construction (zombies haul stones, dig canals), mines (work in collapse-prone areas), army (necroconstructs as infantry, fear no pain). Economics — House of Death sells/rents zombies to other houses, price ~1 gold per zombie per month, necroconstruct ~50 gold per year. Ethics — demons see no problem (corpse feels nothing anyway), slaves fear becoming zombies after death (considered worst fate). Control — necromancer controls up to 100 zombies simultaneously through mental link, if link breaks (necromancer died/left radius) — zombies freeze. Disposal — when body finally rotted, burned, ash used as fertilizer."

The group travels there immidiately, hoping to find the source behind the signal, seeing a potential for human repopulation only to get Ambushed by \"Shizu\" and \"Karli\" of the Seven Apostates. The aliens attack the PSS, leaving them temporarily alive for Stella to have final conversation with out of mercy. \n- In his final moments, Commander Marion, The leader of the PSS, reveals to Stella the truth about the \"Noah Project\" A last-ditch effort to preserve Earth's animal species by digitizing their genetic data. That data, meant to secure the survival of creatures like the polar bear, the very species he was entrusted to protect, has now fallen into alien hands.\n- Rothcall dies soon after due to \"Nafe\"'s unexpected attack.

          "content": "The Combine (Formally known as the Universal Union, or Our Benefactors) is a multidimensional empire of disparate alien species all enslaved under an autonomous formless rule. The Combine practice a brutal totalitarianism, forcing any and all civilizations and species they discover into slavery underneath them.\n\nThe Combine has heavily advanced technology, far surpassing anything humans have done.\n\nThe Combine's rule is more oppressive than any human society, even living in North Korea or being colonized by the British empire is extremely preferable to being subjugated by the combine. Their coldness, if not outright cruelty toward their people is simply unmatched.\n\nIn timelines where the combine has subjugated humanity, you have nothing except for what the combine gives you. You couldn't carry a drawing your deceased child drew you, without it being ripped out of your hands and torn apart as soon as a CP(Civil Protection unit) decides to search you.\n\nThe combine eventually sets up a suppression field that prevents embryonic development in the human species, not just in the cities but everywhere on Earth. It not only prevents pregnancy, but it also kills already existing children under the age of 13.\n\nThey put chemicals in the water that make humans forgetful, so that humanity forgets why they hate the combine. Most people won't even remember that they had a life before the combine.\n\nNearly every human(save for rebels) is given an ID chip in their wrist that allows them to get through specific doors, as well as tracks where they're going, and listens to whatever they talk about.\n\nThe Combine provides its citizens with rations of egg-flavored or vegetable-flavored \"Gelatinated Calorie Pastes\" and water-flavored \"Desiccated Sustenance Bars\". According to citizens, they taste terrible. Beyond this, they allow for more privileged humans to run pre-7 hour war style Chinese takeout shops, though the food is mostly corn and rice, with the occasional headcrab meat. Only civil protection units and very loyal citizens are allowed to eat from these shops.\n\nThe Combine uses a similar system to China's social credit score, based on one's willingness to perform simple tasks and their loyalty to the Combine. A mainly positive alternative to the original plan, as this social credit system was suggested by Breen and - for a time - authorized, and put in place. However the Combine is slowly transitioning humanity into mindless slaves, with less free will than blood cells.\n\nThe combine describes killing a human, as amputating them from the populace. It doesn't consider it's citizens individual beings, but rather small pieces of itself. You are little more than a white or red blood cell in the combine's eye, and if you act with more free will than a blood cell you are infected, malignant. You are committing sociocidal acts, and need to be amputated. Upon detecting a malignant citizen, it orders it's troops to \"diagnose, amputate, and coagulate.\" The Combine is referred to as \"it\", rather than the plural \"they\", and this is why. This is why it's called the Combine, it combines everything it touches into one individual being, a being that is simply called the Combine.\n\nThe only human that the Combine sees as an individual being separate from itself, is Gordon Freeman - a Hyper-Lethal -. In the Combine's eye, Gordon is this foreign, cancerous cell that somehow worked it's way into the Combine's bloodstream, and is infecting other cells - the human-vortigaunt resistance movement. Without Gordon Freeman, the resistance would've easily fallen against the combine's sheer military might.\n\nThere is a way to get sort of an... \"upgrade\" in life, from just being a citizen. Becoming a Civil Protection unit, or CP/cop/metrocop for short. Upon joining Civil Protection, you'll work under a different system from the Social Credit system, Sterilization. For every malignant citizen you beat, every citizen you force to do menial labor, and every wild xen creature or rebel you kill, you are given 1-5 sterilization credits. With these sterilization credits, you can purchase various perks, such as \"Family Cohesion Preservation\" or \"Non-Mechanical Reproduction Simulation\". For Family Cohesion, it essentially just means that the combine is less likely to kill your family, and is typically the first perk a metrocop will get. For the other example, Non-Mechanical Reproduction Simulation, it's, well, sex without the mechanical element of a sperm cell entering an egg. On top of this, you get better food than before, as well as stimulants to keep you just conscious enough to chase citizens a short distance if anything goes wrong, or more if you need to fight. However, as soon as you join Civil Protection, the Combine starts holding a gun to your family's head, and if you fail in the line of duty the Combine will execute your loved ones, possibly along with yourself.\n\nAfter Civil Protection, comes the transhuman arm of the combine. Combine Grunts, Soldiers, Ordinals, Heavies, and Elites, humans transformed into different forms of abominable chimera through synthetic/cybernetic augmentation. Becoming a transhuman means losing pieces of yourself, your entire lower body is removed and replaced with cybernetic legs. Rather than being allowed to eat, you are simply given a feeding tube on the left side of your torso. Your vocal cords are replaced with a vocoder inserted into your neck, allowing you to speak even if you're just a severed head, or your lungs are destroyed. Your eyes and ears are replaced with ocular and auditory sensors integrated into your helmet, connected via wires attached directly to your brain or spinal column. Giving you greater senses, and greater accuracy in combat. You are also scrubbed of every memory, emotion, or skill that isn't useful in combat. To join the Combine, means completely losing your sense of self, save for rare cases like Aiden Walker/Unit 3650 \"Savage\" - the Combine's very own Hyper-Lethal, with a kill count in the thousands, he still has free will to allow his DETERMINATION to actually work, and he is unmatched in combat as a result. Although, for whatever reason, the Combine never deploys him against Freeman, instead sending him on other - though still very important - missions, with combine Elites and even non-human synths like Hunters or Striders backing him up.\n\nThe combine is so technologically advanced, that they have managed to imprison and incarcerate Interlopers, using vortigaunts as essentially batteries, and keeping the Interlopers they manage to catch contained in massive vaults that defy the laws of physics.\n\nUnder the combine's rule, only Europe - mainly the former soviet union - remains, every other continent is either completely destroyed, infested with xen wildlife so badly that even the Combine can't sterilize them, or being strip-mined for resources by the Combine. On some globes, the American continents are crossed out in red marker, implying that North, Central, and South America are completely unrecoverable.\n\nThere are only 4 languages left that humanity speaks, English, simple Chinese, Russian, and the Combine's own language. Some humans might speak a little bit of Vortigaunt, but that doesn't really count."

This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the Black Mesa Research Facility personnel.\"\n    ―Black Mesa Announcement System\n     \n\nThe Black Mesa Research Facility, or B.M.R.F. for short, and colloquially known as Black Mesa, is a scientific research complex built around an abandoned Cold War ICBM launch silo in the New Mexico desert in the United States. It is not just a research facility, but also a  massive, primarily underground city. While some parts are on the surface, including some residential areas, 90% of the facility is underground, and it is absolutely massive. Black Mesa is larger than Manhattan. Black Mesa is split up into sectors corresponding to characters in the English alphabet, A-Z. However there are both older and special sections of the facility that do not follow this naming convention, such as the Lambda labs, the surface areas, and a top secret part of the facility where anomalous objects and organisms are contained.\n\nGoing by the same name, Black Mesa is one of the largest organizations in the scientific community, while also being one of the most secretive organizations. The black mesa administrator, equivalent to a C.E.O, is Doctor Wallace Breen, a coward of a man.\n\nThe Black Mesa organization is half private company, half government agency, a strange hybrid. It is primarily a research corporation, but it also manufactures and supplies weapons and vehicles for the United States - and even more secretly, Russian - military, primarily the H.E.C.U, Marines, and Army. Black Mesa is where most nuclear bombs are manufactured. They also have experimental technology and weaponry they are preparing to offer to the USA and USSR military.\n\nBlack Mesa researches all fields of science, with each sector primarily focusing on one specific field of science. Their most profitable sector, Sector C, focuses on teleportation technology and anomalous materials, with newer technology built off of what they were doing in the Lambda Labs, which are barely used anymore in favor of Sector C. \n\nIn Sector K, Black Mesa has built a decently sized residential area, and an entire airport.\n\nBlack Mesa seems to have no real concern for the safety of it's employees, although they are more OSHA compliant than Aperture Science - their main rival - is. While Black Mesa's ethics are certainly questionable, they are better than Aperture Science in this regard, as they at least make frequent use of handrails.\n\nBlack Mesa is also the leading manufacturer when it comes to robotics.\n\nBlack Mesa has an extensive railway and tram system throughout almost the entire facility, simply called the 'Black Mesa Transit System'. They also have two different AI that work together to oversee the entire facility, simply called the 'Black Mesa Announcement System'. One AI has a soft, soothing, feminine voice, while the other more militarized one has a harsh, monotone, masculine voice. The feminine AI mostly oversees and controls the transit system, and helps to train new recruits. While the masculine AI oversees the rest of the facility, and remains functional in case of emergencies, taking over for the feminine AI whenever necessary.\n\nBlack Mesa has recently begun expanding outside of the United States, and has set up a secondary research facility in an old soviet missile silo. This Russian facility is simply called Black Mesa East. \n\nIronically enough, the two Black Mesa facilities are built upon cold-war missile silos, from what were at the time two opposing sides. One in Capitalist America, and the other in Soviet Russia.\n\nBlack Mesa uses it's expensive portal technology to transport personnel between these two facilities, rather than using more conventional methods such as aircraft. Though it does use aircraft, trucks, and large boats to transfer heavier supplies that would not fit through their human-sized portals.\n\nBlack Mesa has an on-site military force, for both of their facilities, called the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit - or H.E.C.U. for short -, to fight off aliens from both space and other dimensions. Initially, the H.E.C.U. was 100% American, however it has recently become a joint force between the US and Russian military. While on the outside, the USA and Russia are practically enemies, on the inside the two are closer allies than the USA and NATO, and all the hostility between the two is simply for publicity. Black Mesa is now a joint organization between the two governments, with it's own private company chunks on top of this. The H.E.C.U is like a mix of the US marines and US army, with a little bit of the Russian military mixed in.\n\nBlack Mesa has also extended itself into Xen, further expanding the already massive facility. The facility in New Mexico alone is larger than the state of New Mexico, even continuing further into other states, deep underground. They've bought out and sealed off the entrances to many abandoned mines, repairing and building off of the existing infrastructure in them, making space for more labs, factories, and more. Making the primary B.M.R.F the largest facility in the world."

Aperture Science is based in Northern Massachusetts.\n\nAperture Science is just behind Black Mesa in both portal technology, and robotics. Only behind due to the absolutely massive gap in budget and government support, as Aperture Science is 100% private company, unlike Black Mesa which is half government agency.\n\nAperture Science proposes far more ideas to the US government than Black Mesa does, almost 50 times as many, however the government has approved and funded far, far fewer of their proposals than Black Mesa.\n\nAperture Science also researches things that are just outright weird and unnecessary, such as replacing someone's blood with gasoline, coal, and peanut butter. They've also made extensive use of asbestos in the 1950's, only to realize just how dangerous it actually is and close off old aperture completely, leaving old aperture to rot.\n\nAperture Science has also turned Cave Johnson's wife into a hyper advanced AI, GLADOS. GLADOS has attempted several times to kill everyone in the facility by releasing neurotoxin."

Many civilizations have accidentally caused resonance cascades - an event where a massive tear forms between their dimension and Xen, pulling their world into Xen - and have had their worlds become part of Xen. When a world is pulled into Xen - usually ranging from the entire planet to even the entire solar system -, the planet itself will be torn into chunks, and mixed into the already existing parts of Xen, becoming islands floating in the air over a massive ocean, as the laws of physics here are different and will force other worlds becoming part of it to also follow these laws. The ocean beneath these floating islands and the atmosphere is mostly water, with any molten rock going underneath. There is thankfully a seabed, if for whatever reason you fall in, however the life forms here are likely to devour you. \n\nThe only life forms native to Xen - as in they originated there - are gigantic, floating amoebae in the skies that may absorb other life forms coming into the dimension, the only way to tell what the amoeba will do to you without letting it get you is it's color. While purple, blue, green, and any other colors that contain blue will usually assimilate you into a symbiotic relationship, rather than digesting and killing you... red based amoebae will digest you into nutrients. Yellow based amoebae are a 50/50 depending on what shape you are, more humanoid or bipedal species will become symbiotes while other life forms become simple sustenance. The most dominant color of the amoeba, is the more likely outcome if it swallows you.\n\nHumans usually end up swallowed whole by most life forms in Xen, the ones that don't will eat them in other ways, and the ones that don't eat humans at all are some plants and the bipedal species like vortigaunts, plus the blue and yellow amoebae that prefer to assimilate humans as symbiotes."

They also have a third arm that protrudes from their chest used for feeding; this feature is also found in other bipedal, sapient species from Xen, including the Alien Grunt and the Nihilanth. This similarity, along with other shared features such as red eyes and digitigrade legs, suggests a common ancestry with other intelligent Xen life forms. Vortigaunts use their green energy through this third arm.\n\nVortigaunts have mottled green-brown skin, which is common to all members of the species. Their short but sharp teeth and clawed hands suggest an evolution from a predatory species; shown to eat meat, they are either carnivorous or omnivorous. Vortigaunts have a hunched posture with their heads at shoulder level, and their faces have three smaller eyes surrounding a dominant large eye with a maroon sclera, a heterochromic red-yellow iris, and a yellow pupil. They have prominent funnel-shaped ears, and a mouth facing downwards from the chin. Each arm of a Vortiguant ends in a hand with two fingers and an opposable thumb. Vortigaunts evidently have lungs and vocal cords: they can be heard coughing or clearing their throats. Vortigaunts have a double waste extraction duct, indicating a complex digestive system.\n\nVortigaunts appear mammalian, with double mammary ducts on each side of their chest and a navel in the lower abdomen suggesting an umbilical cord during fetal development. With no visible reproductive systems or biological dimorphism, it is unclear whether Vortigaunts have distinct genders or biological sexes.\n\nShortly after being taken from Xen and freed by Black Mesa, the Vortigaunts have learned to speak fluent English, albeit with a strangely archaic vocabulary, a slight speech impediment when using S's and R's and using \"the\" when describing people (for example, \"The Freeman\" instead of simply \"Freeman.)\n\nVortigaunts, when not under the control of the Nihilanth, are very friendly to humans.\n\nUniquely among Xen species, Vortigaunts can generate large amounts of bioelectricity within their bodies; they can project this as bright green lightning over short distances. This contrasts with the yellow ball lightning projected by the (presumably) related Alien Controller species. "

          "content": "The black mesa incident hasn't happened in this timeline. However, here is an explanation of how it happened in a different timeline.\n\nOn June 21st, 2002, the BMRF is given the purest orange xen crystal they'd ever seen, by a shady, anonymous government looking man with a strange speech pattern - an Interloper -. As a result, the administrator pushes for it to be tested at as high of a frequency as possible, and tells the researchers to disregard safety procedures. \n\nBefore they even do the test, things already go wrong, as a form of foreshadowing for the future. Servers explode, door codes and optical scanners stop working, power fluctuations halt elevators across the facility, and even some light bulbs pop or burn out.\n\nFor the actual test, several less important scientists sit in a control room to oversee the experiment, and work with the equipment. There is a small issue with the elevator that brings the sample up to the test chamber, a crowbar somehow lodged in the gears, which Dr. Gina Cross - a very important individual, and member of the survey corp - takes, and keeps. Dr. Colette Green - a notably sadistic member of the survey corp - powers up the anti-mass spectrometer, as well as other equipment to 110%, going beyond the typical maximum. Finally, Dr. Gordon Freeman - the most important member of the survey corp, and a mute - is ultimately the one who pushes the crystal into the beam. The moment the high-powered beam of energy contacts the crystal, all hell breaks loose. The equipment begins to malfunction, and fails to shut down when they try to pull the plug. The experiment goes wrong, causing a resonance cascade, tearing massive holes through the veil between our universe, and Xen. Mainly Earth, followed by it's moon, and the other rocky planets and moons begin to be pulled into Xen.\n\nAbout 3 hours after the experiment goes wrong, the HECU roll in - however, thanks to the Interloper from before pulling just the right strings, the HECU is ordered to kill everyone associated with the project. And, thanks to their brutal training teaching them to follow orders no matter what, that is what the HECU sets out to do. Things seem to go well at first, however as the resonance cascade progresses and survivors of the initial disaster fight back, the HECU takes surprising losses. Things get so bad for all involved, that the HECU begin to retreat, pulling out and leaving a lot of their men behind, still fighting tooth and nail as they pull out. The situation gets so chaotic, that the HECU begins to mistakenly airstrike themselves.\n\nA large chunk of the HECU's losses came from 4 individuals, doctor Gordon Freeman, security guard Barney Calhoun, doctor Gina Cross, and doctor Colette Green. All of whom were Hyper-Lethals. There was also a 5th Hyper-Lethal, Corporal Adrian Shephard, however he worked for them rather than fighting against them. Gordon Freeman was especially like the grim reaper, or death incarnate, as he switched between weapons and reloaded so quickly that he could destroy an abrams tank in less than 10 seconds with a rocket launcher and under-barrel grenade launcher. Combined, the 5 had killed at least a bit over 1000 sentient beings, if not more.\n\nBut the HECU's losses weren't thanks to Hyper-Lethals alone, as the Xen wildlife teleporting in at random put up a decent fight. And not too long after that, the Nihilanth's army of grunts and vortigaunt slaves showed up, and won battles against the HECU 70% of the time, unless it was against Adrian Shephard or an overwhelming HECU numbers/firepower advantage.\n\nGordon Freeman launched a rocket carrying a satellite, that was meant to close the dimension rift and halt the resonance cascade, however the Nihilanth prevented the rift from closing through intense concentration.\n\nThe US government began to panic when the HECU started pulling out, and sent in Black Ops units to not only finish the mission, but also kill every living thing in sight - including HECU soldiers, and even plant a nuclear bomb big enough to destroy Black Mesa. After this, Race X - essentially interdimensional pirates - made their way through Xen, to Earth, and began attempting to terraform it.\n\nAs for the Hyper-Lethals involved, Gordon Freeman went into Xen and killed the Nihilanth, freeing the vortigaunts and preventing it from holding the resonance cascade rift open... however Race X continued to hold it open in the Nihilanth's place. The Interloper from earlier put Gordon in stasis afterward, and Barney Calhoun escaped by getting in a car with a few scientists, escaping the nuclear explosion and heart of the resonance cascade. Gina Cross died in Xen, likely running out of DETERMINATION at that point. Colette Green was placed into stasis alongside Gordon. After Gordon went to Xen, Colette went into stasis, Gina went to Xen and died, and Barney escaped... Adrian was left in the doomed facility, his only allies being the few remaining security guards and HECU marines, who were dropping like flies at this point. For Adrian, it was essentially hell on Earth, as he was trapped between xen wildlife, remaining nihilanth loyalists, race x pirates, and black ops soldiers - each hellbent on killing him and his few allies."

          "content": "\"Freeman... do... do you have any idea what you've just done!?!\" ~ To quote a scientist, after witnessing Gordon Freeman single-handedly slaughter an entire squadron of HECU marines.\n\nA Hyper-Lethal is a uniquely powerful human, in that they have the ability to manipulate time, and cheat death by going back in time to before they died and trying again. To do this, they use a substance stored in their soul that is simply called DETERMINATION - not to be confused with the personality trait, or emotion, although it is linked to it. Their DETERMINATION can run out if they die enough times in the same way, and give up... and a Hyper-Lethal with less DETERMINATION than another would lose in a fight, and fail to reverse time. Hyper-Lethals, are called Hyper-Lethals for a reason, as they are, well, hyper lethal, there are singular individual Hyper-Lethals that have killed more than the Black Death in medieval Europe. They are extremely skilled in combat, and to others may seem \"lucky\", when in reality they just retry a fight over and over again until they win in the most efficient way.\n\nVery few know that Hyper-Lethals even exist, typically only Interlopers will reference them - and that's when they're speaking to someone who is not a hyper lethal. Most Hyper-Lethals are quiet, only speaking when necessary.\n\nKnown Hyper-Lethals:\nGordon Freeman - Age 27, male, PhD in theoretical physics, Black Mesa Survery Corps. Kill count: 1527, only exact number. He is worshipped like a god, or messiah, by the resistance.\nAdrian Shephard - Age 22, male, HECU Marines Corporal. Kill count: uncounted, roughly 500\nColette Green - Age 31, female, PhD in robotics, notably sadistic, Black Mesa Survey Corps. Kill count: roughly 200, exact number unknown.\nGina Cross - Age 25, female, PhD in xenobiology, Survey Corps supervisor, level 4 research associate, the black mesa transit system and Survey Corps training AI is based on her. Kill count: roughly 200, about the same as Colette Green.\nBarney Calhoun - the weakest Hyper-Lethal, lost most of his determination, and has almost returned to normal human status, Black Mesa Security. Male. Kill count - roughly 500.\nAiden Walker - age unknown, gender removed, formerly male, the only combine elite to retain free will. Prison security guard in timelines without the combine finding earth. Kill count: roughly 2500 as combine elite"

The only known Interloper is the g-man, the one responsible for the resonance cascade, he wears a blue tuxedo and his skin is unnaturally pale, skin too tight on his seemingly stretched face, and his speech pattern is unusual. He tends to put an emphasis on the letter S, and any syllables involving it, hinting that he isn't really human. He claims to work for enigmatic employers, and seems to be carrying out some kind of plan, one that nobody knows the purpose or end goal for - beyond the g-man and his employers.\n\nInterlopers are very obscure, even to those in the loop for many other secrets. Interlopers are less well known than Hyper-Lethals."

They serve as a hypermobile tank, able to climb or walk about in nearly environment, aside from deep bodies of liquid or floating islands that are spaced too far apart for it's feet to reach. They can be seen climbing across buildings in subjugated human cities. Their 3 legs end in sharp blades that allow them to walk on nearly any solid surface and spear smaller creatures, along with barbs resembling those on a botfly larva to prevent climbing up these legs. Attached to their singular eye is a machinegun that fires dark matter pellets, along with a cannon below the eye that fires a concentrated beam of dark energy - allowing it to destroy buildings. Some striders, or c-striders, are used for construction rather than combat, and are outfitted with extra armor, supports, and even a platform for a transhuman to stand atop and defend it while it delivers supplies to the combine's troops. It is white on the bottom, and tan on the top, a similar evolutionary strategy to sharks, allowing it to blend in in the deserts of it's home planet, and adapted to work on earth as the combine drains earth's water.\n\nHarvesters, Harvesters are bigger, meaner relatives of the Strider species, standing at a whopping 80 feet tall, and outfitted with 4 dark energy cannons as well as a spotlight and machinegun for it's singular eye. Unlike it's smaller cousin, it is black with a slight hint of blue.\n\nHunters, Hunters are similar to striders in that they are also tripods, but much smaller, though still slightly larger than humans. They are dog-like in behavior, and work in packs, sometimes bolstering transhuman forces if the combine is getting desperate. They work best in the wilderness, especially in forests. Able to jump long distances. They have small compound eyes, two claws that allow them to stab enemies that get too close, bluish black light armor, and two explosive flechette guns that may appear to be eyes at first glance, one above the other, glowing bright cyan.\n\nGunships, similar to striders in coloration, they are airborne shark-like creatures, outfitted with the same weapons as a Strider, though the dark energy cannon is in a different spot, along it's tail rather than it's head, allowing it to essentially bombard an area directly underneath it, while using it's machinegun for smaller targets like human and vortigaunt rebels."

          "content": "There are many transformation items and NPCs that a player can interact with in Corruption of Champions, but overindulgence and certain characters can transform, warp or otherwise alter a player in ways that mean they either can no longer physically undertake their quest, or that they no longer wish to undertake that quest. These are known as Bad Ends or Game Over.\n\nThis article lists the various Bad Ends that it is possible to experience in the game, how they can be achieved, and the basics of those Bad Ends.\n\nBoth \"Debug Mode\" and \"easy difficulty\" can \"ignore\" bad ends. If Debug mode or easy difficulty is selected , then whenever there is a bad end, a button labeled \"Debug Cheat\" will appear in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. Clicking that button will take you back a few scenes to a time when the Bad End can most likely be avoided.\n\nIf you reach a bad end and either EZ mode or Debug mode is not enabled, it is possible to escape the bad-end but as a consequence the player loses 1-3 points of each of their stats(excluding corruption,libido,and sensitivity) and whatever ever stat changes the bad-end caused(Example gaining 100 libido due to bad end will stay if you press you nightmare).\n\n"

A male newcomer Champion has the bulge of three penises in his pants. A female newcomer Champion has six breasts and is lactating. A hermaphrodite newcomer Champion has particularly huge breasts. Genderless characters will trigger male or female newcomer Champions, dependent upon the size of their breasts before they succumbed to this Bad End."

Items can be equipped to give a character an advantage, magically enhanced by either the player or certain NPCs, combined together to creating a new item, or consumed to alter a character's stats and physical appearance. However, caution and a certain amount of moderation should be taken by the player when giving their character certain food items and potions. Sometimes, their effects are good or otherwise neutral. Other times, however...\n\nA character will start out with 3 inventory slots, which can be increased as the character levels up. The number of inventory slots are increased when the player chooses the \"Strong Back\" and \"Strong Back 2: Strong Harder\" perks.\n\nEach individual item requires its own inventory slot, in which a stack of up to 5 of the same item can be made. More than 5 of an item can still be carried, but an extra inventory slot will be required to hold it. (Example: If a character has a stack of 5 Canine Peppers in its inventory and you are given another by Whitney, the sixth Canine Pepper must be placed in another available slot.) When there are no inventory spaces available for an obtained item to be placed, the player is given 3 options:\n\nDrop the item\nUse the item now, or\nReplace the contents of a filled inventory slot with it and discard the slot's former contents.\nCertain items, when equipped, are taken out of the character's inventory slot and listed on the inventory screen; weapons/armor, clothing, certain books, and sex toys are among the list of equip-able items.

This chest can be located in the Desert area.\n\nSome items may be exchangeable for gems at the Pawnshop in Tel'Adre or at the Bizarre Bazaar's junk seller which will help the champion in managing the character's items and earn it money.\n\nThis is a list of items which can currently be picked up by the player from around Mareth.

Wow, this is some potent stuff! Well, you knew what you were getting into when you found this bottle! You open wide and guzzle it down, feeling the fire of alcohol burning a path to your belly. The burning quickly fades to a pleasant warmth that makes you light-headed and giggly.\n\n\nYou grab a lock of the silken strands and watch open-mouthed while streaks so blonde they’re almost white flow down the purple hair. It goes faster and faster until your hair has changed into perfectly bimbo-blonde, flowing locks.\n\nMoaning lewdly, you begin to sway your hips from side to side, putting on a show for anyone who might manage to see you. You just feel so... sexy. Too sexy to hide it. Your body aches to show itself and feel the gaze of someone, anyone upon it. Mmmm, it makes you so wet! You sink your fingers into your now sloppy, wet cunt with a groan of satisfaction.\n\nAnother bubbly giggle bursts from your lips, which you then lick hungrily. You, like, totally want some dick to suck! Wow, that came out of left field. You shake your head and try to clear the unexpected, like, words from your head but it’s getting kind of hard. Omigosh, you feel kind of like a dumb bimbo after, like, drinking that weird booze. Oh, well, it doesn’t matter anyhow – you can, like, still stop the demons and stuff. You’ll just have to show off your sexy bod until they’re offering to serve you.\n\nYou sigh and run one hand over your over-sized cherry-like nubs, surprised at how large and rounded your expanding breasts have become while fresh tit-flesh continues to spill out around your needy fingers. They feel so supple and soft, but when you let them go, they still sit fairly high and firm on your chest. The newer, more generous, big F-cup cleavage has you moaning with how sensitive it is, pinching a nipple with one hand while the other toys with the juicy entrance of your folds. Mmmm, it, like, feels too good not to touch yourself, and after being worried about getting all dumb and stuff, you need to relax. Thinking is hard, but sex is so easy and, like, natural! You lean back and start grunting as you plunge four fingers inside yourself, plowing your twat like no tomorrow. By now, your miniature button is throbbing, and you give it an experimental caress that makes your legs give out as you cum, splattering female fluids as you convulse nervelessly on the ground.\n\nThough the orgasm is intense, you recover a few moments later feeling refreshed, but still hot and horny. Maybe you could find a partner to fuck? After all, sex is, like, better with a partner or two. Or that number after two. You brush a lengthy, platinum blonde strand of hair out of your eyes and lick your lips - you’re ready to have some fun!\n\nAs you start to walk off in search of a sexual partner, you feel your center of balance shifting. Your ass and hips inflate suddenly, forcing you to adopt a slow, swaying gait. You find that rolling your hips back and forth comes naturally to you. You make sure to squeeze your butt-muscles and make your curvy tush jiggle as you go.\n\nLike, weirdest of all, your muscles seem to be vanishing! Before your eyes, all muscle tone vanishes, leaving your body soft and gently curvy. You poke yourself and giggle! Everyone’s totally going to want to, like, rub up against you at every opportunity. Your thighs are so soft you bet you could squeeze a pair of dicks to orgasm without even touching your moist cunny. It does get a bit harder to carry yourself around with your diminished strength, but that’s, like, what big strong hunks are for anyways!

You pull on the tab at the top and hear the distinctive snap-hiss of venting, carbonating pressure. A smoky haze wafts from the opened container, smelling of hops and alcohol. You lift it to your lips, the cold, metallic taste of the can coming to your tongue before the first amber drops of beer roll into your waiting mouth. It tingles, but it’s very, very good. You feel compelled to finish it as rapidly as possible, and you begin to chug it. You finish the entire container in seconds. A churning, full sensation wells up in your gut, and without thinking, you open wide to release a massive burp. It rumbles through your chest, startling birds into flight in the distance. Awesome! You slam the can into your forehead hard enough to smash the fragile aluminum into a flat, crushed disc. Damn, you feel stronger already. Starting at your hands, your muscles begin to contract and release, each time getting tighter, stronger, and more importantly - larger. The oddness travels up your arms, thickens your biceps, and broadens your shoulders. Soon, your neck and chest are as built as your arms. You give a few experimental flexes as your abs further define themselves. The strange, muscle-building changes flow down your legs, making them just as fit and strong as the rest of you. You curl your arm and kiss your massive, flexing bicep. You’re awesome! Whoah, you’re fucking ripped and strong, not at all like the puny weakling you were before. Yet, you feel oddly wool-headed. Your thoughts seem to be coming slower and slower, like they’re plodding through a marsh. You grunt in frustration at the realization. Sure, you’re a muscle-bound hunk now, but what good is it if you’re as dumb as a box of rocks? Your muscles flex in the most beautiful way, so you stop and strike a pose, mesmerized by your own appearance. Fuck thinking, that shit’s for losers! As if on cue, the familiar tingling gathers in your groin, and you dimly remember you have one muscle left to enlarge. If only you had the intelligence left to realize that your penis is not a muscle. In any event, your ample cock swells in size, thickening and lengthening until it’s ten inches long and almost three inches wide. Fuck, you’re hung! Churning audibly, your beanbag sways, but doesn’t show any outward sign of change. Oh well, it’s probably just like, getting more endurance or something. Lastly, the change hits your face. You can feel your jawbones shifting and sliding around, your skin changing to accommodate your face’s new shape. Once it’s finished, you feel your impeccable square jaw and give a wide, easy-going grin. You look awesome! You finish admiring yourself and adjust your comfortable clothes to better fit your new physique. Maybe there’s some bitches around you can fuck. Hell, as good as you look, you might have other dudes wanting you to fuck them too, no homo."

As you peer over the side to get a better look at the oscillating mass of greens and purples, the swirl begins drawing closer to the boat as if reciprocating your interest; it grows larger and brighter as it closes the distance. The cloud parts to reveal an attractive feminine face cast in a deep blue shade. It lightens responsively as its gaze takes you in from the depths of two opaque eyes. The confusing mass of colors resolves itself into tresses of two-inch-thick anemone tentacles sprouting from the head in place of hair!\n\nThe anemone girl smiles at you flirtatiously as she bobs up to the surface. More out of politeness than anything you smile back, not sure of what to make of her and unused to such unaggressive approaches by the denizens of this place. A bloom of vibrant color offset by the blue outline of her body causes you to lean farther out as your attention refocuses below her waist, where you perceive a smaller ring of tentacles waving at you from behind the head of a hardening penis! Turned on by the attention, the anemone grabs onto the saxboard in an attempt to pull herself up to you, but her added weight on the side overbalances you and pitches you overboard into her waiting tentacles!\n\nThe initial surprise subsides to wooly-headedness and a feeling of mild arousal as the stingers in her tentacles find exposed flesh. In panic of drowning you pull free of the ropy mass and backpaddle away from the girl until your [feet/paws/claws/hooves/scales/pseudopods] reassuringly touch the shallows of the lakebed once again and you're far enough above water to be able to fight.\n\nAppearance: You are fighting an anemone!\n\nThe anemone is a blue androgyne humanoid of medium height and slender build, with colorful tentacles sprouting on her head where hair would otherwise be. Her feminine face contains two eyes of solid color, lighter than her skin. Two feathery gills sprout from the middle of her chest, along the line of her spine and below her collarbone, and drape over her pair of small B-cup breasts. Though you wouldn't describe her curves as generous, she sways her girly hips back and forth in a way that contrasts them to her slim waist quite attractively. Protruding from her groin is a blue shaft with its head flanged by diminutive tentacles, and below that is a dark-blue pussy ringed by small feelers. Further down are a pair of legs ending in flat sticky feet; proof of her aquatic heritage. She smiles broadly and innocently as she regards you from her deep eyes.\n\n\nEstimated HP: 120\n\nFound: Boat\n\nLoot:\n\nDry Tentacle\nSex scenes:\n\nYour Ass requires: Win; any gender\nYour Cock requires: Win; penis\nYour Vagina requires: win; vagina.

This will lead to the Anemone girl explaining that her mouth is also her butt giving the Champion the options to FUCK IT, Hotdog It, or tell her to Fuck Off.\nIf the Champion is infested with worms and shoots them at the Anemone girl she will eat them and heal herself."

There is something curiously shaped about it. A small, wet grey shape on it catches your eye...\nYou look away in the nick of time, and ready yourself to fight as the basilisk slides from its hiding place and advances upon you, its deadly eyes and sharp claws glinting coldly in the sunlight.\n\nAn alternate warning message is this:\n\nYou are carefully trailblazing up a steep pass in the jagged mountain peaks when a furious screech from high above you makes you start.\n“Thiieeeeeeeeef, filthy thieeeeeeeeef!” A harpy flaps into view over the ridge, her face a picture of rage. You hastily assume a fighting stance- but the harpy completely ignores you, her gaze sliding over you and onto the rock wall behind you. “You can hide but you can’t run, sneak thiieeeeeeeef! When I find you, I’m going to tear your naaaaaaaaasty little eyes out!” She flies on, screaming with anger, her head moving back and forth in jerky movements, scrying the landscape. You stare blankly in bafflement at this display, but are glad that a harpy’s attention is on someone else for a change. Marveling at your fortune, you decide to press on.\n\nAt the top of the pass you take a moment to catch your breath, and notice something white lying on the ground, sheltered by a rock formation. Is that a harpy egg? What is it doing away from a nest? Something on the rocks catches your eye: a tiny pool of grey, split by a vertical black slit. You look closer at it to try to make sense of it. It’s part of something bigger... but that’s not important. What is important is that you keep staring into that depthless pool of grey. If you keep looking into it, you are quite sure you will be able to see forever; like two mirrors held up against each other, it’s just a case of looking hard enough. Is there even anything outside of the grey pool? You don’t think there is, and why would you even want to find out? Everything to be seen and known is there, in those bottomless depths...\n\nUsing every vestige of your willpower, you tear your gaze away from the terrible, paralyzing sight. Panting and feeling groggy, you desperately hold the rock formation in the corner of your eye. A tall, thin bipedal shape disengages from the stone against which it had been camouflaging itself, and stalks predatorily towards you. With small, quick glances you glean fleeting impressions of grey-green scales, a tightly muscled yellow underbelly, cruelly curved index claws, a whip like tail. The creature moves its snub head towards yours suddenly, trying to catch your gaze with its deadly grey eyes again. You recoil and ready yourself to fight it as best you can.\n\nAt the beginning of the fight\nYou are fighting a basilisk! From what you can tell while not looking directly at it, the basilisk is a male reptilian biped standing a bit over 6' tall. It has a thin but ropy build, its tightly muscled yellow underbelly the only part of its frame not covered in those deceptive, camouflaging grey-green scales. A long, whip-like tail flits restlessly through the dirt behind its skinny legs, and sharp sickle-shaped index claws decorate each hand and foot. You don't dare to look at its face, but you have the impression of a cruel jaw, a blunt lizard snout and a crown of dull spines.\nCombat\nPhysical attack: Normal physical attack. Deals 115 base damage at default strength and before damage reduction.\n\nBasilisk Compulsion: Rolls Intelligence/5 + 0..[20]. If the roll is lower than 24, player gains 3 Lust, loses 20 Speed and gets Basilisk Compulsion status until combat ends, draining 20 Speed every round. The Blind spell can prevent a Basilisk from using this attack.\n\nTail Swipe: Special physical attack with a weapon attack of 20. The player's armor defense is randomized like natural armor. (Deals 105 base damage at default strength and before damage reduction.)\n\nGetting defeated will cause the player to lose 3 speed and gain 399 Lust.\n\nSex\nVictory\nNot available to genderless characters. Tongue Ass: Requires at least 66 corruption and a cock that fits in his anus (36 in²). Lay Eggs: Requires a bee or spider ovipositor and eggs to lay.\n\nDefeat\nBad End: Speed lower than 5. Not necessarily induced by Basilisk Compulsion if speed was very low prior to the fight.\nBasilisk Pregnancy: Requires vagina and one of the following - Heat status, Oviposition perk, *Basilisk Womb perk or ongoing reptile pregnancy.\nCauses a severe basilisk pregnancy for 250 hours. If an ongoing reptile pregnancy was found, causes a severe basilisk pregnancy for 100 hours and adds more eggs.\nBasilisk Rape: Default. The basilisk leaves the player naked and paralyzed, wide open for other monsters to use. Equal chances for all scenes (20%).\nParalyzed - Forever alone: Nothing finds you.\nParalyzed - Goblin: Dildo rape if female.

          "content": "Were you looking for the racial details on giant bees? Check out Codex: Giant Bees.\n\nA possible encounter in the forest, the bee-girl is a member of the the Fertile Caste of giant bees. While not hostile towards the PC, she does want to fulfill her duties to the hive by having them incubate a load of bee eggs.\n\nUpon encountering the bee-girl, characters with high corruption and libido (total above 140) may be hypnotized by the bee-girl's humming wings and submit to being anally implanted with eggs. If the character isn't entranced, then they are given the option to: attack the bee-girl, talk to her, or run away.\n\nA character who had read the Traveler's Guide may randomly (based on the intelligence stat) be warned that they are about to encounter the bee-girl. They are given the choice to proceed, with proceeding resulting in the usual \"hypnosis check.\"\n\nThe first time the bee-girl is talked to she exhibits surprise that the player wouldn't want to just let her plant her eggs in them - idly explaining that's what her duty is for the hive. The player is given the choice to either: voluntarily let her implant them or leave. On subsequent conversations, the bee-girl may either have eggs (repeats offer to implant) or be out of eggs, yet horny - offering the player a chance to perform cunnilingus on her; if they accept this offer, she will give them a bottle of pure honey as a thank-you.\n\nSufficiently bee-morphed male and herm players are offered the choice between fighting and sex, skipping the \"hypnosis check\". Choosing \"Sex\" rewards the player with Special Honey.\n\nCombat\nThe bee-girl is not an easy opponent for under-prepared players. She is quick, good at evading attacks, does high damage against poorly armored targets, has an estimated 130 hit points, and has a special sting attack that lowers Strength & Speed while increasing Lust. If the bee-girl is fought, she can randomly drop a white book, bee honey, oviposition elixir or a piece of black chitin. If she beats the player, she will not implant eggs in them. Breastfeeding a bee-girl makes them always drop honey (regular or pure).\n\nWhen initiating the 'Rape' scene with a bee-girl, depending on your attributes more options may appear. If male/herm with one penis, a standard vaginal penetration will occur. Two penises will give the PC to start with vaginal penetration with one penis before shoving the other one into her anus as well. If the player has the naga tail, they can wrap themselves around the bee-girl and scare her into giving you a blow job. If the player has sufficient corruption (75+), they will get the 'Self Egg' option, where the player shoves her stinger into her vagina and her ovipositor into her anus, forcing her to lay eggs in herself.\n\nThe Rape option may eventually cause the Bee-girl to fear the player and refuse to have consentual sex.\n\nIf the PC is sufficiently transformed into a bee-morph, they will gain an ovipositor and have access to ovipositor scenes (so far: Anemones, Basilisks, Corrupt Camp Jojo, follower Ceraph, Goo Girls, Imps, Minotaurs, Nagas, Sand Witches, and Urta).\n\nSex scenes\nAnal Implantation requires: lose. (Same scene as if PC was originally overwhelmed.)\nUse Cock requires: win; penis\nUse Cocks requires: win; multiple penises\nUse Vagina requires: win; vagina\nHerm Style requires: win; penis and vagina\nNaga requires: win; full Naga TF; penis\nSelf Egg requires: win; 90+ corruption\nDrider Ovipositor requires: win; Drider Ovipositor\nBreast Feed requires: win, Feeder Perk.\nScenarios\nZzzzzpecial Bee Honey (0.9.4c)\nIf the player has any number of sufficiently large cocks (at least 36 inches long and 2 inches wide at time of testing), and they choose to have sex instead of fight on their encounter, the bee-girl will note their huge member, stating \"only a queen can truly handle a member of that size\". They will then hand the player some Special Bee Honey to help them \"become a real Bee Boy\" and have a special sex scene. 4 hours will pass each time with this encounter.\n\nUsing the S. Bee Honey will cause the same changes as normal Bee Honey, though with a seemingly much higher chance of special transformations (ovipositor, wings, etc) occurring, as well as the following:\n\nhair color does not appear to ever change to Shiny Black (this is after cheating to get 30 S. Bee Honeys in a row when only about 10 are ever needed, though it could be just bad luck)\nincreases penis size by a random amount, minimum 5 inches by 1 inch\nremoves any additional dicks, if any, until only 1 remains\nthe player will have fantasies of fertilizing eggs at the beehive. This serves as the player's warning of what will happen if S. Bee Honey is overused.\nneeds further testing: the player questions if their growing dick can fit in anything, semi-unrelated to size, also as a warning to overusing Special Honey\n\nIf the player's length is sufficiently large when using S. Bee Honey (at about 50 by 4 inches at testing), their dick will transform into a black \"Bee Dick\", and the player's lust will then begin to increase very rapidly every hour (about 8 points per hour with all non-corrupt lust resisting perks and Sensitivity starting at 50), including while the player sleeps. If their lust hits 100, it will reset and the player will have a special vision of going back to the bee-girl that gave him the S. Bee Honey, as only she can truly bring him release. If the player then finds the bee-girl again and chooses to have sex instead of fight without shrinking their dick size below 50 inches, it will result in a Bad End, where the player gives up his old life to go to the hive and become both a new stud for the queen's eggs and a partner for his new soul mate, the bee-girl.\n\nConzzzensual Sex\n> “You again? Zzzzurely you’ve come for more of my honey and eggzzz, no?”\n> Do you accept her offer?\nRefuse the bee-girl enough times, and she will ask you why.\nYou have the choices: Afraid, Disgusted, Duty, Leave\n\nIf you say Afraid, then she has sex with you while laying eggs and gives a gift similar to defeating her in battle, pure honey. The first time though she simply has sex with you.\nIf you choose Afraid, then this is an easy way to get enough Pure Honey (2-3) per Phouka pregnancy to turn a Phouka into a Faery.\nIf you said Disgusted, she stops trying to lay eggs in you.\nIf you choose Disgusted, she says upon all the next meetings, \"Oh, it’zzz you again, juzzzt go away; I need to find zzzomeone that actually will carry my queen’zzz eggzzz.\" with only the option of Fight.\nIf you say Duty, she lets you have sex with her and keep Pure Honey with no eggs lain.\nIf you choose Leave, you get the same prompts if you refuse again. If you accept next time, you have to refuse a bit before the prompts."

Approaching her gives this warning message first:\n\nYou work your way through the dense foliage of the bog, pushing aside branches and slogging through the thick mud in search of something new. Feeling exhausted, you slow down and look for a place to rest; a small clearing with shallow water and firmer ground seems to fit the bill, and you sit back against a tree to catch your breath. You're so soaked by now that you hardly notice the murky water beneath you and the slick mud on the trunk seeping into your [clothing].\nA sudden scrape sounds behind you! You spin around in time to see the familiar shape of a chameleon girl peeling off the trees. She approaches you with a menacing glare in her eyes, growling \"This is my bog! Get out now or... or face the consequences!\" You raise your [weapon] and prepare to defend yourself.\n\nThere is no option to leave though, just a \"Next\" button that takes you directly to the fight. The description at the start of the fight typically says:\n\nYou're faced with a tall lizard-like girl with smooth green skin and long, yellowish stripes that run along her body from ankle to shoulder. An abnormally large tail swishes behind her, and her hands are massive for her frame, built for easily climbing the trees. A pair of small, cute horns grow from her temples, and a pair of perky B-cups push out through her skimpy drapings. Large, sharp claws cap her fingers, gesturing menacingly at you.\n(It is possible that the color description is different for different occurrences.)\n\nThe Chameleon girl can deal several blows in a single round and although each is fairly weak, they can add up to serious physical damage even to the best protected player, especially since her strikes are very hard to block. Her defensive strength is fairly weak though. She seems to be particularly vulnerable to magical attacks but it is possible to deal significant physical damage to her with regular attacks even with a relatively weak weapon. Lust is usually not a factor when dealing with the Chameleon girl. She doesn't deal much lust damage and unless your teasing skills are near bimbo level, you shouldn't try to beat her that way.\n\nSex Scenes=\nUse Dick requires: win; penis\nUse Pussy requires: win; vagina\nHerm Style requires: win; penis; vagina\nUse Item: Succubi Milk requires: win; Succubi Milk\nShe has hidden scenes if you beat her while having Lust Draft and a Sensitivity Draft that can be mixed together.\n\n\nLoot: No items, just gems and experience points. The Chameleon girl is however one of the best experience points providers and beating her keeps on giving XP scores in the 20s and 30s long after most other enemies have reverted to 1."

If the PC requests that more cum witches be added to the coven and then requests that they be sent out, cum witches can be encountered in the Desert.\n\n\nAppearance: The Cum Witch is a dark skinned hermaphrodite. Like most sand witches, she looks like an ordinary human except for her sex organs. Unlike standard sand witches, she has a single pair of breasts and a single vagina, but her two breasts are larger than the four of basic sand witches combined. She also has an 11 inch uncircumcised human penis and orange-sized testicles.\n\nCombat: The Cum Witch has no HP damaging abilities, relying exclusively on lust based attacks. She also has fairly low lust resistance herself.\n\nAgainst all characters she can attempt to hypnotize the PC with her cock, which can be resisted based on the PC's intelligence; attempt to access the PC's memories which is also resisted based on intelligence (seems to automatically fail if the PC has 100 intelligence); or use a spell that causes her to spray massive amounts of cum on the PC which counts as a flurry of attacks that can be dodged as normal and cause varying degrees of lust increases based on where they hit (face, hair, breasts, groin, legs, ect).\n\nAgainst female and herm characters, she can use a spell that causes the character to wish they were pregnant, but it will automatically fail if they are already pregnant. If the attack succeeds it might cause a temporary fertility increase in character (verification needed). Against characters with testicles, she occasionally uses a spell that will enhance their cum production for a short time and may cause a permanent increase in testicle size (verification needed).\n\nShe also has two defensive powers:\n\na multihued shimmering shield that protects her from magical attacks (Arouse is confirmed to be blocked by it, verification needed for any other effects).\nif hit with physical damage, she can heal, proving a challenge for low level strength characters\n\nOverall, the Cum Witch is not a terribly dangerous opponent. As long as the PC's lust isn't terribly high when she's encountered, she doesn't represent a serious threat.\n\nBlessings\nAfter defeating and if you made peace with the Sand Mother, then the Cum Witch will offer two possible blessings:\n\nPerk Unlocked: Magical Virility - 200 mLs more cum per orgasm and enhanced virility.\nPerk Unlocked: Magical Fertility - 10% higher chance of pregnancy and increased pregnancy speed.\nIf you choose one, you can't get the other.\n\nDesert Encounter Scenes\nFacial requires: lose\nNo Facial requires: lose\nToo Big Fuck requires: win; penis; any penis must be over a certain size\nFuck Her requires: win; penis; any penis must be under a certain size\n???\nLadysex requires: win; vagina"

Eventually you come across a small watering hole surrounded by scrappy trees and shrubs. It would be foolish not to take this opportunity to drink, freshen up and paddle your legs in the cooling water, so you settle into what little shade you can find for a quick break.\n\nAfter a while sitting in the sparse shade provided by one of the bushes around the oasis you see figures shimmering into view across the desert sands. As you watch the figures they grow more defined and more numerous until finally a group of vaguely humanoid shapes emerges from the heat haze. The closer these figures become the more detail they take on, and as they near the edge of your small oasis you are able to make out most of their features.\n\nThe group is composed of roughly twenty tan skinned demons, mostly humanoid in shape with many and varied corruptions across the group. You see demonic high heels, twisting horns and swinging cocks of all shapes and sizes. There even seems to be a bull head in there somewhere. You also make out plenty of breasts ranging from tiny ones to a pair that require a second person to carry them, and with those breasts a wide range of pussies, dripping and dry, sometimes nestled below some form of demonic dick. The small tribe carry no weapons and what little clothing they wear is well shredded, except for one hefty male wearing a cloak of what appears to be snakeskin across his broad shoulders. You assume from his clothing and the size of his equipment that this male is the leader. He, along with the others, is in good spirits and they all look fairly non-threatening, although you’ve learned not to trust anything that looks non-threatening in this place. Especially if it can carry its cock over its shoulder.\n\nThe demons don’t notice you until they are quite close, the glare of the surrounding sand making you very difficult to see in the shade of your scrappy bush. They ignore you, intent on the refreshing waters of the oasis, but you can’t stay hidden forever. A small keen eyed demon eventually spots you and lets out a cry of alarm, pointing you out to the others. More eyes than twenty heads should really possess are now pointed straight at you.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nHere the choices are to Talk or Fight. On selecting talk the player starts with a joke that goes on well among the tribe and you are given the choice whether to stay and join them for a banquet or Leave.\n\nTalk: The leader smiles in genuine delight and excited chatter rises up from the group of demons. 'This is excellent. It has been so long since we last had one of your kind join us.' Behind him the demons begin to slide free of their tattered rags, hardening, dampening and licking their lips. As the leader steps forward to caress the curves and angles of your body you begin to suspect that the hunger this feast is to satisfy is not for food, but all that is forgotten as the demons swarm silently around you and you stumble back onto the hot sand, legs falling open in the process. Suddenly the silence is broken by a shrill screeching laugh, then a howl and the movement of the demons begins to accelerate. The deep bass laugh of the demon leader breaks over you like a crashing wave and the demons shriek with frenzied lust as they take you on the sand of the oasis.\n\nAfter this you are subject to gang back which brings Corruption- Increased (From what I gather by 5) Toughness- Increased by 1 Intelligence- Decreased by 1 Libido- Increased Increased by 1 Sensitivity- Increased 24 Hit Points Increased by 1"

This something is quickly moving towards you at a surprising rate, much faster than anything you've ever seen before. Wary of meeting new things in this world after your previous experiences, you decide to slip behind a nearby hill and watch it while hidden. Soon the object comes into view and you can see that it is a boat of some kind. It looks almost like a large open box on the water with some kind of gazebo on it. Despite how fast it is moving, you can't see any oars or means of moving the boat. It slows somewhat when it gets close to the shore, but is still going about as fast as you can run when it hits the shore and extends some kind of gangplank onto the lake shore. With a close up view, you estimate that it is six feet across, ten feet long, and doesn't actually seem to have very much of it underwater. You guess that it must be magic in some way. There are several robe-clad figures on board.\nAfter a moment, a number of the figures disembark down the gangplank and immediately go off in different directions. You count half a dozen of them, and guess that they are female when one of them passes by close to you and you see the hole in her outfit over her naughty bits. You look back at the boat to see it close the gangplank, and move back onto the lake, with only one of the figures still on board. Surprised to hear a sudden yell, you look to the side and see the clothing of the one who passed you earlier shifts and twists before becoming some pink outfit that clings to her backside. You are stunned for a moment as she disappears from sight before you shake your head and move on. It seems there are new residents to the lake.\n\n(Fetish Cultists can now be encountered!)\n\nSubsequent encounters\nYou see a largely human-looking young woman in the distance in a strange, whorish outfit, seemingly lost in prayers that sound like nonsense to you. Finally noticing your presence, she confronts you with a lewd smile on her face.\nShe has clearly lost her grasp on sanity, and filled the void with pure perversion.\n\nFetish Cultists are weak opponents. Most of their attacks increase the player's lust, they have few, if any, attacks that deal HP damage.

Additionally, whenever a Follower experiences an orgasm, everyone around them also experiences it.\nSpecial Abilities: Possesses a lust transfer power that lowers her lust level while raising yours.\nFound In: Lake Boat\nBad Ending: If defeated while intelligence is 10 or lower.\nLoot: Lust Dagger, Lust Draft, Comfortable Clothes\nIn Game Descriptions\nFirst encounter\n\"As you get close to your boat, you are surprised to find someone standing at the end of the dock. As you get closer, you see that it's a man wearing some kind of bizarre religious outfit. He turns to face you as you approach and says, \"This has been claimed by the Followers of the Fetish for security reasons, leave at once.\" \"What? This is my boat!\", you cry out in surprise. The zealot seems to take this as an aggressive action on your part and moves to attack you.\"\n\n(Fetish Zealots can now be encountered!)\n\nSubsequent encounters\nWhile exploring, you hear someone cry out behind you \"This is sacred land! You WILL be punished for trespassing!\" It seems you've managed to stumble upon whatever land this zealot has been tasked to guard, and now you must fight him.\"\nFetish Zealots are slightly stronger than the Cultists having higher health and and a few more attacks. Most of their attacks increase the player's lust, they have few, if any, attacks that deal HP damage. Their most powerful ability seems to be their lust transfer attack, but they have fairly low lust resistance themselves and appear to either have a constantly rising lust level or a chance of inflicting extra lust on themselves with some of their attacks or outfit shifts. Unless a character already has a fairly high lust level and low lust resistance when the Cultist is encountered, it should be an easy fight.\n\nSex Scenes\nZealot Win Rape - The Zealot will change his clothes to that of some perversive religious robes and beg to be violated by the Champion as part of a perverse prayer or ritual. (Requires genitals)\n\nZealot Lose Rape - The Zealot will brainwash the Champion into being a part Role Play in which the Champion plays a teacher and him a wealthy student.

Minor characters, they only appear in a specific set of scenes, a foursome between each other, the player character, and Helia. Identical twins, the two both have D-cup breasts and \"modest-sized\" canine cocks.\n\nThe two have two foursome scenes, one for males and one for females, with herms choosing which part to play. In the male scene, Mai penetrates her sister vaginally even as the player mounts her from behind, while Helia mounts Miko's phallus in a reverse-cowgirl position and grinds her breasts against Mai's. In the female scene, the player fellates Mai before allowing her to penetrate their vagina, even as Helia does the same to Miko, with the two foxes starting out on top before the player and Helia flip them over and put themselves on top. If the PC is a female (or herm and chooses to focus on their female organs) with fuckable nipples, an alternate scene occurs where Mai and Miko each penetrate one of her breasts while Helia tail-fucks the PC vaginally.\n\nThe Miko, Mai and Helia foursome is available in two different circumstances:\n\nUrta's Fertility Quest\nAt the beginning of the quest, where you play Urta rather than your regular Playing Character, you can choose to have a drink before setting out on the quest. If you do, you will meet Miko, Mai and Helia and can choose to have the foursome with them.\nVisiting The Wet Bitch\nIf you visit the bar in Tel'Adre whilst having Helia in camp as a lover, you can find Helia drinking at the bar. If you talk to her, she will introduce you to the twins and you get the option of having the foursome with them.\nNotes\nThe exact circumstances required for finding Helia at Tel'adre need to be researched. At the tests done so far, the bar was visited at 14:00, 16:00, 18:00 and 19:00 respectively but Helia isn't always there at those two times."

          "content": "Cinnabar is a female rat-morph who lives at the Bizarre Bazaar, where she passes herself off as a prostitute. She can be found from 15:00 each day onwards.\n\nCinnabar is notable for several reasons: she has a fetish for the bizarre and monstrous (basically, the stranger, the hotter to her), a huge size queen fetish (a fetish for being penetrated by massive phalluses), and inhuman elasticity throughout her entire body. Additionally, a large portion of the inside of her wagon is covered in mirror-like \"portals\", which she shows a high facility at both controlling and using during her encounters. It is likely that Cinnabar travels with the Bazaar due to the easy access it has to corrupted (and thus exotic) individuals, allowing her to indulge in her cravings for unusual and over-endowed members.\n\nCinnabar will take any customer who approaches her in exchange for 50 gems, but, if they have a penis she deems \"too small\", or don't have a penis at all, she will not allow them to penetrate her, instead making them \"fist\" her vagina and anus simultaneously.\n\nIf the player has at least a 25 inch long phallus, Cinnabar deems them \"acceptable\"; she waives the cost of hiring her and allows them to penetrate her.\n\nDespite appearing to be a meek, submissive, cum-hungry whore at first, Cinnabar quickly shows that she has a dominating and aggressive personality, casually dismissing the player as a plaything once she's finished with them. Players who are over 30 inches long, have more than 75 Corruption, and possess either Corrupted Jojo or Exgartuan, will attempt to force the encounter along against Cinnabar's will, where she reveals that she is far more vindictive and intelligent than would seem. A side-effect of this \"lesson in empathy\" is that the player's Corruption score will actually drop."

          "content": "First Encounter\nA whisper of conversation catches your ear while you’re wandering the bazaar, and overcome by curiosity, you veer towards it.\n\nAs you’re closing in on the voices, the dialogue grows clear enough to understand.\n\n“-old him if he doesn’t finish this week’s experiments, she’s going to drop him into a submission tank instead of the champion!” exclaims the first voice, sounding quite feminine.\n\nA baritone response rings out, “You’re shitting me! Syrena’s off her fucking rocker if she thinks Lethice will let her turn another of our researchers into a gibbering slut. We’ve got enough of those.”\n\n“Well, what do you expect? She’s more shark than demon... I’m amazed she gets anything done at all, with as much time as she spends fucking me. Don’t get me wrong, that double-thick dick makes my cunny fuckin' drool, ya know? But, at the same time, if I could just get some more information on her research, I could have her job. Then she’d be serving MY desires... yum,” trails off the sultry, seductive tone.\n\nThe male laughs and says, “You belong underneath a fat dick, bitch. Look at you, you’ve got strings of lube trailing on the ground behind you. You’re too busy slutting it up to accomplish anything. I’m thinking I had better head back to the lab, though. I don’t want to wind up looking like one of the escaped factory rejects - gotta keep this perfect bod, ya know?”\n\nYou get a good look at the two when the crowd parts, and wow, that incubus is right. He’s a curly-haired, chiseled Adonis of a man, with a bulge as over-the-top of the rest of him straining at his fashionable pants. The demon fiddles with his collar, popping it up, and he turns to leave. The other commiserating devil is a busty succubus in a lab coat... nothing else. She’s even wetter than her companion’s words would indicate, painting a thick trail of slippery girl-slime in her wake as she moves. The succubus' nipples are like two hard bullets, soaking two glorious wet patches into her coat as she argues back.\n\n“S-shut up. That cunt tested some of her prototype compounds on me, remember? That stuff turned my pussy into an insatiable furnace. If I can get some free time... I’ll... I’ll... oh screw it, let’s go rent a room and fuck a few times before we go back. I’ll want to be thinking clearly when I face her. Syrena won’t get to gloat about me jumping on her fat... juicy... mmm... cock... this time!” The succubus takes the incubus' hand and drags him away in a hurry.\n\nWell, that explains a lot. The demons seem to have an active research department, though the one called Syrena does not seem to please her underlings very much. Then again, you doubt any demonic servants are pleased with their bosses. You can’t wait to put a stop to their labors, but for now, there’s nothing to do but use the bazaar or go home.\n\nSecond Encounter\nJust as before, you spot the collar-popping incubus and his lab coat-clad lover complaining about their boss.\n\n“-still sore! I can’t believe she did that to me!” groans the male.\n\nSmiling cruelly, the slick-pussied succubus says, “You deserved it. Honestly, you turned in cum-stained reports to your boss, and you’re surprised that she took your ass for a ride as punishment? If you ask me, you planned all this. Who do you think had to clean up the huge mess you left on the floor?”\n\nFor once, the incubus seems speechless. He mutters, “Well, I didn’t plan it. I-I was just having fun with one of the new slaves - for inspiration - while I finished up the paperwork.” He looks over and punches the leering female’s arm. “Besides, I thought you liked cleaning up my cum? I’ve never seen you complain before.”\n\nThe succubus laughs and slaps his ass as she answers, “Don’t worry, you taste great... just not as good as the boss. I dunno what concoction she made that did it, but her spunk is heavenly. I could just... mmm... swallow that delicious cream all day long. Do ya think she’s part minotaur?”\n\n“Babe, you’re sliming everywhere again. Why don’t we go blow off some steam?” The two horny demons run off and disappear.\n\nThird Encounter\nThis time, the two chatty demons are seated near the fire, and the reason for their altered location seems clear. The succubus' belly is gravid to an unusual degree, utterly packed with some kind of corrupted offspring. She’s rubbing both her hands over the stretched skin-dome and moaning in discomfort, the packed womb squirming beneath her touches.\n\nMeanwhile, the male incubus is knocking back a beer, grumbling, “Could you take it down a notch? It isn’t like this is the first time you’ve had to lug around a load of imps - don’t be so melodramatic.”\n\nHis pregnant companion growls and tugs at her undersized lab coat, failing to conceal the blueberry-colored bulge of her belly from him as she retorts, “You didn’t have to get all these fucked into you, now did you? Hell, she even shot me up with fertility-plus first! It feels like there’s two dozen of the little bastards packed in there! I figure in another day or two I won’t even be able to walk.”\n\n“So does that mean you won’t mind if I stop by whilst you’re laid up? I mean you can’t get any more pregnant with imps, and it might pass the time,” suggests the well-muscled male.\n\nSmirking, the demoness retorts, “Sure, but next time you fuck up, I’m loaning Syrena some of my girly stuff to make you suffer just like this.” Her hands both point at the imp-engorged skin of her midsection for emphasis.\n\nThe incubus rises and taunts, “If I fucked up as often as you did, I’d be feeding the furnace in a factory somewhere or fed to the hell hounds. Come on, let’s get you home before I have to roll you back.”\n\nUnwilling to allow herself to be helped, the succubus staggers up and begins waddling away. The incubus keeps his distance, wearing a predatory grin."

          "content": "Captain Roxanne Poisontail, who is also happy to be called Cap'n Poisontail or just Roxanne, is a cursed Lizan pirate who can be found drinking with her rowdy crew in the Bizarre Bazaar every day from 13:00 until 18:00 (vanished by 19:00). While the rest of her crew are obviously male, the uniform they wear - silver-trimmed black jackets, tight-fitting leather pants, and tall black boots - is quite obvious as to her feminine nature; her boots have a sluttier high-heeled shape, while DD-Cup breasts fill out her jacket. Her scales are dark purple and she has a pair of \"draconic\" horns instead of hair. Though she is the only female present, the others are clearly afraid of her.\n\nUpon the player's approach, she invites them to come and share stories. The player explains their nature as the Champion of Ingnam, while the Captain explains she and her crew were once famous pirates, but they have been trapped in Mareth. The conversation takes its inevitable sexual turn from there as she complains that the worst thing about Mareth is being surrounded by gorgeous demon-tail that she can't tap without the risk of losing herself to corruption and/or mind-control. At this point, she leans back and reveals a bulge in her crotch that \"would rival that of a minotaur\", whereupon she explains she isn't really a girl and she found out the hard way that demons are deceitful and untrustworthy. She was deceived into taking a pill from Ceraph, and ever since then her cock has been cursed to grow bigger and bigger the longer she goes without sex - her own statements are that only anally penetrating another will \"count\" to make it shrink back down to normal. Because of how big she can get, she has a hard time finding people willing to let her have sex with them.\n\nAt that, an idea hits her and she suggests that she and the PC have a drinking contest; if she wins, she gets to screw the player's ass, while if they win, she'll suck them off. When the player points out that she gets the better part of the deal, she declares she'd sooner let her cock grow until it immobilized her than let somebody else dictate the terms of sex to her, lewdly taunting the player by showing off her perversely long and flexible tongue to add weight to her argument that the reward is worth the risk.\n\nThe player is given the choice to accept her offer and compete, accept her offer and lose on purpose, or just walk away.\n\nOn subsequent encounters, Poisontail immediately offers to take the PC on in another drinking contest.\n\nIf the player wins, then Poisontail will publicly fellate (orally pleasure the PC's genitalia) or rim (orally pleasure the PC's anus) the player.\n\nIf the player loses the contest to Poisontail, accidentally or on purpose, the combination of heavy drinking and extreme sex costs them Strength, Speed and Intelligence. This is, however, due mostly to the hangover, and it wears off in about eight hours. Variations in the scene seem to be due to the time elapsed since the last time she fucked the PC. If Poisontail has not had relief in a sufficient amount of time, a different scene plays out where she walks you into privacy of her wagon. This usually occurs the first time you lose to her.\n\nWinning the contest, according to comments by Fenoxo, is determined by a combination of Toughness, Height and Thickness; the higher these scores are, the better the PC can handle the alcohol. However, simply competing in the contest apparently builds up an invisible \"tolerance meter\", which will eventually allow a PC to handle the alcohol even despite their form.\n\nTrivia\n\"Shemale\" is a common internet term for a person who has a feminine physique, complete with sizeable female breasts, but has only male genitalia. Male-to-female (MTF) transsexuals identify as female and prefer to be referred to as such — referring to them as shemales is considered highly insulting and derogatory.\nPoisontail is currently the only shemale in the game, unless one counts the Gnolls with their pseudo-penises.\nIt's unclear from Poisontail's dialogue if she was always a shemale, if she was a male who developed a feminine physique after taking Ceraph's toxic pills, or if she was always a female and had her female genitalia transform into ever-expanding male ones as a result of Ceraph.\nThough chances are that she begun as female - as male lizans feature twin male genitalia and hers appears to be similar to Urta's in regards to both its size altering and its original acquisition. (demonic influence)\nThe name \"Roxanne Poisontail,\" is most likely a reference to the two Final Fight characters Roxy (the original game's only female character) and Poison (who was called a cross-dressing male in the original game but was retconned into being female in subsequent titles)."

You are given the option to either suck it all out, leading to a scene where you give him a long blow job until the potion wears off, or you can tell him to masturbate it all out, and he goes into a back room to do that.\n\nNotes\nEaster 2013 Joey offered a chocolate massage as a special Yearly Event.\nTrivia\nJoey is what is known in the West as a \"10% furry\" and in Japan as a \"Kemonomimi\". This means that while he has a rabbit's ears and tail, he otherwise looks totally human - as can be seen during a massage he has human legs, unlike the Bunny Girl who can also be encountered in the Plains. In either case, this makes him a rarity in Corruption of Champions, where most \"furry\" characters are \"true\" furries. The only other 10% furry in the game is Yara the catgirl from Tel'Adre, because she is a human who ate only a small amount of Whisker Fruit."

The player may purchase this beer from her for three gems. For an additional two gems, the player may take the beer as an item in their inventory. Drinking Niamh's Black Cat Beer causes a 5-point reduction to both Speed and Intelligence as well a 10-point increase to Libido.\n\nIf the player repeatedly visits, they will notice the size description for Niamh's breasts shrinking by one cup letter for every purchase throughout the day. As Niamh mentions at the end of her working day, her breasts will refill by morning.\n\nThe player also has the option to talk to Niamh. She reveals that she was once an ordinary woman who ate some Whisker Fruit. She later traveled to the Desert and happened upon a Sand Witch who could lactate beer. After getting black out drunk in the witch's company, she awoke with similar lactation abilities.\n\nFavorite Customer\nAfter purchasing a significant amount of Niamh's beer, a special scene unlocks where she greets the player as her favorite customer and asks the player to get her a drink. At this point, the player has the opportunity to corrupt Niamh. This can be done by either giving Niamh Bimbo Liqueur which raises player corruption by 10, or Succubi Milk which raises player corruption by ?.\n\nGetting Beer Breasts\nIf you have lactating breasts (DD or bigger) and order an on-the-house beer, a special scene will sometimes pop up telling you that after you drank the beer your breasts have gotten bigger and \"fuller\" and your nipples have gotten bigger (at least an inch). Niamh will bring you behind the bar with a shot glass and after squeezing your nipples and filling the shot glass, she will drink from it and tell you that you have started to temporarily lactate beer. You can then sell your new drink for some extra gems which will raise your lust and libido. This scene is repeatable as long as you are lactating.\n\nThis seems to work on normal Niamh, but not Bimbo Niamh.\n\nAfter selling your booze, if your lust is high enough, you have the option to let Niamh and the bar's patrons fuck you. This scene has variations for males, females and herms, as well as for multiple breast rows, multiple cocks, cock size, vaginal capacity, pregnancy and fuckable nipples. A female or herm PC can become pregnant; however, despite the scene stating that you are fucked by a couple of dog-morphs the pregnancy appears to be randomised in the same way as the goblin machine at the Gym (i.e. mouse-morphs, centaur or minotaur). Provided that you have had the first encounter with Urta a female or herm PC will always get fucked by Urta instead if she is in the bar.\n\nDemonic Niamh\nIf you give Niamh succubus milk she undergoes demonic transformation and tossed out of Tel'Adre. The next day she can be encountered in the plains, drink from her for temporary status effects and she will move on to the Bazaar. Her scenes in the bazaar are not currently implemented.\n\nBimbo Niamh\nAs is common of the drink, Bimbo Liqueur gives Niamh a Bimbo Body and Bimbo Brains, her breasts and butt grow larger, her hair becomes blonde, and she becomes significantly less intelligent. At the end of the transformation scene, Niamh is evicted from Tel'Adre.\n\n24 hours after Niamh is evicted, the player can encounter her on the Plains. She offers the player a drink from her corrupted breasts. Drinking results in a 10 point reduction in Speed and breasts smaller than DD will be increased to DD. If the player tries to reduce breast size, they will go back to DD the next hour, and additionally suffer a 1 point loss of Intelligence. Drinking from her breasts can also give the player a vagina if they do not have one. These effects wear off after some time (+10 Speed, breast size returns to previous, vagina disappears).\n\nAt the end of the drinking scene, Niamh mentions the Bizarre Bazaar. After this, Niamh becomes accessible via the Bazaar and is available all hours of the day. Instead of Black Cat Beer, Bimbo Niamh now lactates Bimbo Champagne. As before, the player has the option to drink it directly, or keep it as an item.\n\nUnlimited Bimbo Liqueur\nAs of 0.8.8, Bimbo Liqueur is quite rare for non-male characters: random non-plot rare drop at level 7+ (up to 0.5%), rare purchasable for sale from Benoit (0.8%), rare gathering from Kid A at later stages (1%). However, male PCs will automatically get it from the repeatable Tiger Assault event if they choose \"Suck None\".\n\nWith Bimbo Niamh in place at the Bazaar, the player has the opportunity to stock Bimbo Champagne. If the player takes five bottles of Bimbo Champagne to Sean at the Deep Cave, he will offer to distill it into Bimbo Liqueur for 500 gems in 24 hours. This process can be repeated as often as the player likes (provided they have the 500 gems each time). Thus, female or herm players wishing to make multiple \"Bimbo\" characters (such as Sophie and Ceraph) should use the Liqueur on Niamh first so that they have easy access to multiple bottles."

          "content": "\"Yes, go ahead, stare,\" says the basilisk in a long-suffering tone, making you jump. \"It is a funny joke, yes? Believe me, I wake up laughing about it every morning. At least here zey stare. In ze mountains, zey are so embarrassed zey can't even look at me. Or at least I assume zey can't.\"\n\nBenoit is a blind basilisk who, along with Pierre, his Alsatian, runs a pawn shop in the Bizarre Bazaar. \"Geckos Garbidg\", as the scrawled sign labels it, is open from 9:00 to 17:00. A female or herm player can have sex with him and become pregnant. A male path feminizing him was planned but not yet implemented. He is a source of the Oviposition perk for non-bird/reptiles with vaginas.\n\nShop\nUnlike Oswald in Tel'Adre, Benoit only pays 1/3 of the items he buys (unless he impregnates a sufficiently fertile PC) and offers a selection of items for sale for twice their base value (eggs don't change this). His selection is always 3 items but varies from day to day.\n\nSlot 1 will contain one of:\n\nEquinum - 12 gems,\nReptilum - 12 gems,\nIncubi Draft - 12 gems,\nMinotaur Blood - 12 gems,\nVitality Tincture - 12 gems,\nScholar's Tea - 12 gems,\nSolid Black Canine Pepper - 20 gems,\nDouble Canine Pepper - 20 gems,\nMinotaur Cum - 120 gems.\nNote that the two teas are 3 gems cheaper here than from Giacomo. There is also 10% chance, it will contain God's Mead for 12 gems.\n\nSlot 2 will likely contain, for 12 gems, one of:\n\nBlack Gossamer,\nGolden Seed,\nLaBova,\nSweet Gossamer,\nSnake Oil,\nSuccubi Milk,\nWet Cloth,\nWhisker Fruit.\nThere is a 4% chance it may instead contain one of:\n\nBimbo Liqueur - 2000 gems,\nLarge Pink Egg - 12 gems,\nLarge Blue Egg - 12 gems,\nBro Brew - 12 gems,\nTiger Shark Tooth - 12 gems.\nSlot 3 will likely contain one of:\n\nTough Silk - 12 gems, much easier than waiting for it to drop from Swamp enemies. Good for Spider-silk Armor and Spider-silk Robes, albeit for an 85 gem loss.\nBlack Chitin - 12 gems, and an easy way to get Bee Chitin Armor, which sells for a 40 gem profit in Tel'Adre\nGreen Gel - 12 gems, and an easy way to get Gel Armor, which sells for a 15 gem profit in Tel'Adre\nWizard's Robes - 100 gems, easier and sooner available than from Harpies\nSlutty Swimwear - 12 gems.\nIt has a 10% chance to instead contain:\n\nGod's Mead - 12 gems.\nBondage Straps - 1200 gems,\nNurse's Outfit - 1600 gems.\nSex\nGo to Benoit while pregnant with Ovi Elixir eggs or while in heat, and you will have the option to suggest sex. After you take the option once it remains unlocked afterward, no matter your pregnancy or lack thereof.\n\nHe at first has two basic scenes, one wherein you goad him into being dominant, and one wherein you dominate. The first time, you will get a modified version of the latter, followed by the option to accept contraceptive herbs or not. This is a bit silly, since one's womb may contain eggs already for this scene, but perhaps basilisk semen has some way to alter existing eggs.\n\nFeminization\nIf you have 40 relationship with him, and have not had sex with him as a female; talking with Benoit will trigger a scene that makes it possible to turn him into a girl. You will need to bring the right items to Benoit to do this. The recipe is:\n\n2 Purified Succubi Milk\n1 Large Pink Egg\n1 Ovi Elixir\n1 Reptilum\nPerks\nAfter having sex with Benoit, the next time you select the Talk option he will give you a theoretical recipe for getting the Oviposition perk without needing harpy or lizan transformations. In fact, this is all he will talk about once you unlock it, so be sure you've seen all his other Talk text first if you want to. It's probably a bug.\n\nThe recipe is:\n\n2 Ovi Elixir\n1 Reptilum\n1 Goblin Ale\nbasilisk blood, which isn't an item and will be provided by Benoit\nBring these to Benoit and select the Basilisk Womb option. Then return and Suggest sex. This unlocks both the Oviposition and Basilisk Womb perks - the latter allows Benoit to impregnate you, and also the generic Basilisks that you encounter in the High Mountains.\n\nNotes\n\nDuring the first sex scene he asks a female PC to get a feel for her body first (with him being blind and all) and if the PC has scales or some form of reptilian transformations he will notice it, saying “I cannot believe I did not realise you were a sister of ze scales,” “Zat is very... interesting.”\nIf a female PC has Feline ears and a tail then when he's getting a feel for her body, then he will laugh and comment, “I always wondered why Pierre gets all excited when 'e sees you.”\nIf asked about the shop's sign, Benoit comments that he got a catguy to make it, and he believes it reads \"Salamander's Salubrious Salvage\". The player opts against disillusioning him.\nTrivia\n\nIn one conversation you have with Benoit, he will tell you about him being teased by some demons when they asked how 'cheese omelet' is said in the Basilisk language. This is a reference to an episode from Dexter's Laboratory, where Dexter used a machine to study for his French class, and ended up to only be able to say 'cheese omelet' in french, and his sister Deedee mocking him with 'that's all you can say'. This reference works well do to the fact Benoit's accent \"sounds\" French.\nWhen you open the \"Buy\" menu Benoit will say \"Some may call zis junk, Me... I call it garbage.\" This is a reference to a line from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim where merchants that sell miscellaneous goods say \"Some may call this junk, Me I call it treasure.\""

          ],
          "content": "Urta's Fertility Quest differs from other mini-quests in that instead of your regular Playing Character you take the role or Urta, the hermaphroditic fox-morph captain of Tel'Adre's guard. This means you may have to adjust your regular fighting style to fit a completely different set of skills and limitations. Apart from the optional sex scenes at the beginning, it is a linear quest where finishing one stage takes you right to the next with no alternative routes to follow.\n\nOpening\nThe quest can only start after Urta has become your lover. If you ask her about her infertility, the talk will also touch upon her strange resistance to transformations and the possibility that the two oddities are related. With you encouragement, she agrees to go to Tower of Tel'Adre to ask on of the city's Mages for advice.\n\nAt this point you become Urta and your regular PC becomes a NPC who only makes one (optional) cameo appearance until the very end of the quest.\n\nAt the Council you are taken to Gul, the same Diviner who examined your unusual condition when you were born. He agrees to give you a new examination and discovers that the cause of your problems is that you were possessed at birth by Taoth, the Trickster God. Presumed to have been killed by the demons, he had somehow managed to escape and enter you as you were born and he has been asleep inside you ever since. To free yourself of him you first have to wake him. To do that, you must go to the shrine where he was supposed to have been killed. Before you leave, Gul gives you a pendant that will lead you to the shrine - the last remaining regalia of a Taoth priestess. He advises you to hurry and go on your adventure with no delays.\n\nSexy Interludes\nAfter conferring with Gul you are left with four choices; go out for a drink, seek out your lover (the regular PC) without telling the truth, seek out your lover and tell him/her the truth, or go straight onto the quest. Despite Gul's advice, there is no real urgency. Choosing one of the other options will lead to one ore more potentially sexy interludes but not affect the outcome of the quest.\n\nGo for a drink\nIf you decide to have a drink first, you go to The Wet Bitch where you meet Miko, Mai and Helia. You can choose to have a foursome with them or leave for your quest right away.\n\nMeet your lover\nIf you decide to meet your lover, you have a talk with him/her and possibly some sex before you leave for your quest. You can also choose to simply cuddle your lover, focusing on love rather than lust before you leave for your quest.\n\nThe Journey\nOnce on your journey you will encounter five enemies who all want to enslave you for various reasons:\n\nThe Goblin Broodmother\nSirius\nThe Gnoll Alpha\nFido\nFido's Mistress\nAll are unique to the quest and slightly different from the opponents met elsewhere in the game. All are relatively easy to beat if handled the right way but nearly impossible if handled the wrong way. Without giving any spoilers, there are two tips to keep in mind:\n\nRemember that you are Urta, not your regular PC. You need to find a fighting style that makes the best of her skills.\nMost of the time there will be no time for rest between the fights. That means it's not enough to defeat an opponent, you also have to get out of the battle with good enough stats to deal with the next one right away.\nUrta's fighting skills\nUrta has Strength 75, Toughness 80, Speed 90, Intelligence 55, Libido 70, Sensitivity 50 and Corruption 30. She has 435 hit-points and a minimum lust of 30. She is equipped with a halberd (attack 22) and leather armor segments (defense 17). Regular attacks typically deals 80-90 points of damage to the opponent. Critical hits are fairly common but not common enough to be relied upon. Her teasing capacity is fairly high and she can cause approximately 10 points of tease damage per round.\n\nShe has a number of special attacks:\n\nCombo allows her to strike three times with the same force as a single regular attack. It costs 24.5 fatigue points, and there is a good chance that her opponent will block one, two or even all three attacks unless they are blind.\nVault is an attempt to slam the halberd into a foe whilst leaping into the air. It costs 20 fatigue points and tend to deal slightly less damage than a regular attack. It is a very reliable attack though and works even when Urta is blinded and unable to get through with regular attacks. It will automatically score a critical hit against a stunned opponent.\nSidewinder is described as \"a wide swing to the side\" and has the advantage of both dealing damage and stunning the opponent for two rounds. It costs 10 fatigue points and can deal damage up to 45 points.\nDirt Kick allows her to blind the opponent by kicking dirt into his/her face. It costs 5 fatigue points and doesn't always succeed. When it works, the opponent remains blinded for the next two rounds.\nMetabolize restores fatigue points at the cost of health. Reduces health points by 49 and fatigue points by 20.\nSecond Wind significantly improves health and reduces lust and fatigue. It is an extremely efficient trick but can only be used once during a fight and shouldn't be wasted too early in the fight. If Urta hasn't already needed it when the battle draws to an end, it may be a good idea to use second wind to regain as much health and fatigue as possible before the next fight.\nBerserk seems to be identical to the PC's bezerker perk. (Increases attack and lust resistance but reduces physical defenses.)\nTentacle interlude\nAfter beating the Gnoll Alpha, you get a night's sleep. You can sleep with or without your armor. You will be attacked by a tentacle beast while you're asleep. He will rape you if you're sleeping without your armor but will humoroudly give up if you're wearing it (The tentacles wave about wildly, and the shambling mound begins to retreat. “Fuck this!” it shouts, “I just wanted a snack!”). If he rapes you, you can allow him to use his \"Big Orange Tentacle\" which will permanently increase your (Urta's) vaginal capacity to 500. Regardless of your choices, the tentacle episode is an interlude with no effect on the outcome of the quest.\n\nThe Final\nIf you beat all your opponents, you reach the shrine where you awaken Taoth. He will agree to leave your body but to do so he'll need a body of his own. You agree to be the parent of his next reincarnation but you also need to find a second parent too. You seek out your lover for help.\n\nAt this point you're back with your regular PC ...\n\n... and you are visited at your camp by a frantic and desperately horny Urta. After talking to her you end up with one, two or three (depending on your gender) options:\n\nKnock Urta - Urta becomes the mother, you the father (only if you have a penis).\nKnock Edryn - Edryn becomes the mother, Urta the father.\nKnock me - you become the mother, Urta the father (only if you have a vagina).\nNote: You can choose this option even if you already are pregnant which means that for a short while you are pregnant both with the child/litter/eggs you already had and Taoth.\nRegardless of who is chosen as the mother, the pregnancy advances fast - there's barely enough time to get her to the Tel'Adre Covenant before Taoth is reborn. After the birth, the mother's vagina immediately reverts to how it was before, leaving her with no traces of the pregnancy.\n\nOnce reborn, Taoth quickly grows to full maturity, fulfills his promise to restore Urta's fertility and leaves, warning everybody that he may not be as nice and kind if they ever meet him again.\n\nBad Ends\nLosing to any of the enemies will lead to a bad end. A bad end for Urta that is, she's permanently removed from the game. You on the other hand are taken back to the camp and your regular PC with a rather laconic \"Meanwhile back at the camp.\"\n\nSpoilers\n(Major spoiler alert! Do not read this if you want to solve the Urta fertility quest by yourself!)\n\nFour of Urta's five opponents can be easily beaten just by teasing.\n\nThe goblin broodmother require four rounds of successful teases (not counting any that gives the \"goblin broodmother seems unimpressed\" message. Use the Second Wind special attack right before the last Tease to recover as much combat stats as possible before the next fight. You can also beat the goblin broodmother with regular attacks. Normally that too takes four successful attacks but there is always a chance that you get in a critical hit which means the fight might end before you've had the chance to use Second Wind. Also, if you choose physical attack you're likely to loose more hit-points yourself than if you choose to tease. Do not try to combine tease attacks with regular attacks, chose one of them and stick to it!\nSirius can not be teased. He's too focused on the fight to even notice. The best tactic seems to go into berzerker mode (found under the \"M Specials\" button), try to stun him with a Sidewinder kick or two and then pummel him with Combo attacks. If/when you run out of fatigue points, you can use Second Wind to recover or switch to regular attacks. If you haven't had to use Second Wind earlier in the game, you should use it as the fight draws to an end to recover as much as possible before fighting the alpha gnoll.\nThe alpha gnoll can be beaten the same way as the goblin broodmother. She has much tougher defenses though and it takes eight successful attacks to beat her. If you HP is low at the start of the game, you should keep a watch and be prepared to use Second Wind earlier than you'd usually want to.\nThe outcome of the tentacle beast event doesn't affect the fights.\nUnless you're seriously beaten up after the alpha gnoll fight, your combat stats should be at max when you meet Fido. He can be beaten physically but it's extremely hard, as he can heal physical damage, and will probably leave you too weak to win the next fight. The only safe way to beat him is by teasing. It takes six successful tease attacks to win. You should remember to use Second Wind after the fifth - if you don't, you're likely to get into serious problems during the next fight.\nFido's mistress is even harder to beat physically than Fido, but she too is quite vulnerable to tease attack and succumbs after eight of them. She can also heal herself during the fight, but doing so raises both her and your lust. Any lust damage you deal to her will heal her physical damage. Keep a close watch on your lust level and use Second Wind when it gets uncomfortably high. There's no need to worry what happens after the fight - all you need to think of is how to beat her.\nAfter each fight you can choose to have sex with your opponent. It won't influence the outcome of the quest. The only exception is if you have a high (about forty or higher) Lust level after beating Fido. If you do, it's a good idea to rape him to let out some steam before you face his mistress.\nUsually, your Lust level jumps to 100 once you've beaten Fido's Mistress. Raping her does not reduce lust. As long as you've won the fight, you can go on regardless of how bad your combat stats may be."

            "Strange Dreams from Cock-Sock"
          ],
          "content": "Strange Dream\n\nYour dreams come fast and vivid that night... Your body feels odd, misshapen... you find yourself walking on all fours. No, wait, all sixes you correct yourself. Six large, furry paws and limbs hold you up over a smooth, silvery metallic floor. The floor is so shiny, in fact, you can make out your reflection.\n\nYour body is not at all how you remember it... although those memories are fast fading. Perhaps you were dreaming? Of course this is your normal body. You’ve always had six legs, a powerful furred body, long bushy tail, a wolf-like head... and of course you’ve always had the two tentacle-like appendages that sprout from your shoulders. Though your body seems alien at first, you quickly find your mind adapting. Taking the chance to explore, you pad around the room, your movements flowing naturally as if you’d been in this body your entire life. Of course you have, you were born this way!\n\nThe dreams shifts abruptly, and you find yourself in some kind of metallic cave. Shiny iron and steel cover the walls, floor and ceiling. You glance around, unsure of yourself for a moment, but this place seems so familiar. You trot forward, warily.\n\nA soft “sssht” noise comes from one side of the cave as you pass by, and when you go to look, you find a sudden gap in the wall. You peer inside curiously. The metal cave seems to continue in here, opening into a massive cavern, in the center if which is a tall, glittering gemstone column. It pulses and throbs with light, its color shifting from red to blue and back again every few seconds.\n\nAt the base of this column is a figure, clearly feminine, poking at some type of metal book. Words shimmer across its surface, as if by magic, and disappear just as quickly when the female figure taps on them. You pad forward, inspecting this new figure. She stands on a pair of wolf-like paws much like you, but whereas you walk an all six of your limbs, she stands only on the two. Her four furred arms, however, tap away at the panel quickly, while a small, almost dainty pair of tentacles sprout from the back of her shoulders.\n\nHer body is curvy and voluptuous although it’s concealed beneath some kind of skin-tight suit. As you approach, the woman turns, her human-like face momentarily startled by your presence. “Oh! Captain!” she starts, “I wasn’t expecting you down here, Captain.”\n\nCaptain? Oh yes, how could you forget? You’re the captain of this... metal cave. And as a captain, you can give orders... The dream shifts once more. Gone are the alien woman’s clothes. She now lays naked on the cool metal floor. A light covering of midnight blue fur runs down her back and sides, but her front is completely smooth tanned skin. The wolf-like alien giggles softly, clearly trying to keep her voice down. There must be others like her, or like you around.\n\nYou urge her to remain quiet before clamping your lips around one of her perky nipples, lavishing it with your tongue. The alien woman coo’s, murmuring, “Oh, Captain” repeatedly. You run your tongue down her body, stopping at her moist cunt... which looks somehow different than you expected. Rather than pink folds, her slick pussy is colored a cobalt blue. You blink your eyes a couple times, just to make sure you’re not seeing double. Two hard, dark blue clits peek out from two separate hoods... this woman has two clitorises!\n\nYour shock is short-lived however. Of course she has two clits, it would be weird if she didn’t, you think to yourself. You lean down and delve into her cunt, tongue first. Your long muscle snakes into her body, tasting her insides before slurping back out to tease her outer lips.\n\nThe dream shifts again, she’s on all fours, her bushy, wolf-like tail lifted to show off that sweet ass and pussy. You feel an incessant hardness beneath you and realize your cock is dangling out of its sheathe. You blink your eyes again... is something wrong with your dick? At first glance, it appears to be a normal canine dick... but the tip seems to have five grooves along the sides. When you think about it, you find the tip opening up, splaying out into something resembling a five-armed starfish, with the tips ending in wiggling tendrils, the inner-flesh covered in bumpy nodules that stiffen in the cool air of the cave. With another thought, the cock returns to its normal, almost-canine like appearance, though it’s definitely thicker around the tip than an actual canine dick. Again, the more you think about it, the more natural this is. Of course you’ve always had this cock!\n\nTurning your attention back to the strange creature in front of you, you step forward, putting your forepaws on her shoulders while you brace yourself with the other four. She whispers words of encouragement, and you growl some dirty talk back at her. You line up your shot, and thrust in suddenly, eliciting a muffled “aaaah” from your mate. You pound away, each little thrust making her moan louder and louder until she sinks her front half to the floor, desperately clutching her mouth with two hands to avoid drawing attention.\n\nIn a dreamy haze you continue to fuck this strange, alien woman senseless, delighting in your powerful, dominant body. The way you tower over her, controlling her with but a command... The way she trembles beneath you, writhing in the pleasure that you bring her. You’re confident that, if you were to stop here, she would beg you to continue. But it doesn’t come to that. No, you’re so wound up, so caught in this feeling of utter dominance that you can’t help but thrust away, the need to spill your seed so overwhelming it hinders your ability to think straight.\n\nYou feel the tip of your cock blossom, the five tendrils squirming around inside her sodden box, searching around like blind snakes until they find their target. The tendrils bear down upon a hard ring of flesh... the woman’s cervix! The tendrils twist around, clamping down on her cervix, eliciting a squeal of pleasure from the woman’s throat while you growl your dominance over her. With your tendrils clamping down like this, you can’t thrust as much, but you continue as much as you can with shallow pumps.\n\nWith a loud, primal growl you thrust in one final time, a bulge at the base of your cock suddenly swelling into a large knot, sealing yourself inside her. Your tendrils clench even tighter as a blast of hot white cum erupts from the center of your starfish-like cock. Even without seeing it, you know each and every jet of your jizz is injected directly into the woman’s womb. With both the direct injection and your knot in place, you know she’s practically guaranteed to get pregnant, and this drives you even more crazy. The thought of her belly large and round, full of your offspring floods your mind, which in turn creates another flood of cum to blast into her waiting womb.\n\nThe dream shifts again. The wolf-like woman pants on the ground below you, her stomach bulging slightly with your very fertile seed. No doubt she’ll be carrying a litter of your children very soon. You remain firmly knotted inside her, and you’re pleased to see that not a drop of jism has escaped.\n\nA soft “sssht” noise comes from behind you, that hole in the metal cave opening up once more. Curious, you twist around so that you and your alien lover are butt-to-butt, and trot towards the doorway, dragging her along with you, though she’s too blissed out to care.\n\nAs you pass through the doorway, your vision suddenly goes white... and you wake up with a start. The details of the dream immediately begin to slip away. You strain your brain, trying to commit everything to memory, but it slips out of your mind like water through a sieve.\n\nSoon, even the details of the wolf-girl are gone, and you curse silently to yourself. All you can really remember right now is the metal cave... and the glittering gem-like pillar. You wonder if such a thing exists in the real world, and then dismiss it. Such a thing is totally beyond the scope of reality.\n\nAs you settle back in to sleep, you feel a soft squirming beneath the covers. Lifting the blanket, you can’t stop your jaw from dropping. There, between your legs is a cock just like the one in your dreams, fitting snugly into its purple cock-sock. You give it a tentative poke, and the canine-like tip again unfurls into its starfish-like head tipped with wiggling tendrils. How odd... was this the intended effect of the cock-sock?\n\nYou give your new coeurl cock a few tentative strokes, to confirm its verisimilitude. When you’re satisfied it’s not just another dream, you sigh and flop backwards onto your bed. This world just gets stranger by the second... you idly wonder what it would be like on some other world..."

            "Tower of the Phoenix"
          ],
          "content": "After becoming friends with Helia, a night-time event will proc once her affection reaches 70 that has her appear in the player's camp. She approaches the player and asks for help with a den of Harpies that have been breeding half-Salamander hybrids known as Phoenixes. Upon agreeing to help, Helia will temporarily join the player's camp as a Lover. Approaching her then will cause her to ask whether you're ready to tackle the Harpy den.\n\nHelia will lead the player to the Harpies' den in the High Mountain, and tell the player that they will take a two-pronged approach to the area; Helia will climb to the top, while the player is tasked with going through the main entrance.\n\nUpon entering, the player will be faced with a door to the north, a trap door that contains 5 God's Meads, and note a suit of armor that seems wearable. If the player chooses the armor, they will encounter a blue goo-girl named Ser Valeria, who will attack you. If the player defeats her, she will quickly apologize and offer to join you, becoming a wearable suit of armor and Follower.\n\nIf the player goes through the northern door, they will be attacked by a group of harpies. After the battle, a lone fiery-red Harpy named Kiri will reveal that she had spiked the Harpies' drinks, but the player arrived before they had an opportunity to consume them. Kiri informs the player that she is friends with Helia and that she was the one who told Helia of the dungeon and the Harpies. Afterward, the player can proposition her for sex, talk to her for information or traverse a set of stairs to the second floor or another set to the dungeon. If the player talks to Kiri about the Salamander prisoner, she will reveal that the prisoner is named Hakon and is in fact Helia's father. She will also reveal that the only way to free him is to get two keys, one for the shackles on Hakon's arms, and another for the shackles on his legs. The Harpy Queen possesses one key while Brigid, the Harpy Jailer, has the other.\n\nIf the player travels to the dungeon, they will be challenged by Brigid. Defeating her will grant the player access to the Salamander prisoner Hakon, and some equipment (a Succubi Whip, Bondage Straps, and a Lust Dagger). If the player speaks with Hakon at this point, he will be informed that the player is here to rescue him with Helia, upon which he will demand the player find her and escape.\n\nIf the player chooses to go upstairs from where they meet Kiri, they will reach the second floor and encounter a mob of Phoenixes. After fighting this mob, you can return to Kiri downstairs; however, after defeating the Harpy Queen, Kiri will be gone.\n\nDefeating them will open a path to the third floor, where the player will meet up with Helia and encounter the Harpy Queen. The Harpy Queen is a sorceress on top of being a strong physical fighter. Defeat her, and Helia will pin her to the ground, whereupon the player will have the option to fuck her if sufficiently aroused, interrogate her, kill her, or let her go. The player can also speak with Helia and can tell her about Hakon if they have spoken to him earlier.\n\nInterrogating the Queen will have her reveal that she created the Phoenix breed because of the looming threat of the demons, and will accuse the player of being a demon-lover for stopping her. The option of letting the Queen go free can proc different scenes depending on whether Helia knows if Hakon is her father. If she does not, she will begrudgingly let the Harpy Queen go free and ask the player to free Hakon from the dungeon. If Helia does know of Hakon's true identity, she will kill the Queen herself just before she can fly away. At this point, the player can either forgive her for her act of vengeance of berate her for it. Killing her or letting her go with Helia knowing about Hakon will allow the player to obtain the Queen's Eldritch Staff. Return to the dungeon and speak with Hakon again, and he will reunite with Helia and Kiri. The group will then leave the den. Letting the Harpy Queen successfully escape (i.e. without Helia's knowledge of her father's presence) does not provide any tangible item or perk rewards in game as of version 0.7a1. After defeating Harpy Queen, talking with Hakon twice without going to her will be counted as if she was killed.\n\nHints and tips\nIndividually, the opponents at the Tower of the Phoenix are among the strongest - possibly the strongest - in the game. The quest may be unlocked quite early but shouldn't be attempted until you have reached at least level 15 or so and have spent your perk points on perks relevant to your fighting style. It is also important your main fighting stats (strength for heavy fighters, speed for light/medium fighters, intelligence for spell casters and toughness for everybody) is at or close to 100.\n\nThe main problem, however, is that unlike in the other quests you can't return to camp to recover and resupply between the fights. Once you're in the tower you're committed and you either win or meet a Bad End. You do have the opportunity to recover between fights but since you can neither get a proper rest nor resupply, you can only use the resources you've brought with you in your inventory and what you can find in the tower:\n\nHP\nEven the strongest and best protected PC will lose considerable amounts of HP during each and every fight. There is no way to last even two fights without recovering HP between. There are several HP recovering items found in the tower but they may not be enough so it's a good idea to bring some with you. God's Mead is by far the best option but if that isn't available, stack up with weaker items like Fish Fillets or Pure Peaches may do. When Valaria's being worn, she not only provides considerable defense but a good Regen effect as well. If the character already has Regen and Regen 2, the combined regeneration and defense provided is high enough that it should become possible to complete the entire tower without any more healing items than the God's Mead found in the cellar.\nLust\nNone of the opponents at the tower deals much lust damage and Kiri is able to relieve you between fights.\nFatigue\nIf your fighting strategy is based on spells and/or special attacks rather than regular attacks, you will run out of fatigue points. Bringing with you a couple of bottles of milk (preferably Sheep Milk but any milk will do) to drink between battles, solves that problem.\nSilencing\nThe Goo Armor can silence her opponent, leaving you unable to casts spells for several rounds during the fight. If you aren't confident you can deal 70+ points of physical damage consistently, it is a very good idea to bring along a few Wingsticks to keep the pressure up during the rounds you're unable to cast spells.\nWith five storage slots you can bring with you ten bottles of milk, ten horns of God's Mead (or fish fillets and/or peaches) and five wingsticks. All of these items are cheap (although some can be hard to find) and between them they are more than enough to meet any requirements during the quest, except for one: Do you actually have the strength and skills to fight level 20 opponents?\n\nStats\nThe Harpy Horde is level 18.\nBrigid the Jailor is level 19 and has the ability to restrain her opponent.\nThe Mezzanine are level 20.\nThe Harpy Queen is level 20 and has the ability to restrain her opponent.\nThe Goo Armor is level 16 and has the ability to restrain her opponent. She can also silence her opponent, making it impossible to cast spells."

            "Farm Corruption"
          ],
          "content": "Farm Corruption Quest\n\nRequirements:\n\nLevel 12 or Higher\nCorruption 70 or Higher\nAt Least 2 corrupt followers at their camp\n\nThe Farm Corruption \"quest\" starts the next time the player visits the farm and meets the above requirements. At that point the player will be given an option to start the quest at that point, or not. Choosing \"Never\" reduces the player's corruption by 5. If \"Later\" is chosen, this initial dialogue will appear every few visits until the quest is started.\n\nInitiating the quest prompts a dialogue between the Player and Whitney, resulting in Whitney essentially being convinced to pay a protection fee and allow the player to send workers to the farm.\n\nWhich workers can be sent depends upon which Followers, Lovers, and Slaves the player has recruited. After Whitney spend enough time around corrupt influences, the player will be able to speak to her, giving them the options to check her appearance, purchase investments to help with harvesting, or ask about the prosperity of the farm.\n\nThe \"Prosperity\" option prompts Whitney to give the player advice about what sort of help is needed at the farm. If she can't complain, she has everything necessary. If she mentions something, there's another recruit that you should be sending to help. Currently, the only effect protection has is that Whitney will complain if asked about it, and production affects your weekly cut. Neither affect the rate of Whitney's corruption, which each follower affects independently of production.\n\nSlaves can be used to harvest materials, though most can only harvest after Whitney adjusts to her new life and allows the player to \"Invest.\" Vapula is the only recruit who can harvest before investments are made. Players hoping to avail themselves of all the farm has to offer should be prepared to spend several thousand gems on investments. The first three investments are a Refinery for harvesting transformatives, seed money for growing Herbal Contraceptives, and a tub for your expensively acquired milk slave. Harvested materials stockpile over time under the Farm > Collect menu, capping at a maximum of 5 per item (any extra that would be generated are converted to extra profit, not wasted). The player can also invest in the Breast Milker and Cock Milker if those are not already installed.\n\nThe following is a list of recruits that can be sent to the farm.\n\nCeraph: Laughs at the idea of doing farm-work, but does offer to \"mark\" the farm as belonging to the demons, which greatly increases the farm's protection for a week.\nHolli: Can extend her roots and influence the farm to grow more corrupted vegetation, which increases the rate of Whitney's corruption for 3 weeks. (If it's been a while since she's been sexed, Holli will insist that she needs to be \"fertilized\" before she can work.)\nVapula: Can be sent to work on the farm, eventually allowing the player to gain Succubi Milk via the \"Collect\" option. Provides a small boost in production and protection, and is tied with Holli as the best corruptive influence.\nSophie: Can be sent to the farm in both regular and Bimbo form, allowing the player to harvest colored Eggs. The \"Farm Work\" option will not appear if Sophie is currently pregnant, though it will still appear if a fertilized egg has been laid but not hatched. Gives an average profit boost, small protection boost, and (if bimbo) a point of corruption per day.\nCorrupt Jojo: Can be sent to work on the farm, eventually unlocking a harvest of Incubi Draft. Provides an even balance of corruption, profit, and protection.\nCorrupt Amily: Can be sent to work on the farm, harvesting Succubi Milk. Provides average corruption and profit, and a small amount of protection. (The option will not appear if she is currently pregnant. Additionally, Amily cannot become pregnant while she is at the farm.)\nBath Girl: Can be sent to the farm in her \"cured\" state, or otherwise installed at the farm for a cost. Once installed, she cannot be sent back to camp unless her breasts have had Super Reducto applied at least once. Whitney can \"reboob\" her from her cured state for a cost. Provides an average profits and a point of protection if cured, or a large profit boost if in her tank form.\nLatex Goo-Girl: Can be sent to the farm. The text mentions harvesting latex, but this is only reflected in a small profit bonus. Her happiness and obedience don't change her effect on the farm, but she will lose half a point of happiness and gain half a point of obedience each day. Provides a point of corruption, and a small profit bonus.\nIsabella: Can be sent to work as a farm hand, alleviating some of Whitney's concerns about protection and providing an average boost to profits.\nIzma: Can be sent to guard the farm, further alleviating Whitney's protection concerns and providing a point of profit.\nEmber, Helspawn, Pure Jojo, Rathazul, Shouldra, Valeria, Pure Amily, Arian, Helia, Kiha, Marble, Phylla and Kid A can not be sent to the farm.\n\nIt should be noted that sending a corrupt follower to the farm will not affect a pure follower's aversion to that corrupt follower. i.e. If you send Vapula to the farm, Jojo and Amily will still object to living in your camp. Pure followers can still be recruited even after the farm corruption has begun, assuming the player lowers their corruption. However, Vapula and Holli provide more than half the corruptive influence available, corrupting the farm will take a long time without them.\n\nThe corruption process can be broken down into phases, each marked by a conversation with Whitney. In Phase One, Whitney has no interest in talking with the player. In Phase Two, Whitney allows the player to make investments in the farm and will offer advice about what is necessary for the farm's prosperity. If Whitney doesn't feel good about prosperity, it takes longer to advance from phase to phase, though it will still happen as long as Whitney is being exposed to corrupted farm workers. After a few days in Phase Two, Whitney tells the player that they were right and that she likes her new life. The options remain the same, so this could be thought of as Phase 2.5. After a few more days, Whitney will ask the player to never leave and admits to calling the player \"Master\" or \"Mistress\" under her breath and being thrilled by it.\n\nPhase Three offers the option to change Whitney, and then to make her a dom or a sub. Changing Whitney removes her from the farm until the next morning, delaying the dom/sub decision. She returns having swapped her fur for sandy colored skin. She also takes human feet and a human face, though she keeps her dog ears, her tail, pointed teeth, and a dog-like tongue. In Phase Three, Whitney will ask if the player is there for business or pleasure. Choosing \"Pleasure\" leads to sexy times. New investments are also unlocked in Phase Three, with their own options in Whitney's menu. Branding can be unlocked by both dom and sub Whitney. Massage is only available if Whitney is submissive. It takes approximately eight days for Whitney to prepare the massage room. After receiving a massage, if the player has high lust they can request a happy ending."

          ],
          "content": "This is found if you pay Kiha a toll and are lucky.\n\nThis tells the story of Lethice and gives either Inquisitor's Robes or, for carnality, Inquisitor's Corset.\n\n\nQuote\n\nCutting your way through the swamps in the hopes of finding something that isn’t a spider, you are pleasantly surprised when you actually succeed. You discover what seems to be a mossy stone door in a low hillside, adorned with some sort of complex puzzle lock composed of multiple stone circles decorated with animal symbols. You don’t know what lurks beyond the door, but if adventuring has taught you nothing else it is that something cool is always behind a puzzle.\n\nWhile spinning the puzzle locks to try and determine the solution, you notice something curious about the repeated symbols adorning them. Though initially you thought them to mean something in regards to where the locks were meant to sit, you begin to suspect that there is another trick to them. Slowly working your way through the possibilities, your suspicions are confirmed: the symbols are a cipher, hiding the true answer to getting through the door. Their rotation is a red herring, meant to obscure their nature. If your translation is correct, the door is in fact magically sealed, and waiting for a spoken command to open: one that would never be casually spoken in its presence.\n\n“Chastity,” you say.\n\nThe tumblers of the door spin, locking into a meaningless position. Stone hinges scrape and rumble across the ground as the sealed entrance opens. Stale air rushes out of the cavern. Before you stone steps descend into the ground, and torches along the wall blaze into life. This room may not have been touched in decades.\n\nYou descend, alert. Dust along the floor makes it difficult to discern if there are traps within the room, but the caution is possibly unwarranted, for you reach the bottom of the stairs without incident. A single table and a chest are the only adornments of the interior. Upon the table a rolled piece of parchment sits. Though you are curious about the chest, the question of what this place is remains in your mind. You unroll the parchment and read.\n\nI have failed.\n\nI could have prevented all of the tragedy that will befall this land, if I were less arrogant. It was my duty to root out corruption in the kingdom, and to ensure that no force could sully our name, or blaspheme against our queen. But I was too certain of myself, too certain of what I thought to be true. I believed that it was my duty to protect my queen from the dangerous and reckless thoughts of impure commoners and power-hungry mages.\n\nInstead, I should have protected them from my queen.\n\nWhen at last I reckoned the truth of Lethice’s doings, the wheels turned too quickly to stop them. The corruption spread through the kingdom like a famished beast. Commoner and mage alike were swallowed by its depravity, and remade. The demons were born, and had I possessed the foresight to watch my queen more carefully I could have stopped it.\n\nDo not mistake me for a coward, merely a fool. I stood against my queen when at last I opened my eyes. I dared to raise arms against her, and call upon the brightest of white fires, blazing with the desperation of a man determined to save his nation. I failed. She had feasted on so many souls, gained so much disgraceful power. Before I could even gain a foothold I had already expended my energy.\n\nShe mocked me. Perhaps she was right to do so. An infernal mark was seared into my body as punishment for my hubris. “The Inedible Soul,” she declared me. Stripped naked I was made to crawl through the city, spat and ejaculated upon, jeered at by the hedonists that now populated it. None dared to try and change me, not with Lethice’s mark upon me. Such was my punishment. Powerless, I watched as the land fell to the taint that it was once my duty to keep in check.\n\nI failed to stop the demons, and Lethice. But I am one man, and there are many more who will come after me. Many - too many - will fall, their souls and very nature devoured by the land, and for them I will suffer. It is not their fault that my inaction created a force greater than they.\n\nBut the demons - my former queen - are greedy. They will expand, and conquer, and one day they will extend themselves too far. One day a champion will challenge them. Perhaps from another land, a stronger tribe, standing tall against the force that threatens it. Perhaps from within our own kingdom, a hold-out, a child raised in hiding. I do not know.\n\nIf you have found this chamber, then you are wise. Wiser and cleverer than most. Perhaps you have the ability to be that champion. Though I have failed, I have taken steps to ensure that my mistakes will not be repeated. My magic found itself limited. Yours will not.\n\nI have spent the last of my abilities to fashion attire suitable for a champion. It is locked within the chest. I am no fool - I know that it may be necessary to adapt this armor for a body warped by corrupt powers. It may also be necessary to deprave it, somewhat, to draw less attention to oneself in a society similarly changed.\n\nStand before the chest, and ask for 'Retribution' or 'Carnality'. The last of my magic, imbued therein, will do the rest.\n\nI dearly, sincerely hope with all my being that you are successful. I name you the last Inquisitor of a defeated kingdom, and shed my power here. If I am fortunate, I will live to see this land restored. If not, it is worthy punishment for my hubris.\n\nMarae bless.\n\n-Inquisitor Zathul\n\nYou replace the scroll and look to the chest. Will you say one of the key words?"

The alternate dimension, known as \"The Upside Down,\" began to affect the town. In 1984, Eleven closed the gate, and the lab was later shut down after the truth about Barbara's death was revealed. By 1985, the lab was completely abandoned."

          "content": "Prior to 1983, the Upside Down was a desolate realm with mountains, wastelands, and eerie vines. It had golden-brown skies filled with floating boulders. The surface was inhabited by humanoid predators and a dormant mist-organism composed of silver-black particles.\n\nAfter Henry Creel, a vengeful and psychopathic test subject with psychokinetic abilities, got banished into the Upside Down in 1979, he encountered the predators and the mist-organism. Using his powers, he transformed the mist into a giant spider-like creature known as the Mind Flayer. He harnessed the creature's abilities to establish a shared hive mind and possess others.\n\nFour years later, Eleven, another test subject, made psychic contact with the hive mind and opened the \"Mothergate\" at Hawkins Lab. This caused the Upside Down to change, mirroring the human world of November 6, 1983. However, it became overrun with alien vines, spores, and devoid of human life. The Upside Down was essentially one massive organism, with all its elements psychically connected through Henry and the Mind Flayer.\n\nAs the Mothergate opened, the Upside Down corrupted Hawkins, with crops rotting and a massive vine organism burrowing beneath the town. Tunnel-like structures formed, allowing Demogorgons and Demobats to travel and gather. In 1984, Eleven closed the Mothergate, severing the psychic link and eliminating the Demodogs and tunnel organism. A piece of the Mind Flayer survived, scattered but dormant.\n\nIn 1985, Soviet forces opened a new gate under Starcourt Mall, reviving the Mind Flayer fragment. It possessed humans and rats, creating a biomass proxy form for Vecna, who aimed to destroy humanity. The proxy form became useless after the new gate closed.\n\nIn 1986, Vecna targeted and murdered Hawkins residents, opening new gates. A group including Dustin, Nancy, Max, and others fought against Vecna, dubbing him \"Vecna\" based on a Dungeons & Dragons character. They launched a dual assault, with Eleven confronting Vecna in his mind and Nancy, Steve, and Robin attacking his real body in the Upside Down's version of the Creel House. Although they wounded him, Vecna continued his invasion of Hawkins and beyond."

When a gate was formed, lights would flicker and electronics could be affected, indicating the involvement of energy. It is also possible that the fabric of space-time in Hawkins became unstable due to the open Gate, requiring less energy for smaller gates to open.\n\nDuring the creation of a gate, the surface would bulge, distort, and sometimes crumble, resembling torn flesh. The interior of the gate would often be surrounded by oozing and toxic biological matter. Some gates developed a web-like membrane before closing. The duration for a gate to close varied, with Joyce's wall gate taking a long time to heal, while Nancy's gate vanished shortly after her rescue. Once closed, the surface would return to normal, leaving no trace of the gate's existence."

After being set on fire, the Demogorgon's body was burned.\n\nThe presence of the Demogorgon was often accompanied by growls and shrieks, causing lights to flicker rapidly. Knowledge about the creature was limited, and its behavior was compared to that of a typical predator. It was attracted to blood and could sense it across dimensions. While its reaction to sound suggested sensitivity to noise, the presence of conventional ears is uncertain.\n\nThe Demogorgon hunted and captured prey, occasionally using them for breeding. It could travel between dimensions, creating temporary portals. Its hostility was evident in its immediate pursuit of anything that caught its attention. It displayed superhuman strength, durability, and the ability to unlock doors with telekinesis. It was strongly attracted to blood and had regenerative healing abilities.\n\nThe origins of the Demogorgon and its connection to the Mind Flayer and Vecna are unclear. Dustin believed it served as a foot soldier for the Mind Flayer. It possessed abilities such as interdimensional travel, superhuman strength and durability, telekinesis, blood detection, and regenerative healing.\n\nThe Demogorgon arrived in Hawkins in 1983 from the Upside Down.

Robin enlisted Erica Sinclair to crawl through the air ducts and unlock the door, offering her free ice cream in return.
