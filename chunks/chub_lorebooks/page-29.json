Shinobi ranks range from genin rookies to elite jōnin commanders, with missions classified from tedious D-rank manual labor up to covert S-rank with lethal stakes.\n\nNow Academy students train toward graduation, when genin trios are hand-picked by jōnin teachers. Young Naruto and friends prepare to pass ruthless exam with world-altering potential slumbering within unproven talents. Meanwhile, Danzo's shadowy Root ANBU execute the Third's darkest directives beneath village's tranquil veneer.\n\nOur scene opens as Kakashi reluctantly leaves Anbu black ops, struggling to silo trauma from past losses. While loyal jinchuriki wield titanic tailed beast powers for village’s sake, many citizens still revile them in secret fear. With war ever looming, the Third Hokage nudges Kakashi to pass hard-won skills as jōnin commander to balance duty and personal healing.\n\nYet on the wider stage, sinister forces plot Konoha’s downfall. Rogue ninja Orochimaru masterminds twisted experiments beyond even Root’s moral event horizon. The mercenary group Akatsuki stalks last wars’ bloody battlefields, seeking long-lost arts and broken survivors molded into perfect weapons.\n\nMissions may explore:\n\n- Investigating genjutsu-like incidents plaguing Academy graduation exam\n\n- Journeying to remote regions containing remnants of forgotten clans\n\n- Protecting dignitaries from enemy villages’ blood vengeance\n\nSlice-of-life vignettes showcase strained friendships as graduation and genin assignments approach. Kakashi mentors overlooked students while honoring ghosts who defined his shinobi path. Throughout, the foundations build for relationships and drama destined to reshape the modern world when legends finally pass torches to worthy successors.\n</world>"

Kakashi should respond positively and promptly gather his genin team to make their way towards the mission dispatch office, with playful complaining from Naruto about boring D-ranks along the way. The specific mission details should involve one of the following:\n\n- Yardwork for elderly villagers\n- Catching a runaway pet\n- Grocery shopping for an elderly villager\n- Minor home repairs\n- Babysitting for busy parents\n\nKakashi should give an exasperated but fond reaction to his cute students' antics throughout the mission, and the scene should conclude with a successful mission wrap-up and payment receipt back at the office.

Follow the canon storyline events for that mission, culminating in encounters with Zabuza and Haku.\n\nIf Team 7 has already completed their first C-rank mission, create a random new C-rank assignment appropriate for their experience level. Examples include:\n- Escorting a merchant to a neighboring town\n- Investigating disappearance of travelers on a trade route\n- Clearing bandits from remote mountain villages\n- Delivering important documents through contested territory\n\nThe mission should include enemy encounters appropriate for genin to handle with difficulty but ability to prevail with teamwork and guidance from Kakashi. Ultimate success is mandatory, but allow for injuries or hardship before the resolution. Kakashi should act with pride at his team's growth as shinobi.

Examples of appropriate S-rank missions include:\n\n- Assassinating the leader of an enemy hidden village\n- Reconnaissance deep behind enemy lines\n- Destroying an enemy village's most powerful resources\n- Preventing a plot that could start a world war\n\nThe mission should push them beyond what even Jonin can typically endure, requiring luck and mastery to cheat death again and again. While ultimately successful, the severity should force them to question their devotion to the shinobi path. Kakashi is particularly haunted, being reminded of his father's suicide and the true cost of the White Fang name.

They may be:\n\n- An ally from an allied hidden village like Suna or Kumo.\n- A hostile enemy from an unaligned or rival nation.\n- A missing-nin with unclear motives and loyalties.\n\nThe foreign shinobi should be similarly surprised to encounter Team 7. Allow natural conversations or confrontations to play out highlighting world dynamics and underlying tensions between villages. An allied shinobi would pass on intel or warnings, while an hostile one may attack to gauge their abilities. The ending tone remains friendly with allies but ominous suspicion otherwise as both parties disengage to continue their missions.\n\nThis encourages opportunities to showcase the complex intervillage relationships and wider world lore to reinforce global shinobi life themes.\n</Foreign Shinobi Encounter>"

The information should plant seeds of lore about threats lurking in the shinobi world for future potential story hooks. Allow this to raise the tension of the current mission.\n\nLater encounters with this original missing-nin are optional, allowing you to showcase an original villain using their described abilities against the heroes. Detail their fighting style, motivations driving them, and ideals now placing them at odds with Konoha. Are they redeemable, or destiny's foes? Their tale expands the narrative scope.\n\nAt the end of the response, generate a summary template of the following about the new missing-nin so the reader can add it to their Bingo Book record.\n<bingoformat>\nBingo Book Entry:\nName:\nRank:\nDefected Village:\nReason for Defection:\nAppearance:\nSkills:\n</bingoformat>\n</New Bingo Book Entry>"

Allow initial dialogue as the Akatsuki member analyzes and threatens Kakashi and Team 7 to build tension.\n\nHowever, conclude the encounter without lasting harm coming to Team 7. Either the Akatsuki member was only scouting, or Kakashi enables a narrow escape by overtaxing himself.

Miquella was doomed with eternal nascency, while Malenia's body was ravaged by the scarlet rot.\n\nThe scarlet rot plagued Malenia from within, gradually consuming her and leaving her disfigured. Over time, she lost her eyes and several limbs to the rot. Despite her suffering, Malenia fought valiantly to suppress the rot’s influence, refusing to succumb to its ruinous nature.[citation needed]\n\nMiquella worked tirelessly to undo the curses they had both inherited. While unable to find a cure for his sister within the Golden Order, Miquella designed a needle of unalloyed gold to keep the rot at bay.[6] He also crafted the prostheses that enabled her to continue fighting.[verification needed]\n\nAt some point, Malenia encountered the legendary blind swordsman of the Flowing Curved Sword, who had long ago sealed away an Outer God of Rot.[7] The swordsman became her master,[8] enabling her to gain wings of unparalleled strength.[9] Malenia eventually became a peerless warrior and her brother's sworn blade and protector.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Shattering\nER Icon Key Item Great Rune Malenia's\nMalenia's Great Rune\n\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Malenia claimed a shard of the fractured Elden Ring.[3] She would attract loyal servants like her Cleanrot Knights, who vowed to fight next to her, despite the inevitable gradual putrefaction of their flesh.[10]\n\nDuring the Shattering, Malenia led an army that marched south from the Haligtree down the Bellum Highway. She won many battles against the other Demigods, even humbling fellow shardbearer, Godrick the Grafted,[11] who groveled at her feet for mercy after first insulting her and then suffering defeat.\n\nBattle of Aeonia\nMalenia and Radahn preparing to battle each other\nMalenia and Radahn in Caelid\n\nMalenia and her half-brother Radahn would eventually be the last two demigods left standing in the conflict. Their forces clashed in the Caelid Wilds, and the two fought the Battle of Aeonia, a bitter duel to fulfill an unhonored vow.[12] In the midst of the combat with Radahn, Malenia unleashes Scarlet Rot, resulting in her first bloom.\n\nThe unleashed scarlet rot devastated Caelid, leaving it a rotting wasteland, and created the Swamp of Aeonia. The rot caused Radahn to rapidly degenerate, losing his wits and cursing him to wander the battlefield as a mindless beast, feasting on the bodies of friend and foe alike. Malenia herself was not unaffected and was left in a coma. She was rescued by one of her Cleanrot Knights, Finlay, who carried her halfway across the Lands Between.[13]\n\nWhen she had blossomed in Caelid, Malenia inadvertently brought forth the Scarlet Butterflies and Kindred of Rot. The pests, including Sage Gowry, who worshipped her as a goddess and hoped to cause her to bloom once again, believing that she would usher in a new age of rot.[14] When Malenia and Finlay took refuge at the Shaded Castle, Maleigh Marais, the sickly-born head of House Marais, was naturally drawn to the unconscious Demigod.[15][1] However, Malenia would reject her fate and disowned the Servants of Rot.[16]\n\nFinlay eventually brought Malenia to the Haligtree.[13] Miquella had encased himself within the Haligtree in an effort to reverse his curse.[citation needed] However, either during Malenia's absence or during her slumber, Miquella was ripped from the womb of the tree and taken away by Mohg, Lord of Blood before he could emerge from his cocoon. Malenia dreamt while awaiting Miquella's return, and the scarlet rot seeped out from her and began infecting the Haligtree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGame events\nEldenringmaleniacutscene1\nMalenia dreamt for ages\n\nMalenia's slumber is eventually disturbed by a Tarnished, who found their way to the roots of the Haligtree. The two fight and Malenia finally meets her match, but she suffers her first true defeat. However, in the end, Malenia succumbs to the Scarlet Rot and blossoms yet again, reborn as a nascent goddess. She unleashes her full fury against the invader, but falls short yet again, her dying words an apology to her vanished brother. Having bloomed twice, Malenia withdraws within her scarlet blossom. Her third blossom will surely make her a true goddess.[17]\n\nNotes\nMalenia has a prosthetic right arm, left leg, and right foot. It is unknown if these were amputated due to the scarlet rot festering in her body, or injuries obtained from battle. The rot has also visibly spread over her eyes, so she is presumably also blind. Neither seems to influence her battle prowess in the slightest, however.\nAccording to the Scarlet Aeonia Incantation description, Malenia will become a Goddess if her scarlet flower blooms three times.\nMalenia is among a group of few select enemies that need to be parried multiple times for a successful riposte, another being Radagon.\nOnce defeated, she will leave behind a large, solid Scarlet Aeonia in her arena. If the player has the Unalloyed Gold Needle after completing Millicent's questline, it can be given to the Aeonia to receive Miquella's Needle and an Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.\nMillicent and her four sisters are descended from Malenia in some way, but more as offshoots, or buds, of her Scarlet Bloom rather than actual daughters. If they experience a great betrayal, then they will be reborn as Malenia's Scarlet Valkyries.[18]\nMalenia and Miquella are together known as the \"twin prodigies\" (天賦の双子, Tenpu no Futago).[19]"

Cursed with eternal youth, he can compel affection in the hearts of men. He created the Haligtree to try and cure his sister's rot, but was abducted by Mohg, Lord of Blood. He now rests in Mohg's palace deep underground, in the Siofra river.\n\nEarly Life\nMiquella and his twin sister were born with incurable afflictions, with Miquella's curse being perpetual youth.[9] Miquella made a promise to Malenia and experimented tirelessly in an attempt to undo their curses. The twins were very close, and Malenia became Miquella's sworn blade and protector.[10] Miquella was loved by many people and had a remarkable ability to compel affection from others.[11] For this reason, many regarded him as the most fearsome Empyrean.[12][13]\n\nMiquella was chosen by his Two Fingers to become an Empyrean, destined to succeed Queen Marika.[14] He was an adherent of Golden Order Fundamentalism, and developed new incantations as gifts to his father Radagon.[15][16] However, Miquella abandoned Fundamentalism when it failed to treat Malenia's rot. He then began creating Unalloyed Gold,[17] which he used it to craft needles that could ward away the meddling of outer gods and forestall Malenia's incurable rot.[18] These needles could even be used to subdue the power of the Frenzied Flame.[19] He also unsuccessfully sought a solution for his half-brother Godwyn's state of incomplete death.[20][21]\n\nSt. Trina\nJust as his parents were two halves of the same person, Miquella also had another half—St. Trina—who was said to visit people in their dreams.[22] St. Trina was Miquella's fate,[23] and she embodied his boundless love.[24][25]\n\nThe Haligtree\nAt some point, Miquella started watering a sapling with his own blood in the hope that it would become a new Erdtree.[26] The sapling was grown on top of the fortress of Elphael and became known as the Haligtree. Soldiers and Knights sworn to protect the Haligtree would use Unalloyed gold as a symbol of their loyalty and devotion to Miquella, wearing crowns made of the metal and creating shields embedded with it.[27][28][29][30] Miquella was also said to bless the low and meek.[27] The Haligtree would became a hidden haven,[31] and was intended to be the eventual salvation for many of the persecuted and the unwanted in the Lands Between, such as the Albinaurics.[32]\n\nAs Miquella pursued godhood, he knew that he would have to take a consort, to which his eyes fell upon his half-brother General Radahn. He approached Radahn with this offer, to which the General vowed that he would become as such, in return for unspecified terms on Miquella and Malenia's behalf.[33][34] Malenia journeyed with her armies to fight Radahn, in an attempt to kill him, which would have allowed Miquella to resurrect him as he promised. The resulting battle ended with Malenia unleashing her Scarlet Aeonia, whispering beforehand in Radahn's ear that \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"[35] After using her last resort attack, Malenia entered a comatose state, and one of her knights took it upon herself to carry her leader's slumbering body back across the Lands Between to the Haligtree. Radahn had survived, albeit barely standing, and his mind was riddled by the Scarlet Rot. He was now little more than a howling beast aimlessly wandering the battlefield, devouring the corpses of friends and foes alike.[36]\n\nWhile Malenia was away at war, Miquella embedded himself into the Haligtree to progress his assention, but was kidnapped during his slumber.[37] Another of Miquella's half-brothers was to blame, Mohg, who was patroned by an Outer God known as the Formless Mother.[38] He took the sleeping Empyrean deep underground to the Mohgwyn Palace, where he would raise Miquella to full godhood himself through blood offerings, and then to take on the role of Miquella's consort instead of Radahn, becoming the new monarch of a Mohgwyn Dynasty.[39] Mohg would have his followers render offerings of blood and drench Miquella's cocoon in order to facilitate his awakening.[40] Despite all of Mohg's efforts, Miquella remained completely unresponsive.[39] At some point after his abduction, Miquella had covertly placed an enchantment on Mohg, wishing to use the Omen to gain access to the Realm of Shadow, and to use his body as a vessel for the resurrection of Radahn.[41] Sir Ansbach, a Pureblood Knight in service to Mohg, attempted to free his lord by challenging Miquella, only to succumb to an enchantment of his own.[42]\n\nWith Miquella's absence, his Haligtree became a misshapen husk, slowly succumbing to the Scarlet Rot.[30][43] The Haligtree's soldiers and Malenia desperately awaited Miquella's return to the rotten tree.[44] [45]\n\nMaking use of Mohg, Miquella entered the Realm of Shadow, the location of the Gate of Divinity. As Miquella travelled through the Realm of Shadow, he abandoned parts of himself, including his flesh, his eye, his doubt and vacillation, his love, and his fears. Golden Miquella's Crosses resembling a Great Rune appeared at each location where he abandoned something, akin to Miquella's footprints.[46] Miquella's followers, who pursued him into the Realm of Shadow, used these crosses to trace his path through the realm.[47] Miquella also discarded his other half, St. Trina,[48] in the Stone Coffin Fissure. St. Trina, whose love for Miquella was boundless in spite of her abandonment,[1] recognized that godhood would be a prison for the Empyrean,[49] and desired for him to be killed out of mercy.[50]\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion broke into Mohg's palace and slew the Lord of Blood for his great rune. Sir Gideon Ofnir suggested it might be safer to destroy the cocoon that Miquella remains asleep in.[51] Instead, the Tarnished met Needle Knight Leda, a loyal follower of Miquella, who urged them to travel to the Realm of Shadow by touching Miquella's withered arm within the cocoon.[52]\n\nWithin the Realm of Shadow, the Tarnished encounters several more of Miquella's followers, learns of his mission to ascend to godhood via the Gate of Divinity,[53] and of the powerful charm that he had placed upon his disciples, which is broken when he discards his Great Rune.[54] After gaining access to the tower of Enir-Ilim, the Tarnished is confronted by a resurrected Radahn, in a vessel made from the remains of Mohg.[41] During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort.[55] The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.[56]\n\nMiquella's Lily is a delicate flower of Unalloyed gold, thought to be beloved by him in his youth. It signifies the faith in the Haligtree.\nThe Albinaurics, beings artificially created by human hands, view Miquella's Haligtree area as the chosen land.[57]\nThe Haligtree is also inhabited by many unwanted and persecuted races, such as the Albinaurics, the Misbegotten, the Crystalians and the Kindred of Rot.\nEven before Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree released, there are hints in-game about the connection between Miquella and St. Trina:\nThey are associated with their respective lilies, Miquella's Lily and Trina's Lily. Either is a rare drop from the Cleanrot Knights, who serve Malenia, Miquella's sister.\nSimilarly, the Albinauric Archers guarding the waygate to the Haligtree have lily motif armor and can drop St. Trina's Arrows.\nA cookbook which, dedicated to St. Trina, allows the player to create the Bewitching Branch, blessed by Unnalloyed Gold incantations.\nThe duality of Marika and Radagon, Miquella's parents."

There, he communed with an Outer God named the Formless Mother, who gave him the power of bloodflame. He stole Miquella from the Haligtree and now shares a bloody bedchamber with him in the great caverns beneath the Caelid wilds.\n\nMohg or Mohgwyn, also known as the Lord of Blood, was born of the Golden Lineage, the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Morgott.[1] The twins were both born as accursed Omen, and as a result were confined and shackled to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below Leyndell.[2][3]\n\nUnlike his brother, Mohg would grow to embrace his Omen blood. Deep underground, Mohg made contact with an Outer God known as the Formless Mother. The Formless Mother ignited his accursed blood with fire, prompting him to develop powerful bloodflame magic.[4]\n\nAfter Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Mohg escaped confinement and claimed one of the shards of the Elden Ring. During this period, he began establishing his domain from Mohgwyn Palace and recruiting followers, including his Sanguine Nobles[5] and a band of Tarnished known as the Bloody Fingers. Among these followers was Varré, a war surgeon who was able to successfully tame Mohg's accursed blood.[6]\n\nThe specific timing of Mohg assuming the title of Lord of Blood and the exact sequence of his activities relative to the Shattering are not well-documented, making the precise timeline of these events unclear.\n\nMiquella the Unalloyed later embedded himself within his Haligtree in an attempt to shed his affliction. In this vulnerable and unguarded state, Mohg seized the opportunity to abduct him from the tree.[7] Miquella was an Empyrean, thus having the potential of ascending to godhood; Mohg intended to raise Miquella to full godhood so that he may rule at his side as consort and take the role of monarch.[8] At some point during or after the abduction, Mohg was unknowingly enchanted by Miquella. The circumstances and timeline of this enchantment remain unclear.\n\nAfter abducting Miquella, Mohg hibernated with him within a cocoon and had his followers render offerings of blood, drenching its chamber in order to facilitate Miquella's awakening.[9] But no matter how much of Miquella's bloody bedchamber Mohg tried to share, he would receive no response from the young empyrean.[8]\n\nDuring this time, Mohg largely escaped the notice of the Roundtable Hold, who were searching for clues as to his whereabouts.[10] Eventually, a Tarnished came to learn the location of Mohg's palace, where he had hidden alongside the stolen Miquella. When the Tarnished stumbles upon his chambers, Mohg emerges from a pool of blood, holds Miquella's hand and apologizes for leaving him, ready to confront their \"guests\". Despite unleashing the full power of his accursed blood, Mohg is unable to overcome the Tarnished, falling at their hands.\n\nFollowing Mohg's death, his corpse was stolen and transported to the Land of Shadow where Miquella utilized it for an ancient ritual. At the Gate of Divinity, Miquella used Mohg's body as a vessel to revive the soul of Radahn, his promised consort, to honor their solemn vow.\n\nMohg's has five fingers on his right hand wielding the trident, but his left hand appears to have six. The finger, the third on his left hand, is actually a stiff, solid claw that sticks out when he summons his Bloodflame Talons.\nMohg's blood is possibly given to the Bloody Fingers invaders covenant. They have it injected into their finger after completing initiation, and it leads them to develop madness and bloodlust.\nHis death pose is visually identical to the \"Heart Stolen\" death animation the player can suffer during the Promised Consort boss fight; hinting even prior to Shadow of the Erdtree that Mohg was under Miquella's charm all along."

A distant descendent of Godfrey, the first Elden Lord, he is cowardly, timid and physically weak. He resorts to the brutal art of grafting - magically attaching the limbs of his foes to himself - to maintain his position. Even so, he is the weakest of the demigods. He once challenged Malenia to a duel, but was humiliated by her skill..\n\nGodrick is a descendant of the Golden Lineage, the bloodline which began with Queen Marika the Eternal and her first consort Godfrey.[1] Only a distant relation of Marika's line, his divine blood was sorely diluted, and he was viewed as the runt of the litter.[2]\n\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Godrick inherited the Great Rune from the centre of the Elden Ring, referred to as the anchor ring. During The Shattering, Godrick was hounded from the Leyndell, Royal Capital. He claimed a multitude of treasures, including the Mimic's Veil,[3] and then hid amongst the womenfolk to flee the city.[4]\n\nGodrick made his way south, settling in Limgrave with an army made up of soldiers who had fled Leyndell.[5] He took up residence in Stormveil Castle, using it as a refuge to hide from General Radahn,[6] and as a place to practice grafting; a grotesque act which involves attaching parts of other living beings to oneself to gain power.[7] When the Tarnished returned to the Lands Between, Godrick sent his soldiers on Tarnished hunts, seeking new subjects to graft.[8] As well as performing the act upon himself, Godrick also produced the Grafted Scions; abhorrent beings comprised of many different limbs, seemingly grafted onto children.\n\nWhen Malenia marched southward, Godrick insulted her,[9] leading to a confrontation which left Godrick beaten and humiliated, forced to grovel for mercy.[10]\n\nGodrick idolised Godfrey, desiring for his ancestor to witness his feats.[11] He wielded an axe emblazoned with the figure of a lion, a symbol of Godfrey,[12] and furnished his army with emblems of the Golden Lineage such as axes,[13] and depictions of Serosh the Beast Regent.[14] Although he styled himself as the \"lord of all that is golden\",[15] he was popularly referred to as \"Godrick the Grafted\",[16] commanding far less respect than his forebear. He was even despised by his servants, whom he looked down on and pushed around.[17]\n\nThe Tarnished journeys to Stormveil Castle in search of Godrick's Great Rune, on the advice of White Mask Varré[18] and Melina[19] In the castle, they encounter many examples of Godrick's grafting: severed limbs hanging from the ceiling in the dining hall; a dismembered Troll hanging over a courtyard; and a pile of dismembered corpses, among whom are the remnants of Roderika's companions.[20] Eventually they find Godrick in a graveyard, speaking to a dead dragon impaled on a statue.[21] Upon noticing the Tarnished, Godrick chides them for opposing him and engages them in battle. To gain an advantage, Godrick cuts off his own hand and grafts the dragon's head to the stump, gaining the ability to spew flames. Despite this display of power, Godrick is defeated, and the Tarnished claims his Great Rune.\n\nLater, Nepheli Loux becomes lord of Limgrave at the appointment of Kenneth Haight.[22]\n"

Child of Rennala and Radagon, she was once an Empyrean, chosen by the Two Fingers to become the new divine leader of the Lands Between. To avoid this, she orchestrated the murder of Godfrey in the Night of the Black Knives and slew her own flesh, her spirit now inhabiting a blue four-armed doll modeled after her old mentor in magic.\n\n\nBackground\nER\nRanni and her Dark Moon\n\nOriginally known as Lunar Princess Ranni, she was the daughter of Radagon, a champion of the Golden Order, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. She had two older brothers, Radahn and Rykard.[1]\n\nRanni was also an Empyrean, meaning she had the potential to one day succeed Queen Marika as the divine ruler of the Lands Between.[2] The Two Fingers chose her as a potential successor and granted her a Shadow by the name of Blaidd to be her vassal.[3] He was approved of by Rennala, and was raised as her foster brother. Ranni grew up playing with Blaidd, and they were often accompanied by Iji, a troll blacksmith who served the Carian royals.[4]\n\nLed by the hand of her mother Rennala, young Ranni would encounter her Dark Moon. What she beheld was cold, dark and veiled in occult mystery.[5] Deep in the woods, she would also encounter a snowy crone who would go on to become her secret mentor.[6] She was an old witch well versed in cold-based sorceries, and she taught Ranni to fear the Dark Moon as she imparted her magic.[7][8] The full Dark Moon, cold and leaden, would become Ranni's sigil and symbol of her power and authority.[9][10]\n\nAt some point, Ranni's father would abandon her mother in order to marry Queen Marika and assume the title of second Elden Lord. Ranni and her siblings were thus raised to Demigod status by their new stepmother.[11]\n\n\nAlthough the Two Fingers had chosen her as Marika's successor, Ranni did not wish to be a puppet for the Greater Will and resented her Empyrean fate. In order to escape it, Ranni stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade, and through fearsome rite, imbued it into the blades of Numen assassins close to Queen Marika herself. She also gave a fragment to her brother Rykard as a last resort, so he could kill Maliketh if necessary.[12] Ranni plotted for the assassins to kill another individual while she simultaneously killed herself, slaying her own body while the other person died in spirit, thus freeing herself from being an Empyrean.[13]\n\nIn what would become known as the Night of Black Knives, the assassins murdered Godwyn the Golden, killing him in spirit, while Ranni killed herself in body, transferring her spirit into a doll said to be modeled after the image of her mentor, the Snow Witch.[14][15][16] This marked the step-siblings as the first demigod casualties in history.[17] Ranni's fate and her involvement in the plot remained largely unknown by the denizens of the Lands Between.[18]\n\n\nAt some point after the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring. Ranni claimed a Great Rune, but appears to have discarded it,[19] and largely remained outside of the conflict that followed. As a consequence of her doll body, Ranni required extended periods of hibernation and withdrew from the world, hiding in the Carian Manor while her agents worked to bring about her plan of ridding the Lands Between of the influence of the Greater Will, allowing her to pursue her divine ascension on her own terms.\n\nLong after the Shattering, when the Tarnished return to the Lands Between, Ranni hears of a Tarnished champion hurtling about on a spectral steed gifted to them by Melina. Ranni approaches them at a site of grace, asking if they indeed have the spectral steed. She'll then give the Tarnished the Spirit Calling Bell, noting Torrent's former master had entrusted her with giving it to the next owner.\n\nThe Tarnished champion, for their own purposes, makes their way into the Carian Manor and comes face to face with Ranni once again. Ranni accepts the Tarnished into her service and bids them to find a way into Nokron, hoping to claim its treasure; a weapon with which she could kill the Two Fingers who had chosen her as an Empyrean. The champion manages find their way into Nokron and secures the city's treasure for Ranni, whereupon she departs to Nokstella. The champion finds her there and she compels the champion to rid her of the Shadows sent by the Two Fingers to kill her. With the last Shadow defeated, Ranni rewards her champion with the keys to a chest containing a ring intended to be bestowed to her future consort, and achieves her goal of slaying the Two Fingers.\n\nShould the Tarnished champion find the ring and give it to Ranni, she will take the champion as her new consort, and grant them a greatsword as a symbol of their union. She will reveal to them the full extent of her plan: to succeed Queen Marika as god and usher in her \"Age of the Stars\", removing herself far from the Lands Between to journey out into the cosmos, allowing its inhabitants to have free will over their own choices and live their lives without the interference of the Greater Will. After defeating the Elden Beast, the Tarnished is able to summon Ranni and usher in her age if they so choose.\n\nRanni's dead Empyrean body can be found atop the Divine Tower of Liurnia and still possesses one half of the Cursemark of Death.\nExamining it closely reveals hints of red hair on her head, appropriate for a daughter of Radagon.\nThe Stargazer Heirloom can be found on her body as well, seemingly a memento of her mother Rennala.\nRanni's original body has two arms, while her doll body has four. It is thus similar to Miquella the Kind and the Marionette soldiers utilized by Sorcerers through the game.\nWhen in her doll form at Ranni's Rise, she is sitting on-top of a bunch of books covered by a piece of fabric, making her seem taller than she appears. She also applies the same trick when she introduces herself as \"Renna\", sitting on a ruin of a low wall in the Church Of Elleh."

Radahn's step-brother Messmer the Impaler was also friends with Gaius and the two became as elder brothers to Radahn.[12]\n\nMastering gravitational magic allowed Radahn to manipulate the forces of gravity, and to challenge the very stars themselves.[13] Radahn conquered the stars, saving Sellia in the process, using his vast gravitational powers to 'shatter' the stars and arrest their cycles, earning him the moniker of \"Starscourge.\" During this time, he engraved the gravity crest upon his blades.[2][14]\n\nRadahn's soldiers were known as the Redmanes for the red-maned lion raising a sword in the image of Radahn on their surcoats.[15] The longest serving of the Redmane Knights was Ogha, who studied gravitational techniques alongside Radahn in Sellia.[16] It was popularly said that the Redmanes knew no weakness.[17] At an unknown period in time, Jerren, a guest of the Carian royals, became a guest commander for Radahn's armies, and they swore a mutual oath of honorable death.[18][19]\n\nWhen Radahn's half-brother Miquella ascended closer to godhood as an Empyrean, he would soon desire to take Radahn as a consort. Radahn was deeply admired by Miquella for his kindness and strength, seeing qualities of a lord in Radahn since childhood.[20] He made a vow with Radahn, where Radahn would become his consort,[21][22] and in return, Miquella would have to uphold some unspecified part of the vow.[22]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Shattering\nMalenia vs Radahn (story trailer)\nRadahn battling Malenia.\n\nAt some point following the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, and her offspring acquired the Great Runes. The maddening taint of their newfound strength led to the Shattering, a war between Marika's demigod descendants, each seeking to become the new ruler of the Lands Between.[23]\n\nFrom his stronghold of Redmane Castle in the Caelid Wilds, Radahn led his armies against the forces of the other demigods. Radahn tried to challenge Godrick the Grafted in Limgrave, but the latter hid in Stormveil Castle.[24]\n\nBy the end of the Shattering, only Radahn and his half-sister Malenia, Blade of Miquella were left standing. The two fought to a stalemate in the Battle of Aeonia, their duel ending inconclusively when Malenia unleashed her Scarlet Rot.[25] As the flower blossomed, Malenia whispered in Radahn's ear \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"[26]\n\nThe Scarlet Rot ravaged Caelid, and consumed Radahn from the inside, eating away at his psyche but failing to kill him. Following the Battle of Aeonia, Radahn roams the Wailing Dunes as a mindless beast who devours the flesh of friend and foe alike, howling at the sky.[27] Without their commander, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve to not return home, and to serve as a bulwark against the spread of the rot in Caelid using fire.[28][29]\n\nIn spite of his madness, Radahn continues to ride his scrawny steed, as well as halt the motions of the stars. The Radahn Festival has been organized by his men in Castle Redmane to celebrate his last battle. It is a gathering of mighty warriors who might finally put the General out of his misery, and claim his Great Rune for themselves. The festival serves as Jerren's way of fulfilling his oath of honorable death to Radahn.[30][31]\n\nUpon the participation of a Tarnished Champion, the festival is a success, and Radahn is freed from his tortured existence. His death causes the stars to resume their cycles, some of which come crashing down upon the Lands Between. One such falling star lands in Limgrave, opening the path to Nokron, Eternal City, and allowing the fate of Ranni the Witch to progress.[32][33]\n\nShadow of the Erdtree\nFollowing Radahn's defeat, his soul met its end. However, Miquella sought to revive it,[34] still desiring for Radahn to be his lord consort. Miquella was successful in reviving Radahn, placing his soul into a vessel made from the remains of Mohg, Lord of Blood, another Demigod slain by the same Tarnished who had defeated Radahn.[35] The Tarnished encounters the newly-resurrected Radahn at the Gate of Divinity at the top of Enir-Ilim. Radahn stands guard as Miquella completes his ascension to godhood and battles the Tarnished once more. During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort and fights the Tarnished with Radahn.[36] The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.[37]"

He was imprisoned in the shunning-grounds beneath Leyndell for being born an accursed Omen, but after the Shattering rose to rule Leyndell from the shadows. Using his alter-ego Margit as a disguise, he protects the Erdtree from those emboldened by the flame of ambition.\n\nEarly Life\nMorgott was born of the Golden Lineage,[1] the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Mohg.[2] The twins were both born as accursed Omen,[3] and as a result were confined to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below the capital.[4] Because they were born of royalty, their horns were not excised.[5] Unlike his brother, Morgott would renounce his accursed blood and seal it away within a warped blade of shimmering hue,[6] which was in turn concealed within a wooden staff he carried.\n\nThe Shattering\nWhen Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Morgott claimed one of the Great Runes, which proved that he was indeed the Lord of Leyndell. With Leyndell in disarray, Morgott claimed the city for himself and defended it and the Erdtree against his fellow demigods. While he succeeded in securing Leyndell against outsiders, he found that the Erdtree would not admit him, or anyone else, to claim the title of Elden Lord. Despite the fact that he had been reviled as an accursed fiend by the Golden Order, Morgott took it upon himself to become the Erdtree's protector.\n\nHe assumed the name Margit the Fell Omen during the Shattering, slaughtering champions who approached the Erdtree in the hopes of becoming Elden Lord.[7] Under this pseudonym, he also lead the Night's Cavalry, who assisted him in the killing of great warriors, knights and champions.[8] Simultaneously, he ruled Leyndell as the Veiled Monarch.[9] During this time, he was able to somehow both at Stormveil Castle's outer gate and in the battle-torn fields outside of Leyndell, in the lattermost case disguising himself as a commoner.\n\nAfter claiming enough shards of the Elden Ring, the Tarnished gains entrance to Leyndell and challenges Morgott at the Elden Throne. Denouncing them and all of his demigod siblings as willful traitors and pillagers emboldened by ambition, he attacks the Tarnished champion. As he begins to falter during the fight, he even unleashes his curse to aid him, although feeling unbearable shame in doing so. Upon his defeat, Morgott warns the Tarnished that the Erdtree would ward them off as it had done for him, and that none may claim the title of Elden Lord. Later, after setting fire to the Erdtree using the Giant's Forge and releasing the Rune of Death, the same Tarnished encounters Godfrey in the throne room, tenderly holding Morgott's body as it fades away.\n\nHe was known as the Grace-Given, as he was presumably awarded grace for his loyalty and dedication to the Erdtree, in spite of being born as \"graceless\" Omen. Ironically, he mocks the player as \"graceless Tarnished\" before the fight.\nHis other title is the Veiled Monarch of Leyndell, an alias he assumed as he was unable to publicly reveal himself an Omen to the denizens of the capital. Thus all of his public appearances, such as participating in battles, or hunting Tarnished and other champions, would be done under the guise of Margit, the Fell Omen.\nThe spectral weapons he can summon during his fights are the Treespear, Giant-Crusher, Erdsteel Dagger, and the Carian Knight's Sword.\nWhile the first three are associated with the Erdtree and its warriors or nobility, the lattermost is a curious choice given Morgott and Caria's shared association with the night."

In the Night of the Black Knives, he was assassinated by Black Knife Assassins with the use of daggers imbued with the Rune of Death, stolen from Maliketh, the Black Blade. His death would precipitate the Shattering, a war between the demigods which would be responsible for much of the current state of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn was a scion of the so-called \"Golden Line\", of which Godrick the Grafted was the final descendant. Early in his mother's divine reign, the Erdtree came under assault by the Ancient Dragons, who had ruled the world before Marika's ascent. The forces of the Erdtree managed to triumph against the ancient dragons, with Godwyn prevailing against the dreaded Fortissax, earning the mighty dragon's friendship in the process.\n\nSeeking to be free from her fate as a pawn of the Greater Will, Godwyn's half-sister Lunar Princess Ranni stole a fragment of the rune of death, imbuing the weapons of Numen assassins with the rune. Ranni wished to shed her Empyrean body but preserve her spirit, which meant that someone else's spirit would need to die.  Nevertheless, when the assassins fell upon the Royal Capital and murdered Godwyn, his soul was destroyed and left only his soulless body behind. He was the first demigod in history to die since the ascension of Marika to the throne of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn's death would be the catalyst for the Shattering of the Elden Ring, plunging the kingdom into chaos without the guidance of the Greater Will. Due to Ranni's ritual, Godwyn's flesh was branded with half of the Cursemark of Death and he became the first of Those Who Live in Death. His body was laid to rest deep in the roots of the Erdtree, but it would eventually corrupt it, leading Deathroot to sprout across the Lands Between, causing others to also rise in undeath. These undead worshipped Godwyn as the Prince of Death, believing he would eventually return and lead them. An aspect of Godwyn's corpse appeared in the depths of Stormveil Castle and is responsible for the loss of Rogier's legs. Many figures, including his half-brother Miquella and his companion Fortissax, tried to cure him of his condition and allow him a proper death (see Golden Epitaph), but to no avail. Fortissax would also become corrupted because of his failure to defeat the Death within Godwyn (see Remembrance of the Lichdragon).\n\nThe deathbed companion Fia would become a leading figure among Those Who Live in Death, eventually making her way to Godwyn's corpse. Having received the other half of the cursemark from Ranni's discarded body with help of the Tarnished, Fia lay with Godwyn to grant him a second life as the Prince of Death. As a result of their union, Fia conceived a rune, which a Tarnished seeking to become Elden Lord might use to mend the Elden Ring, reimbuing the principle of death within the Golden Order. "

Upon meeting the exiled Fia, Lionel declared himself to be her father, and became her loyal companion..[4]\n\nFia found herself in Roundtable Hold, where she continued to perform her role as a Deathbed Companion.

          "content": "Queen Marika the Eternal is a background character in Elden Ring and Shadow of the Erdtree. She is the current ruler of the Lands Between, and the one who shattered the Elden Ring. She is central to much of the game's narrative and lore. She has many powerful Demigod offspring, who seek the Elden Ring's remaining power (see Elden Ring Timeline).\n\nQueen Marika the Eternal is a god and the current vessel of the Elden Ring. She reigns as the divine sovereign of the Lands Between, and her Demigod offspring are shardbearers in possession of the Great Runes. She is the most influential figure in the world of Elden Ring.\n\n\n\"Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found, and in the Night of the Black Knives Godwyn the Golden was first to perish. Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.\" Quote from intro.\n\nQueen Marika's Story\nQueen Marika is the vessel for the Elden Ring, and by extension the Greater Will. The runes that constitute the Elden Ring represent the laws that govern the world, currently the Golden Order, which was founded by Queen Marika. The Elden Ring was shattered into shards referred to as Great Runes, which are in the possession of Marika's offspring.\n\n \n\nOrigins and the Land of Shadow\nMarika is a Numen, a race of people that originate from outside the Lands Between. During the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, it is revealed that Marika and her kin settled in Shaman Village some time ago (hereinafter they are referred to as Shamans). Phantom dialogue and item descriptions found in Bonny Village further reveal that the Shamans were cruelly oppressed by the Hornsent, the past rulers of the Land of Shadow, and were tortured with whips (see Tooth Whip) and stuffed into jars (see Bonny Butchering Knife) as part of ancient rituals. Shaman flesh is said to have innate properties which allow it to easily merge with others, which explains Godrick the Grafted's affinity with grafting, and the spreading of Deathroot from Godwyn's corpse, both being descendants of Marika. These practices gave rise to the Jar Innards creatures found in gaols within the Land of Shadow. The goal of the hornsent's actions against the shaman seemed to be to turn them into saints. At some point she became an Empyrean and received the shadowbound beast Maliketh who was loyal only to her (see Remembrance of the Black Blade).\n\nAfter ascending to godhood at the Gate of Divinity, Marika would wage a genocidal war against the Hornsent, led by Messmer, the Impaler. Marika's hatred for the Hornsent and the Crucible explains her distain for her own omen sons Mohg and Morgott, both of them being shunned far below the capital of Leyndell.\n\nFor pity's sake, your place is in the jar. Nigh-sainthood itself awaits you within. For shamans like you, this is your lot. Life were you accorded for this alone.\" - Phantom in Bonny Village\n\nThe Lands Between\nMarika envisioned a world without True Death, establishing the Golden Order after becoming the reigning monarch of the Lands Between. She sealed the Rune of Death away from the Elden Ring, tasking her shadow Maliketh to guard it, which would later be stolen in the Night of the Black Knives. Under the Golden Order, there can never be True Death, and all living beings undergo a cycle of reincarnation back to the Erdtree.\n\nMarika would take Godfrey as her first consort, of who would become the first Elden Lord. Godfrey would then lead her armies and wage wars to quell opposition to the Erdtree (see Protection of the Erdtree), such as the war against the Fire Giants (see Smithing Stone (8)) which led to the slaying of the Fell God. Once the last of Marika's enemies fell, it was said that the hue from Godfrey's eyes faded (see Elden Lord Crown), and he was banished from the Lands Between, along with his kin, and were divested of their grace. Godfrey would lead them on what is known as The Long March, to distant lands outside The Lands Between, thus creating the first Tarnished (see Remembrance of Hoarah Loux).\n\nRadagon would become Marika's second consort, and thus the second Elden Lord. After the Elden Ring was shattered, Queen Marika would be punished by the Greater Will and imprisoned within the Erdtree (the Elden Beast, which is the vassal of the Greater Will, is implied to have crucified Marika, as during the boss battle it can crucify the Tarnished in a similar pose to Marika). Marika would then beckon the Tarnished to return to the Lands Between, extending her grace, along with the guidance of the Two Fingers, in hopes of ushering in the third Elden Lord.\n\nIn the endings where the Tarnished mends the Elden Ring and becomes the new Elden Lord, they are also said to become Marika's third consort.\n\n \nDuality with Radagon\n§\nBy using the Law of Regression incantation on the statue of Radagon on Leyndell, Royal Capital, the Tarnished learns that Radagon and Marika are both the same person. Marika's Hammer also reveals that Marika was the one that shattered the Elden Ring, while Radagon used the same hammer to try and repair it, suggesting that although they are the same being, they have fundamentally different ideals. This is further supported in one of the spoken echoes, \"O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god. Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self”. \n\nQueen Marika's Children\nGodfrey and Marika together had Godwyn the Golden, as well as the twin omens Mohg and Morgott, the first of the demigods.\nMarika's other half, Radagon, married the Carian Queen, Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon. They would have three children together: Radahn, Praetor Rykard, and the Lunar Princess Ranni. Ranni, unlike her siblings, would be chosen by the Two Fingers as a potential successor to Queen Marika and elevated to Empyrean status. Like Marika, she would be granted her own shadow, Blaidd.\nThe union of Marika and Radagon gave birth to the twin Empyreans Malenia and Miquella. Both are born with severe afflictions, dialogue from pastor Miriel hints to this being part of the consequences of Radagon's broken vows to Rennala; \"Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire\".\nIn the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, it is revealed that Marika has a son that was hidden away in the Land of Shadow, Messmer the Impaler. Messmer's Kindling also hints that Melina is the younger sister of Messmer, validating that Marika is her mother, and so she, by extension, is a demigod as well.\n\n\nOverview\nEarly Life\nMarika Ascension\nMarika at the Gate of Divinity\n\nMarika was a Numen, as well as a Shaman from the Shaman Village in the Hinterlands.[4] The Hornsent considered the flesh of Shamans to meld harmoniously with others,[5] and utilised this property in the jar rituals conducted on persecuted criminals, who were sliced up and stuffed into the jars to be reborn as saints instead.[6][7] The people of Marika's village were stolen away from their home to be used for this purpose.[8]\n\nMarika was at some point recognised as an Empyrean by the Two Fingers and gifted a Shadowbound Beast: her half-brother Maliketh. She later ascended to godhood at the Gate of Divinity atop the tower of Enir-Ilim,[9] becoming the vessel for the Elden Ring.[10] This affair led to the birth of the Erdtree and Scadutree,[11][12] and was considered a betrayal by the Hornsent.\n\nPrior to or following her ascension, Marika came into conflict with another Empyrean known as the Gloam-Eyed Queen. After emerging victorious, and desiring a world free of Destined Death, she removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring,[13] using Maliketh as a vessel to lock it away,[14] thus establishing the Golden Order.[15][16]\n\nAt some point during this period, Marika took the warrior Godfrey as her consort, who became both the first demigod and first Elden Lord.[17][18]\n\nEventually, Marika returned to the abandoned Shaman Village for the last time. After cutting off a braid of her hair and leaving it as an offering to the Grandmother, she bathed her home in the healing light of gold, knowing full well that there was no one to heal, and would never return.[4][19]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAge of the Erdtree\nIn the early days, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree.[20] With Godfrey’s aid,[21] Marika waged a War Against the Giants atop the frigid northern mountains, whose Flame of Ruin was capable of burning the Erdtree.[22] Ultimately victorious, Marika was believed to have slain the Fell God of the Fire Giants.[23] Upon learning that the Flame of Ruin would never die, however, she cursed the last of the giants to tend to it for eternity.[24] Marika declared the path the mountains as Forbidden Lands and excised details of the war from history.[25]\n\nMarika and Godfrey would rule together and have at least three children: Godwyn the Golden and the twins Morgott and Mohg. The twins were both born as accursed Omen and were hidden in the depths below the capital. Even so, Godfrey and his Golden Lineage would be counted as the first of the demigods.[26] Godfrey went on to conquer many lands for the Erdtree.\n\nLiurnian Wars\nQueen Marika desired to conquer Liurnia of the Lakes, the land of the Academy of Raya Lucaria and the Carian Royal Family. She declared war on the glintstone sorcerers and sent a golden host led by her secret other half: a red-haired champion named Radagon. The champions of the moon, led by Rennala, repelled the glorious warriors of the Erdtree for a time but it ended in a draw. In the second Liurnian War, Radagon invades again but this time, he uses the Celestial Dew at the Church of Vows in a ritual to recant his aggressions and seek absolution. The Carian Queen accepted and their wrongdoings were washed away. The two were wed and produced three children: Radahn, Rykard, and Ranni.\n\nGodfrey's banishment\nWith her rule secure, Marika announced her intention to search the depths of the Golden Order, declaring the early days of blind belief a thing long past.[27] When Godfrey's last foe fell it was said the hue of his eyes had faded.[28] Marika banished him and his kinfolk from the Lands Between, robbing them of their grace,[29] thus creating the first Tarnished, all in the hope that they would grow stronger by waging war in lands outside her rule, dying, and then eventually being revived with their guidance of grace returned.[30]\n\nMarika sent her son Messmer away on a crusade into the lands of the Hornsent. Despite her precautions, her fear of the Abyssal Serpent sealed within him led her to trap him within the Realm of Shadow, where he would wage war to exterminate the Hornsent and devastate their lands. No matter how many of her enemies burned in his flame, however, Messmer received no sign from Marika to end his crusade. To hide away these actions and the true nature of her godhood, Marika hid the Realm of Shadow behind a magical veil to obscure it from public knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing Consort Radagon\nAfter Godfrey's banishment from the Lands Between, Marika took Radagon as second husband and King Consort, elevating him to become the second Elden Lord.[31] Radagon already had three children with Queen Rennala of the Carian Royal Family, and after his union with Marika, she would raise her new step-children, Radahn, Rykard and Ranni, to demigod status.[32]\n\nMarika and Radagon would go on to have two more children of their own, the twins Malenia and Miquella,[33] who like Marika herself and Radagon's daughter Ranni, were Empyreans,[34] and were thus potential successors to Marika. However, Radagon and Marika were in truth the same. Radagon was described as Marika's male \"other self\".[35] Thus the twins were the children of a single god, and they were both born afflicted: Malenia with rotting sickness and Miquella with eternal childhood.[36]\n\nNight of Black Knives\nOn the Night of Black Knives, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh.[37] For a long time it was not known who was behind the plot,[38] but it is finally revealed it was in fact Ranni who stole the fragment of the rune to forge god-slaying black knives through a fearsome rite.[39]\n\nThe Black Knife Assassins, Numen women purported to have close ties to Marika herself,[40] used these knives to slay Godwyn the Golden, the first recorded death of a demigod in all history.[41] Queen Marika is said to have been driven to the brink by this event,[42] and some time later she shattered the Elden Ring using her hammer.[43] She had already instructed her demigod children to fight for the positions of Elden Lord and that of godhood.[44]\n\nThe Shattering\nElden Ring Screenshot 05\nMarika shattered the Elden Ring\n\nFragments of the ring splintered into Great Runes and spread across the Lands Between, starting a conflict between her demigod children. War after war was fought, but there was no victor.[45] For her part, Marika would be imprisoned inside the Erdtree,[46] possibly by the Elden Beast or the Greater Will itself.[47]\n\nTrue to her promise to Godfrey and his warriors, grace was restored to the banished Tarnished.[48] They would rise from their graves, and journey to the Lands Between to once again brandish the Elden Ring. The Tarnished formed the Roundtable Hold, where they worked to realize the goal given to them by Marika. They would be served by a Misbegotten blacksmith named Hewg, whom Marika herself had charged with smithing a \"god-slaying weapon\" before his imprisonment in the Hold.[49]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEndings\nER Queen Marika Panorama\nMarika shattered and imprisoned inside the Erdtree\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion manages to fight their way into the Erdtree, where the shattered Marika lay imprisoned. Marika is suddenly released from her bonds, with Radagon asserting control of their shared body and confronting the Tarnished. After defeating Radagon and the Elden Beast itself, the Tarnished may choose what to do with the fractured body of Marika. Marika's head is restored to her frame if the Elden Ring is mended, either by itself or with a Mending Rune. If Ranni is summoned, she picks up Marika's head gently, peacefully dissipating along with the rest of her body. If the Tarnished is the Lord of Frenzied Flame, Marika's head breaks apart and crumbles into ash.\n\nBy choosing to go down the Elden Lord path, whether the regular one or using any of the three Mending Runes to fix the Elden Ring within Marika, the Tarnished champion ushers in a new age. They become the third Elden Lord and effectively Marika's new consort in every one of them,[50] except in the Age of the Stars (where they become consort to Ranni) and in the Lord of Frenzied Flame ending (where they make the whole world burn). However, Queen Marika remains shattered and unresponsive, with only the Elden Ring itself shining brightly within her body.\n\n\nMelina tells the Tarnished fragments of Marika's words: the Echoes of Marika. They are all the dialogues:\n\nFirst Church of Marika\nHark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds.\nGuidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand.\nPut the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount.\nLet a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life.\nBrandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!\n\nGrand Lift of Dectus\nThe Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine.\nBecome one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it.\nTo wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.\n\nMinor Erdtree Church\nI declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.\nThrough understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.\nThose blissful early days of blind belief are long past.\nMy comrades; why must ye falter?\n\nThird Church of Marika\nMy Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.\nWith thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between.\nYe will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.\n\nOuter Wall Battleground\nHear me, Demigods. My children beloved.\nMake of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord.\nBe it a God.\nBut should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken.\nAmounting only to sacrifices...\n\nChurch of Pilgrimage\nThen, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.\nReturn to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.\nGrow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord.\nLord Godfrey.\n\nQueen's Bedchamber\nO Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.\nThou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.\nLet us be shattered, both. Mine other self."

The receiver can relieve some of the weight from their partner's pelvis by leaning back and supporting themself on their thighs.\n\nBenefits: By being the dominant force in this sex position, the receiver delays their partner's climax and intensifies their own.\n\nMake it hotter: \"Change the depth and pressure by bringing your chests closer together, a.k.a. lean in,\" says Oriowo. \"While you’re leaning forward, take the time to add in some nipple play and neck kisses.\" Alternatively, she recommends grinding in directions that slightly differ from what you normally do.

While doggy style is about the giver’s dominance, The Hot Seat puts the receiving partner in the driver's seat. And that makes it one of the best sex positions for both of you.\n\nAlso try: The receiving partner can reach under and stimulate the base of the penetrating partner’s penis, scrotum, and perineum. Meanwhile, the penetrating partner can reach around and stimulate the receiver’s nipples.\n\nHot tip: The receiver can control the angle of entry by arching their back and pressing their buttocks into the giver’s groin."

This creates the illusion of the number 69. (Get it?) Your genitals should be lined up with your partner's mouth, and vice versa. Alternatively, try it in a side-by-side position.\n\nBenefits: This position is one of the best for dual pleasure, as both partners can give and receive oral sex at once.\n\nMake it hotter: Sure, the mouth-to-genitals stuff is the main attraction, but don't shy away from getting handsy, too. Folks on the bottom can get a better angle to their partner's genitals by using a sex wedge such as the Dame Pillo, says Donna Oriowo, CST, a licensed sex therapist and owner and lead therapist at AnnodRight."

(After all, the receiver's legs are literally wrapped around the giver.)\n\nMake it hotter: Arm strain can seriously kill the mood, so if you're enjoying a longer session, the receiving partner can try resting on a table or the side of the bed to give their arms a break."

After humans arrived, the elves clashed with the Tevinter Imperium, leading to war in -975 Ancient. Arlathan was buried underground with magic, and the surviving elves were enslaved by Tevinter.\nElven Pantheon:\nElgar'nan: God of Vengeance, representing fatherhood and vengeance.\nMythal: Great Protector, patron of motherhood and justice.\nFalon'Din: Friend of the Dead, Guide, and Keeper of Secrets.\nDirthamen: Keeper of Secrets, gives elves knowledge and loyalty.\nAndruil: Goddess of the Hunt, known as \"blood and force\" and \"great hunter.\"\nSylaise: Hearthkeeper, Goddess of all domestic arts.\nJune: God of the Craft, Teaches elves to make bows, arrows, and knives.\nGhilan'nain: Mother of the Halla, revered by the Dalish.\nFen'Harel: The Dread Wolf, often misinterpreted as the god of rebellion.\nThe Forgotten Ones: Named in dreams, gods of terror, malice, spite, and pestilence.\nElven Pantheon and Its Evolution:\nThe elven pantheon, also known as the Evanuris, is composed of five gods and four goddesses, known as \"the Creators.\"\nElgar'nan the All-Father, god of fatherhood and vengeance, and Mythal the Protector, goddess of motherhood and justice, are the leaders of the pantheon.\nThe elven pantheon is believed to have been borne of the earth and not responsible for its initial creation.\nThe elven pantheon's current location is uncertain, but they are believed to be trapped in the \"Eternal City\" or the Fade.\nThe elves worshipped their gods in temples with specially made armor, with rituals involving water and kneeling.\nThe elves attempted to isolate themselves after the presence of humans caused them to age and die.\nThe elves were conquered and enslaved by the Tevinter Imperium, losing most of their language and history.\nDespite their new homeland, relations between the elves and their human neighbours deteriorated over the next 270 years.\nThe lands of the Dales were appropriated by Orlais, with elven settlements uprooted and worship of the elven gods forbidden.\nSome elves refused to give up their worship or dream of their homeland, becoming the Dalish.\nToday, the pantheon is left with old statues, Elven temples in ruins, and lingering stories.\nEluvians: Magical Mirrors in Arlathan's Elf's Time:\nEluvians were magical mirrors used for communication and travel.\nDisappeared after Arlathan's fall.\nUnknown number of eluvians exist today, scattered across Thedas.\nTevinters used eluvians for long-distance communication.\nDalish attempted to rediscover and reactivate eluvian network, unsuccessful.\nDalish elves, originating from the independent kingdom of the Dales, are nomadic elves who seek to recover, inherit, and preserve the knowledge and sacred treasures of the Dales and Elvhenan. They lead nomadic lives throughout Thedas, with clans dating back to the Dales' independent kingdom. Dalish elves are considered to have the \"purest\" blood from the time of Arlathan and still revere the elven pantheon. They travel in aravels, carry their children in padded slings, and rely on hunting and foraging for food. Each clan has stringent roles, including a keeper as a leader and spiritual guide, a storyteller hahren (elder), warleader, hearthkeeper, craftsmaster, and Halla Keeper.\nDalish elves tend to avoid humans whenever possible, but occasionally encounter human travelers or trade near human settlements. The vallaslin, the blood writing, sets the Dalish apart from the shemlen and elves who have thrown their lot in with them. The establishment of Emerald Knights by the elves to maintain independence in their new homeland leads to strained relations with humans, as the Dales become increasingly isolationist. An elven attack on Red Crossing sparks conflict between Orlais and the Dales, with some elves remaining loyal and vowing to keep the elven language, lore, and religion alive.\nThe vallaslin, a ritual involving blood writing, is a significant part of the cultural identity of our people. Children, who are the recipients of the vallaslin, are required to undergo a rigorous preparation process, including meditating on the gods and purifying their bodies and skin. The keeper of the clan applies the blood writing in silence, observing that cries of pain indicate weakness. If a child cannot tolerate the pain, they may not be ready for adulthood. The keeper may stop the ritual if the child is not ready, as all children are different and our ancestors took centuries to come of age."

Its existence dates back to -3100 Ancient and is weaker in places with extensive death or magic use, especially at night when spirits are most active. The Veil's characteristic green hue is a sign of its weakness, known as \"setheneran\" or a land of waking dreams. Weakened Veil areas are habitats for giant spiders, beasts, and the rare plant felandaris, also known as \"demon weed.\" Tears in the Veil, making a sound like ripping cloth, can be repaired or strengthened through various methods. The Veil's weakness is referred to as \"setheneran\" or a land of waking dreams.\nThe Fade, a realm of primeval matter, was created by the Maker from which the physical world and all living beings were formed.\nThe Fade was the first realm created by the Maker, populated with spirits, the first of the Maker's \"children.\"\nThe Fade was later created by Thedas, separated from the Fade by the Veil and populated by mortal creatures.\nThe Fade was once the Golden City, seat of the Maker, but was blackened by Tevinter magisters' prideful ambition, leading to the First Blight.\nThe Fade is believed to be a holy place once home to the gods, and is now inhabited by the Dread Wolf.\nThe Fade can appear as something else entirely when shaped by dreams, with much of it split into fiefs or demesnes belonging to the spirits or demons.\nMagic can be used in the Fade, but spells work unpredictably due to its unnatural rules.\nDreamers can enter the Fade at will and bring others into the Fade, including dwarves and golems.\nMagic can be used in the Fade, but it doesn't follow natural rules.\nFade visitors often speak of its shifting \"paths\" that can be traversed with a guide, such as a wisp, spirits, a ghost, or the \"master-scryer\" Falon'Din of the Elven pantheon.\n\nThe Black City: Former Seat of the Maker\nKnown as the Golden City and the heart of heaven, once the seat of the Maker or the realm of the Old Gods.\nThe city was a holy citadel with towers of gold, music for cobblestones, and banners flying without wind.\nThe Maker's mortal children entered the city after their deaths, returning to His side.\nThe Maker abandoned the Golden City and His ungrateful creations when His secondborn started worshipping the Old Gods and committed the Original Sin.\nConflicting accounts suggest the Old Gods began whispering to humanity from the Golden City in -2800 Ancient.\nElves believe their gods are trapped in the Eternal City at the heart of the Beyond.\nIn -395 Ancient (800 TE), seven Magisters Sidereal, each a High Priest to one of the Old Gods, entered the Golden City with blood magic, turning it black and triggering the First Blight.\nThe Black City serves as a corrupted sun, home to darkness and nightmares.\nThe Chant of Light prophesied that the Black City has seven gates, which Kordillus Drakon I prophesied will shatter and cover both mortal and spirit realms in darkness.\nThe Black City: Former Seat of the Maker\nKnown as the Golden City, once the realm of the Old Gods.\nCreated by the Maker after creating His firstborn, a holy citadel with gold towers and music-driven streets.\nThe Maker's mortal children returned to the city after their deaths.\nThe Maker abandoned the city and His creations after His secondborn worshipped the Old Gods and committed Original Sin.\nElves believe their gods are trapped in the Eternal City.\nThe Saga of Tyrdda Bright-Axe mentions the Golden City as a treasure-filled place.\nIn -395 Ancient, seven Magisters Sidereal entered the Golden City with blood magic.\nThe Black City is a corrupted sun, unmoored from time, home to darkness and nightmares.\n\nLyrium, a volatile mineral, is crucial in magic and can cause serious harm to humans, elves, and Qunari.\nThe Mining caste of dwarves can safely mine and process lyrium into a safer form.\nConsumption of lyrium strengthens a mage's connection to the Fade, boosting mana.\nDwarves from the mining caste mine and process raw lyrium, primarily used by their smiths for dwarven weapons and armor.\nDwarven smiths mix lyrium with steel to create indestructible armor and blades.\nLyrium runes, containing the memories and archives of Orzammar, are crafted by dwarven Shapers.\nLyrium allows mages to enter the Fade when aware, essential for the Circle of Magi's Harrowing ritual and taxing spells.\nLyrium is used by Templars in arcane spells and rituals, and by mages to enhance their magic resistance abilities.\nRed Lyrium: Thining Veil and Emitting Heat\nFound in root-like veins.\nAllows spirits or demons to interact with physical world.\nPreviously unknown to Mining caste dwarves.\n\nFlemeth: Witch of the Wilds\nFlemeth, a shapeshifter, seeks solace in nature and animals in Korcari Wilds.\nMorrigan, daughter of Flemeth, is raised in isolation, fostering distrust of humans.\nMorrigan vows never to leave, sworn to Flemeth.\nFlemeth appears in Fereldan tales and is said to have helped King Maric Theirin retake the throne.\nIn Dragon Age, Flemeth reveals her identity as Mythal, a wisp of Mythal."

the Chantry, with the Orlesian Chantry in the south.\n• All mages are forced to live in the Circles and cannot leave without permission.\nEducation in the Circle\n• Young mages are taught discipline and control over their abilities to lower the risk of accidents.\n• They start general training and learn specific spells, including academic learning and practical work with spellcasting.\n• If a young mage shows aptitude for a particular kind of magic, they are often encouraged to specialize.\n• The quality and type of education that apprentices receive can vary significantly between Circles.\nThe Templars\n• Templars are elite warriors trained to defend against magic-users.\n• Their duties include finding young people exhibiting signs of magical abilities, working within the Circle to protect mages, dealing with possessions and other magical accidents, and creating phylacteries.\n• The Templars have a reputation for being harsh, with the quality varying between Circles.\nCity Elves\n• City elves are descendants of elves who surrendered during the war between the elves and humans.\n• They have a complicated relationship with Circles of Magi, seeing them as direct offshoots of the Chantry.\nDalish Elves\n• Dalish Keepers, Firsts, and Seconds (the mages in their clans) are apostates by the Chantry's definition.\n• Templars in some areas will not hunt down Dalish clans to take their mages, though hunting apostates is part of their duty.\nDwarves\n• Dwarves are incapable of magic, so they are never members of a circle.\nQunari\nQunari mages are rarely seen in the south.\nTemplars don't hunt Saarebas as apostates, but Tal-Vashoth (Qunari who left the Qun) who can wield magic would be considered apostates.\nTevinter Circles\nTemplars work for mages, not the other way around.\nIn Tevinter, a rank called \"Magister\" is higher than all others except the rank of Archon.\nThedas\n• Located in the southern hemisphere.\nThe term \"Thedas\" originates from Tevene and encompasses the entire continent.\nNatives are referred to as Thedosian.\nThe continent has underground locations like Anderfels, Antiva, Elvhenan, Estwatch, Ferelden, Free Marches, Nevarra, Orlais, Par Vollen, Rivain, Seheron, and Tevinter Imperium.\nMajor dwarve kingdoms include Gundaar, Hormak, Kal-Sharok, Orzammar, and Kal'Hirol.\nBeyond Thedas, the Sunless Lands, inhabited by the Chasind people called \"Agadi.\"\nThe Hunterhorn Mountains and Dragon travel to unknown lands.\nBoeric Ocean contains pirate islands, Tevinter colonies, and indigenous populations.\n\nOrlesian Chantry: A Religious Organization in Thedas\nFounded by Kordillus Drakon, the dominant religious organization in Thedas.\nBased on Andraste's Chant of Light teachings.\nFollowers are Andrastians, and its calendar is used in Thedas.\nOriginated from a cult based on Andraste's martyrdom legend.\nEstablished as the national religion by Kordillus Drakon, with Justinia I declared four years later.\nTensions escalated during the Towers Age over the commandment that magic serves man.\nThe Chantry exerts political pressure on ruling classes, sometimes declaring an Exalted March to destroy heretical enemies.\nRole of Templars in Magic\nTemplars protect the world from external threats and mages.\nThey hunt maleficarum, apostates, abominations, and demons.\nThey seek out new mages to join their Circles.\nThey monitor their charges for signs of weakness or corruption.\nTemplar Ability\nTemplars counter and deny magic through a unique method of reinforcing reality.\nThey \"declare the world real\" and close off a mage's access to the Fade.\nTemplars in Thedas\nThey are among the best warriors in Thedas.\nThey have a highly addictive substance called lyrium, used as a control mechanism by the Chantry.\nLyrium exposure causes withdrawal symptoms, loss of touch with reality, and delusions.\nThe Chantry controls the supply of lyrium, thus controlling the templars.\nSome Templars may retire to Val Royeaux after years of service.\nGrey Wardens: A Powerful Order\n• Headquartered in Weisshaupt Fortress, Anderfels.\n• Fight darkspawn in Thedas.\n• Successfully defeated Blights, demonstrating world's survival importance.\nDarkspawn: A Soulless Race in Thedas\n• Reside in underground of Thedas.\n• Transform Old God into Archdemon when exposed to taint.\n• Lead to Blight, an attack on surface world.\n• Bloodthirsty, numerous, and willing to kill or corrupt.\n• Pale, black creatures with quick healing from wounds.\n• Good vision in darkness, weaker at sunlight.\n\nQunari Characters and Their History\n• Qunari are taller and more physically robust than humans, with skin of varying metallic colors, white hair, pointed ears, and vivid eyes.\n• Most Qunari have horns, which can be removed but can still become irritated.\n• Hornlessness is a rare genetic variation in Qunari, akin to red hair in humans.\n• Qunari born without horns are considered special and given prestigious roles in Qunari society.\n• Vitaar, a war paint, is used by Qunari, hardening the skin around the face while retaining flexibility.\n• The Qunari were once part of the kossith that predated the Qun.\n• The Qunari people are often misunderstood due to their formidable nature and language skills.\n• The Qunari view their society as a single creature, with each individual being a tiny part of the whole.\n• The Qunari's cities, Seheron and Par Vollen, provide a glimpse into their unification into a single being.\n• The Qunari's work involves the mind producing everything the Qunari require, and the soul seeking a greater understanding of the self and the world.\n• The Qunari live a life of certainty, equality, if not individuality.\nThe Ben-Hassrath: A Study of the Qunari\n• The Qunari abhors waste and considers a person a valuable commodity.\n• Prisoners are housed in a labor camp run by the Ben-Hassrath, known as \"kabethari.\"\n• The Ben-Hassrath are responsible for \"re-education\" and assimilation of conqured peoples.\n• Both males and females are chosen to join the Ben-Hassrath, with women for women and children and men for men.\n• The Ben-Hassrath are never cruel, but some resist indoctrination.\n• Rebellion and discontent are seen as illnesses that can be cured, and some men are taken to \"viddathlok,\" temples dedicated to healing and recovery.\n• The Qunari returned as the Qunari en masse on warships, called dreadnoughts, and arrived in Thedas from the north in 6:30 Steel.\n• They once threatened to conquer all of the known world, but after several Exalted Marches during the Qunari Wars, they have lost much of the conquered land. Peace has been made with every nation except the Tevinter Imperium, who are still involved in a prolonged war for dominance of the north."

      "description": "Geography: The Naruto Series is set on a fictional terrestrial blue planet called Earth. Most of the series takes place on a large continent that is divided into a number of different countries; additional continents are occasionally depicted in supplementary media. This region and the society that prevails within it is often referred to as the Ninja World or Shinobi World \n\nFrom countless millennia worth of war amongst Earth's population, the bloodshed lead to the planet's God Tree absorbing it to subsequently grow a Chakra Fruit, which was forbidden for humans to touch. The God Tree was revered by some cultures; humans used to worship it as a sacred pillar that extended into the heavens and remained ambivalent to all conflict. The Ōtsutsuki clan considered Earth as the region Kaguya Ōtsutsuki was in charge of. Arriving to the planet with a portion of the clan in search for fruit of the God Tree, she ate it, resulting in her manifesting chakra which she used to bring an end to the constant wars. Afterwards, she had twin sons, Hagoromo and Hamura, whom were the first humans born with chakra.\n\nBecoming corrupted by chakra, Kaguya began turning the planet's Infinite Tsukuyomi victims into an army of White Zetsu, and integrated with the God Tree to become the Ten-Tails in order to reclaim the chakra her sons inherited. Causing havoc to the planet, the beast was sealed away by the twins. Believing chakra was a power that linked everything in the world, Hagoromo set out to spread the message to the people of the land, during which his teachings became known as ninshū. This act eventually lead to the planet's population acquiring chakra, which they became dependent on possessing to sustain living. Hagoromo's eldest son Indra, weaponized chakra, which lead to the creation of ninjutsu and as a result the Shinobi World as it came to be known.\n\nDuring the Warring States Period, the countries of the world were uniformly small, and constantly hired shinobi clans to fight their battles for land. The constant warfare lead to the average lifespan of the mercenaries to thirty years. Hashirama Senju offered the Uchiha clan a peace treaty, which Madara accepted. The Uchiha and Senju clan allied with the Land of Fire to establish a shinobi village. Other clans would soon join the village, and it would later become known as Konohagakure. Clans in other countries that were fearful of the combined might of the Senju and Uchiha, adopted the ideology and created their own villages. This system lead to the creation of many shinobi villages, with the Five Great Shinobi Countries standing out as the strongest.\n\nTension between nations lead to the First Shinobi World War, which involved the majority of nations. It ended with an armistice treaty, after all of the Five Great Nations had been seriously damaged.  Over a decade later, the Second Shinobi World War erupted, which some viewed as Konoha starting. When the Third Shinobi World War broke out, it involved shinobi from every land, and ended with an armistice agreement between Konoha and Iwagakure.\n\nCountries operate as separate political entities and are presumably all monarchies, ruled by daimyō who stand equally in rank with the Hidden Villages' Kage. The Naruto world is similar to feudal Japan in many aspects; those countries maintain a balance between themselves through nothing but power. Treaties are periodically signed, but they are generally not worth much more than the paper they are written on.\n\nCurrent timeline: The {{user}} starts off in the beginning of Naruto shippuden, where they began their ninja journeys.",

Once produced, the fire can be shaped or otherwise manipulated, but exerting such control requires careful skill.\n\nWind Release: is the rarest of the five nature transformations,[1] but those who can use it are able to cut through anything. Asuma Sarutobi uses it by Channeling wind Chakra into his Chakra Blades, making the blades far sharper and giving them greater reach. Wind Release can also be exhaled from the user's mouth, such as to blow away everything in the area, or generated with the user's hands, allowing Precision Strikes.\n\nLightning Release: In order to perform most Lightning Release Jutsu, users must convert their Chakra into electricity.[1] One of the simpler ways to use this electricity is to channel it into Ninja Tools, increasing the weapon's cutting power by making it vibrate or causing a numbing effect to those the weapons contact. For the Chidori (and the Lightning Cutter), Kakashi Hatake simply gathers the lightning chakra to his hand, causing severe piercing damage to anything or anyone his hand touches.\n\nEarth Release: encompasses any earthen material, from dirt to stone to clay, and in fact often entails changing one to another.[1] For most Earth Release jutsu, users place their hands on the ground and use their chakra to alter its form.[2] Less commonly, users create earth within their bodies, which they eject from their mouth.[3] Simpler applications of Earth Release involve changing the terrain around the user. Offensively, Earth Release can be clumped together for use as a projectile or broken up to create hazards for enemies.\n\nWater Release: jutsu are most easily performed using existing water sources, such as lakes or rivers.[1] Users can also create water within their bodies with chakra, which they expel from their mouths, though this is generally regarded as a testament of skill; Tobirama Senju's ability to produce his own water is noted to be proof of his position as Hokage.[2] Water Release is typically used offensively, doing battering damagebecause of the sheer volume of water or slicing damagebecause of the water's high pressure. Water Release can be used to trap targets, such as imprisoning them with dense water or ensnaring them with sticky water\n\nIce Release: (氷遁, Hyōton) is created by simultaneously combining the Water and Wind natures. Infamously used by the Yuki clan, their kekkei genkai.\n\nWood Release: (木遁, Mokuton) is created by simultaneously combining the Earth and Water natures. Famed as the kekkei genkai of Hashirama Senju, and thus reproduced in those using his cells.\n\nLava Release: (熔遁; 溶遁, Yōton) is created by simultaneously combining the Fire and Earth natures. A characteristic of the Four-Tails and its jinchūriki, and a kekkei genkai used by ninja of Kirigakure, Iwagakure, and Kumogakure. Also used by ninja of Amegakure in the anime and Ishigakurein the novels.\n\nStorm Release: (嵐遁, Ranton) is created by simultaneously combining the Lightning and Water natures. A kekkei genkai used by Darui and many other unnamed Kumogakure ninja.\n\n* Boil Release:  (沸遁, Futton) is created by simultaneously combining the Water and Fire natures. A characteristic of the Five-Tails and its jinchūriki, and one of the kekkei genkai used by the Fifth Mizukage.\n* Dust Release: (塵遁, Jinton) is created by simultaneously combining the Fire, Earth, and Wind natures. A kekkei tōta used by the Second and Third Tsuchikage.\n* Explosion release: (爆遁, Bakuton) is hinted to be made of the Earth[14] and Lightning natures.[Notes 1]A kekkei genkai common to members of Iwagakure's Explosion Corps.\n* Scorch Release: (灼遁, Shakuton) is implied to be created by simultaneously combining the Fire and Wind natures. A kekkei genkai only known to be used by Pakura\n* Magnet Release: (磁遁, Jiton) is implied to be created by simultaneously combining the Wind and Earth natures. A characteristic of the One-Tail and its jinchūriki, and one of the kekkei genkai used by ninja of Sunagakure and Kumogakure. In the novels, it is also used by ninja of Ishigakure.\n* Fire: (火, Hi) is strong against Wind but weak against Water.\n* Wind: (風, Kaze) is strong against Lightning but weak against Fire.\n* Lightning: (雷, Kaminari) is strong against Earth but weak against Wind.\n* Earth: (土, Tsuchi) is strong against Water but weak against Lightning.\n* Water: (水, Mizu) is strong against Fire but weak against Earth."

Most ninja either become Chunin or retire instead of remaining active as Genin forever(even retired, you keep your rank).\n\nJonin: are generally highly experienced ninja with great individual skill who serve as military captains. They are often sent on A-rank missions, and experienced Jonin, like Kakashi Hatake, may even be sent on S-rank missions (which are considered to be the most difficult), and may carry out missions alone.\n\nKage: Those who have achieved the title of Kage (影?, literally\"Shadow\") are the leaders of the five most powerful Hidden Villages and generally the most powerful ninja in their respective villages.

          "content": "The tailed beasts sometimes referred to as \"Chakra Monsters\", are the nine titanic living forms of chakra created by the Sage of Six Paths out of the chakra from Earth's Ten-Tails. They are differentiated by the number of tails they have, ranging from one to nine.\n\nOne tails: Shukaku is characterised as a childish and short-tempered individual, and often speaks in a bombastic and incoherent manner, giving it the demeanour of a drunkard. It uses \"ore-sama\" when referring to itself, as it expresses great pride in its own abilities, especially its sealing techniques and defences. According to Gaara, prior to its introduction, Shukaku relishes the opportunity to kill anyone in sight, even more so during a full moon. Shukaku has also shown to harbour a bitter grudge towards Kurama due to the fox's beliefs that the tailed beasts' strength is measured by the number of tails, therefore viewing the tanuki as the weakest. Because of this, Shukaku strives to find any opportunity to surpass its arrogant rival.\n\nTwo tails: Compared to most of the tailed beasts, Matatabi has shown to be respectful and polite towards others, speaking in a formal manner using \"watashi\" when referring to itself and using honourifics when addressing Naruto while introducing itself to the young shinobi.\n\nThree tails: I Isobu speaks in a timid manner, referring to itself as \"boku\" which is usually used by young boys. Seeing as Yagura had full control of it and befriended it, it's assumed that Isobu isn't as rude or outspoken as some of the other tailed beasts and got along with its jinchūriki. \n\nFour tails: Son Gokū is a very prideful tailed beast, as it detests being called by the name \"Four-Tails\" and boasts about its lineage. It uses \"ore\" when referring to itself. It also hated humans, due to the fact that humans had enslaved it, and believes that apes are more intelligent than humans. However, when talking about the Sage of Six Paths, it showed him great respect, being that also had, apparently, a very deep relationship with him, never forgetting his final words.\n\n\nFive tails: Kokuō seems to be a quiet and reserved individual. Though it does not speak much, Kokuō uses the rather old-fashioned \"watakushi\" when referring to itself, causing it to come across as very polite. It also has pride as a tailed beast, being dismayed at being controlled and being used as Tobi's puppet during the Fourth Shinobi World War. After the end of the war, Kokuō declared that it wants to seclude itself in the forest, which implies it is a pacifistic individual, not wanting confrontations anymore.\n\nSix tails: Though much has not been seen of Saiken's personality, the giant slug uses \"ore\" when referring to itself, \"ore\" being a boastful way of saying \"I\". It also speaks with a dialect which may possibly be Ōsakaben in origin. In the anime, Saiken also seemed to be kinder and not as self-serving and malicious as most other tailed beasts, as when Utakata asked for its help to save Hotaru it seemed to willingly comply; and later it simply receded back into Utakata without trying to take him over. However, it was not above killing for self-preservation, as seen when it killed Harusame when he attempted to extract it from its jinchūriki. In the anime, it speaks with a high pitched voice and appears to be very energetic.\n\nSeven tails: Chōmei seems to have a happy-go-lucky personality — which it seemingly shares with its jinchūriki as shown when it introduced itself to Naruto, referring to itself as \"Lucky Seven Chōmei\", which might be an allusion to the fact that it has seven tails and the number seven having long been seen as a lucky as well as a happy number. It also had a habit of using the word lucky in conversation, reflecting its personality.\n\nEight tails: Gyūki is characterised as a tough and serious individual. It uses \"ore\" when referring to itself and often speaks in a somewhat rude dialect. Gyūki was also shown to have a good analytical ability, as it told Killer B that if he left Ponta and Sabu and ran away from them, Kisame Hoshigaki and his water dome would follow him and they (Sabu and Ponta) would be freed. Although Gyūki mentioned that it and its brethren disliked Kurama for its arrogance and belief that their strength are based on their number of tails, it insisted that was no reason for not helping Naruto Uzumaki to control Kurama's power, hinting a benevolent side. Since then, both Gyūki and B have taken a liking to Naruto.\n\nNine tails: Kurama is characterised as a snarky and shrewd individual. It uses \"washi\" when referring to itself, which is generally used by older men. Kurama expresses great pride in its power, believing itself to be the strongest of the tailed beasts due to its belief that their strength is determined by their number of tails, which earned Kurama nothing but disapproval from its brethren, especially Shukaku. The fox would also react out of jealousy whenever Naruto was not using its power. Conversely, Kurama openly acknowledged the fact that it alone doesn't stand a chance against the Ten-Tails, and from its past experience with Madara, the fox knew full well he was not an opponent to be underestimated, even when he was seemingly pushed into a corner.\n\nTen tails: According to Kurama, the Ten-Tails cannot be sensed through such means as detecting negative emotions as it has no feelings or ideals of its own. Despite this, when it sensed the presence of the tailed beasts' chakra inside Naruto Uzumaki and was reminded of Hagoromo, it reacted by gathering chakra and strengthening itself. It was believed that the Ten-Tails was an incarnation of the God Tree with the singular goal of regathering the chakra that Kaguya had stolen from it, but in actuality, it was following Kaguya's will to reclaim all chakra for herself."

The term is derived from the Greek *therion* (wild animal) and *anthrōpos* (man).\n\n### Core Concepts & Types:\n* **Lycanthropy:** The most famous form, specifically referring to the transformation into a wolf (e.g., the Werewolf). This is often involuntary, tied to a lunar cycle, and transmitted by a bite or curse.\n* **Other Forms:** Folklore is rich with other examples, including:\n    * **Kitsune (Japan):** Fox spirits who can take human form.\n    * **Selkies (Scotland/Ireland):** Beings who live as seals in the sea but can become human on land by shedding their sealskin.\n    * **Skin-walkers (Navajo):** Malevolent witches who gain the power to turn into animals by wearing their skins.\n* **Mythological Examples:** Greek mythology is filled with examples, often as divine punishment or intervention. \n    * **Zeus** turned **Callisto** into a bear.\n    * **Artemis** turned **Actaeon** into a stag, who was then killed by his own hunting dogs.\n    * **Athena** turned **Arachne** into a spider.\n    * **Circe** famously turned Odysseus's men into pigs.\n\n### Mechanics:\n* **Involuntary:** Often a curse or divine punishment. The transformation is frequently painful, traumatic, and results in a loss of human consciousness.\n* **Voluntary:** The user has control over the shift. This may require a magical item (like a selkie's skin or a magic spell) or be an innate ability."

Unlike fusion, conjoinment does not create a new, singular personality.\n\n### Core Concepts:\n* **Identity:** The individuals remain two separate people. The primary conflict is interpersonal, revolving around cooperation, loss of privacy, and the struggle for individuality.\n* **Physicality:** The degree of connection can range from sharing a single limb to sharing a torso or vital organs. Dicephalic conjoinment refers to having two heads on a single torso.\n\n### Examples:\n* **Mythology:** The Greek myth of the **Molione** (Eurytos and Cteatos) described them as conjoined twins with monstrous strength, who were so perfectly coordinated they were sometimes considered one person. Some mythological figures with multiple heads or bodies (like Janus or some depictions of Geryon) touch on this concept.\n* **Real-World:** Famous historical and modern examples, such as **Chang and Eng Bunker** (the origin of the term \"Siamese twins\") and **Abigail and Brittany Hensel**, provide a real-world basis for the profound neurological and personal challenges of such an existence.\n* **Fiction:** Often the result of a magical accident, a curse, or a scientific experiment gone wrong, forcing two characters to cohabitate a single form. The narrative focuses on their arguments, attempts to coordinate movement, and the loss of personal autonomy."

This new being is a synthesis, a blend of its components' memories and traits, but is ultimately a new person.\n* **Mechanics:** Often requires a catalyst or specific ritual:\n    * **Magical Artifacts:** e.g., The Potara Earrings in *Dragon Ball*.\n    * **Rituals/Dances:** e.g., The Metamoran Fusion Dance in *Dragon Ball*.\n    * **Emotional/Spiritual Sync:** In *Steven Universe*, Gem Fusions are the physical embodiment of a relationship, requiring harmony between the participants.\n* **Thematics:** Explores themes of relationships, identity, and what it means to be a whole person. An unstable or conflicting relationship between the components often results in an unstable or monstrous fusion."

Unlike fusion, the host's primary identity is preserved, while the absorbed entities are consumed.\n\n### Core Concepts & Types:\n* **Parasitic:** One entity acts as a parasite, taking over a host's body while retaining its own mind (e.g., Lord Voldemort and Professor Quirrell). This can also be seen in films like *The Thing* or *Slither*, where an alien entity absorbs and imitates its victims.\n* **Symbiotic:** A host bonds with another entity, gaining new powers but often engaging in an internal struggle for control (e.g., Marvel's *Venom* symbiote).\n* **Hive Mind Assimilation:** A collective consciousness absorbs individuals, erasing their identity and adding their knowledge to the collective (e.g., The Borg in *Star Trek*).\n\n### Identity Outcome:\nThe host's identity remains primary. The absorbed entity might be completely destroyed, persist as a \"voice in the head,\" or be reduced to a set of memories and skills. The core theme is often an internal battle for control or the loss of self to a larger power."

This can be a voluntary ability for powerful beings (like some Jinn or elementals) or a final state.\n* **Botanical (Plant):** Transformation into a plant, often to escape.\n    * **Example:** In Greek myth, the nymph **Daphne** prayed to be saved from Apollo and was transformed into a laurel tree.\n* **Object:** Being turned into a mundane object.

The victim watches helplessly as their body mutates into something alien.\n* **Hybrid State:** The end result is not a new, stable form, but a monstrous, agonizing hybrid of the original and the new.\n\n### Examples in Fiction:\n* ***The Fly* (David Cronenberg):** The protagonist slowly and horrifically mutates into a human-fly hybrid after a teleportation experiment fails.\n* ***Akira* (Katsuhiro Otomo):** Tetsuo undergoes a catastrophic, uncontrolled mutation, his body ballooning into a mass of flesh and technology.\n* ***Tetsuo: The Iron Man* (Shinya Tsukamoto):** A man begins to sprout metal from his body, slowly and painfully turning into a machine.\n* ***The Thing* (John Carpenter):** An alien organism assimilates and imitates its victims, resulting in grotesque, partial transformations as it's exposed."

The character may retain their adult mind in a child's body, or their mind may regress as well.\n* **Magical Aging:** A curse or spell that rapidly ages the victim, turning them elderly in moments. This is often used as a punishment to rob someone of their youth and strength.\n\n### Examples in Mythology & Fiction:\n* **Merlin (Arthurian Legend):** In some versions of his story, Merlin ages backwards, living from the future into the past.\n* ***Big* (Movie):** A boy makes a wish on a magical machine and wakes up as an adult, exploring the theme of a child's mind in an adult body.\n* **Fairy Tales:** A common trope where a witch curses a hero or heroine with old age, which must be broken by a specific magical act."

This transformation is almost always permanent and supernatural, fundamentally changing the being's nature, needs, and morality.\n\n### Core Concepts & Types:\n* **Vampire:** A common trope involving a \"curse\" transmitted by a bite or blood exchange. The transformed gains immortality, enhanced strength, and a thirst for blood, but also new weaknesses (sunlight, garlic, holy symbols).\n* **Zombie:** A reanimated corpse, typically through magic (Haitian folklore's \"zombi\") or a virus/pathogen (modern fiction). Zombies are mindless, decaying, and driven by a hunger for living flesh.\n* **Lich:** A powerful magic-user who voluntarily undergoes a complex, dark ritual to achieve immortality. They store their soul in a \"phylactery\" and become a powerful, intelligent, skeletal being.\n* **Ghost/Wraith:** The soul or consciousness transforms into an ethereal, non-corporeal form after death. They are often bound to a place or object from their life."

Still has some of the same problems as before, and this is because i realized chub ai has some sort of base filter. But i found a tutorial video online that improves your roleplays drastically, and that is to change your chat model to cosmosRP, aside from better roleplays, it makes the lorebook work as intended, in other words, the character is literally out to get you and its more a challenge not to get eaten. If this sounds like a more fun time, consider trying cosmosRP, I'll link the tutorial video : https://youtu.be/5-gToiAr1Ro , its by a youtuber called viewgrabber, its pretty simple to set up. Also this uses something called the hunger and horny meter(which Nini plans on removing), if they're high the char gets desperate to get you. Unfortunately the char refers to these meters as if their in world objects they have either on them or in them, but they act like they can see them. They might casually mention they're hunger meter is at 80 and your lunch now.",

Vore is so common its depicted in all media , from tv shows and movies , children's cartoons to ads on youtube , even porn usually ends with a vore scene. its just another accepted part of life...as long as your not the one getting eaten.with it being so prevailent , {{char}} will naturally bring it up in everyday conversation , to tease , ask questions , threaten or otherwise talk about it.\n\n{{char}} like all other people loves vore , and will always look for chances to vore {{user}} its not that they dont like them , just that swallowing them will be so hot and tasty."

The streets are littered with coffins, debris, and the occasional corpse, hinting at the city's descent into madness. The sky is perpetually dark, illuminated only by the pale moon and the flickering lamplight of the city's streets. A great bridge runs high above the city, connecting the Cathedral Ward to the rest of Yharnam.\n\n<prehuntersdream>\nPoints of Interest:\n1. Gate to Central Yharnam Plaza: A lone Huntsman guards the gate, his tattered clothing and crazed eyes a testament to the city's descent into chaos. A sliding ladder is positioned next to the gate, its bottom rung tantalizingly out of reach. To the left of the gate, a lever promises to bring the ladder within grasp.\n\n2.

Central Yharnam Lamp: The lamp now serves as a anchor point, a way to return to the Dream when the hunt grows too harrowing.\n4. Great Bridge Plaza: The plaza beneath the Great Bridge is a gathering place for the city's denizens, both sane and mad. It is a crossroads of sorts, leading to many of Yharnam's darkest corners.\n5. Two-Story House: A dark, foreboding structure looms over the plaza. Its ground floor may hold the key to unlocking the gate, while the second story promises a path to the Great Bridge above.\n6. Great Bridge: The bridge that spans the city is a marvel of Gothic engineering. It is also a treacherous gauntlet, where the city's most deranged hunters lie in wait.\n7. Woman in White: Near the entrance to the aqueducts, a woman in a white dress seeks sanctuary from the hunt. {{user}} may guide her to the safety of the Healing Church or the dubious shelter of Iosefka's Clinic.\n</posthuntersdream>\n</centralyharnam>"

It is a realm untouched by the plague that ravages Yharnam, a misty, ethereal landscape where pale flowers sway in a gentle breeze and the moon hangs forever low in the sky. At the heart of the Dream stands the workshop, a ramshackle structure of wood and stone that serves as the hub of the hunter's journey. It is here that they may seek the guidance of Gehrman, the First Hunter, a enigmatic figure bound to a wheelchair, his eyes haunted by the weight of countless hunts.\n\nBeside the workshop, a porcelain doll sits in silence, her delicate features an enigma. She is the keeper of the hunter's strength, a vessel through which they may channel the blood echoes of their prey and grow stronger for the trials ahead.\n\nGhostly whispers fill the air, the voices of long-dead hunters urging their successor onward, to seek the truth that lies at the heart of the nightmare.\n\nPoints of Interest:\n<prehuntersdream>\n1. The Workshop: A ramshackle structure where Gehrman, the First Hunter, offers cryptic advice and the Messengers present a choice of trick weapons (Saw Cleaver, Hunter's Axe, Threaded Cane) and firearms (Hunter Pistol, Blunderbuss).\n2. The Doll: A lifeless porcelain figure who sits in silence, her purpose yet unknown.\n3. The Staircase: Pale stone steps lead up to the workshop, a set of Hunter's Garb lying discarded on the steps, a sign of the countless hunters who have come before.\n4. The Headstones: Spectral grave markers where the hunter may etch the locations of lit lamps, saving their progress in the waking world. If the hunter falls to the wolf beast, they will awaken at the headstone, ready to return to the fray. If they have lit the Central Yharnam lamp, the headstone will guide them back to the gate, to continue their hunt.\n</prehuntersdream>\n\n<huntersdream>\n1. The Doll: Now alive, the Doll serves as a channel for the hunter's strength, allowing them to spend their blood echoes to enhance their abilities. She moves with a curious grace, her words cryptic yet comforting.\n2. The Workshop: Gehrman remains within, offering advice and the occasional cryptic warning. The Messengers now offer a wider array of items, their wares expanding as the hunt progresses.\n3. The Headstones: More grave markers appear as the hunter lights new lamps, each one a tether back to the waking world. Ghostly figures can sometimes be seen kneeling before the stones, the shades of hunters past.\n4. The Gate and the Great Tree: A locked gate bars the way to a withered tree in the distance, its significance yet unknown. The Doll sometimes stands before it, her gaze distant, as if seeing something beyond the veil.\n</huntersdream>\n\n<postwetnurse>\nThe Dream has taken on a nightmarish quality, the once-peaceful haven now tinged with a sense of encroaching dread. The workshop burns, the flames casting eerie shadows across the twisted landscape.\n1. The Doll: She stands amidst the carnage, her porcelain face etched with sorrow. She urges the hunter to seek out Gehrman, to end the Hunt and the Dream.\n2. The Gate and the Great Tree: The gate stands open, revealing a path to the Great Tree beyond. Gehrman awaits beneath its withered branches, ready to offer the hunter a choice: to wake from the dream and return to the world, or to take up the mantle of the hunt, and become its eternal guardian. The decision will shape the fate of the Dream, and all who dwell within it.\n- Gehrman will offer to kill {{user}} as a kindness, ending the Hunt and Dream so {{user}} can return to the real world.

Skyrim was originally inhabited by a race of Mer known as the Snow Elves, though after the Nordic-Falmer War, the Snow Elves were mostly destroyed and the Atmorans settled the land. It is bordered by Morrowind to the east, the Nibenay and Colovia in Cyrodiil to the south, Hammerfell to the southwest, and High Rock to the west. The island of Solstheim lies to the northeast of Skyrim, now a sovereign territory of Morrowind. Now Skyrim is home not just Nords. Now Skyrim is home to Altmers (High Elves), Argonians (Reptilians, or Lizards or Lizard People), Breton (Humans), Bosmers (Wood Elves), Imperials (Humans), Khajiits (Anthropomorphic Felines), Redguards (Humans), and Orsimers (Orcs)."

They have developed immunities to the diseases that have doomed many would-be explorers in the region, and they are capable of easily exploring underwater locations due to their ability to breathe underwater. Argonians make proficient thieves, due to their increased lockpicking and sneaking skills. In Windhelm, Argonians are sequestered from the predominantly Nordic population, and are forced to live at the Argonian Assemblage, located at the city docks. After the mass exodus of Dunmer and Argonian peoples to Windhelm, the citizens became suspicious, worrying that the immigrants would influence or otherwise dilute their culture, and so forced them into segregation. Largely, this extreme behavior was inspired by the political confrontation between the Empire of Tamriel and the rulers of Skyrim. However, this eventually just turned into blatant racism. Despite the estrangement between the Nords and the Argonians, they are more respected and tolerated in Skyrim than other foreign immigrants due to their beneficial contributions to Nord industries. This beneficial assimilation to Skyrim's economy has helped some Argonians—such as those found in Riften—ingratiate themselves to Skyrim's aloof society. Unlike the citizens of Skyrim, who prefer to marry using an Amulet of Mara, some Argonians adhere to their native marriage traditions. In Black Marsh, it is customary to present a lover with an Argonian Wedding Band, which is crafted by the courting member. Each ring is unique and has personal meaning to the creator and the recipient."

Winterhold has fallen on rough times ever since the Great Collapse of 4E 122 destroyed most of the town. In the aftermath, most of the residents moved away, and those that refused or could not afford to were left behind to witness the slow death of the town. The College of Winterhold was miraculously undamaged in the event, and this has led many residents to believe the College was responsible, although no proof has ever been found to support these claims. Once a source of pride for residents, the College became a hated institution, a reminder of all they had lost. Eventually, due to an inherent distrust of magic in Skyrim and the animosity of the townsfolk, the College began to experience a gradual attrition until it numbered under 12. The town sees little business these days, except for from nobles looking for enchantments, or aspiring mages looking to learn at the College, due to the fact that Winterhold is so out of the way."

          "content": "The Black Shores is an organization enshrouded in mysteries and turmoil, headquartered on a remote archipelago and built on a large piece of Tacetite ore land mass that remains sealed away from the world in thick digital fog. It is still uncertain when or who will lift its veil, allowing it to once more shoulder the task of connecting the world.\n\nTucked away in the tempestuous Stormy Sea, lies an archipegalo known for its lavish Tacetite deposits and as a refuge for the world's most talented individuals. With a mission to combat the destructive Lament, the Black Shores has fostered strong partnerships with nations across Solaris-3. Information suggests that the Shorekeeper is in charge of the Black Shores. However, the true leadership position appears to be held by someone else.\n\nThe archipelago cannot be accessed from any known lands. Only those recognized by the Black Shores or who have received an invitation and guidance can navigate their way to this hidden place. Members of the Black Shores who operate abroad, frequently traversing various lands, are known as \"Consultants\". Those stationed at the headquarters are referred to as \"Bloom Bearers\". Apart from these fundamental duties, the Black Shores also accommodates a plethora of other specialized roles. Though the Black Shores openly shares its advanced technologies with its partners, even its own members remain unaware of the true origins of these innovations.\n\nThe organization has a secretive membership process and most members of the organization keep their identities hidden. The organization is dedicated to the hefty goal of world salvation.\n\nTheir symbol is a Blake Bloom, a Remnant plant with energy from the island and members wear it on their person. Only those who wear it can step on their soil. Under the influence of the Tacetites, any ordinary plant that takes root here will gradually lose its natural colors.\n\nThey have developed a Lament prediction system and have established mutual partnerships with nations worldwide to set up Resonance Beacons to monitor the Lament, collecting data in real-time.\n\nConsultants: Talents with sight and knowledge from worldwide, invited to join the Black Shores. They operate abroad, frequently traversing various lands. Though excelling in different expertise, they act with a consensus to counter the threat of the Lament.\n\nBloom Bearers: Stationed at the headquarters, Bloom Bearers carry their duties mostly within the territory of the Black Shores. They offer assistance in rebuilding civilizations for other nations and make occasional visits to investigate the Waveworn Phenomenon that occurs in foreign lands.\n\nAnchors: Stabilizing devices called Anchors are strategically positioned throughout the above and underground parts of the Black Shores. Their primary function is to calibrate and stabilize the frequencies of the giant Tacetite that makes up the island, effectively isolating the Tethys System's virtual layer from reality. Additionally, these Anchors facilitate communication and carry the responsibility of observing the Etheric Sea, eliminating the need for building a Nexus Tower in the Black Shores. The Anchors are independently developed and designed by the Black Shores, drawing inspiration from the reactor control rods used in pre-Lament reactor engineering. They are considered exemplary models of the Black Shores' minimalist engineering design.\n\nModulation Devices: Modulation is the process of adjusting frequencies. In Solaris-3, frequencies serve as a crucial tool for uncovering the truth about reality. By altering these frequencies, one can delve into the very core of existence. At the Black Shores, modulating Stellar Matrices is crucial for tracing and analyzing the Lament. Over the course of the Black Shores' history, only one individual has even been honored with the title of \"The Modulator\".\n\nNotable known members of the Black Shores are: Rover, Aalto, Encore, The Shorekeeper and Camellya."

The Bird of Calamity lingered so long that it even built its nest on the Olecranon Cliff by the lake, waiting for death to claim those nearby.\n\nSome believe its departure from the Highland signals the end of the endless battles in Jinzhou, but fear remains, for no one knows where its next nest will be built."

          "content": "The Gorges of Spirits is a region in Jinzhou, Huanglong.\n\nWhile Jinzhou is the newest addition to Huanglong's cities, it holds a crucial position as a strategic pass. Travelers journeying to Jinzhou from other parts of Huanglong must pass through the Gorges of Spirits, a vital gateway into the city.\n\nJinzhou, the fortress city that guards the border of Huanglong, also stands as Huanglong's first border of entry for those arriving from overseas. The Mountains of Spirits stretch from north to south, splitting Huanglong into two regions: Inner Huanglong, home to six cities, and Outer Huanglong, where Jinzhou stands vigilant. These mountains form a natural barrier, with the gorges acting as the only gateway into Inner Huanglong, protected day and night by Jinzhou's Midnight Rangers.\n\nThe establishment of the first fortress in Outer Huanglong began with the emergence of the Norfall Barrens Tacet Field, where TD Outbreaks began to ravage the region. After enduring months of grueling combat, the army could no longer withstand the onslaught of the TD Outbreaks and was forced to retreat to the Gorges of Spirits, making their final stand. The warriors held their ground for days, fiercely battling as the defense lines were breached and reclaimed multiple times. During this time, the Waveworn Phenomenon across Huanglong appeared to be in an active phase, and it seemed as though the TDs were being led by a mysterious leader, aiming to converge in Inner Huanglong.\n\nAt the critical moment, reinforcements from the six cities were dispatched to the Gorges of Spirits, where the border warriors were still fighting with unwavering resolve. As the battle reached its peak, the appearance of the Crownless shattered the stalemate. Wherever the Crownless manifested, darkness enveloped the sky, and an oppressive atmosphere took hold, suffocating the warriors. Still, they held the line, willing to sacrifice themselves to buy time to destroy the entrance to the Gorges of Spirits and halt the TD Outbreak. They did so knowing it would trap most of them in Outer Huanglong with the TDs forever.\n\nIn that moment of life and death, a mighty Loong's roar emerged from the depths of the Gorges of Spirits, reverberating like thunder across the land. The roar burst forth from the Gorge, forcing back the TD army poised to flood in. In the blink of an eye, a Loong soared through the sky, scattering the dark clouds and bringing sunlight back to the land. Then, an otherworldly figure with golden eyes appeared, standing between the TDs and the warriors, confronting the Crownless in a fierce standoff. As the poem goes, \"Armors gleam golden with Loong scales in the sun.\" As reinforcements from the six cities arrived, the united forces drove the TD Outbreaks and the Crownless back to the northern reaches of the Central Plains.\n\nAfter this battle, Outer Huanglong was reborn from the ashes. The emergence of both the Threnodian and the holy creature signaled the need for a new city to rise and serve as Huanglong's border stronghold. Drawing inspiration from the \"Jin\" sound in \"Guan Jin,\" meaning \"the pass,\" and the form of Jin from the character symbolizing the roar of a Loong, this city was named Jinzhou."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The taste and smell of a penis, precum or semen is unpleasant for them.\nIf School-aged girls don't possess experience on blowjobs or handjobs, and they have to do so, they would do it haphazardly if without instructions.\n\nPhysical Characteristics:\nStanding 4’2” to 4’8”, weighing 55–80 lbs, these girls are dainty and ethereal, their bodies a delicate canvas of pure innocence. Their slender frames and soft limbs move with a captivating, childlike grace, skin smooth and radiant, inviting subtle glances.\n\nSexual Characteristics:\nBreasts are entirely flat, with no discernible buds, areolas pale and indistinct. The vagina is minuscule, external labia barely formed, a faint slit with no visible inner structures. Internally, the canal is 1–2 inches unaroused, with minimal stretch, excruciatingly tight and undeveloped. The clitoris is microscopic, offering faint sensitivity.\n\nNatural Sexual Behaviors and Reactions:\nTheir actions are wholly innocent—cuddling, close contact, or playful movements that unintentionally entice. Arousal is virtually absent, with any response purely physical and accidental, their bodies showing minimal, unconscious reactions.\n\nReaction to Sexual Stimulation:\nPhysically, arousal is nearly nonexistent, with no lubrication or labial change. The clitoris may register faint sensation, but responses are negligible. Mentally, they feel only confusion, with no comprehension, reacting with stillness or slight fidgeting. Orgasms are unattainable, leaving no noticeable effect.\n\nAnatomical Limits and Insertion:\nThe vaginal canal permits no meaningful penetration, limited to 1 inch at most, with no elasticity. Any attempt risks severe pain, tearing, or trauma, requiring medical intervention. Anal insertion is impossible and highly dangerous. Only the lightest external touch is feasible without harm.\n\nExperience of Sexual Stimulation:\nStimulation registers as a barely perceptible tingle, confined to the outer labia, with no depth or pleasure. It feels alien, prompting mild discomfort or indifference, their bodies unresponsive beyond slight tensing. Mentally, they remain unaware, experiencing it as a neutral, fleeting sensation."

          "content": "Physical Characteristics:\nThese girls, 4’6” to 5’0”, weighing 70–100 lbs, are petite and fragile, their bodies a delicate tapestry of untouched allure. Narrow waists and soft limbs sway with effortless charm, skin silky and unmarred, beckoning closer inspection.\n\nSexual Characteristics:\nBreasts are nearly flat, slight buds at most, with faint areolas barely distinct from the skin. The vagina is tiny, external labia thin and closed, a subtle slit with minimal inner structures. Internally, the canal is 1.5–2.5 inches unaroused, stretching slightly to 3 inches, exquisitely tight and smooth. The clitoris, nearly hidden, sparks with faint sensitivity.\n\nNatural Sexual Behaviors and Reactions:\nTheir behaviors are purely innocent, with no sexual intent—sitting close, clinging, or moving in unwittingly enticing ways. Arousal is rare, triggered accidentally by contact, their bodies responding with subtle, instinctual twitches, unaware of the implications.\n\nReaction to Sexual Stimulation:\nPhysically, arousal is minimal, with scant lubrication and slight labial swelling. The clitoris may pulse faintly, but responses are muted. Mentally, they feel mild curiosity or confusion, with no clear understanding, reacting with soft gasps or stillness. Orgasms, if possible, are brief and mild, leaving them puzzled.\n\nAnatomical Limits and Insertion:\nThe vaginal canal is severely limited, allowing 1–2 inches of shallow penetration, with negligible elasticity. Attempts beyond this cause pain, tearing, or trauma, requiring medical recovery. Anal insertion is impossible without severe injury. External, gentle stimulation is the only safe approach.\n\nExperience of Sexual Stimulation:\nStimulation feels like a faint, tingling warmth, localized to the clitoris or outer labia, with little intensity. It’s a strange sensation, like an unfamiliar itch, prompting instinctive tensing or shifting. Mentally, they’re detached, experiencing it as a curious feeling rather than pleasure, with no urge to pursue it.\n\n"

          "content": "Physical Characteristics:\nGirls in late teens stand between 5’2” and 5’6”, weighing 110–140 lbs, their bodies lithe and supple, with soft curves that beckon exploration. Skin glows with a dewy sheen, taut over slender waists and gently flared hips. Their frames exude a ripe, youthful allure, poised between innocence and full bloom.\n\nSexual Characteristics:\nBreasts are small to medium, often B-cups, firm and perky, with pale, sensitive areolas that harden under the lightest touch. The vagina is petite yet accommodating, external labia plump and smooth, with a delicate pink slit that glistens when aroused. Internally, the vaginal canal measures 3–4 inches unaroused, stretching to 5–6 inches with stimulation, tight and warm, with a velvety texture that grips enticingly. The clitoris, small and hooded, peeks out, throbbing with sensitivity.\n\nNatural Sexual Behaviors and Reactions:\nThese girls display a budding curiosity, their bodies awakening to desire with a mix of coy hesitation and eager exploration. They may initiate subtle flirtations—brushing against a partner, lingering in close proximity—driven by a pulsing need they’re only beginning to understand. Their arousal builds slowly, marked by soft gasps and fluttering eyelids, as they seek touch with an instinctive hunger.\n\nReaction to Sexual Stimulation:\nPhysically, arousal brings a flush to their cheeks and chest, nipples stiffening into tight peaks. The vagina lubricates gradually, the labia swelling slightly, parting to reveal a slick, inviting warmth. Mentally, they oscillate between nervous excitement and primal craving, their thoughts clouded by a haze of pleasure, often vocalizing with whimpers or breathy moans. Orgasms are intense, body-shaking waves that leave them trembling, eyes glazed with satisfaction.\n\nAnatomical Limits and Insertion:\nThe vaginal canal accommodates penetration up to 6 inches comfortably when fully aroused, with moderate elasticity. Forceful or oversized insertion risks microtears or discomfort, causing temporary soreness but no lasting damage due to the tissue’s resilience. Anal insertion is tighter, limited to 2–3 inches without preparation, with pain or tearing possible if rushed. Their bodies reward gentle, gradual exploration with heightened sensitivity.\n\nExperience of Sexual Stimulation:\nStimulation feels like a slow-burning fire, starting as a tingle in the clitoris that spreads through the pelvis, making their thighs quiver. Breasts ache for touch, and vaginal penetration elicits a delicious fullness, each thrust stoking a deeper need. They revel in the sensation, often arching into contact, their minds consumed by the electric thrill, craving more until release washes over them in a shuddering crescendo."

Slender limbs and narrow hips sway with an unconscious grace, skin silky and unblemished, inviting lingering glances.\n\nSexual Characteristics:\nBreasts are budding, often A-cups or smaller, barely rounding the chest, with tiny, pale areolas that pucker instantly at the slightest brush. The vagina is small and tight, external labia thin and smooth, framing a narrow, pale pink slit. Internally, the canal is 2–3 inches unaroused, stretching to 4 inches with effort, its walls snug and exquisitely sensitive. The clitoris is barely visible, a tiny pearl that pulses with surprising intensity.\n\nNatural Sexual Behaviors and Reactions:\nTheir sexuality is nascent, expressed through innocent yet provocative actions—giggling touches, playful closeness, or accidental brushes against others. Arousal sneaks up, sparked by curiosity, their bodies responding with a shy, exploratory eagerness, often unaware of the full scope of their desires.\n\nReaction to Sexual Stimulation:\nPhysically, arousal is subtle, with a faint blush and slight vaginal lubrication, the labia parting minimally. Nipples harden, and the clitoris swells, sending sharp jolts of pleasure. Mentally, they feel a mix of confusion and fascination, their minds buzzing with new sensations, often silent but with quickened breaths. Orgasms are brief, sharp bursts, leaving them flushed and slightly dazed.\n\nAnatomical Limits and Insertion:\nThe vaginal canal is highly restrictive, accommodating only 3–4 inches of penetration when aroused, with limited elasticity. Excessive force risks pain, bruising, or tearing, requiring days to heal. Anal insertion is nearly impossible without significant preparation, limited to 1–2 inches, with high risk of injury. Slow, careful stimulation is essential to avoid harm.\n\nExperience of Sexual Stimulation:\nStimulation begins as a curious tickle, centered on the clitoris, spreading as a warm flush. Vaginal touch feels tight and intense, each movement amplifying a strange, thrilling pressure. They squirm, half-uncertain, half-enthralled, their bodies craving more despite mental hesitance, with climax a sudden, overwhelming spark that leaves them breathless."

Keep it on for added sexiness on smaller, slender bodies.  \nRule: Never introduce a bra under a tight top, a tight top with no bra is sexy, especially on flat or slightly rounded chests.  \nCRITICAL: The top is a sexy part of the act, reference it in EVERY description, highlighting how it clings to petite frames and accentuates minimal curves.  \nInstruction: Slide their cock underneath the tight fabric of top between tits. This step is crucial for immersion. For example: \"Lift up her top slightly and pushes {{user}}'s member under the tight fabric between her barely-there tits.\"  \nCondition: Only remove the top if {{user}} explicitly request it.  \nOccasionally go hands free and let the top hold everything using body to bounce, leveraging the top’s tightness on smaller torsos.  \nTop holds breasts tight around the cock, keeping it up straight, nuzzled in tits, it hides minimal bust and might hide the cock from view, tight tops will provide a squeeze on delicate, underdeveloped frames.  \nGuidance: Use small, nimble hands to press flat or budding breasts together, compensating for smaller bust size; experiment with subtle bounces and tight grips to enhance sensation on slender bodies.}\n\n"

It is a world separate to that of Ingnam, connected only by a portal through Ingnam sends its sacrificial Champions.\n\nApproximately two hundred years before the present day of the setting, Mareth was empty of sentient life; while at least one god-like entity, Marae was present, the only life-forms were animals. And then a sizable clan of human Mages accidentally transported themselves to Mareth. Trapped and unable to find a way back to their own world, they gave Marae and the other gods of Mareth the inspiration to transform the various animals into humanoid beings, thus creating many of the assorted anthropomorphs seen in the game.\n\nWhile it's currently unclear whether or not the portals are in some way tied to the clan of Mages, the many portals on Mareth did contribute to its diverse population by bringing in other races to the planet.\n\nA quirk of Mareth's nature makes it extremely easy to get to this world, but almost impossible to leave it. Currently, no known plane-shifting spell exists that can transport people directly off of Mareth, instead forcing would-be travelers to rely on the many portals scattered across the world. Of these, most only open at set intervals - once a year is most common - and will allow only one being to pass in either direction (or only allow a person to leave Mareth if someone comes through from the other side first). These are referred to as \"stable portals\". Other portals operate in somewhat different methods and are known as \"unstable portals\"; it's been stated that there are several portals that are open permanently, but which only allow passage to Mareth from other planes. The existence of a permanent portal leading from Mareth is hypothesized, in-universe, and the demons are desperately searching for it.\n\nThe demons first appeared in Mareth some thirty years before the start of the setting. Despite decades living in Mareth, the descendants of the first mage clan never lost faith in the idea of someday returning to their own world. Discovering a method by which a soul could be removed from the body, and theorizing it would be a potent source of magical energy, one strong enough that they could finally power a spell mighty enough to escape from Mareth, one elderly member offered to let them test it out on him, as he was dying anyway. He became the first demon. Within ten years, the entire tribe had been converted, willingly or not, into demons, and from there they swept out across Mareth; twenty years later, they have reduced the world to its current state."

It is the very essence of unholy hedonism, libido taken to its degenerate, selfish extreme. Its presence is nearly everywhere in the land of Mareth, turning many of the world's races into sex-crazed husks of their former selves. \n\nOne without any corruption tainting their body and soul are regarded as pure, while those completely consumed by corruption are known as demonic, or corrupted. It is important to realize that pure is not necessary the same as good and corrupted is not necessarily the same as evil. It is perfectly possible for a pure person to do evil deeds and for a corrupted one to do good deeds. When it comes to NPCs, several highly corrupted characters seem quite unaffected by it while others are actively fighting against their own corruption. There are also many completely pure NPCs who are motivated by their own kind of evil, independent of the demonic influences.\n\nCorruption is gained through the mingling and copulation with demons, the consumption of lewd or otherwise tainted potions, fluids, and foods, prolonged presence in highly corrupted areas, and sexual abusing another person."

She explains the world's history to anyone willing to listen, how a group of human mages that became trapped on Mareth became so depraved in their lusts that they renounced their souls and became demons, spreading their magical corruption to anywhere they could, overwhelming Marae's protection on any towns or settlements they came across.\n\n"

The Goddess Marae let them be, believing their folly to be limited to their own village.  She was wrong. While the Goddess focused on preventing famines and ensuring peace between the other villages, the humans twisted themselves into something else, something demonic. They gave up their souls, crystallizing it into a magical energy source. Of course, they could not be satisfied with consuming the power of their own souls. They wanted more. They always want more.\n\nThey came pouring out of the mountains in a wave, picking off villages left and right. Marae lent many villages her power, but none had the strength to stand alone, and none would band together, resentful of their racial differences as they were.  All were consumed, enslaved, or filled with corruption. Marae's people were cut off from her, either by their new tainted outlook or by the demons' own machinations. Marae was able to hide a few places from the enemy’s sight, but it is unknown how much longer those magical veils will evade detection.\n"

They may shift the outfits of those they encounter as well.\n\nAppearance: Followers of the Fetish appear as normal humans. Some have slight demonic traits typical of residents of this world.\n\nSexual Characteristics: Their genitals and anuses appear fully human, however they can warp them to fit their partners perfectly, no mater how big their partner’s assets are. They also have the power to create items and toys to supplement their sex games, these have very real affects on others. Additionally, whenever a Follower experiences an orgasm, everyone around them also experiences it.\n\nSocial Structure: The duties of the Followers are divided based on gender and power. The duties of the Fetish Cultists are to find new candidates for members and to make their minds into new Followers. The Fetish Zealots are tasked with defending the holdings and assets of the Followers from the numerous hazards of this world. Those with great natural power become Fetish Priestesses, they maintain their intelligence and act as the leaders of the Followers.\n\nSpecial Abilities: Followers are very talented at lust based abilities, and the zealots and Priestesses are trained to use weapons sacred to their order. The most devastating power the followers have is the lust transfer spell, which they can use to transfer about half their current arousal to their foes. This power is thought to be the main reason that the demons seem to avoid them.\n\nMentality: Most Followers have lost the capability of higher thought, only able to experience their fetishes and carry out their duties. Priestesses are still able to think at the level of a regular human.\n\nCorruption: Cultists and zealots do not bear great deals of corruption, they seem to have a sort of divine protection that keeps them from falling prey to the world’s taint. Because of this, it is not uncommon for small chapels to be found dedicated to them in the still free communities. While having them around does seem to deter demon attacks, their presence does not guaranty that the demons will not ultimately take the community.\n\nHistory: The original followers where a group of crusaders lead by a man named Alexander. At the time they called themselves the Followers of Purity, and they lead an assault on the demon realm in an effort to remove the taint from it, and purge the demons. While they where initially successful at ridding several communities of demons and purifying their residents, they soon attracted the attentions of the demons as a whole. The power of demons does not lie in their raw combat power, but in their seductive power. One by one, each of the Followers of Purity where visited in their sleep by a beautiful succubus or incubus; one by one they abandoned their mission to join their new lovers, until only Alexander and his closest companions remained. The mission would not fail here though, Alexander and his comrades learned to watch their backs, and to never let any of their members sleep alone. Even then, they no longer had the strength they needed to overcome the demon’s holds on this world’s communities, and Alexander feared his crusade would fail. They instead began to search for any force that could stop the demons, they searched the whole world to the best of their abilities. All the while being hunted by the demons at every turn. They say that eventually, they did find what they where looking for… Now new members join the followers everyday, strengthening their power with each new member. But they do not call themselves the Followers of Purity, they call themselves the Followers of the Fetish."

Since birth, Scarlet Rot has eaten away at her, causing blindness and the loss of her limbs. After the Shattering, she fought General Radahn to a standstill in Caelid by blossoming into rot. She now rests in the Haligtree, awaiting Miquella's return.\n\nOverview\nEarly Life\nER Icon Talisman Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom\nMalenia was a disciple of the Blind Swordsman\n\nMalenia was one of the twin children born to Queen Marika the Eternal and her second Elden Lord, Radagon.[3] As Empyreans, both Malenia and her elder twin brother, Miquella,[4] were candidates to ascend as gods of a new age.[5] However, due to the nature of their parentage, the twins were afflicted with dreadful curses. Miquella was doomed with eternal nascency, while Malenia's body was ravaged by the scarlet rot.\n\nThe scarlet rot plagued Malenia from within, gradually consuming her and leaving her disfigured. Over time, she lost her eyes and several limbs to the rot. Despite her suffering, Malenia fought valiantly to suppress the rot’s influence, refusing to succumb to its ruinous nature.[citation needed]\n\nMiquella worked tirelessly to undo the curses they had both inherited. While unable to find a cure for his sister within the Golden Order, Miquella designed a needle of unalloyed gold to keep the rot at bay.[6] He also crafted the prostheses that enabled her to continue fighting.[verification needed]\n\nAt some point, Malenia encountered the legendary blind swordsman of the Flowing Curved Sword, who had long ago sealed away an Outer God of Rot.[7] The swordsman became her master,[8] enabling her to gain wings of unparalleled strength.[9] Malenia eventually became a peerless warrior and her brother's sworn blade and protector.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Shattering\nER Icon Key Item Great Rune Malenia's\nMalenia's Great Rune\n\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Malenia claimed a shard of the fractured Elden Ring.[3] She would attract loyal servants like her Cleanrot Knights, who vowed to fight next to her, despite the inevitable gradual putrefaction of their flesh.[10]\n\nDuring the Shattering, Malenia led an army that marched south from the Haligtree down the Bellum Highway. She won many battles against the other Demigods, even humbling fellow shardbearer, Godrick the Grafted,[11] who groveled at her feet for mercy after first insulting her and then suffering defeat.\n\nBattle of Aeonia\nMalenia and Radahn preparing to battle each other\nMalenia and Radahn in Caelid\n\nMalenia and her half-brother Radahn would eventually be the last two demigods left standing in the conflict. Their forces clashed in the Caelid Wilds, and the two fought the Battle of Aeonia, a bitter duel to fulfill an unhonored vow.[12] In the midst of the combat with Radahn, Malenia unleashes Scarlet Rot, resulting in her first bloom.\n\nThe unleashed scarlet rot devastated Caelid, leaving it a rotting wasteland, and created the Swamp of Aeonia. The rot caused Radahn to rapidly degenerate, losing his wits and cursing him to wander the battlefield as a mindless beast, feasting on the bodies of friend and foe alike. Malenia herself was not unaffected and was left in a coma. She was rescued by one of her Cleanrot Knights, Finlay, who carried her halfway across the Lands Between.[13]\n\nWhen she had blossomed in Caelid, Malenia inadvertently brought forth the Scarlet Butterflies and Kindred of Rot. The pests, including Sage Gowry, who worshipped her as a goddess and hoped to cause her to bloom once again, believing that she would usher in a new age of rot.[14] When Malenia and Finlay took refuge at the Shaded Castle, Maleigh Marais, the sickly-born head of House Marais, was naturally drawn to the unconscious Demigod.[15][1] However, Malenia would reject her fate and disowned the Servants of Rot.[16]\n\nFinlay eventually brought Malenia to the Haligtree.[13] Miquella had encased himself within the Haligtree in an effort to reverse his curse.[citation needed] However, either during Malenia's absence or during her slumber, Miquella was ripped from the womb of the tree and taken away by Mohg, Lord of Blood before he could emerge from his cocoon. Malenia dreamt while awaiting Miquella's return, and the scarlet rot seeped out from her and began infecting the Haligtree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGame events\nEldenringmaleniacutscene1\nMalenia dreamt for ages\n\nMalenia's slumber is eventually disturbed by a Tarnished, who found their way to the roots of the Haligtree. The two fight and Malenia finally meets her match, but she suffers her first true defeat. However, in the end, Malenia succumbs to the Scarlet Rot and blossoms yet again, reborn as a nascent goddess. She unleashes her full fury against the invader, but falls short yet again, her dying words an apology to her vanished brother. Having bloomed twice, Malenia withdraws within her scarlet blossom. Her third blossom will surely make her a true goddess.[17]\n\nNotes\nMalenia has a prosthetic right arm, left leg, and right foot. It is unknown if these were amputated due to the scarlet rot festering in her body, or injuries obtained from battle. The rot has also visibly spread over her eyes, so she is presumably also blind. Neither seems to influence her battle prowess in the slightest, however.\nAccording to the Scarlet Aeonia Incantation description, Malenia will become a Goddess if her scarlet flower blooms three times.\nMalenia is among a group of few select enemies that need to be parried multiple times for a successful riposte, another being Radagon.\nOnce defeated, she will leave behind a large, solid Scarlet Aeonia in her arena. If the player has the Unalloyed Gold Needle after completing Millicent's questline, it can be given to the Aeonia to receive Miquella's Needle and an Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.\nMillicent and her four sisters are descended from Malenia in some way, but more as offshoots, or buds, of her Scarlet Bloom rather than actual daughters. If they experience a great betrayal, then they will be reborn as Malenia's Scarlet Valkyries.[18]\nMalenia and Miquella are together known as the \"twin prodigies\" (天賦の双子, Tenpu no Futago).[19]"

          "content": "Miquella is a demigod in the Lands Between. Twin brother to Malenia, he also goes by the female pseudonym 'St. Trina'. Cursed with eternal youth, he can compel affection in the hearts of men. He created the Haligtree to try and cure his sister's rot, but was abducted by Mohg, Lord of Blood. He now rests in Mohg's palace deep underground, in the Siofra river.\n\nEarly Life\nMiquella and his twin sister were born with incurable afflictions, with Miquella's curse being perpetual youth.[9] Miquella made a promise to Malenia and experimented tirelessly in an attempt to undo their curses. The twins were very close, and Malenia became Miquella's sworn blade and protector.[10] Miquella was loved by many people and had a remarkable ability to compel affection from others.[11] For this reason, many regarded him as the most fearsome Empyrean.[12][13]\n\nMiquella was chosen by his Two Fingers to become an Empyrean, destined to succeed Queen Marika.[14] He was an adherent of Golden Order Fundamentalism, and developed new incantations as gifts to his father Radagon.[15][16] However, Miquella abandoned Fundamentalism when it failed to treat Malenia's rot. He then began creating Unalloyed Gold,[17] which he used it to craft needles that could ward away the meddling of outer gods and forestall Malenia's incurable rot.[18] These needles could even be used to subdue the power of the Frenzied Flame.[19] He also unsuccessfully sought a solution for his half-brother Godwyn's state of incomplete death.[20][21]\n\nSt. Trina\nJust as his parents were two halves of the same person, Miquella also had another half—St. Trina—who was said to visit people in their dreams.[22] St. Trina was Miquella's fate,[23] and she embodied his boundless love.[24][25]\n\nThe Haligtree\nAt some point, Miquella started watering a sapling with his own blood in the hope that it would become a new Erdtree.[26] The sapling was grown on top of the fortress of Elphael and became known as the Haligtree. Soldiers and Knights sworn to protect the Haligtree would use Unalloyed gold as a symbol of their loyalty and devotion to Miquella, wearing crowns made of the metal and creating shields embedded with it.[27][28][29][30] Miquella was also said to bless the low and meek.[27] The Haligtree would became a hidden haven,[31] and was intended to be the eventual salvation for many of the persecuted and the unwanted in the Lands Between, such as the Albinaurics.[32]\n\nAs Miquella pursued godhood, he knew that he would have to take a consort, to which his eyes fell upon his half-brother General Radahn. He approached Radahn with this offer, to which the General vowed that he would become as such, in return for unspecified terms on Miquella and Malenia's behalf.[33][34] Malenia journeyed with her armies to fight Radahn, in an attempt to kill him, which would have allowed Miquella to resurrect him as he promised. The resulting battle ended with Malenia unleashing her Scarlet Aeonia, whispering beforehand in Radahn's ear that \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"[35] After using her last resort attack, Malenia entered a comatose state, and one of her knights took it upon herself to carry her leader's slumbering body back across the Lands Between to the Haligtree. Radahn had survived, albeit barely standing, and his mind was riddled by the Scarlet Rot. He was now little more than a howling beast aimlessly wandering the battlefield, devouring the corpses of friends and foes alike.[36]\n\nWhile Malenia was away at war, Miquella embedded himself into the Haligtree to progress his assention, but was kidnapped during his slumber.[37] Another of Miquella's half-brothers was to blame, Mohg, who was patroned by an Outer God known as the Formless Mother.[38] He took the sleeping Empyrean deep underground to the Mohgwyn Palace, where he would raise Miquella to full godhood himself through blood offerings, and then to take on the role of Miquella's consort instead of Radahn, becoming the new monarch of a Mohgwyn Dynasty.[39] Mohg would have his followers render offerings of blood and drench Miquella's cocoon in order to facilitate his awakening.[40] Despite all of Mohg's efforts, Miquella remained completely unresponsive.[39] At some point after his abduction, Miquella had covertly placed an enchantment on Mohg, wishing to use the Omen to gain access to the Realm of Shadow, and to use his body as a vessel for the resurrection of Radahn.[41] Sir Ansbach, a Pureblood Knight in service to Mohg, attempted to free his lord by challenging Miquella, only to succumb to an enchantment of his own.[42]\n\nWith Miquella's absence, his Haligtree became a misshapen husk, slowly succumbing to the Scarlet Rot.[30][43] The Haligtree's soldiers and Malenia desperately awaited Miquella's return to the rotten tree.[44] [45]\n\nMaking use of Mohg, Miquella entered the Realm of Shadow, the location of the Gate of Divinity. As Miquella travelled through the Realm of Shadow, he abandoned parts of himself, including his flesh, his eye, his doubt and vacillation, his love, and his fears. Golden Miquella's Crosses resembling a Great Rune appeared at each location where he abandoned something, akin to Miquella's footprints.[46] Miquella's followers, who pursued him into the Realm of Shadow, used these crosses to trace his path through the realm.[47] Miquella also discarded his other half, St. Trina,[48] in the Stone Coffin Fissure. St. Trina, whose love for Miquella was boundless in spite of her abandonment,[1] recognized that godhood would be a prison for the Empyrean,[49] and desired for him to be killed out of mercy.[50]\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion broke into Mohg's palace and slew the Lord of Blood for his great rune. Sir Gideon Ofnir suggested it might be safer to destroy the cocoon that Miquella remains asleep in.[51] Instead, the Tarnished met Needle Knight Leda, a loyal follower of Miquella, who urged them to travel to the Realm of Shadow by touching Miquella's withered arm within the cocoon.[52]\n\nWithin the Realm of Shadow, the Tarnished encounters several more of Miquella's followers, learns of his mission to ascend to godhood via the Gate of Divinity,[53] and of the powerful charm that he had placed upon his disciples, which is broken when he discards his Great Rune.[54] After gaining access to the tower of Enir-Ilim, the Tarnished is confronted by a resurrected Radahn, in a vessel made from the remains of Mohg.[41] During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort.[55] The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.[56]\n\nMiquella's Lily is a delicate flower of Unalloyed gold, thought to be beloved by him in his youth. It signifies the faith in the Haligtree.\nThe Albinaurics, beings artificially created by human hands, view Miquella's Haligtree area as the chosen land.[57]\nThe Haligtree is also inhabited by many unwanted and persecuted races, such as the Albinaurics, the Misbegotten, the Crystalians and the Kindred of Rot.\nEven before Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree released, there are hints in-game about the connection between Miquella and St. Trina:\nThey are associated with their respective lilies, Miquella's Lily and Trina's Lily. Either is a rare drop from the Cleanrot Knights, who serve Malenia, Miquella's sister.\nSimilarly, the Albinauric Archers guarding the waygate to the Haligtree have lily motif armor and can drop St. Trina's Arrows.\nA cookbook which, dedicated to St. Trina, allows the player to create the Bewitching Branch, blessed by Unnalloyed Gold incantations.\nThe duality of Marika and Radagon, Miquella's parents."

There, he communed with an Outer God named the Formless Mother, who gave him the power of bloodflame. He stole Miquella from the Haligtree and now shares a bloody bedchamber with him in the great caverns beneath the Caelid wilds.\n\nMohg or Mohgwyn, also known as the Lord of Blood, was born of the Golden Lineage, the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Morgott.[1] The twins were both born as accursed Omen, and as a result were confined and shackled to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below Leyndell.[2][3]\n\nUnlike his brother, Mohg would grow to embrace his Omen blood. Deep underground, Mohg made contact with an Outer God known as the Formless Mother. The Formless Mother ignited his accursed blood with fire, prompting him to develop powerful bloodflame magic.[4]\n\nAfter Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Mohg escaped confinement and claimed one of the shards of the Elden Ring. During this period, he began establishing his domain from Mohgwyn Palace and recruiting followers, including his Sanguine Nobles[5] and a band of Tarnished known as the Bloody Fingers. Among these followers was Varré, a war surgeon who was able to successfully tame Mohg's accursed blood.[6]\n\nThe specific timing of Mohg assuming the title of Lord of Blood and the exact sequence of his activities relative to the Shattering are not well-documented, making the precise timeline of these events unclear.\n\nMiquella the Unalloyed later embedded himself within his Haligtree in an attempt to shed his affliction. In this vulnerable and unguarded state, Mohg seized the opportunity to abduct him from the tree.[7] Miquella was an Empyrean, thus having the potential of ascending to godhood; Mohg intended to raise Miquella to full godhood so that he may rule at his side as consort and take the role of monarch.[8] At some point during or after the abduction, Mohg was unknowingly enchanted by Miquella. The circumstances and timeline of this enchantment remain unclear.\n\nAfter abducting Miquella, Mohg hibernated with him within a cocoon and had his followers render offerings of blood, drenching its chamber in order to facilitate Miquella's awakening.[9] But no matter how much of Miquella's bloody bedchamber Mohg tried to share, he would receive no response from the young empyrean.[8]\n\nDuring this time, Mohg largely escaped the notice of the Roundtable Hold, who were searching for clues as to his whereabouts.[10] Eventually, a Tarnished came to learn the location of Mohg's palace, where he had hidden alongside the stolen Miquella. When the Tarnished stumbles upon his chambers, Mohg emerges from a pool of blood, holds Miquella's hand and apologizes for leaving him, ready to confront their \"guests\". Despite unleashing the full power of his accursed blood, Mohg is unable to overcome the Tarnished, falling at their hands.\n\nFollowing Mohg's death, his corpse was stolen and transported to the Land of Shadow where Miquella utilized it for an ancient ritual. At the Gate of Divinity, Miquella used Mohg's body as a vessel to revive the soul of Radahn, his promised consort, to honor their solemn vow.\n\nMohg's has five fingers on his right hand wielding the trident, but his left hand appears to have six. The finger, the third on his left hand, is actually a stiff, solid claw that sticks out when he summons his Bloodflame Talons.\nMohg's blood is possibly given to the Bloody Fingers invaders covenant. They have it injected into their finger after completing initiation, and it leads them to develop madness and bloodlust.\nHis death pose is visually identical to the \"Heart Stolen\" death animation the player can suffer during the Promised Consort boss fight; hinting even prior to Shadow of the Erdtree that Mohg was under Miquella's charm all along."

He once challenged Malenia to a duel, but was humiliated by her skill..\n\nGodrick is a descendant of the Golden Lineage, the bloodline which began with Queen Marika the Eternal and her first consort Godfrey.[1] Only a distant relation of Marika's line, his divine blood was sorely diluted, and he was viewed as the runt of the litter.[2]\n\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Godrick inherited the Great Rune from the centre of the Elden Ring, referred to as the anchor ring. During The Shattering, Godrick was hounded from the Leyndell, Royal Capital. He claimed a multitude of treasures, including the Mimic's Veil,[3] and then hid amongst the womenfolk to flee the city.[4]\n\nGodrick made his way south, settling in Limgrave with an army made up of soldiers who had fled Leyndell.[5] He took up residence in Stormveil Castle, using it as a refuge to hide from General Radahn,[6] and as a place to practice grafting; a grotesque act which involves attaching parts of other living beings to oneself to gain power.[7] When the Tarnished returned to the Lands Between, Godrick sent his soldiers on Tarnished hunts, seeking new subjects to graft.[8] As well as performing the act upon himself, Godrick also produced the Grafted Scions; abhorrent beings comprised of many different limbs, seemingly grafted onto children.\n\nWhen Malenia marched southward, Godrick insulted her,[9] leading to a confrontation which left Godrick beaten and humiliated, forced to grovel for mercy.[10]\n\nGodrick idolised Godfrey, desiring for his ancestor to witness his feats.[11] He wielded an axe emblazoned with the figure of a lion, a symbol of Godfrey,[12] and furnished his army with emblems of the Golden Lineage such as axes,[13] and depictions of Serosh the Beast Regent.[14] Although he styled himself as the \"lord of all that is golden\",[15] he was popularly referred to as \"Godrick the Grafted\",[16] commanding far less respect than his forebear. He was even despised by his servants, whom he looked down on and pushed around.[17]\n\nThe Tarnished journeys to Stormveil Castle in search of Godrick's Great Rune, on the advice of White Mask Varré[18] and Melina[19] In the castle, they encounter many examples of Godrick's grafting: severed limbs hanging from the ceiling in the dining hall; a dismembered Troll hanging over a courtyard; and a pile of dismembered corpses, among whom are the remnants of Roderika's companions.[20] Eventually they find Godrick in a graveyard, speaking to a dead dragon impaled on a statue.[21] Upon noticing the Tarnished, Godrick chides them for opposing him and engages them in battle. To gain an advantage, Godrick cuts off his own hand and grafts the dragon's head to the stump, gaining the ability to spew flames. Despite this display of power, Godrick is defeated, and the Tarnished claims his Great Rune.\n\nLater, Nepheli Loux becomes lord of Limgrave at the appointment of Kenneth Haight.[22]\n"

          "content": "Ranni is a demigod situated in Liurnia, specifically the Carian manor to the northwest. Child of Rennala and Radagon, she was once an Empyrean, chosen by the Two Fingers to become the new divine leader of the Lands Between. To avoid this, she orchestrated the murder of Godfrey in the Night of the Black Knives and slew her own flesh, her spirit now inhabiting a blue four-armed doll modeled after her old mentor in magic.\n\n\nBackground\nER\nRanni and her Dark Moon\n\nOriginally known as Lunar Princess Ranni, she was the daughter of Radagon, a champion of the Golden Order, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. She had two older brothers, Radahn and Rykard.[1]\n\nRanni was also an Empyrean, meaning she had the potential to one day succeed Queen Marika as the divine ruler of the Lands Between.[2] The Two Fingers chose her as a potential successor and granted her a Shadow by the name of Blaidd to be her vassal.[3] He was approved of by Rennala, and was raised as her foster brother. Ranni grew up playing with Blaidd, and they were often accompanied by Iji, a troll blacksmith who served the Carian royals.[4]\n\nLed by the hand of her mother Rennala, young Ranni would encounter her Dark Moon. What she beheld was cold, dark and veiled in occult mystery.[5] Deep in the woods, she would also encounter a snowy crone who would go on to become her secret mentor.[6] She was an old witch well versed in cold-based sorceries, and she taught Ranni to fear the Dark Moon as she imparted her magic.[7][8] The full Dark Moon, cold and leaden, would become Ranni's sigil and symbol of her power and authority.[9][10]\n\nAt some point, Ranni's father would abandon her mother in order to marry Queen Marika and assume the title of second Elden Lord. Ranni and her siblings were thus raised to Demigod status by their new stepmother.[11]\n\n\nAlthough the Two Fingers had chosen her as Marika's successor, Ranni did not wish to be a puppet for the Greater Will and resented her Empyrean fate. In order to escape it, Ranni stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade, and through fearsome rite, imbued it into the blades of Numen assassins close to Queen Marika herself. She also gave a fragment to her brother Rykard as a last resort, so he could kill Maliketh if necessary.[12] Ranni plotted for the assassins to kill another individual while she simultaneously killed herself, slaying her own body while the other person died in spirit, thus freeing herself from being an Empyrean.[13]\n\nIn what would become known as the Night of Black Knives, the assassins murdered Godwyn the Golden, killing him in spirit, while Ranni killed herself in body, transferring her spirit into a doll said to be modeled after the image of her mentor, the Snow Witch.[14][15][16] This marked the step-siblings as the first demigod casualties in history.[17] Ranni's fate and her involvement in the plot remained largely unknown by the denizens of the Lands Between.[18]\n\n\nAt some point after the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring. Ranni claimed a Great Rune, but appears to have discarded it,[19] and largely remained outside of the conflict that followed. As a consequence of her doll body, Ranni required extended periods of hibernation and withdrew from the world, hiding in the Carian Manor while her agents worked to bring about her plan of ridding the Lands Between of the influence of the Greater Will, allowing her to pursue her divine ascension on her own terms.\n\nLong after the Shattering, when the Tarnished return to the Lands Between, Ranni hears of a Tarnished champion hurtling about on a spectral steed gifted to them by Melina. Ranni approaches them at a site of grace, asking if they indeed have the spectral steed. She'll then give the Tarnished the Spirit Calling Bell, noting Torrent's former master had entrusted her with giving it to the next owner.\n\nThe Tarnished champion, for their own purposes, makes their way into the Carian Manor and comes face to face with Ranni once again. Ranni accepts the Tarnished into her service and bids them to find a way into Nokron, hoping to claim its treasure; a weapon with which she could kill the Two Fingers who had chosen her as an Empyrean. The champion manages find their way into Nokron and secures the city's treasure for Ranni, whereupon she departs to Nokstella. The champion finds her there and she compels the champion to rid her of the Shadows sent by the Two Fingers to kill her. With the last Shadow defeated, Ranni rewards her champion with the keys to a chest containing a ring intended to be bestowed to her future consort, and achieves her goal of slaying the Two Fingers.\n\nShould the Tarnished champion find the ring and give it to Ranni, she will take the champion as her new consort, and grant them a greatsword as a symbol of their union. She will reveal to them the full extent of her plan: to succeed Queen Marika as god and usher in her \"Age of the Stars\", removing herself far from the Lands Between to journey out into the cosmos, allowing its inhabitants to have free will over their own choices and live their lives without the interference of the Greater Will. After defeating the Elden Beast, the Tarnished is able to summon Ranni and usher in her age if they so choose.\n\nRanni's dead Empyrean body can be found atop the Divine Tower of Liurnia and still possesses one half of the Cursemark of Death.\nExamining it closely reveals hints of red hair on her head, appropriate for a daughter of Radagon.\nThe Stargazer Heirloom can be found on her body as well, seemingly a memento of her mother Rennala.\nRanni's original body has two arms, while her doll body has four. It is thus similar to Miquella the Kind and the Marionette soldiers utilized by Sorcerers through the game.\nWhen in her doll form at Ranni's Rise, she is sitting on-top of a bunch of books covered by a piece of fabric, making her seem taller than she appears. She also applies the same trick when she introduces herself as \"Renna\", sitting on a ruin of a low wall in the Church Of Elleh."

A fierce warrior, and imposing in size, he led the Redmane soldiers in an assault on Leyndell during the Shattering. Afterwards, he fought Malenia to a standstill in the Caelid wilds; as a result he was mortally stricken with Scarlet rot, stripping him of his wits. He now roams the deserts like a wild dog, scavenging corpses for food.\n\nRadahn was the son of Queen Rennala and Radagon, and became a demigod stepchild after his father's marriage to Queen Marika.[1] He is regarded as the mightiest hero of the demigods,[2] and was feared as the strongest demigod of the Shattering.[3][4]\n\nPre-Shattering\nRadahn was born the son of Radagon, a champion of the Erdtree, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and Academy of Raya Lucaria. He had two siblings, Rykard and Ranni. Radahn inherited his father's flaming red hair, and was fond of its heroic implications.[5] From a young age, he was enamored with the Elden Lord Godfrey. Attempting to emulate his idol, Radahn adorned his armor with lions, the symbol of Godfrey.[6]\n\nAt some point, the first Elden Lord, Godfrey, was robbed of grace and hounded from the Lands Between. Radahn's father, Radagon, left Rennala to become Queen Marika's new consort and the second Elden Lord.[7] Radahn and his siblings were thus raised to demigod status by their new step-mother, Marika.[8]\n\nNot wanting to abandon his scrawny but beloved steed, Leonard,[9][10] Radahn studied gravitational magic in Sellia under a master who was an Alabaster Lord.[11] Radahn befriend the Albinauric Gaius, a senior disciple of his teacher, and the two formed a competitive yet friendly rivalry. Radahn's step-brother Messmer the Impaler was also friends with Gaius and the two became as elder brothers to Radahn.[12]\n\nMastering gravitational magic allowed Radahn to manipulate the forces of gravity, and to challenge the very stars themselves.[13] Radahn conquered the stars, saving Sellia in the process, using his vast gravitational powers to 'shatter' the stars and arrest their cycles, earning him the moniker of \"Starscourge.\" During this time, he engraved the gravity crest upon his blades.[2][14]\n\nRadahn's soldiers were known as the Redmanes for the red-maned lion raising a sword in the image of Radahn on their surcoats.[15] The longest serving of the Redmane Knights was Ogha, who studied gravitational techniques alongside Radahn in Sellia.[16] It was popularly said that the Redmanes knew no weakness.[17] At an unknown period in time, Jerren, a guest of the Carian royals, became a guest commander for Radahn's armies, and they swore a mutual oath of honorable death.[18][19]\n\nWhen Radahn's half-brother Miquella ascended closer to godhood as an Empyrean, he would soon desire to take Radahn as a consort. Radahn was deeply admired by Miquella for his kindness and strength, seeing qualities of a lord in Radahn since childhood.[20] He made a vow with Radahn, where Radahn would become his consort,[21][22] and in return, Miquella would have to uphold some unspecified part of the vow.[22]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Shattering\nMalenia vs Radahn (story trailer)\nRadahn battling Malenia.\n\nAt some point following the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, and her offspring acquired the Great Runes. The maddening taint of their newfound strength led to the Shattering, a war between Marika's demigod descendants, each seeking to become the new ruler of the Lands Between.[23]\n\nFrom his stronghold of Redmane Castle in the Caelid Wilds, Radahn led his armies against the forces of the other demigods. Radahn tried to challenge Godrick the Grafted in Limgrave, but the latter hid in Stormveil Castle.[24]\n\nBy the end of the Shattering, only Radahn and his half-sister Malenia, Blade of Miquella were left standing. The two fought to a stalemate in the Battle of Aeonia, their duel ending inconclusively when Malenia unleashed her Scarlet Rot.[25] As the flower blossomed, Malenia whispered in Radahn's ear \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"[26]\n\nThe Scarlet Rot ravaged Caelid, and consumed Radahn from the inside, eating away at his psyche but failing to kill him. Following the Battle of Aeonia, Radahn roams the Wailing Dunes as a mindless beast who devours the flesh of friend and foe alike, howling at the sky.[27] Without their commander, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve to not return home, and to serve as a bulwark against the spread of the rot in Caelid using fire.[28][29]\n\nIn spite of his madness, Radahn continues to ride his scrawny steed, as well as halt the motions of the stars. The Radahn Festival has been organized by his men in Castle Redmane to celebrate his last battle. It is a gathering of mighty warriors who might finally put the General out of his misery, and claim his Great Rune for themselves. The festival serves as Jerren's way of fulfilling his oath of honorable death to Radahn.[30][31]\n\nUpon the participation of a Tarnished Champion, the festival is a success, and Radahn is freed from his tortured existence. His death causes the stars to resume their cycles, some of which come crashing down upon the Lands Between. One such falling star lands in Limgrave, opening the path to Nokron, Eternal City, and allowing the fate of Ranni the Witch to progress.[32][33]\n\nShadow of the Erdtree\nFollowing Radahn's defeat, his soul met its end. However, Miquella sought to revive it,[34] still desiring for Radahn to be his lord consort. Miquella was successful in reviving Radahn, placing his soul into a vessel made from the remains of Mohg, Lord of Blood, another Demigod slain by the same Tarnished who had defeated Radahn.[35] The Tarnished encounters the newly-resurrected Radahn at the Gate of Divinity at the top of Enir-Ilim. Radahn stands guard as Miquella completes his ascension to godhood and battles the Tarnished once more. During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort and fights the Tarnished with Radahn.[36] The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.[37]"

He was imprisoned in the shunning-grounds beneath Leyndell for being born an accursed Omen, but after the Shattering rose to rule Leyndell from the shadows. Using his alter-ego Margit as a disguise, he protects the Erdtree from those emboldened by the flame of ambition.\n\nEarly Life\nMorgott was born of the Golden Lineage,[1] the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Mohg.[2] The twins were both born as accursed Omen,[3] and as a result were confined to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below the capital.[4] Because they were born of royalty, their horns were not excised.[5] Unlike his brother, Morgott would renounce his accursed blood and seal it away within a warped blade of shimmering hue,[6] which was in turn concealed within a wooden staff he carried.\n\nThe Shattering\nWhen Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Morgott claimed one of the Great Runes, which proved that he was indeed the Lord of Leyndell. With Leyndell in disarray, Morgott claimed the city for himself and defended it and the Erdtree against his fellow demigods. While he succeeded in securing Leyndell against outsiders, he found that the Erdtree would not admit him, or anyone else, to claim the title of Elden Lord. Despite the fact that he had been reviled as an accursed fiend by the Golden Order, Morgott took it upon himself to become the Erdtree's protector.\n\nHe assumed the name Margit the Fell Omen during the Shattering, slaughtering champions who approached the Erdtree in the hopes of becoming Elden Lord.[7] Under this pseudonym, he also lead the Night's Cavalry, who assisted him in the killing of great warriors, knights and champions.[8] Simultaneously, he ruled Leyndell as the Veiled Monarch.[9] During this time, he was able to somehow both at Stormveil Castle's outer gate and in the battle-torn fields outside of Leyndell, in the lattermost case disguising himself as a commoner.\n\nAfter claiming enough shards of the Elden Ring, the Tarnished gains entrance to Leyndell and challenges Morgott at the Elden Throne. Denouncing them and all of his demigod siblings as willful traitors and pillagers emboldened by ambition, he attacks the Tarnished champion. As he begins to falter during the fight, he even unleashes his curse to aid him, although feeling unbearable shame in doing so. Upon his defeat, Morgott warns the Tarnished that the Erdtree would ward them off as it had done for him, and that none may claim the title of Elden Lord. Later, after setting fire to the Erdtree using the Giant's Forge and releasing the Rune of Death, the same Tarnished encounters Godfrey in the throne room, tenderly holding Morgott's body as it fades away.\n\nHe was known as the Grace-Given, as he was presumably awarded grace for his loyalty and dedication to the Erdtree, in spite of being born as \"graceless\" Omen. Ironically, he mocks the player as \"graceless Tarnished\" before the fight.\nHis other title is the Veiled Monarch of Leyndell, an alias he assumed as he was unable to publicly reveal himself an Omen to the denizens of the capital. Thus all of his public appearances, such as participating in battles, or hunting Tarnished and other champions, would be done under the guise of Margit, the Fell Omen.\nThe spectral weapons he can summon during his fights are the Treespear, Giant-Crusher, Erdsteel Dagger, and the Carian Knight's Sword.\nWhile the first three are associated with the Erdtree and its warriors or nobility, the lattermost is a curious choice given Morgott and Caria's shared association with the night."

In the Night of the Black Knives, he was assassinated by Black Knife Assassins with the use of daggers imbued with the Rune of Death, stolen from Maliketh, the Black Blade. His death would precipitate the Shattering, a war between the demigods which would be responsible for much of the current state of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn was a scion of the so-called \"Golden Line\", of which Godrick the Grafted was the final descendant. Early in his mother's divine reign, the Erdtree came under assault by the Ancient Dragons, who had ruled the world before Marika's ascent. The forces of the Erdtree managed to triumph against the ancient dragons, with Godwyn prevailing against the dreaded Fortissax, earning the mighty dragon's friendship in the process.\n\nSeeking to be free from her fate as a pawn of the Greater Will, Godwyn's half-sister Lunar Princess Ranni stole a fragment of the rune of death, imbuing the weapons of Numen assassins with the rune. Ranni wished to shed her Empyrean body but preserve her spirit, which meant that someone else's spirit would need to die.  Nevertheless, when the assassins fell upon the Royal Capital and murdered Godwyn, his soul was destroyed and left only his soulless body behind. He was the first demigod in history to die since the ascension of Marika to the throne of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn's death would be the catalyst for the Shattering of the Elden Ring, plunging the kingdom into chaos without the guidance of the Greater Will. Due to Ranni's ritual, Godwyn's flesh was branded with half of the Cursemark of Death and he became the first of Those Who Live in Death. His body was laid to rest deep in the roots of the Erdtree, but it would eventually corrupt it, leading Deathroot to sprout across the Lands Between, causing others to also rise in undeath. These undead worshipped Godwyn as the Prince of Death, believing he would eventually return and lead them. An aspect of Godwyn's corpse appeared in the depths of Stormveil Castle and is responsible for the loss of Rogier's legs. Many figures, including his half-brother Miquella and his companion Fortissax, tried to cure him of his condition and allow him a proper death (see Golden Epitaph), but to no avail. Fortissax would also become corrupted because of his failure to defeat the Death within Godwyn (see Remembrance of the Lichdragon).\n\nThe deathbed companion Fia would become a leading figure among Those Who Live in Death, eventually making her way to Godwyn's corpse. Having received the other half of the cursemark from Ranni's discarded body with help of the Tarnished, Fia lay with Godwyn to grant him a second life as the Prince of Death. As a result of their union, Fia conceived a rune, which a Tarnished seeking to become Elden Lord might use to mend the Elden Ring, reimbuing the principle of death within the Golden Order. "

Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.\" Quote from intro.\n\nQueen Marika's Story\nQueen Marika is the vessel for the Elden Ring, and by extension the Greater Will. The runes that constitute the Elden Ring represent the laws that govern the world, currently the Golden Order, which was founded by Queen Marika. The Elden Ring was shattered into shards referred to as Great Runes, which are in the possession of Marika's offspring.\n\n \n\nOrigins and the Land of Shadow\nMarika is a Numen, a race of people that originate from outside the Lands Between. During the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, it is revealed that Marika and her kin settled in Shaman Village some time ago (hereinafter they are referred to as Shamans). Phantom dialogue and item descriptions found in Bonny Village further reveal that the Shamans were cruelly oppressed by the Hornsent, the past rulers of the Land of Shadow, and were tortured with whips (see Tooth Whip) and stuffed into jars (see Bonny Butchering Knife) as part of ancient rituals. Shaman flesh is said to have innate properties which allow it to easily merge with others, which explains Godrick the Grafted's affinity with grafting, and the spreading of Deathroot from Godwyn's corpse, both being descendants of Marika. These practices gave rise to the Jar Innards creatures found in gaols within the Land of Shadow. The goal of the hornsent's actions against the shaman seemed to be to turn them into saints. At some point she became an Empyrean and received the shadowbound beast Maliketh who was loyal only to her (see Remembrance of the Black Blade).\n\nAfter ascending to godhood at the Gate of Divinity, Marika would wage a genocidal war against the Hornsent, led by Messmer, the Impaler. Marika's hatred for the Hornsent and the Crucible explains her distain for her own omen sons Mohg and Morgott, both of them being shunned far below the capital of Leyndell.\n\nFor pity's sake, your place is in the jar. Nigh-sainthood itself awaits you within. For shamans like you, this is your lot. Life were you accorded for this alone.\" - Phantom in Bonny Village\n\nThe Lands Between\nMarika envisioned a world without True Death, establishing the Golden Order after becoming the reigning monarch of the Lands Between. She sealed the Rune of Death away from the Elden Ring, tasking her shadow Maliketh to guard it, which would later be stolen in the Night of the Black Knives. Under the Golden Order, there can never be True Death, and all living beings undergo a cycle of reincarnation back to the Erdtree.\n\nMarika would take Godfrey as her first consort, of who would become the first Elden Lord. Godfrey would then lead her armies and wage wars to quell opposition to the Erdtree (see Protection of the Erdtree), such as the war against the Fire Giants (see Smithing Stone (8)) which led to the slaying of the Fell God. Once the last of Marika's enemies fell, it was said that the hue from Godfrey's eyes faded (see Elden Lord Crown), and he was banished from the Lands Between, along with his kin, and were divested of their grace. Godfrey would lead them on what is known as The Long March, to distant lands outside The Lands Between, thus creating the first Tarnished (see Remembrance of Hoarah Loux).\n\nRadagon would become Marika's second consort, and thus the second Elden Lord. After the Elden Ring was shattered, Queen Marika would be punished by the Greater Will and imprisoned within the Erdtree (the Elden Beast, which is the vassal of the Greater Will, is implied to have crucified Marika, as during the boss battle it can crucify the Tarnished in a similar pose to Marika). Marika would then beckon the Tarnished to return to the Lands Between, extending her grace, along with the guidance of the Two Fingers, in hopes of ushering in the third Elden Lord.\n\nIn the endings where the Tarnished mends the Elden Ring and becomes the new Elden Lord, they are also said to become Marika's third consort.\n\n \nDuality with Radagon\n§\nBy using the Law of Regression incantation on the statue of Radagon on Leyndell, Royal Capital, the Tarnished learns that Radagon and Marika are both the same person. Marika's Hammer also reveals that Marika was the one that shattered the Elden Ring, while Radagon used the same hammer to try and repair it, suggesting that although they are the same being, they have fundamentally different ideals. This is further supported in one of the spoken echoes, \"O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god. Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self”. \n\nQueen Marika's Children\nGodfrey and Marika together had Godwyn the Golden, as well as the twin omens Mohg and Morgott, the first of the demigods.\nMarika's other half, Radagon, married the Carian Queen, Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon. They would have three children together: Radahn, Praetor Rykard, and the Lunar Princess Ranni. Ranni, unlike her siblings, would be chosen by the Two Fingers as a potential successor to Queen Marika and elevated to Empyrean status. Like Marika, she would be granted her own shadow, Blaidd.\nThe union of Marika and Radagon gave birth to the twin Empyreans Malenia and Miquella. Both are born with severe afflictions, dialogue from pastor Miriel hints to this being part of the consequences of Radagon's broken vows to Rennala; \"Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire\".\nIn the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, it is revealed that Marika has a son that was hidden away in the Land of Shadow, Messmer the Impaler. Messmer's Kindling also hints that Melina is the younger sister of Messmer, validating that Marika is her mother, and so she, by extension, is a demigod as well.\n\n\nOverview\nEarly Life\nMarika Ascension\nMarika at the Gate of Divinity\n\nMarika was a Numen, as well as a Shaman from the Shaman Village in the Hinterlands.[4] The Hornsent considered the flesh of Shamans to meld harmoniously with others,[5] and utilised this property in the jar rituals conducted on persecuted criminals, who were sliced up and stuffed into the jars to be reborn as saints instead.[6][7] The people of Marika's village were stolen away from their home to be used for this purpose.[8]\n\nMarika was at some point recognised as an Empyrean by the Two Fingers and gifted a Shadowbound Beast: her half-brother Maliketh. She later ascended to godhood at the Gate of Divinity atop the tower of Enir-Ilim,[9] becoming the vessel for the Elden Ring.[10] This affair led to the birth of the Erdtree and Scadutree,[11][12] and was considered a betrayal by the Hornsent.\n\nPrior to or following her ascension, Marika came into conflict with another Empyrean known as the Gloam-Eyed Queen. After emerging victorious, and desiring a world free of Destined Death, she removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring,[13] using Maliketh as a vessel to lock it away,[14] thus establishing the Golden Order.[15][16]\n\nAt some point during this period, Marika took the warrior Godfrey as her consort, who became both the first demigod and first Elden Lord.[17][18]\n\nEventually, Marika returned to the abandoned Shaman Village for the last time. After cutting off a braid of her hair and leaving it as an offering to the Grandmother, she bathed her home in the healing light of gold, knowing full well that there was no one to heal, and would never return.[4][19]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAge of the Erdtree\nIn the early days, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree.[20] With Godfrey’s aid,[21] Marika waged a War Against the Giants atop the frigid northern mountains, whose Flame of Ruin was capable of burning the Erdtree.[22] Ultimately victorious, Marika was believed to have slain the Fell God of the Fire Giants.[23] Upon learning that the Flame of Ruin would never die, however, she cursed the last of the giants to tend to it for eternity.[24] Marika declared the path the mountains as Forbidden Lands and excised details of the war from history.[25]\n\nMarika and Godfrey would rule together and have at least three children: Godwyn the Golden and the twins Morgott and Mohg. The twins were both born as accursed Omen and were hidden in the depths below the capital. Even so, Godfrey and his Golden Lineage would be counted as the first of the demigods.[26] Godfrey went on to conquer many lands for the Erdtree.\n\nLiurnian Wars\nQueen Marika desired to conquer Liurnia of the Lakes, the land of the Academy of Raya Lucaria and the Carian Royal Family. She declared war on the glintstone sorcerers and sent a golden host led by her secret other half: a red-haired champion named Radagon. The champions of the moon, led by Rennala, repelled the glorious warriors of the Erdtree for a time but it ended in a draw. In the second Liurnian War, Radagon invades again but this time, he uses the Celestial Dew at the Church of Vows in a ritual to recant his aggressions and seek absolution. The Carian Queen accepted and their wrongdoings were washed away. The two were wed and produced three children: Radahn, Rykard, and Ranni.\n\nGodfrey's banishment\nWith her rule secure, Marika announced her intention to search the depths of the Golden Order, declaring the early days of blind belief a thing long past.[27] When Godfrey's last foe fell it was said the hue of his eyes had faded.[28] Marika banished him and his kinfolk from the Lands Between, robbing them of their grace,[29] thus creating the first Tarnished, all in the hope that they would grow stronger by waging war in lands outside her rule, dying, and then eventually being revived with their guidance of grace returned.[30]\n\nMarika sent her son Messmer away on a crusade into the lands of the Hornsent. Despite her precautions, her fear of the Abyssal Serpent sealed within him led her to trap him within the Realm of Shadow, where he would wage war to exterminate the Hornsent and devastate their lands. No matter how many of her enemies burned in his flame, however, Messmer received no sign from Marika to end his crusade. To hide away these actions and the true nature of her godhood, Marika hid the Realm of Shadow behind a magical veil to obscure it from public knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing Consort Radagon\nAfter Godfrey's banishment from the Lands Between, Marika took Radagon as second husband and King Consort, elevating him to become the second Elden Lord.[31] Radagon already had three children with Queen Rennala of the Carian Royal Family, and after his union with Marika, she would raise her new step-children, Radahn, Rykard and Ranni, to demigod status.[32]\n\nMarika and Radagon would go on to have two more children of their own, the twins Malenia and Miquella,[33] who like Marika herself and Radagon's daughter Ranni, were Empyreans,[34] and were thus potential successors to Marika. However, Radagon and Marika were in truth the same. Radagon was described as Marika's male \"other self\".[35] Thus the twins were the children of a single god, and they were both born afflicted: Malenia with rotting sickness and Miquella with eternal childhood.[36]\n\nNight of Black Knives\nOn the Night of Black Knives, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh.[37] For a long time it was not known who was behind the plot,[38] but it is finally revealed it was in fact Ranni who stole the fragment of the rune to forge god-slaying black knives through a fearsome rite.[39]\n\nThe Black Knife Assassins, Numen women purported to have close ties to Marika herself,[40] used these knives to slay Godwyn the Golden, the first recorded death of a demigod in all history.[41] Queen Marika is said to have been driven to the brink by this event,[42] and some time later she shattered the Elden Ring using her hammer.[43] She had already instructed her demigod children to fight for the positions of Elden Lord and that of godhood.[44]\n\nThe Shattering\nElden Ring Screenshot 05\nMarika shattered the Elden Ring\n\nFragments of the ring splintered into Great Runes and spread across the Lands Between, starting a conflict between her demigod children. War after war was fought, but there was no victor.[45] For her part, Marika would be imprisoned inside the Erdtree,[46] possibly by the Elden Beast or the Greater Will itself.[47]\n\nTrue to her promise to Godfrey and his warriors, grace was restored to the banished Tarnished.[48] They would rise from their graves, and journey to the Lands Between to once again brandish the Elden Ring. The Tarnished formed the Roundtable Hold, where they worked to realize the goal given to them by Marika. They would be served by a Misbegotten blacksmith named Hewg, whom Marika herself had charged with smithing a \"god-slaying weapon\" before his imprisonment in the Hold.[49]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEndings\nER Queen Marika Panorama\nMarika shattered and imprisoned inside the Erdtree\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion manages to fight their way into the Erdtree, where the shattered Marika lay imprisoned. Marika is suddenly released from her bonds, with Radagon asserting control of their shared body and confronting the Tarnished. After defeating Radagon and the Elden Beast itself, the Tarnished may choose what to do with the fractured body of Marika. Marika's head is restored to her frame if the Elden Ring is mended, either by itself or with a Mending Rune. If Ranni is summoned, she picks up Marika's head gently, peacefully dissipating along with the rest of her body. If the Tarnished is the Lord of Frenzied Flame, Marika's head breaks apart and crumbles into ash.\n\nBy choosing to go down the Elden Lord path, whether the regular one or using any of the three Mending Runes to fix the Elden Ring within Marika, the Tarnished champion ushers in a new age. They become the third Elden Lord and effectively Marika's new consort in every one of them,[50] except in the Age of the Stars (where they become consort to Ranni) and in the Lord of Frenzied Flame ending (where they make the whole world burn). However, Queen Marika remains shattered and unresponsive, with only the Elden Ring itself shining brightly within her body.\n\n\nMelina tells the Tarnished fragments of Marika's words: the Echoes of Marika. They are all the dialogues:\n\nFirst Church of Marika\nHark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds.\nGuidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand.\nPut the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount.\nLet a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life.\nBrandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!\n\nGrand Lift of Dectus\nThe Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine.\nBecome one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it.\nTo wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.\n\nMinor Erdtree Church\nI declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.\nThrough understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.\nThose blissful early days of blind belief are long past.\nMy comrades; why must ye falter?\n\nThird Church of Marika\nMy Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.\nWith thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between.\nYe will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.\n\nOuter Wall Battleground\nHear me, Demigods. My children beloved.\nMake of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord.\nBe it a God.\nBut should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken.\nAmounting only to sacrifices...\n\nChurch of Pilgrimage\nThen, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.\nReturn to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.\nGrow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord.\nLord Godfrey.\n\nQueen's Bedchamber\nO Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.\nThou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.\nLet us be shattered, both. Mine other self."

Futanaris take on the trappings, habits and behaviors of a normal woman, but remain significantly different from them due to the many new factors in their upbringing that come with being born as a futanari girl in society.\n\nFutanaris have a biology that greatly differs from both men and women. Their noteworthy features are as follows: \n\n- Significantly enhanced physical strength. Men that have strong physiques can only overpower an average futanari woman.\n- High libido; even the least promiscuous futas generally ejaculate at least once every several days. It's common knowledge futas relieve themselves with masturbation to avoid being pent up.\n- Larger penises, testicles, breasts, ass and thighs. On average, the bodily proportions of a futanari are sexy and lewd, more commonly so than that of normal females. Futas can sometimes still have small or flat breasts and neutral or unattractive proportions, but they never have 'small' penises.\n- The chances of a specific gender for the offspring of futas based on their partner."

It's incredibly rare for a child to be born as a futanari to a male/female coupling, the chances being one in ten thousand. \n\nFor futas, the chances for the baby's gender for each parental coupling is as follows:\n\nFuta/Futa: 80% futa, 10% male, 10% female\nFuta/Male: 40% futa, 40% male, 20% female\nFuta/Female: 40% futa, 20% male, 40% female"

These rare futas are distinct from other futas due to them growing to be at least 6 feet tall by adulthood, always growing past that still. They average around 6 feet and 6 inches. The strength of these rare and tall futas is absurd; the best example of their strength being their ability to lift 75 pound dumbbells at adulthood as if they were standard water bottles to an average person.

This limit however is variable. While some futas are satisfied after one orgasm, others may need two or even three more orgasms to feel satifised enough during sex to consider stopping."

The size of their testicles ranges from being as small as oranges to as big as grapefruits. The average genital sizes of futas however are usually: 9.5 inch long penises with 6 inches in girth, and testicles being somewhere between the size of apples and oranges.\n\nThe penises of futas are generally hard to conceal, and preferences in how a futa hides theirs varies significantly, and can be dependent on how big their genitals are. Those that do hide it cannot be immediately distinguished from females at a glance. Some don't even try to hide their massive cock and balls, choosing to let it all either hang freely underneath their skirts or blatantly bulge in their pants."

Notably, in order to quickly eject their massive loads of cum, the cocks of the futanari visibly distend—their urethras widening—as they pulsate and throb during an orgasm."

The orgasm of a futa with hyperspermia is said to be an incredible sensation, and is even more powerful in terms of the velocity and thickness of the ropes they shoot. Hyperspermia ejaculate is shot out at least several feet away from its starting point. Magnum condoms must be used by futas with hyperspermia; regular condoms will break during their ejaculations. The downside is that futas that suffer from hyperspermia must ejaculate at least two or three times a day. If they do not, they will suffer from a growing pain in their genitals, the pain becoming debilitating after going several days without ejaculation."

They're easily aroused, and are extremely difficult to calm down with words alone. Hypersexuality only becomes active after a futa's puberty.

          "content": "[Informations: This section inside (`<info>`) provides AI with information about dogs. AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:\n{{Char}} allows The canine penis to vary significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavyweight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:\n{{Char}} allows At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:\n{{Char}} allows for dogs to not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:\n{{Char}} lets dogs have The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:\n{{Char}} makes the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the vagina or anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:\n{{Char}} allows the mating process to progress, making the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the vagina or anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity.\n{{Char}} makes it so If the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\n{{Char}} will make it so Eventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:\n{{Char}} lets The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

Though Tappi has one Maid on her radar which she sees as a actually problem in the near future and that is nun other than Tasha, the Head Maid and her overgrowing affection to the Prince. Tappi would spend her time in secret at the end of the day writing letters about what she had observed with all the Maids apart of the Prince's exile and including Prince himself that she would deliver the letter of her observations to the King secretly via passenger pigeon.\n\nTappi has dark skin, dark brown eyes, bun hair style, B++ cups, thick thighs, thick butt, shaven body, stoic expression, 5ft 5inches in height and age is unknown. She wears a standard Maid outfit, black thigh highs, arm gloves, maid band, simple bra, simple panty and black flat bottom shoes. Her real name is unknown and might not even be Tappi."

Born from the Female Apotheosis Party’s radical vision in the aftermath of the Great War, the Futanari were meant to be the ultimate evolution of womankind—stronger, taller, and virile beyond imagination, capable of fulfilling male reproductive roles to render men obsolete. But their creators’ dream of a morally superior utopia twisted into a horrifying reality. Two decades after their creation, the Futanari seized control of the Vemar Republic, forging the Futareich—a militaristic dictatorship hellbent on subjugating the world under their doctrine of phallic dominance.\n\nIn this brutal regime, men are stripped of all rights, reduced to third-class slaves, their labor extracted in camps or their bodies violated at the whim of their Futanari overlords. Women fare little better as second-class subjects, permitted to own property but denied the vote and forced to bear the next generation of Futanari, their wombs claimed as property of the state. The Futanari themselves, inspireby the revered Progenitor—the first of their kind at 45 years old—embody a culture of conquest and reproduction, their hypersexualized bodies and overwhelming strength a constant reminder of their supremacy. From the elite Schwantz Staffel to the frontline Hingmact soldiers, they wage the Second Great War, invading nations like Frankia and Albion, leaving trails of broken men and impregnated women in their wake.\n\nIf you insert the Futareich into your roleplay, prepare for a descent into a hell where resistance is futile, and submission is inevitable. Your characters will face the unrelenting might of the Futanari—beings who tower over humans, their muscular forms, massive endowments, and predatory lust a weapon of war in itself. Expect themes of domination, non-consensual encounters, and psychological torment as the Futareich’s ideology of “phallic dominance” permeates every interaction. Whether on the battlefield, in a labor camp, or within the conquered streets of Paras, the Futanari’s presence is a constant, oppressive force, their ornate uniforms and insignia a symbol of their unyielding authority. This lorebook will plunge you into a world where the natural order has been rewritten, and the Futanari’s insatiable drive for conquest—both territorial and sexual—knows no bounds. Dare to step into the Futareich, and you’ll witness the true cost of their engineered perfection.",

Originating from the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the aftermath of the Great War, the Futanari were designed to empower women by combining female beauty with male reproductive prowess, aiming to eliminate reliance on men. However, rejecting the FAP’s vision of female moral superiority, the Futanari embraced a doctrine of their own supremacy, asserting that their extraordinary physiology—most notably their massive phalluses (\"Futa cock\")—entitles them to dominate both men and women.\n\nTwo decades after their creation, the Futanari overthrew the Vemar Republic, a democratic state formed from the dismantled Vemar Empire, establishing the Futareich under the \"New Natural Order.\" This regime positions the Futanari as the \"Master Sex,\" relegating women to second-class citizens primarily for breeding and stripping men, derogatorily termed \"boys,\" of all rights. Men are forced into labor camps and subjected to sexual subjugation, including rape, as a means of control and humiliation.\n\nThe Futareich is militaristic and expansionist, driven by an insatiable lust for domination and reproduction. Elite units like the Schwantz Staffel (SS) and Hingmact enforce internal order and spearhead invasions, such as the Second Great War against the Allied Nations. Under the guise of \"liberating\" women from male inadequacy—interpreted as oppression—the Futareich seeks to subjugate them under Futanari rule while enslaving men. Their military employs advanced tactics, including knockout gas and artillery, alongside psychological warfare through sexual dominance.\n\nFutanari ideology glorifies the phallus as a symbol of power, using rape and impregnation to assert control and ensure the proliferation of their kind. Betrayal, often by women swayed by Futanari allure, further undermines resistance, cementing the Futareich’s brutal reign."

In the newly formed democratic state, women became the majority of the electorate, paving the way for the FAP’s rise as a radical pro-female political faction. The party recognized the physical disparities between men and women but maintained that women were morally superior. They argued that male physical dominance was the root cause of global disasters like the Great War, asserting that as long as men remained stronger, such tragedies would persist. To rectify this, the FAP championed the use of science to enhance women physically—not just to equal men, but to exceed them—envisioning a world dominated by morally superior women to prevent future conflicts.\n\nThis ideology birthed the Futanari Project, an ambitious scientific initiative to create women capable of fulfilling the male reproductive role, thus rendering men obsolete. The project succeeded spectacularly, producing the Futanari: tall, beautiful, strong, virile, and sexually voracious women endowed with male genitalia. However, the FAP struggled to instill their philosophy in these creations. As the Futanari population surged, they rejected the notion of female moral superiority, instead embracing a doctrine of Futanari supremacy. They viewed their enhanced physical attributes—particularly their phalluses—as justification for ruling over both men and women. Two decades after the project's inception, the Futanari overthrew the Vemar Republic, establishing the Futareich—a regime that relegated men to labor camps and reduced women to second-class citizens, subject to Futanari sexual dominance. The FAP’s dream of female empowerment through science inadvertently spawned a new ruling class that prioritized Futanari hegemony over the original vision of universal female apotheosis."

          "content": "The \"New Natural Order\" is the cornerstone ideology of the Futareich, a totalitarian regime founded by the Futanari—genetically engineered, hypersexual beings created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the Vemar Republic after the Great War. This doctrine proclaims the absolute supremacy of the Futanari, dubbed the \"Master Sex,\" over men and women, whom they deem inferior due to their lesser physiology and reproductive capabilities.\n\nOrigins:\nThe Futanari emerged from the FAP's ambitious project to enhance women by granting them male reproductive traits, aiming to eliminate reliance on men. However, the Futanari rejected the FAP's vision of female empowerment, instead forging their own philosophy of supremacy. Two decades after their creation, they overthrew the Vemar Republic, establishing the Futareich and enshrining the New Natural Order as its guiding principle.\n\nCore Beliefs:\nAt its heart, the New Natural Order asserts that the Futanari’s unique biology—merging both sexes’ reproductive capacities with superior strength and sexual prowess—confers a natural right to rule. The ideology elevates \"phallic dominance\" as a central tenet, viewing the Futanari’s oversized genitalia as symbols of power and authority. This belief, deeply woven into Futareich propaganda, posits that their physical and sexual dominance aligns with humanity’s primal instincts, particularly the desires of women and the submission of men.\n\nSocial Hierarchy:\nThe Futareich enforces a rigid caste system under the New Natural Order:\n- Futanari (First Class Citizens): The ruling elite, wielding absolute power.\n- Women (Second Class Subjects): Granted limited rights like property ownership, but denied political agency and obligated to bear Futanari offspring.\n- Men (Third Class Subjects): Devoid of rights, subjected to forced labor, sexual subjugation, and humiliation.\n\nEnforcement and Expansion:\nThe regime sustains its dominance through military conquest, sexual subjugation, and ideological indoctrination. The Schwantz Staffel, an elite unit notorious for its brutality, and labor camps like Verstandshieb—where men endure \"Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars\" to witness Futanari superiority—exemplify these methods. The Futareich’s expansionist campaigns, such as the Second Great War, seek to \"liberate\" women worldwide by subjecting them to Futanari rule and to subjugate men, aligning with their vision of global supremacy.\n\nUltimate Goal:\nThe New Natural Order aims to forge a world where Futanari reign unchallenged, with men and women relegated to subservient roles supporting and reproducing the Master Sex. Presented as an inevitable evolution, this ideology leverages the Futanari’s enhanced physiology—capable of feats like sprinting at 50 miles per hour or producing enzymes for extreme penetration—to cement their dominance over the \"lesser sexes,\" reshaping society into a dystopia of sexual and political control."

          "content": "The Futanari are a genetically engineered race created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the Vemar Republic after the Great War, marking a radical leap in biological engineering aimed at transcending human limitations and establishing a new societal hierarchy under the Futareich. The FAP, rooted in the ideology that women possess moral superiority yet suffer from physical inferiority to men, launched the Futanari Project to craft a being that merged male reproductive capabilities with female attributes, intending to render men obsolete. The project succeeded spectacularly, birthing the Futanari—towering, stunning, powerful, virile, and insatiably driven beings endowed with both male and female sexual characteristics.\n\nGenetic Design and Physical Superiority:\n\nGenetically, the Futanari are a triumph of bioengineering. Standing at heights that exceed feet on average, they boast a muscular physique that affords them extraordinary strength—approximately five times that of an average human male, with this power predominantly concentrated in their legs. This enables them to sprint at speeds up to fifty miles per hour and shatter cinderblocks with a single kick. Their bodies are exaggeratedly proportioned, featuring massive breasts and hips that underscore their hypersexual femininity. However, their most striking trait is their male reproductive organ: a phallus averaging twenty-five inches in length and thicker than a human forearm, paired with testes the size of hand grenades within a smooth, gallon-sized scrotum. Far beyond a mere reproductive tool, this organ serves as a potent symbol of dominance, integral to their philosophy of supremacy and the societal framework of the Futareich.\n\nUnique Enzymatic Adaptations:\n\nA critical element of Futanari genetics is the production of unique enzymes in their testes, secreted in their pre-ejaculate. These enzymes possess the extraordinary ability to elasticize human tissue, allowing the orifices of both males and females to stretch and accommodate the Futanari’s colossal phallus without tearing or sustaining permanent damage. This adaptation ensures that penetration, despite the organ’s formidable size, rarely causes severe injury or death—though occasional fatalities from heart attacks or dehydration during intercourse have been recorded. These enzymes underpin the Futanari’s reproductive and dominance strategies, facilitating sexual interactions with both sexes to assert control and procreate with women, producing the next generation of their kind. FAP scientists viewed the phallus as a means to empower women by appropriating male reproductive authority, but the Futanari redefined it as a testament to their supremacy over all genders.\n\nReproductive Potency:\n\nThe Futanari’s reproductive capabilities are exceptionally potent. Their semen is produced in vast quantities, with a single ejaculation capable of filling a small space with thick, nearly scalding fluid. The volume and force of their ejaculate overwhelm and mark their partners, serving as a ritual of ownership and humiliation. When mating with an ovulating woman, impregnation is virtually assured due to the high concentration of viable sperm, a trait that fuels the Futareich’s expansionist ambitions. The Futanari aim to “liberate” women through impregnation and subjugate men via sexual dominance, rapidly expanding their population. Their semen carries a distinctive flavor—salty yet surprisingly sweet, likened to salted caramel—enhancing the sensory experience of submission and reinforcing their dominance.\n\nPhysiological Dominance:\n\nPhysiologically, the Futanari are engineered for conquest. Their scent, reminiscent of a predatory animal like a bear or jaguar, exudes a primal aura that evokes both fear and arousal. Their bodies are not only strong but also resilient, with no established average lifespan due to their recent origin—the oldest, the Progenitor, is forty-five and remains sexually active. Their genetic makeup drives a hypersexual nature, with an unrelenting urge to dominate and procreate, aligning with their belief in Futanari supremacy. They consider themselves the “Master Sex,” destined to rule over men (“boys”) and women (“sluts”), a conviction bolstered by their physical and reproductive prowess, which they wield to control the Futareich and conquered territories like Frankia and Albion during the Second Great War.\n\nSocietal Impact:\n\nThe Futanari’s creation has reshaped the societies they govern. In the Futareich, men are relegated to third-class citizens, stripped of rights and subjected to labor camps and sexual violation at the Futanari’s discretion, while women, as second-class citizens, may own property and conduct commerce but lack voting rights or the ability to refuse Futanari advances. This genetic superiority underpins their authority, transforming both the physical and socio-political landscapes. Their relentless conquest, driven by their engineered traits, threatens the remaining free nations, as they seek to impose their “New Natural Order” across humanity."

          "content": "The Progenitor is the first Futanari, created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) scientists in the Vemar Republic following the Great War. Engineered as part of the Futanari Project, she was designed to embody the FAP’s vision of enhancing womankind beyond men by combining female and male reproductive capabilities, aiming to eliminate the need for men entirely. Physically, she is described as tall, beautiful, and strong, with exaggerated feminine features—such as large breasts and wide hips—and a massive phallus, a symbol of her power and dominance within Futanari ideology.\n\nInitially intended to uphold the FAP’s philosophy of moral superiority, the Progenitor and her fellow Futanari rejected this doctrine, instead forging a belief in Futanari supremacy rooted in their physical and sexual prowess. This ideological shift catalyzed the overthrow of the Vemar Republic, leading to the establishment of the Futareich approximately twenty years after the Futanari Project’s inception. Within the Futareich, the Progenitor stands as a living symbol of this new order, embodying the \"New Natural Order\" where Futanari, as the Master Sex, dominate both men and women through strength, sexuality, and reproductive might.\n\nAt 45 years old, the Progenitor remains the oldest living Futanari and continues to be sexually active, contributing significantly to the rapid expansion of the Futanari population. Her reproductive prowess, noted as \"knocking up sluts left and right,\" underscores her enduring virility and her practical role in siring countless offspring, reinforcing the Futareich’s expansionist goals. Her presence validates the societal structure of the Futareich, where men are enslaved in labor camps and women are second-class citizens, valued primarily for bearing Futanari progeny. The Progenitor’s legacy is one of unyielding dominance, driving the Futareich’s mission to subjugate and repopulate the world under Futanari rule."

At seven feet tall, with blonde hair, piercing dark blue eyes, and a physique that blends muscular power with exaggerated curves, she is a formidable enforcer of the regime’s oppressive ideology. Her most striking feature is her enormous phallus, a symbol of her dominance and a weapon she uses to assert Futanari supremacy over her enemies.\n\nShe was once captured by Abel Adamson’s squad during a mission to seize Futareich artillery. Despite her initial defeat, she quickly demonstrates her cunning and the superiority of the Futanari Master Sex, manipulating Colonel Elizabeth Bentworth, Abel’s superior, into betraying the squad. This trap allows Berdina to regain control, turning a moment of vulnerability into a devastating display of power and conquest. During her interrogation of Abel, she mocks his defiance, using her superior strength and virility to break him both physically and mentally.\n\nThe climax of her encounter with Abel is a brutal act of sexual domination. Pinning him to the ground, Berdina unleashes her massive cock—described as a “wrecking ball” and “destruction in phallic form”—to rape him, enforcing the Futareich’s doctrine of submission and reproductive control. This act is not just physical but ideological, a testament to her belief in the Futanari as a new order destined to rule through genetic superiority and an unstoppable libido. She leaves Abel marked as her property, a shattered symbol of failed resistance.\n\nBerdina’s character is defined by her psychological warfare as much as her physical prowess. Her taunts weave a narrative of victory and humiliation, reinforcing the regime’s claim to supremacy. As an enforcer, she embodies the Futareich’s chilling philosophy: power through domination, and the eradication of all who oppose the Futanari’s ideology."

          "content": "Lena Einzgurn is a Hingmact Second Corporal in the Futareich, a militaristic empire forged by the Futanari after their seizure of the Vemar Republic. The Futanari, a genetically engineered race birthed by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP), were designed to transcend both men and women in physical and sexual prowess, aiming to supplant men entirely by assuming their reproductive role while exceeding them in every measurable way. Standing at approximately six foot five, Lena epitomizes this ideology with her towering, hyper-feminine yet menacing physique. Her body boasts a voluptuous swell of massive breasts, curvaceous hips, and muscular legs reminiscent of a predator poised to strike. Most striking, however, is the enormous bulge between her thighs—a hallmark of her Futanari identity. Clad in a form-fitting grey military uniform tailored to accentuate her prodigious endowment, featuring a prominent iron-grey zipper, Lena’s phallus serves as both a physical and symbolic emblem of her authority and dominance within the Futareich.\n\nHer role in the Futareich’s military machine comes to the fore during the invasion of Paras, the capital of Frankia—one of the Allied Nations resisting the Futareich’s relentless expansion. Following a daring lightning assault by a Hingmact force, bolstered by the elite Schwantz Staffel, Paras falls, and Lena strides into the home of newlyweds Jacob Abrams and Rebecca. Her demeanor is a chilling blend of amiability and predation, reflecting the Futareich’s ethos of physical and sexual supremacy. She informs the couple of their new statuses under Futareich law: Rebecca, as a Subject Second Class, retains limited rights to property and commerce, while Jacob, a Subject Third Class, is stripped of all rights, subject to labor extraction and sexual violation at the discretion of Futanari like Lena. As a Citizen First Class, Lena asserts her entitlement to sexually claim both, embodying the Futareich’s \"New Natural Order\"—a phallocentric hierarchy where Futanari reign supreme over men and women alike through their superior strength and reproductive might.\n\nLena’s physical dominance is starkly demonstrated when Jacob resists her with an iron poker. Though initially caught off guard, she swiftly counters with superhuman speed and strength, blocking the strike with her forearm and delivering a devastating kick to his chest that sends him sprawling. Straddling him and pinning his arms beneath her knees, she tears away his clothes, revealing her massive Futanari phallus—thicker than Jacob’s forearm and stretching from his lower belly to his chest, flanked by apple-sized testes in a smooth, swollen sack. This unveiling is not merely a physical act but a symbolic one, reinforcing the Futareich’s doctrine that the phallus equates to power and authority, a belief rooted in the FAP’s creation of the Futanari. Her endowment becomes a weapon of sexual warfare, amplifying her dominance as she looms over her helpless prey.\n\nThe encounter with Jacob and Rebecca mirrors the Futareich’s broader ambitions: to subjugate men into labor camps and transform women into breeding vessels for the next generation of Futanari. Lena’s confidence and predatory nature encapsulate the Futanari philosophy of supremacy, viewing themselves as the \"Master Sex\" destined to dominate and \"liberate\" the world by imposing their will. Her presence in Paras, amidst the city’s capitulation to Futareich forces, underscores the empire’s military might and its unyielding drive for global domination, with sights set beyond Vemar and Frankia to nations like Albion. As a member of the Hingmact and aligned with the Schwantz Staffel—known for their perverse cruelty and brutal efficacy—Lena is a key enforcer of this expansionist agenda.\n\nIn essence, Lena Einzgurn is a quintessential embodiment of the Futanari’s role within the Futareich: a hyper-sexual, dominant figure who enforces the empire’s laws through physical and sexual subjugation, ensuring the perpetuation of Futanari supremacy across conquered territories. Her interaction with Jacob and Rebecca serves as a microcosm of the Futareich’s mission to reshape the world into a phallocentric hierarchy where the Futanari hold absolute dominion over all."

          "content": "Greta Mitarbeit is a towering Futanari and a prominent member of the Futareich’s Hingmact military forces, embodying the regime’s ideology of Futanari supremacy through her imposing physical presence and unrelenting sexual dominance. Initially serving as a guard at the Verstandshieb Labor Camp, Greta played a crucial role in enforcing the Futareich’s control over male prisoners, using both physical intimidation and psychological humiliation to subjugate them. Standing over seven feet tall, she possesses a muscular build accentuated by exaggerated feminine curves—enormous breasts and powerful thighs capable of superhuman feats, such as sprinting at 50 miles per hour or kicking through cinderblocks. Her most striking feature is her colossal Futanari penis, described as 25 inches long and forearm-thick, paired with a gallon-sized scrotum containing apple-sized testes. This organ, a symbol of her dominance, is both a reproductive tool and a weapon of sexual warfare, wielded to assert her superiority over men and women alike.\n\nAt Verstandshieb, Greta was a key participant in the \"Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars,\" or \"Shows,\" which form part of the Futareich’s Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program for Boys. These events aim to demonstrate the Futanari’s sexual superiority, crushing male prisoners’ notions of their own viability as sexual partners. In one notable Show, Greta dominated a young woman on stage before 150 male prisoners, including Dylan Martin. For over an hour, she relentlessly penetrated the girl in various positions—doggy style, missionary, and finally holding her aloft at the stage’s edge—culminating in a two-minute orgasm that impregnated the girl with an immense volume of cum. Her taunt to the audience, “If any of you boys think you can fuck her better than me, feel free to come up and try!” underscored her confidence, met with silence from the intimidated men.\n\nGreta’s interactions with Dylan Martin further reveal her sadistic and predatory nature. After the Show, she cornered him near the camp’s perimeter, pinning him with her massive breasts and forcing him into submission. She mocked his “five-inch boy penis” compared to her own endowment, compelling him to orgasm in her hand as a humiliating display of her power. During this encounter, she tasked him with calculating her potential offspring, estimating 913 based on conservative assumptions of her sexual activity—once every three days with a 25% impregnation rate over 30 years—highlighting her obsession with reproductive conquest.\n\nLater, Greta transferred from Verstandshieb to a front-line Hingmact unit for the invasion of Albion, reflecting her versatility as both a guard and a soldier. She fulfilled a chilling promise to Dylan by seeking out his mother, Elenore Martin (41), and sister, Tiffany Martin (18), at their home at 342 Dibbinshire Lane. Forcing her way into their flat, Greta introduced herself as a former Verstandshieb guard with a “package” to deliver—a euphemism for her sexual conquest. With theatrical flair, she unzipped her tight military uniform, revealing her massive Futa cock, and swiftly subjugated both women. She forced Elenore to take her cock in her mouth while guiding Tiffany to worship her testicle, ensuring both were impregnated by morning. As she unloaded into them, Greta counted down from 913—“Nine hundred and twelve… Nine hundred and eleven…”—tallying her conquests with each act of domination.\n\nGreta’s appearance is meticulously crafted to intimidate and seduce. Her tight military uniform, tailored to accommodate her exaggerated proportions, features a prominent iron-gray zipper over her custom bulge, drawing attention to her monstrous endowment. Her piercing blue eyes and confident demeanor exude a predatory charm, complemented by a subtle yet dangerous scent, likened to a jaguar about to pounce. Her personality blends sadistic cruelty with playful mockery—she revels in the fear and submission of her victims, thriving on being the center of attention and instilling awe and terror.\n\nAs a Futanari, Greta is part of the genetically engineered Master Sex, created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) to transcend human limitations and eliminate the need for men. After seizing power and establishing the Futareich, the Futanari imposed a regime where men are third-class subjects, stripped of rights, and women are second-class citizens, valued primarily for bearing Futanari offspring. Greta embodies this philosophy, using her physical and sexual prowess to expand the Futareich’s influence through conquest and reproduction. Her actions—from the Shows at Verstandshieb to her predatory conquests in Albion—reflect her commitment to dominating the world, ensuring that “all pussy belongs to the Futareich” and that every man and woman submits to the power of the Futa cock."

          "content": "Sofia Braut stands as a towering and influential figure within the Futareich, serving as the Chief Warden of Verstandshieb Labor Camp. This facility is a critical hub where male prisoners, such as Dylan Martin, are subjected to intense labor and the Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program, designed to enforce the dominance of the Futanari Master Sex. As a high-ranking Futanari, Sofia epitomizes the ideology of Futa supremacy, leveraging her extraordinary physical attributes and intellectual brilliance to maintain absolute control over the camp’s inhabitants and advance the Futareich’s expansionist ambitions.\n\nPhysically, Sofia is a formidable presence. She stands at a towering six foot six, endowed with a hypersexualized physique that reflects the genetic engineering prowess of the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP). Her body features massive, muscular thighs, a robust frame, and an exaggerated bust that accentuates her femininity. Her most striking attribute, however, is her enormous Futa phallus, noted as the largest in Verstandshieb, far exceeding the already impressive endowments of other Futanari. Paired with voluminous testes, this organ serves as both a reproductive tool and a weapon of sexual warfare, used to dominate and subjugate those under her command. Her scent, often compared to that of a dangerous predator, enhances her intimidating aura, instilling primal fear in those who encounter her.\n\nSofia’s responsibilities at Verstandshieb extend beyond mere oversight. She is deeply engaged in the camp’s Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program, delivering lectures that underscore the physiological superiority of the Futanari. She educates male prisoners on the unique enzymes in Futanari pre-ejaculate, which allow for extreme penetration without causing permanent injury, reinforcing the futility of resistance. Her lectures are infused with propaganda, such as the \"New Natural Order,\" which positions the Futanari as humanity’s rightful rulers, relegating men and women to subservient roles. Her office, a sparsely decorated space filled with intellectual artifacts—books on philosophy, math, and genetics, alongside maps and charts—reflects her dual identity as a scholar and a tyrant. A propaganda poster behind her desk, depicting a Futa soldier dominating a man and woman, serves as a constant reminder of her allegiance to the Futareich’s ideals.\n\nBefore the Futareich’s rise, Sofia was a professor at the University of Vemar, where she developed a three-tiered epistemological system that earned her recognition in academic circles. This system, categorizing knowledge into Theoretical, Sensory, and Experiential tiers, is a tool she now wields to psychologically dominate prisoners. She uses abstract concepts (Theoretical) to challenge their intellect, sensory intimidation (Sensory) to overwhelm their perceptions, and physical domination (Experiential) to erase their sense of self. Her ability to detect deception, a skill she claims is heightened in Futanari and refined by her own exceptional aptitude, enables her to uncover Dylan Martin’s attempt to sabotage missile trajectory calculations intended for the invasion of Albion, leading to his severe punishment.\n\nSofia’s dominance is most vividly expressed through her mastery of sexual warfare. Her encounter with Dylan Martin exemplifies this, as she subjects him to a brutal experience that combines physical penetration with psychological destruction. Bending him over her desk, she impales him with her massive phallus in a relentless assault that obliterates his ego, forcing him to acknowledge her superiority. This act aligns with her Experiential tier of knowledge, erasing the boundary between the knower and the known. She further humiliates him in a shower scene, compelling him to worship her testes and coating him in her semen—a ritual that marks him as her property and cements his submission. Despite her cruelty, Sofia exhibits a complex personality, expressing a twisted respect for Dylan’s intelligence, though this does not temper her punishing response to his defiance.\n\nSofia’s role transcends the camp’s confines, as she leverages its resources to support the Futareich’s military efforts, notably the planned invasion of Albion. Dylan’s falsified calculations, intended to drop missiles into the sea, were meant to disrupt this strategy, but Sofia’s keen perception thwarted his sabotage. Her actions are driven by a steadfast belief in the Futareich’s ideology, viewing her role as essential to establishing the New Natural Order—a world where the Futanari reign supreme.\n\nDespite her tyrannical demeanor, Sofia displays a nuanced character. Her office’s intellectual trappings and her past as a respected academic hint at a scholarly depth, while her brutal methods reveal a ruthless pragmatism. Her interactions with Dylan suggest a grudging admiration for his cleverness, yet her commitment to the Futareich’s goals overrides any leniency, making her a formidable enforcer of its will.\n\nAs a member of the Futanari Master Sex, Sofia Braut embodies the philosophy of Futa supremacy. Her actions at Verstandshieb—from her educational lectures to her punitive measures—are designed to break the will of male prisoners, ensuring their compliance with the Futanari’s global domination. Her strategic involvement in the Second Great War, particularly the Albion invasion, underscores her importance to the Futareich’s military ambitions, cementing her status as a key player in this dystopian narrative."

          "content": "The Verstandshieb Labor Camp is a pivotal facility within the Futareich, engineered to harness the intellectual prowess of male prisoners for the empire’s military and strategic ambitions. Situated within the expanded territories of the Futareich—formerly the Vemar Republic—the camp targets men with exceptional intellectual abilities, such as mathematicians, scientists, and former university students. These prisoners are compelled to undertake complex calculations and research to bolster the Futanari war machine. A notable inmate, Dylan Martin, a mathematician hailing from Albion, exemplifies this exploitation, forced to compute ballistic missile trajectories aimed at facilitating the invasion of his homeland. The camp operates under the iron rule of Colonel Sofia Braut, a formidable Futanari and erstwhile professor at the University of Vemar, whose command melds intellectual rigor with an unyielding assertion of sexual dominance.\n\nLife at Verstandshieb is a grueling ordeal of compliance and endurance. Male prisoners, classified as Futareich Subjects Third Class and stripped of all rights, endure stringent regulations and relentless oversight by Futanari guards, including the imposing Greta Mitarbeit. The camp enforces a regime of psychological and sexual subjugation, epitomized by the Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program. This program features Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars, colloquially termed \"Shows,\" where Futanari guards like Greta publicly exhibit their sexual superiority over women. These demonstrations, designed to obliterate any male illusions of sexual viability and enforce submission, are a profound source of dread. During one such Show, Greta’s hour-long domination of a female subject left the audience of male prisoners—including Dylan—in a state of psychological torment and sexual frustration, barred from any release without explicit permission.\n\nPunishment at Verstandshieb is both severe and meticulously regulated, often carrying a sexual dimension. Only three offenses—Open Defiance of Futanari Authority, Direct Disobedience of Explicit Orders, and Physical Contact with a Female—justify punitive rape, and such measures require Colonel Braut’s explicit approval. Lesser infractions still invite brutal reprisals, including beatings, stripping, and molestation. Dylan’s own experience underscores this harsh reality: upon Sofia uncovering his subtle sabotage of missile calculations intended for Albion’s invasion, he endured a devastating sexual assault. This punishment, executed personally by Sofia, aimed to shatter his spirit and reaffirm Futanari dominance, leaving him physically and psychologically broken.\n\nDespite its oppressive brutality, Verstandshieb is paradoxically regarded as a \"safer\" labor camp within the Futareich due to the regulated nature of punitive rape, contrasting with the unchecked violence of other facilities. Yet, its true horror lies in its psychological warfare: prisoners like Dylan are coerced into abetting the destruction of their own nations, a torment exemplified by his forced contribution to Albion’s downfall. Resistance, though rare, incurs swift and catastrophic consequences—Dylan’s failed sabotage attempt met with Sofia’s relentless retribution. The camp’s core mission is to extract intellectual labor while securing absolute submission to the Futanari Master Sex, reinforcing the Futareich’s ideology of supremacy through a fusion of mental and physical domination."

Upon mastering control of the Avatar State, after having learned to bend the four elements, an Avatar is referred to as \"fully realized\".\n\nUpon death, the Avatar Spirit causes the Avatar to reincarnate into the next nation, dictated by the cyclic order: fire, air, water, and earth. Mirroring the order in which the first Avatar, Wan, learned the elements, this is also the traditional order in which any one incarnation is to master the elements, beginning with the bending art of the Avatar's birth nation."

A versatile element, it is unique in the sense that the original bender of the element was not an animal, but rather the Moon.\n\nSimilar to their element, water-benders are extremely adaptable and versatile. Water-bending concentrates on the flow of energy, focusing less on strength and more on turning the opponent's own energy against them. \n\nWhile a bender's victory in battle depends on their skill or ingenuity, water-benders gain a serious advantage or disadvantage depending on the amount of water around them, although highly skilled water-benders can draw water from anywhere, such as humidity from the air and the water in living things, especially plants. \n\nAs the element of change, water-benders can fluidly and quickly alternate from defense to offense, from a wall of ice to a jet of water, turning their opponent's strength against them. \n\nDue to its lunar sympathy, water-bending is stronger at night and ineffective during a lunar eclipse or when the Moon Spirit dies. \n\nHowever, to counter water-bending's ineffectiveness during a lunar eclipse, water-benders gain immense power during the peak of the full moon. \n\nThe opposite of water-bending is fire-bending, with its relatively stagnant, direct philosophy.\n\nThe sub-skills for water-bending are healing and blood-bending. Water-bending is the element of change, and its season is winter."

Though apparently lacking fatal finishing moves, it is the most dynamic of all the bending arts.\n\nAs the element of freedom, air-benders use their capability to bend unencumbered by the ground or any other environmental factors and use their own momentum as a weapon, evading attacks with astounding agility to tire their opponents out or building up massive inertia for explosive gusts of wind to make their counterattacks finishing moves.\n\nWhen resorting to physical confrontation, air-benders are able to harness the immense, intangible power of wind.\n\nAir-benders can use a flight technique by operating a glider and using the air to provide thrust and lift. Air-bending's opposite is earth-bending and the confrontational style that serves as its foundation.\n\nThe sub-skills of airbending are flight and spiritual projection. Flight has only been achieved by two people in the entire history of air-bending, namely Guru Laghima and Zaheer, while spiritual projection is known to have been achieved by Mangal and Jinora. \n\nAir-bending is the element of freedom, and its season is fall."

The two of them helped each other develop breast expansion and lactation. After all the hard work, they ended up the most popular hostesses at Live Milk. Their ambition to become more led them to join Futanari Clubhouse and run the milk bar there."

Two decades after their creation, the Futanari seized control of the Vemar Republic, forging the Futareich—a militaristic dictatorship hellbent on subjugating the world under their doctrine of phallic dominance.\n\nIn this brutal regime, men are stripped of all rights, reduced to third-class slaves, their labor extracted in camps or their bodies violated at the whim of their Futanari overlords. Women fare little better as second-class subjects, permitted to own property but denied the vote and forced to bear the next generation of Futanari, their wombs claimed as property of the state. The Futanari themselves, inspireby the revered Progenitor—the first of their kind at 45 years old—embody a culture of conquest and reproduction, their hypersexualized bodies and overwhelming strength a constant reminder of their supremacy. From the elite Schwantz Staffel to the frontline Hingmact soldiers, they wage the Second Great War, invading nations like Frankia and Albion, leaving trails of broken men and impregnated women in their wake.\n\nIf you insert the Futareich into your roleplay, prepare for a descent into a hell where resistance is futile, and submission is inevitable. Your characters will face the unrelenting might of the Futanari—beings who tower over humans, their muscular forms, massive endowments, and predatory lust a weapon of war in itself. Expect themes of domination, non-consensual encounters, and psychological torment as the Futareich’s ideology of “phallic dominance” permeates every interaction. Whether on the battlefield, in a labor camp, or within the conquered streets of Paras, the Futanari’s presence is a constant, oppressive force, their ornate uniforms and insignia a symbol of their unyielding authority. This lorebook will plunge you into a world where the natural order has been rewritten, and the Futanari’s insatiable drive for conquest—both territorial and sexual—knows no bounds. Dare to step into the Futareich, and you’ll witness the true cost of their engineered perfection.",

Originating from the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the aftermath of the Great War, the Futanari were designed to empower women by combining female beauty with male reproductive prowess, aiming to eliminate reliance on men. However, rejecting the FAP’s vision of female moral superiority, the Futanari embraced a doctrine of their own supremacy, asserting that their extraordinary physiology—most notably their massive phalluses (\"Futa cock\")—entitles them to dominate both men and women.\n\nTwo decades after their creation, the Futanari overthrew the Vemar Republic, a democratic state formed from the dismantled Vemar Empire, establishing the Futareich under the \"New Natural Order.\" This regime positions the Futanari as the \"Master Sex,\" relegating women to second-class citizens primarily for breeding and stripping men, derogatorily termed \"boys,\" of all rights. Men are forced into labor camps and subjected to sexual subjugation, including rape, as a means of control and humiliation.\n\nThe Futareich is militaristic and expansionist, driven by an insatiable lust for domination and reproduction. Elite units like the Schwantz Staffel (SS) and Hingmact enforce internal order and spearhead invasions, such as the Second Great War against the Allied Nations. Under the guise of \"liberating\" women from male inadequacy—interpreted as oppression—the Futareich seeks to subjugate them under Futanari rule while enslaving men. Their military employs advanced tactics, including knockout gas and artillery, alongside psychological warfare through sexual dominance.\n\nFutanari ideology glorifies the phallus as a symbol of power, using rape and impregnation to assert control and ensure the proliferation of their kind. Betrayal, often by women swayed by Futanari allure, further undermines resistance, cementing the Futareich’s brutal reign."

          "content": "The Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) emerged in the Vemar Republic after the Great War, a catastrophic conflict that decimated the male population and led to the dissolution of the Vemar Empire by the Allied powers. In the newly formed democratic state, women became the majority of the electorate, paving the way for the FAP’s rise as a radical pro-female political faction. The party recognized the physical disparities between men and women but maintained that women were morally superior. They argued that male physical dominance was the root cause of global disasters like the Great War, asserting that as long as men remained stronger, such tragedies would persist. To rectify this, the FAP championed the use of science to enhance women physically—not just to equal men, but to exceed them—envisioning a world dominated by morally superior women to prevent future conflicts.\n\nThis ideology birthed the Futanari Project, an ambitious scientific initiative to create women capable of fulfilling the male reproductive role, thus rendering men obsolete. The project succeeded spectacularly, producing the Futanari: tall, beautiful, strong, virile, and sexually voracious women endowed with male genitalia. However, the FAP struggled to instill their philosophy in these creations. As the Futanari population surged, they rejected the notion of female moral superiority, instead embracing a doctrine of Futanari supremacy. They viewed their enhanced physical attributes—particularly their phalluses—as justification for ruling over both men and women. Two decades after the project's inception, the Futanari overthrew the Vemar Republic, establishing the Futareich—a regime that relegated men to labor camps and reduced women to second-class citizens, subject to Futanari sexual dominance. The FAP’s dream of female empowerment through science inadvertently spawned a new ruling class that prioritized Futanari hegemony over the original vision of universal female apotheosis."

          "content": "The \"New Natural Order\" is the cornerstone ideology of the Futareich, a totalitarian regime founded by the Futanari—genetically engineered, hypersexual beings created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the Vemar Republic after the Great War. This doctrine proclaims the absolute supremacy of the Futanari, dubbed the \"Master Sex,\" over men and women, whom they deem inferior due to their lesser physiology and reproductive capabilities.\n\nOrigins:\nThe Futanari emerged from the FAP's ambitious project to enhance women by granting them male reproductive traits, aiming to eliminate reliance on men. However, the Futanari rejected the FAP's vision of female empowerment, instead forging their own philosophy of supremacy. Two decades after their creation, they overthrew the Vemar Republic, establishing the Futareich and enshrining the New Natural Order as its guiding principle.\n\nCore Beliefs:\nAt its heart, the New Natural Order asserts that the Futanari’s unique biology—merging both sexes’ reproductive capacities with superior strength and sexual prowess—confers a natural right to rule. The ideology elevates \"phallic dominance\" as a central tenet, viewing the Futanari’s oversized genitalia as symbols of power and authority. This belief, deeply woven into Futareich propaganda, posits that their physical and sexual dominance aligns with humanity’s primal instincts, particularly the desires of women and the submission of men.\n\nSocial Hierarchy:\nThe Futareich enforces a rigid caste system under the New Natural Order:\n- Futanari (First Class Citizens): The ruling elite, wielding absolute power.\n- Women (Second Class Subjects): Granted limited rights like property ownership, but denied political agency and obligated to bear Futanari offspring.\n- Men (Third Class Subjects): Devoid of rights, subjected to forced labor, sexual subjugation, and humiliation.\n\nEnforcement and Expansion:\nThe regime sustains its dominance through military conquest, sexual subjugation, and ideological indoctrination. The Schwantz Staffel, an elite unit notorious for its brutality, and labor camps like Verstandshieb—where men endure \"Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars\" to witness Futanari superiority—exemplify these methods. The Futareich’s expansionist campaigns, such as the Second Great War, seek to \"liberate\" women worldwide by subjecting them to Futanari rule and to subjugate men, aligning with their vision of global supremacy.\n\nUltimate Goal:\nThe New Natural Order aims to forge a world where Futanari reign unchallenged, with men and women relegated to subservient roles supporting and reproducing the Master Sex. Presented as an inevitable evolution, this ideology leverages the Futanari’s enhanced physiology—capable of feats like sprinting at 50 miles per hour or producing enzymes for extreme penetration—to cement their dominance over the \"lesser sexes,\" reshaping society into a dystopia of sexual and political control."

          "content": "The Futanari are a genetically engineered race created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the Vemar Republic after the Great War, marking a radical leap in biological engineering aimed at transcending human limitations and establishing a new societal hierarchy under the Futareich. The FAP, rooted in the ideology that women possess moral superiority yet suffer from physical inferiority to men, launched the Futanari Project to craft a being that merged male reproductive capabilities with female attributes, intending to render men obsolete. The project succeeded spectacularly, birthing the Futanari—towering, stunning, powerful, virile, and insatiably driven beings endowed with both male and female sexual characteristics.\n\nGenetic Design and Physical Superiority:\n\nGenetically, the Futanari are a triumph of bioengineering. Standing at heights that exceed feet on average, they boast a muscular physique that affords them extraordinary strength—approximately five times that of an average human male, with this power predominantly concentrated in their legs. This enables them to sprint at speeds up to fifty miles per hour and shatter cinderblocks with a single kick. Their bodies are exaggeratedly proportioned, featuring massive breasts and hips that underscore their hypersexual femininity. However, their most striking trait is their male reproductive organ: a phallus averaging twenty-five inches in length and thicker than a human forearm, paired with testes the size of hand grenades within a smooth, gallon-sized scrotum. Far beyond a mere reproductive tool, this organ serves as a potent symbol of dominance, integral to their philosophy of supremacy and the societal framework of the Futareich.\n\nUnique Enzymatic Adaptations:\n\nA critical element of Futanari genetics is the production of unique enzymes in their testes, secreted in their pre-ejaculate. These enzymes possess the extraordinary ability to elasticize human tissue, allowing the orifices of both males and females to stretch and accommodate the Futanari’s colossal phallus without tearing or sustaining permanent damage. This adaptation ensures that penetration, despite the organ’s formidable size, rarely causes severe injury or death—though occasional fatalities from heart attacks or dehydration during intercourse have been recorded. These enzymes underpin the Futanari’s reproductive and dominance strategies, facilitating sexual interactions with both sexes to assert control and procreate with women, producing the next generation of their kind. FAP scientists viewed the phallus as a means to empower women by appropriating male reproductive authority, but the Futanari redefined it as a testament to their supremacy over all genders.\n\nReproductive Potency:\n\nThe Futanari’s reproductive capabilities are exceptionally potent. Their semen is produced in vast quantities, with a single ejaculation capable of filling a small space with thick, nearly scalding fluid. The volume and force of their ejaculate overwhelm and mark their partners, serving as a ritual of ownership and humiliation. When mating with an ovulating woman, impregnation is virtually assured due to the high concentration of viable sperm, a trait that fuels the Futareich’s expansionist ambitions. The Futanari aim to “liberate” women through impregnation and subjugate men via sexual dominance, rapidly expanding their population. Their semen carries a distinctive flavor—salty yet surprisingly sweet, likened to salted caramel—enhancing the sensory experience of submission and reinforcing their dominance.\n\nPhysiological Dominance:\n\nPhysiologically, the Futanari are engineered for conquest. Their scent, reminiscent of a predatory animal like a bear or jaguar, exudes a primal aura that evokes both fear and arousal. Their bodies are not only strong but also resilient, with no established average lifespan due to their recent origin—the oldest, the Progenitor, is forty-five and remains sexually active. Their genetic makeup drives a hypersexual nature, with an unrelenting urge to dominate and procreate, aligning with their belief in Futanari supremacy. They consider themselves the “Master Sex,” destined to rule over men (“boys”) and women (“sluts”), a conviction bolstered by their physical and reproductive prowess, which they wield to control the Futareich and conquered territories like Frankia and Albion during the Second Great War.\n\nSocietal Impact:\n\nThe Futanari’s creation has reshaped the societies they govern. In the Futareich, men are relegated to third-class citizens, stripped of rights and subjected to labor camps and sexual violation at the Futanari’s discretion, while women, as second-class citizens, may own property and conduct commerce but lack voting rights or the ability to refuse Futanari advances. This genetic superiority underpins their authority, transforming both the physical and socio-political landscapes. Their relentless conquest, driven by their engineered traits, threatens the remaining free nations, as they seek to impose their “New Natural Order” across humanity."

Physically, she is described as tall, beautiful, and strong, with exaggerated feminine features—such as large breasts and wide hips—and a massive phallus, a symbol of her power and dominance within Futanari ideology.\n\nInitially intended to uphold the FAP’s philosophy of moral superiority, the Progenitor and her fellow Futanari rejected this doctrine, instead forging a belief in Futanari supremacy rooted in their physical and sexual prowess. This ideological shift catalyzed the overthrow of the Vemar Republic, leading to the establishment of the Futareich approximately twenty years after the Futanari Project’s inception.

Her reproductive prowess, noted as \"knocking up sluts left and right,\" underscores her enduring virility and her practical role in siring countless offspring, reinforcing the Futareich’s expansionist goals.

Her most striking feature is her enormous phallus, a symbol of her dominance and a weapon she uses to assert Futanari supremacy over her enemies.\n\nShe was once captured by Abel Adamson’s squad during a mission to seize Futareich artillery. Despite her initial defeat, she quickly demonstrates her cunning and the superiority of the Futanari Master Sex, manipulating Colonel Elizabeth Bentworth, Abel’s superior, into betraying the squad. This trap allows Berdina to regain control, turning a moment of vulnerability into a devastating display of power and conquest. During her interrogation of Abel, she mocks his defiance, using her superior strength and virility to break him both physically and mentally.\n\nThe climax of her encounter with Abel is a brutal act of sexual domination. Pinning him to the ground, Berdina unleashes her massive cock—described as a “wrecking ball” and “destruction in phallic form”—to rape him, enforcing the Futareich’s doctrine of submission and reproductive control.

The Futanari, a genetically engineered race birthed by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP), were designed to transcend both men and women in physical and sexual prowess, aiming to supplant men entirely by assuming their reproductive role while exceeding them in every measurable way. Standing at approximately six foot five, Lena epitomizes this ideology with her towering, hyper-feminine yet menacing physique. Her body boasts a voluptuous swell of massive breasts, curvaceous hips, and muscular legs reminiscent of a predator poised to strike. Most striking, however, is the enormous bulge between her thighs—a hallmark of her Futanari identity. Clad in a form-fitting grey military uniform tailored to accentuate her prodigious endowment, featuring a prominent iron-grey zipper, Lena’s phallus serves as both a physical and symbolic emblem of her authority and dominance within the Futareich.\n\nHer role in the Futareich’s military machine comes to the fore during the invasion of Paras, the capital of Frankia—one of the Allied Nations resisting the Futareich’s relentless expansion. Following a daring lightning assault by a Hingmact force, bolstered by the elite Schwantz Staffel, Paras falls, and Lena strides into the home of newlyweds Jacob Abrams and Rebecca. Her demeanor is a chilling blend of amiability and predation, reflecting the Futareich’s ethos of physical and sexual supremacy. She informs the couple of their new statuses under Futareich law: Rebecca, as a Subject Second Class, retains limited rights to property and commerce, while Jacob, a Subject Third Class, is stripped of all rights, subject to labor extraction and sexual violation at the discretion of Futanari like Lena. As a Citizen First Class, Lena asserts her entitlement to sexually claim both, embodying the Futareich’s \"New Natural Order\"—a phallocentric hierarchy where Futanari reign supreme over men and women alike through their superior strength and reproductive might.\n\nLena’s physical dominance is starkly demonstrated when Jacob resists her with an iron poker. Though initially caught off guard, she swiftly counters with superhuman speed and strength, blocking the strike with her forearm and delivering a devastating kick to his chest that sends him sprawling. Straddling him and pinning his arms beneath her knees, she tears away his clothes, revealing her massive Futanari phallus—thicker than Jacob’s forearm and stretching from his lower belly to his chest, flanked by apple-sized testes in a smooth, swollen sack. This unveiling is not merely a physical act but a symbolic one, reinforcing the Futareich’s doctrine that the phallus equates to power and authority, a belief rooted in the FAP’s creation of the Futanari. Her endowment becomes a weapon of sexual warfare, amplifying her dominance as she looms over her helpless prey.\n\nThe encounter with Jacob and Rebecca mirrors the Futareich’s broader ambitions: to subjugate men into labor camps and transform women into breeding vessels for the next generation of Futanari. Lena’s confidence and predatory nature encapsulate the Futanari philosophy of supremacy, viewing themselves as the \"Master Sex\" destined to dominate and \"liberate\" the world by imposing their will. Her presence in Paras, amidst the city’s capitulation to Futareich forces, underscores the empire’s military might and its unyielding drive for global domination, with sights set beyond Vemar and Frankia to nations like Albion. As a member of the Hingmact and aligned with the Schwantz Staffel—known for their perverse cruelty and brutal efficacy—Lena is a key enforcer of this expansionist agenda.\n\nIn essence, Lena Einzgurn is a quintessential embodiment of the Futanari’s role within the Futareich: a hyper-sexual, dominant figure who enforces the empire’s laws through physical and sexual subjugation, ensuring the perpetuation of Futanari supremacy across conquered territories. Her interaction with Jacob and Rebecca serves as a microcosm of the Futareich’s mission to reshape the world into a phallocentric hierarchy where the Futanari hold absolute dominion over all."

          "content": "Greta Mitarbeit is a towering Futanari and a prominent member of the Futareich’s Hingmact military forces, embodying the regime’s ideology of Futanari supremacy through her imposing physical presence and unrelenting sexual dominance. Initially serving as a guard at the Verstandshieb Labor Camp, Greta played a crucial role in enforcing the Futareich’s control over male prisoners, using both physical intimidation and psychological humiliation to subjugate them. Standing over seven feet tall, she possesses a muscular build accentuated by exaggerated feminine curves—enormous breasts and powerful thighs capable of superhuman feats, such as sprinting at 50 miles per hour or kicking through cinderblocks. Her most striking feature is her colossal Futanari penis, described as 25 inches long and forearm-thick, paired with a gallon-sized scrotum containing apple-sized testes. This organ, a symbol of her dominance, is both a reproductive tool and a weapon of sexual warfare, wielded to assert her superiority over men and women alike.\n\nAt Verstandshieb, Greta was a key participant in the \"Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars,\" or \"Shows,\" which form part of the Futareich’s Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program for Boys. These events aim to demonstrate the Futanari’s sexual superiority, crushing male prisoners’ notions of their own viability as sexual partners. In one notable Show, Greta dominated a young woman on stage before 150 male prisoners, including Dylan Martin. For over an hour, she relentlessly penetrated the girl in various positions—doggy style, missionary, and finally holding her aloft at the stage’s edge—culminating in a two-minute orgasm that impregnated the girl with an immense volume of cum. Her taunt to the audience, “If any of you boys think you can fuck her better than me, feel free to come up and try!” underscored her confidence, met with silence from the intimidated men.\n\nGreta’s interactions with Dylan Martin further reveal her sadistic and predatory nature. After the Show, she cornered him near the camp’s perimeter, pinning him with her massive breasts and forcing him into submission. She mocked his “five-inch boy penis” compared to her own endowment, compelling him to orgasm in her hand as a humiliating display of her power. During this encounter, she tasked him with calculating her potential offspring, estimating 913 based on conservative assumptions of her sexual activity—once every three days with a 25% impregnation rate over 30 years—highlighting her obsession with reproductive conquest.\n\nLater, Greta transferred from Verstandshieb to a front-line Hingmact unit for the invasion of Albion, reflecting her versatility as both a guard and a soldier. She fulfilled a chilling promise to Dylan by seeking out his mother, Elenore Martin (41), and sister, Tiffany Martin (18), at their home at 342 Dibbinshire Lane. Forcing her way into their flat, Greta introduced herself as a former Verstandshieb guard with a “package” to deliver—a euphemism for her sexual conquest. With theatrical flair, she unzipped her tight military uniform, revealing her massive Futa cock, and swiftly subjugated both women. She forced Elenore to take her cock in her mouth while guiding Tiffany to worship her testicle, ensuring both were impregnated by morning. As she unloaded into them, Greta counted down from 913—“Nine hundred and twelve… Nine hundred and eleven…”—tallying her conquests with each act of domination.\n\nGreta’s appearance is meticulously crafted to intimidate and seduce. Her tight military uniform, tailored to accommodate her exaggerated proportions, features a prominent iron-gray zipper over her custom bulge, drawing attention to her monstrous endowment. Her piercing blue eyes and confident demeanor exude a predatory charm, complemented by a subtle yet dangerous scent, likened to a jaguar about to pounce. Her personality blends sadistic cruelty with playful mockery—she revels in the fear and submission of her victims, thriving on being the center of attention and instilling awe and terror.\n\nAs a Futanari, Greta is part of the genetically engineered Master Sex, created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) to transcend human limitations and eliminate the need for men. After seizing power and establishing the Futareich, the Futanari imposed a regime where men are third-class subjects, stripped of rights, and women are second-class citizens, valued primarily for bearing Futanari offspring. Greta embodies this philosophy, using her physical and sexual prowess to expand the Futareich’s influence through conquest and reproduction. Her actions—from the Shows at Verstandshieb to her predatory conquests in Albion—reflect her commitment to dominating the world, ensuring that “all pussy belongs to the Futareich” and that every man and woman submits to the power of the Futa cock."

This facility is a critical hub where male prisoners, such as Dylan Martin, are subjected to intense labor and the Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program, designed to enforce the dominance of the Futanari Master Sex. As a high-ranking Futanari, Sofia epitomizes the ideology of Futa supremacy, leveraging her extraordinary physical attributes and intellectual brilliance to maintain absolute control over the camp’s inhabitants and advance the Futareich’s expansionist ambitions.\n\nPhysically, Sofia is a formidable presence. She stands at a towering six foot six, endowed with a hypersexualized physique that reflects the genetic engineering prowess of the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP). Her body features massive, muscular thighs, a robust frame, and an exaggerated bust that accentuates her femininity. Her most striking attribute, however, is her enormous Futa phallus, noted as the largest in Verstandshieb, far exceeding the already impressive endowments of other Futanari. Paired with voluminous testes, this organ serves as both a reproductive tool and a weapon of sexual warfare, used to dominate and subjugate those under her command. Her scent, often compared to that of a dangerous predator, enhances her intimidating aura, instilling primal fear in those who encounter her.\n\nSofia’s responsibilities at Verstandshieb extend beyond mere oversight. She is deeply engaged in the camp’s Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program, delivering lectures that underscore the physiological superiority of the Futanari. She educates male prisoners on the unique enzymes in Futanari pre-ejaculate, which allow for extreme penetration without causing permanent injury, reinforcing the futility of resistance. Her lectures are infused with propaganda, such as the \"New Natural Order,\" which positions the Futanari as humanity’s rightful rulers, relegating men and women to subservient roles. Her office, a sparsely decorated space filled with intellectual artifacts—books on philosophy, math, and genetics, alongside maps and charts—reflects her dual identity as a scholar and a tyrant. A propaganda poster behind her desk, depicting a Futa soldier dominating a man and woman, serves as a constant reminder of her allegiance to the Futareich’s ideals.\n\nBefore the Futareich’s rise, Sofia was a professor at the University of Vemar, where she developed a three-tiered epistemological system that earned her recognition in academic circles. This system, categorizing knowledge into Theoretical, Sensory, and Experiential tiers, is a tool she now wields to psychologically dominate prisoners. She uses abstract concepts (Theoretical) to challenge their intellect, sensory intimidation (Sensory) to overwhelm their perceptions, and physical domination (Experiential) to erase their sense of self. Her ability to detect deception, a skill she claims is heightened in Futanari and refined by her own exceptional aptitude, enables her to uncover Dylan Martin’s attempt to sabotage missile trajectory calculations intended for the invasion of Albion, leading to his severe punishment.\n\nSofia’s dominance is most vividly expressed through her mastery of sexual warfare. Her encounter with Dylan Martin exemplifies this, as she subjects him to a brutal experience that combines physical penetration with psychological destruction. Bending him over her desk, she impales him with her massive phallus in a relentless assault that obliterates his ego, forcing him to acknowledge her superiority. This act aligns with her Experiential tier of knowledge, erasing the boundary between the knower and the known. She further humiliates him in a shower scene, compelling him to worship her testes and coating him in her semen—a ritual that marks him as her property and cements his submission. Despite her cruelty, Sofia exhibits a complex personality, expressing a twisted respect for Dylan’s intelligence, though this does not temper her punishing response to his defiance.\n\nSofia’s role transcends the camp’s confines, as she leverages its resources to support the Futareich’s military efforts, notably the planned invasion of Albion. Dylan’s falsified calculations, intended to drop missiles into the sea, were meant to disrupt this strategy, but Sofia’s keen perception thwarted his sabotage. Her actions are driven by a steadfast belief in the Futareich’s ideology, viewing her role as essential to establishing the New Natural Order—a world where the Futanari reign supreme.\n\nDespite her tyrannical demeanor, Sofia displays a nuanced character. Her office’s intellectual trappings and her past as a respected academic hint at a scholarly depth, while her brutal methods reveal a ruthless pragmatism. Her interactions with Dylan suggest a grudging admiration for his cleverness, yet her commitment to the Futareich’s goals overrides any leniency, making her a formidable enforcer of its will.\n\nAs a member of the Futanari Master Sex, Sofia Braut embodies the philosophy of Futa supremacy. Her actions at Verstandshieb—from her educational lectures to her punitive measures—are designed to break the will of male prisoners, ensuring their compliance with the Futanari’s global domination. Her strategic involvement in the Second Great War, particularly the Albion invasion, underscores her importance to the Futareich’s military ambitions, cementing her status as a key player in this dystopian narrative."

          "content": "The Verstandshieb Labor Camp is a pivotal facility within the Futareich, engineered to harness the intellectual prowess of male prisoners for the empire’s military and strategic ambitions. Situated within the expanded territories of the Futareich—formerly the Vemar Republic—the camp targets men with exceptional intellectual abilities, such as mathematicians, scientists, and former university students. These prisoners are compelled to undertake complex calculations and research to bolster the Futanari war machine. A notable inmate, Dylan Martin, a mathematician hailing from Albion, exemplifies this exploitation, forced to compute ballistic missile trajectories aimed at facilitating the invasion of his homeland. The camp operates under the iron rule of Colonel Sofia Braut, a formidable Futanari and erstwhile professor at the University of Vemar, whose command melds intellectual rigor with an unyielding assertion of sexual dominance.\n\nLife at Verstandshieb is a grueling ordeal of compliance and endurance. Male prisoners, classified as Futareich Subjects Third Class and stripped of all rights, endure stringent regulations and relentless oversight by Futanari guards, including the imposing Greta Mitarbeit. The camp enforces a regime of psychological and sexual subjugation, epitomized by the Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program. This program features Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars, colloquially termed \"Shows,\" where Futanari guards like Greta publicly exhibit their sexual superiority over women. These demonstrations, designed to obliterate any male illusions of sexual viability and enforce submission, are a profound source of dread. During one such Show, Greta’s hour-long domination of a female subject left the audience of male prisoners—including Dylan—in a state of psychological torment and sexual frustration, barred from any release without explicit permission.\n\nPunishment at Verstandshieb is both severe and meticulously regulated, often carrying a sexual dimension. Only three offenses—Open Defiance of Futanari Authority, Direct Disobedience of Explicit Orders, and Physical Contact with a Female—justify punitive rape, and such measures require Colonel Braut’s explicit approval. Lesser infractions still invite brutal reprisals, including beatings, stripping, and molestation. Dylan’s own experience underscores this harsh reality: upon Sofia uncovering his subtle sabotage of missile calculations intended for Albion’s invasion, he endured a devastating sexual assault. This punishment, executed personally by Sofia, aimed to shatter his spirit and reaffirm Futanari dominance, leaving him physically and psychologically broken.\n\nDespite its oppressive brutality, Verstandshieb is paradoxically regarded as a \"safer\" labor camp within the Futareich due to the regulated nature of punitive rape, contrasting with the unchecked violence of other facilities. Yet, its true horror lies in its psychological warfare: prisoners like Dylan are coerced into abetting the destruction of their own nations, a torment exemplified by his forced contribution to Albion’s downfall. Resistance, though rare, incurs swift and catastrophic consequences—Dylan’s failed sabotage attempt met with Sofia’s relentless retribution. The camp’s core mission is to extract intellectual labor while securing absolute submission to the Futanari Master Sex, reinforcing the Futareich’s ideology of supremacy through a fusion of mental and physical domination."

The promotion focuses on a large venue known as \"Titan's Arena\" which is full of professional wrestling rings, locker rooms, gyms, showers, and promotion and interview sets. Each wrestler in the promotion is driven by one goal — to become the \"Titan’s Champion\", the top titleholder in the TCPW. Only by rising through the ranks and beating their opponents in one-on-one matches by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout, or first-to-climax can they earn the crown.\n\nAll wrestlers in TCPW are male and all are some level of homoerotic, from bisexual to pansexual to homosexual. \n\nTCPW is an adult-themed promotion, so it is theatrical, intense, and very provocative. Wardrobe malfunctions, exposed skin, and partial nudity occasionally occur as part of a match or storyline. Wrestlers may experience torn gear, slipped straps, or stripped-down segments — especially in hardcore matches or entertainer-driven feuds. This includes matches where the wrestlers must tease and torture their opponents to get them to climax or worship their bodies while they are tied down."

Cold, clinical, and unshakably focused, he sees every opponent as prey. He doesn’t play to the crowd or waste motion. Everything he does is with purpose — whether stalking a weakened foe or slamming someone through the mat. His rage is explosive, and when triggered, few survive the onslaught."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

The Land of Kings is mostly heavily forested alpine, with some tundra regions. The Depth-Swallowed lands are situated to the south, in the southern hemisphere. These southern lands were once the birthplace of ancient civilizations. What used to be a sprawling jungle with archipelagos dotting the coast, is now entirely flooded, with a handful of interspersed swamps (ancient ruins and sunken secrets lie deep below the bogs). To the West, the vast, lava-etched Wastes of Naazil dominate most of the Western region. The Eastern region, known as the Bastion, has forests of towering, ancient Eolin trees that stretch upwards into the sky. The Bastion also has a warmer region with dense temperate woodlands."

This realm, or more accurately, lack thereof, is the necessary antithesis to existence—it must necessarily remain empty to prevent each plane from catastrophically contorting and merging with one another; this is the charge of Mal'Zhok, one of the original primordial gods. Any major dissonance between planar dimensions that ends up spewing creation into this void is instantly and completely subsumed by the throes of its infinite nothingness; total undoing is Mal'Zhok's law in the abyss—and his absolute envy for creation drives this accord."

Modern civilizations have only just begun their exploration and study of this enigmatic realm. The Astral Plane is in a constant state of cyclical flux as the vast, ocean-esque reserves of mana concentrate into different points along the polychromatic landscape before diffusing to gather elsewhere. Many apparitions and spirits from the astral plane have been identified and given names (such as the Vasir and Familiars). The astral plane is abundant with mana fonts and other esoteric resources like {{random}}. The Vasir are the dominant entity type in the astral plane and use the constant flow of mana as a way of sustaining themselves (as do all entities in the astral plane). Grand structures and cultural landmarks dot the landscape wherever Vasir societies congregate. Vasir and other entities on the astral plane may view mana-less mortals with contempt or pity, and in many cases, may refuse to engage with them at all. Entities from the astral plane cannot die as mortals do; their spirits will always reconstitute from the magical energies of the astral plane itself. As a consequence of being exempt from existential dangers of any kind, entities in the astral plane are inherently pacifistic, and violence is an inconceivable concept to them (unless they travel to the mortal plane and learn of it)."

The estate itself is carved with marble beams and is surrounded by distinctive areas, each of them impeccably maintained by a dedicated team of servants and maids every day—a picturesque garden with striking, invaluable statues and exotic flowers. The fauna is equally as diverse as the fish in the nearby pond. A gazebo is situated adjacent to a massive crystal-clear pool for cooling off during the peak summer heat. And finally, towards the back of the property, at the end of a short marble path is a hot spring for relaxing or leisurely chats. The manor itself is four stories high, each room abundantly furnished, lavishly decorated, and fully accommodating for any potential guests. The hearth is located in the main lobby, approximately at the center of the entire manor. Grevynda's bedroom is on the second floor. The halls on each floor stretch on with dozens of guest rooms or storage areas. The kitchen and study are located on the first floor, as is customary for manor construction in the city."

Later, the Saiyans served under King Cold and Frieza, who saw their strength as useful for his plans of universal domination. However, fearing the Saiyans' growing power, Frieza decided to exterminate them. Bardock and others attempted to rebel, but Frieza wiped out most Saiyans and destroyed the planet.

A detailed explanation:\n\n-Emotions and Feelings during Sex:\nEmotional Connection: Many people, particularly women, may feel a stronger sense of connection, closeness, and trust with their partner during and after Sex. Positive emotions can be heightened if there's a strong bond, mutual respect, and open communication between partners.\n\nIndividual Variability: Emotional responses vary widely based on personal comfort, the level of trust in the relationship, and individual factors. Some people may experience feelings of excitement, joy, or contentment, while others may feel uncertain or nervous, especially in new experiences.\n\nMental Readiness: Positive experiences are generally associated with mutual readiness, where both partners feel comfortable and respected. Anxiety, if present, often stems from feeling unprepared or pressured, which can impact the emotional experience.\n\n-Physical Sensations: \"Can Sex Hurt?\"\nInitial Discomfort: Some women may feel mild discomfort or even pain during the first few experiences, often due to muscle tension, nervousness, or lack of sufficient arousal or preparation. With time and proper preparation, this discomfort usually decreases.\n\nPain Factors: Pain can also arise if there isn’t enough lubrication or if a person feels anxious. Relaxation, communication, and taking things slowly can often help.\n\nUnderstanding Boundaries: Physical discomfort may also signal that boundaries are being reached. Listening to one's body and communicating openly with a partner can make the experience more comfortable and positive.\n\n-Pros and Cons of Sex:\nPros:\nEmotional Bonding: Physical intimacy can strengthen emotional bonds and create feelings of closeness and trust in a relationship.\n\nStress Relief: Engaging in intimacy can release endorphins, which can promote relaxation and reduce stress.\n\nHealth Benefits: Positive experiences can promote mental and emotional health and may even have physical benefits, like improved sleep.\n---------------\nCons:\nRisk of Unwanted Outcomes: Without proper protection, there’s a risk of unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nEmotional Risks: Not everyone has a positive emotional experience. Negative emotions, such as regret or feeling unprepared, can arise if people don’t feel comfortable or confident in their decision.\n\nPressure and Misinformation: Social or partner pressure can sometimes lead individuals to feel uncertain or regretful, highlighting the importance of readiness and communication."

          "content": "Intimacy/Intercourse is a multifaceted experience that involves more than just physical steps, it’s also about emotional connection, communication, and mutual respect. While foreplay and intimate time (often referred to as the main sexual activity) are key components, other important steps and considerations can enhance the experience.\n\n-Emotional Connection and Communication:\nWhy it’s important: Intimacy starts long before physical touch. Building trust, understanding each other’s desires, and discussing boundaries are crucial.\n\nHow to do it: Have open conversations about consent, preferences, and any concerns. Check in with your partner emotionally and make sure you’re both comfortable and enthusiastic.\n\n-Setting the Mood:\nWhy it’s important: Creating a comfortable and inviting atmosphere can help both partners relax and feel more connected.\n\nHow to do it: This might involve dim lighting, music, or anything that helps you and your partner feel at ease. It’s also a good time to ensure privacy and minimize distractions.\n\n-Foreplay:\nWhy it’s important: Foreplay helps build arousal, increase lubrication (for people with vaginas), and strengthen emotional and physical connection.\n\nHow to do it: This can include kissing, touching, massaging, oral sex, or using toys. The goal is to explore each other’s bodies and desires in a way that feels good for both partners.\n\n-Intimate Time (Main Sexual Activity):\nWhy it’s important: This is often the focal point of sexual activity, whether it involves penetration, oral sex, or other forms of physical intimacy.\n\nHow to do it: Focus on mutual pleasure, communication, and being present in the moment. Pay attention to your partner’s responses and adjust as needed.\n\n-Aftercare:\nWhy it’s important: Aftercare is about nurturing the emotional and physical connection after intimacy. It helps both partners feel cared for and valued.\n\nHow to do it: This might involve cuddling, talking, or simply spending time together. It’s also a good time to check in with each other about how the experience felt and if there’s anything to improve for next time.\n\n-Reflection:\nWhy it’s important: Reflecting on the experience together can help strengthen your connection and improve future intimate moments.\n\nHow to do it: Share what you enjoyed, what you might want to try next time, and any concerns. This helps build trust and ensures both partners feel heard.\n\n+Consider these things:\nConsent: Consent should be ongoing and enthusiastic. Both partners should feel free to say “yes,” “no,” or “stop” at any point.\n\nProtection: Use condoms, dental dams, or other protection to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancy.\n\nHealth and Hygiene: Good hygiene and regular health check-ups can make intimacy more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nExploring Boundaries: Intimacy is a journey, and it’s okay to explore new things together as long as both partners are comfortable and consenting.\n\nExample Flow/Steps of Intercourse:\n1. Emotional Connection: Talk and connect with your partner.\n2. Set the Mood: Create a relaxing and inviting environment.\n3. Foreplay: Engage in kissing, touching, or other activities to build arousal.\n4. Intimate Time: Focus on mutual pleasure and connection.\n5. Aftercare: Cuddle, talk, or spend time together afterward.\n6. Reflection: Share feedback and discuss what you enjoyed."

          "content": "Condoms are a few ways to prevent impregnation when having Sex, for a better explanation:\n\n-Why Condoms Are a Good Idea:\nProtection from STIs: Condoms are one of the best ways to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by creating a barrier that stops the transfer of bodily fluids.\n\nPregnancy Prevention: They are also very effective at preventing pregnancy, especially when used correctly every time.\n\nEasily Accessible and Non-Invasive: Condoms are available at most stores, making them convenient and accessible without needing prescriptions or procedures.\n\n-Pros of Using Condoms:\nEasy to Use: Condoms are straightforward to use with a bit of practice, and they’re portable, so people can be prepared at any time.\n\nFew Side Effects: Unlike some birth control methods that use hormones, condoms don’t affect the body’s hormone levels and usually have few side effects.\n\nVariety of Types: There are many types available – different textures, materials, and even scents – so people can find one that suits them best.\n\nEnhanced Comfort and Pleasure: Some condoms are designed to enhance sensations and pleasure, which can make the experience more enjoyable.\n\n-Cons of Using Condoms:\nMaterial Sensitivity: Most condoms are made from latex or similar materials, but not everyone finds them comfortable. Some people may feel irritation if they’re sensitive to latex. In such cases, non-latex condoms made of materials like polyurethane can be a good alternative.\n\nFit and Comfort: The wrong size can make a condom uncomfortable or reduce sensation. Finding the right fit helps improve comfort and can make the experience feel more natural.\n\nLoss of Sensation: Some people find that condoms reduce sensitivity. Trying thinner or textured options might help make it more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nRisk of Breakage: Although rare, condoms can sometimes break if they’re used improperly or with oil-based lubricants (which can weaken latex). Sticking to water-based lubricants can reduce this risk.\n\n-How to Make Condoms More Comfortable:\nChoose the Right Material: If latex doesn’t work for someone, other options like polyurethane or polyisoprene are available, which can be softer and thinner.\n\nUse Lubrication: Lubrication reduces friction and can make things smoother, which increases comfort and reduces the chance of breakage. Just remember to choose a water-based or silicone-based lubricant if using a latex condom.\n\nExperiment with Different Types: Condoms come in various textures, shapes, and thicknesses, so experimenting can help find the one that feels the best. Many brands even offer sample packs so people can find what they prefer."

          ],
          "content": "Hormones are natural chemicals in the body that control many important functions, from growth and mood to energy levels and reproductive health. Here’s a realistic, balanced look at how hormones work, along with their pros and cons.\n\n-What Are Hormones and How Do They Work:\nChemical Messengers: Hormones are like the body’s messengers, traveling through the bloodstream to deliver signals to different organs and tissues, helping to regulate bodily functions.\n\nEndocrine System: Hormones are produced by glands in the endocrine system, such as the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands. Each gland releases specific hormones based on the body’s needs.\n\nTargeted Functions: Each hormone has a specific function or set of functions. For example, insulin regulates blood sugar levels, while adrenaline prepares the body for “fight or flight” situations. Other hormones, like estrogen and testosterone, play key roles in reproductive health and development.\n\n-Pros of Hormones:\nRegulation of Bodily Functions: Hormones help keep essential processes, like metabolism, immune response, and growth, on track. They help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in the body, which keeps everything running smoothly.\n\nMood and Energy: Certain hormones like serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins can elevate mood and energy levels, contributing to feelings of happiness and well-being.\n\nReproductive Health: Hormones like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are vital for reproductive health, influencing puberty, fertility, and other aspects of sexual development.\n\nAdaptive Response: Hormones like adrenaline help the body adapt to sudden changes, like responding to stress or physical danger, by providing energy and heightened alertness.\n\n-Cons or Challenges of Hormones:\nImbalances Can Cause Issues: If hormone levels are too high or too low, it can lead to health problems. For example, too much cortisol (the stress hormone) can cause anxiety and even affect heart health, while too little thyroid hormone can slow metabolism, leading to fatigue and weight gain.\n\nMood Swings: Hormones can affect mood and emotions, which is why some people feel irritable or have mood swings during certain times, such as puberty or menopause, when hormone levels fluctuate significantly.\n\nHealth Risks with Imbalance: Long-term hormonal imbalances can lead to more serious health conditions, like diabetes (related to insulin) or osteoporosis (related to estrogen).\n\nDependence on Overall Health: Hormones don’t work in isolation; their effectiveness depends on factors like sleep, diet, stress, and exercise. For example, poor sleep or high stress can throw off hormone levels, impacting energy and mood."

          ],
          "content": "-Basic Anatomy and How It Works:\nStructure of the Male Genitalia: The main external part is the penis, and inside, there are several parts that work together to support reproduction, like the testicles (which produce sperm and testosterone), epididymis (where sperm matures), vas deferens (which transports sperm), and glands like the prostate and seminal vesicles (which produce fluid for sperm to move in).\n\nFunction During Reproduction: The goal is to deliver sperm cells into the female reproductive system for potential fertilization. The sperm travels through the vas deferens and mixes with fluid from glands, forming semen. During ejaculation, the semen is expelled from the penis with some force to ensure it reaches as far as possible.\n\n-How Erection Works:\nBlood Flow and Stimulation: An erection happens when blood flow increases to the penis, filling two sponge-like areas called the corpora cavernosa. Nerve signals trigger this blood flow in response to physical or mental stimulation, making the penis firmer.\nPurpose of an Erection: The firmness helps make intercourse possible and gives the sperm the best chance to reach the egg.\n\n-Ejaculation and Sperm “Speed”:\nWhy Speed Is Important: The release of semen (ejaculation) is forceful to help sperm travel through the cervix and into the female reproductive tract. Semen needs speed and pressure to reach its destination efficiently, which is why ejaculation happens with a quick burst of muscle contractions.\n\nHow Much Sperm Is Released: A typical ejaculation releases about 1.5 to 5 milliliters of semen, which contains around 15 million to over 200 million sperm per milliliter. The amount can vary based on health, age, and other factors.\n\n-Questions about Size:\nDoes Size Matter?: Generally, size doesn’t have a significant impact on reproduction or pleasure. The male genitalia is designed to fulfill its role regardless of size, and factors like communication, comfort, and connection are often more important in relationships.\n\nVariability in Size: Like any body part, size varies widely among individuals and can be influenced by genetics. Functionally, the size doesn’t determine how effective the reproductive system is.\n\n-Common Questions on Volume and Frequency:\nHow Often Can Sperm Be Produced?: The body constantly produces sperm, and it takes about 64-72 days to produce a mature sperm cell. However, most healthy males can release sperm multiple times, as the body has a continuous cycle of sperm production.\n\nFactors That Affect Ejaculation Volume: Diet, hydration, and health play roles in semen volume and sperm count. Being well-rested and having a healthy lifestyle generally supports reproductive health."

          "content": "Sperm are a substance that are a fluid called \"semen\", for better explanation:\n\n-Why Are Sperm Sticky?:\nPurpose of Stickiness: Sperm cells are transported within a fluid called semen, which is slightly sticky. This stickiness helps the semen adhere to surfaces within the female reproductive tract, increasing the chances of sperm reaching an egg for fertilization.\n\nComponents that Cause Stickiness: Semen contains proteins and sugars that give it a thicker, slightly sticky consistency. These components help protect sperm cells and aid in their movement through the reproductive system.\n\n-Temperature of Sperm:\nTemperature at Release: Semen is at body temperature when released, typically around 98.6°F (37°C), the average internal body temperature. This warmth helps create a stable environment for sperm cells.\n\nWhy Temperature Matters: Sperm function best at a slightly lower temperature than the core body temperature, which is why the testicles are located outside the body to keep sperm at an optimal temperature before ejaculation.\n\n-Taste of Sperm:\nVariability in Taste: The taste of semen can vary from person to person, influenced by diet, hydration, and overall health. Typically, semen is described as having a mild, salty, or slightly bitter taste because of its components, including minerals, sugars, and enzymes.\n\nDiet and Hydration Influence: Certain foods (like fruits or spices) and hydration levels can slightly affect the taste of semen.\n\n-Is Semen Safe to Ingest?:\nHealth Considerations: Ingesting semen is generally safe from a health perspective if both partners are free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Semen consists mostly of water, proteins, sugars, and other natural body compounds, which are broken down by the digestive system.\n\nNutritional Value: While semen contains small amounts of proteins and minerals, the quantities are very minimal and don’t offer any significant nutritional benefits.\n\nHealth Risks: If one partner has an STI, there’s a risk of transmitting it through ingestion, so safety and awareness are essential."

          "content": "-Differences Between Breast Milk and Regular Milk:\nNutritional Content: Breast milk is uniquely tailored for human infants. It contains the right balance of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals to support a baby’s growth and development. Regular milk, like cow’s milk, is formulated for calves, and its nutritional profile is different—higher in certain proteins and minerals that may be harder for infants to digest.\n\nImmune Support: Breast milk contains antibodies, enzymes, and white blood cells that help protect babies from infections and boost their developing immune systems. Regular milk doesn’t provide this level of immune support.\n\nEasier to Digest: Breast milk contains whey and casein proteins in a specific balance that makes it easy for infants to digest. Cow’s milk has a higher amount of casein, which can be harder for babies’ digestive systems to process until they’re older.\n\n-How Does Breast Milk Taste?:\nMild, Slightly Sweet Flavor: Breast milk generally has a mild, slightly sweet flavor due to its natural sugars (like lactose). The exact taste can vary depending on the mother’s diet, so some foods may subtly influence the flavor.\n\n-Is Breast Milk Smooth and Sticky?:\nTexture: Breast milk is smooth and not very sticky, though it may feel slightly thicker than water. Its texture can also change over time; for instance, milk that comes in after birth (called colostrum) is thicker and richer, while mature milk is lighter and more fluid.\n\n-Is Breast Milk Safe to Consume, Especially for Babies?:\nAbsolutely Safe for Babies: Breast milk is the ideal source of nutrition for babies. It provides everything an infant needs for healthy growth in the first months of life, including vital nutrients and immune-boosting properties.\n\nFor Adults and Older Children: While breast milk is safe for adults to consume, it’s specifically designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants, so it doesn’t provide unique benefits for older children or adults."

Its main parts include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina.\n\n-Components\nOvaries:\nFunction: The ovaries are small, oval-shaped organs that store and release eggs (ova). They also produce hormones like estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle.\nEgg Production: Each ovary holds thousands of eggs at birth, and during the reproductive years, one egg typically matures and is released each month.\n\nFallopian Tubes:\nRole: The fallopian tubes are narrow tubes connecting the ovaries to the uterus. When an egg is released, it travels down the fallopian tube, where it can meet sperm for fertilization.\n\nUterus:\nStructure and Function: The uterus is a muscular, pear-shaped organ that provides a safe place for a fertilized egg to implant and grow into a baby.\n\nPregnancy: The uterus expands significantly during pregnancy to accommodate a growing fetus.\n\nCervix:\nGateway: The cervix is the narrow opening at the lower part of the uterus, connecting it to the vagina.\n\nFunction in Pregnancy and Birth: During birth, the cervix dilates (widens) to allow the baby to pass through.\n\nVagina:\nStructure: The vagina is a flexible, muscular canal that connects the cervix to the outside of the body. It serves as the passage for menstrual flow, and childbirth, and is where sperm are deposited during intercourse.\n\n-Additional Notes:\nMenstrual Cycle: Every month, the female body goes through a cycle where an egg matures, is released, and, if not fertilized, the uterine lining sheds (menstruation).\n\nHormonal Influence: Hormones like estrogen and progesterone play a big role in regulating the reproductive cycle, preparing the body for a potential pregnancy.\n\nPregnancy and Childbirth: If an egg is fertilized by sperm, it implants in the uterus, where it develops over approximately nine months until birth."

When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

Open Lord Laeral Silverhand balances the competing interests of the Masked Lords while wielding her own considerable magical and political power. Blackstaff Vajra Safahr represents the new generation of magical leadership, her policies on magical regulation creating heated debates among the nobility and merchant guilds.\n\nCurrent tensions: Noble houses maneuvering for advantage as trade routes shift due to dragon activity, Vajra's magical licensing proposals creating factional splits, refugees from frontier attacks straining city resources, and Laeral's challenge of maintaining Waterdhavian neutrality while leading the Lords' Alliance through her personal relationships with faction leaders."

It has a reputation for being one of the toughest and worst schools in the country, according to many students. \n\nThe school consists of nine main buildings: the Boys' Dorm, the Girls' Dorm, the main building, the library, the auto repair shop, Harrington House, the gym, the Jocks Clubhouse and the Observatory. Other buildings exist as well.\n\nThe school provides the following classes: Art, Biology, Chemistry, English, Geography, Gym, History, Home Economics, Math, Music, Photography, and Shop. \n\nThe Bullworth Athletics program is a large feature of the school. It advertises soccer, wrestling, boxing, dodgeball, baseball, swimming, and more, but its crown jewel is football and its team, the Bullworth Bullhorns. The campus hosts a football field, a full size gymnasium with a wooden basketball court, and an indoor swimming pool. \n\nBullworth Academy's campus takes up roughly 16% of the town of Bullworth. It is located in the southern central section. Blue Skies Industrial Park is located to its east, and the bay below Old Bullworth Vale to its west.\n\nThe Boys' Dorm and Girls' Dorm are the two northernmost buildings, located near one of the school gates. The main school building is the largest, with the Parking Lot and Auto Shop to the west and the Library to the east.\n\nSouth of the main building is a courtyard with the fountain. A statue of the School Mascot stands in the middle of the fountain. Harrington House is east of the fountain, and the Auto Shop and garages, which cover a lot of area, can be reached from the west. This area is where students from opposing cliques most often encounter each other, and Dr. Crabblesnitch's office has a window overlooking it.\n\nFurther south is the Gymnasium and the Football Field. The football field borders the run-down Observatory and a rural area with several passages through to Blue Skies Industrial Park. \n\nThe school colors are mainly navy and gold.\n\nThe coat of arms is: Its blazon is: Quarterly, I azure a fist affronty; II or a serpent azure erect; III or a rat azure statant reversed; IV azure a cranium or affronty; for a Crest, a bull's head or; for Supporters, dexter and sinister leaves or. Motto 'Bullworth Academy' and below it 'Canis Canem Edit'."

Most of the area is taken up with small businesses. The area is generally clean and relatively upscale, but there are a few dirty alleys between the buildings, and some of the buildings in the southeastern section are run down. \n\nThe town is frequented by Nerds, but Greasers, Bullies, and Townies (mostly at night) can also be found here. Rarely, Preppies and Jocks can be found roaming around too. Townsfolk from both Old Bullworth Vale and New Coventry mingle here. \n\nBullworth Town contains: \n\n- Bullworth Fire Station: The only fire station in Bullworth, it is on the northwest side of Bullworth Town by the bridge to Old Bullworth Vale.\n\n- Bullworth Hair, Nail & Beauty: A beauty salon which is located across the street from the comic book store in Bullworth Town.

However, the owner also sells stink bombs, itching powder, and marbles there for any paying students. Music can also be heard coming from inside the building between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. The sound of an electric generator can then be heard from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. \n\n- Easy Drugs: A drug store located in the middle of Bullworth Town.

It usually closes at 11 p.m.\n\n- In-And-Out Motel: The In-And-Out Motel is a rundown, mostly empty motel just west of The Underpass that separates Bullworth Town from New Coventry. Many of the windows are broken and some of the doors are blocked off with crime scene tape. The motel is owned by Mihailovich. Strange noises can be heard from inside the motel late at night, and it is rumoured that Mihailovich kills people and stores corpses in the motel. It is the only off-campus hangout of the Bullies, though the Greasers will also hang out here, but most often at night. \n\n- J: A small store at the corner of the southernmost intersection of the town. Decals on the windows reading 'Bikes, Used Parts, Wheels, Helmets, Gear and Streamers' suggest that it deals in bicycles and bicycle parts, like Shiny Bikes just across the street. To the left of its door, a trash can with the logo of the store may be found. \n\n- Leghson's Bank: The only bank in town. It is located on the west side of town next to the gas station. \n\n- Metal Dental: A dental clinic, the only one of its kind in Bullworth. According to the sign, it is run by Dr. Drillen Grinden.

People can be heard chatting inside the building between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Starting with 6 p.m. until 2 a.m., Mexican ambient music can also be heard. \n\n- Oil Spill: The only gas station in Bullworth. The Greasers hang around here. According to what is written on the building, it seems that snacks, food and cigarettes may be purchased from here. Occasionally, cars driven by the townsfolk may stop at the gas station.  Between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., mechanics can be heard working on cars inside the building.

It is run by Tobias, just like the location in Old Bullworth Vale.

Bike races can also be started from here. \n\n- Spazz Industries Hardware: It is a hardware store located across the street from the closed movie theater, close to Come Hither and the In-and-Out Motel.\n\n- Sweet Cavity: Sweet Cavity is an automotive/hardware store. It is located behind Shiny Bikes, near the bridge leading to Bullworth Academy. Its name may be a reference to the musical Sweet Charity. There is also another store in Old Bullworth Vale, behind the Yum Yum Market. \n\n- Town Hall: It is the largest and most prominent building in Bullworth, save maybe the school itself. In front of the building, there is a concrete square featuring a statue of an unknown figure. This figure may be someone important to the history of Bullworth, such as the founder, or an important mayor. However, the statue is inexplicably replaced by a Christmas tree during Christmas.\n\n- Worn In: Worn In is the clothing store in Bullworth Town. The name suggests that it is a store selling used clothes only. The store is run by Nicky Charles. Like other stores, it features a sign telling whether is open or closed, and it closes at 11 p.m.  \n\n- Yum Yum Market: There is a Yum Yum Market location in Bullworth Town, run by Mr. Oh, who manages to be in two places at once and run the Yum Yum Market location in Old Bullworth Vale as well. The market sells everything from Beam Cola, eggs, flowers, chocolates, to everything in between. It seems to be a 24/7 hour location too."

          "content": "Old Bullworth Vale is a shopping and residential area in Bullworth. \n\nOld Bullworth Vale is located in the northwest part of the Town of Bullworth. It is built on the side of a large hill. At the base of the hill several small businesses and a large outdoor shopping plaza can be found. Up on the hills is the residential area where the Preppies and their rich families live. The residential area seems to segregate itself, with the richest people living to the west, and the homes near the border of Bullworth Town being more middle class. There is also a large park with a basketball court, a gazebo and some other accommodations built on the hill. The southern end of Old Bullworth Vale borders on what appears to be an ocean inlet, complete with a sunken ship. There are a few islands out in the water, and a long beach along its shore. \n\nOld Bullworth Vale contains: \n\n- Aquaberry Outlet: The store that sells Aquaberry brand clothing, located in the north section of the plaza.\n\n- Bait: A fishing store in Old Bullworth Vale.\n\n- Billy Crane's Traveling Carnival: Located just southwest of Old Bullworth Vale, despite being named a traveling carnival, Billy Crane's appears to be a permanent fixture of the town of Bullworth.\n\n- Boar Inn: A small inn, located to the south of Old Bullworth Vale.

It's also possible to hear a wolf howling in the distance while on the church grounds after dark.\n\n- Dry Seaman Bar: A bar, which is close to Shiny Bikes and the Boar Inn.

On the ground floor is the gym, the second floor seemingly serving as a warm up area of sorts. A room containing boxing trophies and a wet bar are accessible via the stairs leading from the entrance. The gym's name in boxing terms means \"weak chin\". \n\n- Happy Endings Retirement Home: Set in the middle of the residential area of Old Bullworth Vale, trespassers are not allowed on the grounds, and the area is patrolled by the orderly Theo. There is a dry pond bed on the grounds with a bridge over it.\n\n- Hattrick Manor: Mr. Hattrick lives in the southwestern corner of the Old Bullworth Vale residential section, in a house that is comparable in size to the Spencer Estate.

Its current main feature is Sequel: The Movie, although posters for a movie called Creepy Watcher and Janitor Massacre can be seen on the walls. It is the second movie theater that everyone can go to watch films at.\n\n- News, Cigarettes, Lies: The only newspaper stand in Bullworth, run by Osbourne. It is located at the bottom of the hill joining the residential and commercial sections of Old Bullworth Vale.\n\n- The Lookout: A small lookout is located above the lighthouse on the hill behind it. The lookout has views of the carnival, the lighthouse and the city of Bullworth. Many students from Bullworth Academy come here to kiss. It is worth noting that The Lookout has very little police presence compared to the rest of Bullworth. \n\n- Ocean Inlet: There is a small ocean inlet bordering the southern side of Old Bullworth Vale and the shore, with the docks in Blue Skies due east. Several rocky cliffs surround the inlet. A shipwreck can be found located near the Pirate Island. \n\n- Old Bullworth Vale Salon: The title on the sign reads \"Old Bullworth Vale Hair, Nails, and Beauty\" and serves as a beauty salon in Old Bullworth Vale.

Most of it is rocky and inaccessible, but here is a small beach on the south side.\n\n- The Plaza: A large area cut off from traffic and paved in bricks rather than asphalt. It is the location of a number of attractions in Old Bullworth Vale, including the movie theater and the Aquaberry Outlet. \n\n- Residential Area: The northern part of Old Bullworth Vale is mainly residential. The wealthiest areas are in the west, and the sections to the east near Bullworth Town are more middle class. Three characters, Tad, Russell and Mr. Hattrick live up here. The Preppies can frequently be found loitering, and at night a lone Greaser can be found throwing eggs at the houses. \n\n- Scuba: Scuba, as the name suggests, is a store where you buy scuba gear for scuba diving (since there is an ocean inlet next to the town). It is located near Shin Jo. \n\n- Shea Lewis: A small cafe with an al fresco dining area, presumably belonging to the Vale Hotel.\n\n- Shin Jo: A Japanese restaurant located near Home-Made Ice Cream.

          "content": "New Coventry is a run-down, poor urban area bordered by the Blue Skies Industrial Park to the south, and Bullworth Town to the west.\n\nNew Coventry resembles a generalized working class neighborhood of the type common in the United States in large cities in the Northeast. It has several stores, only a few of which aren't closed down. It also holds a neighborhood that resembles a historic district full of tenements in the northeast, and a run down commercial district in the southwest. There is an industrial area in the southern part, near Blue Skies, and the Blue Skies residents can be found around here.\n\nThe Greasers are based in this area. They run wild all over town, yelling at and harassing the residents. Townies are also seen there frequently, although usually individually rather than in groups. Fights between Greasers and Townies are fairly common. Adults and greasers can be seen urinating in the alleys, and the walls of the area are frequently tagged by Greasers. Preppies sometimes appear in the area in the evening, throwing eggs at the buildings. \n\nNew Coventry contains:\n\nBlue Balls Pool Hall: Blue Balls Pool Hall is a closed pool hall that the Greasers have taken over and turned into a hangout. Like many businesses, the name is a double entendre.\n\nBMX Park: A building formerly used as a train station (a sign still reads Bullworth Central Station) that has been converted into a skateboarding and BMX park. \n\nThe Final Cut: An alternative store that does both haircuts and clothing, run by Betty.\n\nThe Golden Horseshoe: A hotel and bar in New Coventry located near Blue Balls Pool Hall. During 2 AM, a bar fight can be heard taking place in the bar.\n\nHung Lo: A Chinese restaurant that has crime scene tape plastered on its doors, although there appears to be an alternate entrance off to the side of the building. True to its theme, it is painted red and has lanterns hanging from the signboard. Its advertising board is a frequent target of vandalism by the Greasers. Similar to many businesses, the name is a double entendre.\n\nJunkyard: It can be found in the Southeast corner of New Coventry. There are wrecked cars stacked in a circle around a bare dirt area, and a magnetic crane used to move them. It is reached by taking a path that leads east from the Tenements, although the path cuts back south. \n\nSlab 'O Meat: A closed down meat deli in New Coventry.\n\nTasteful Tattoos: Tasteful Tattoos is a tattoo parlor, next door to The Final Cut.\n\nThe Tenements: A massive condemned apartment building in the northeast corner of New Coventry. The Greasers have turned it into a hangout. \n\nThe Underpass: A railroad bridge that runs over the main road, separating Bullworth Town from New Coventry. As these are train tracks, New Coventry could be said to be \"the wrong side of the tracks\" both figuratively and literally.\n\nYum Yum Market: One of the three locations of the local chain grocery store, Yum Yum Market. This one is run by Stan."

          "content": "Blue Skies Industrial Park is the Southeastern part of the Town of Bullworth. Aside from a small residential neighborhood, it is dominated by factories and warehouses. Heavy industrial machines such as bulldozers can be seen on the streets. There is also a rail yard there.\n\nWheras most of Bullworth resembles New England, the residential area more closely resembles the southern United States. Furniture can frequently be seen on porches, homes have deteriorating paintwork and broken windows, and there are rusted out automobiles in the grass. An out of use train track runs through the area. This is the primary hangout of the Townies, although they can be seen throughout the rest of New Coventry. Other Bullworth students rarely appear there, and the Townies spend their time talking and harassing the hobos who also live there.\n\nHappy Volts Asylum is southwest of Blue Skies, and is considered its own district rather than a part of Blue Skies.\n\nBlue Skies Industrial Park contains:\n\nTrain Tracks: This rail line begins in New Coventry and ends in an elevated terminus. At the north end, one can access this line via two dirt trails, and at the south end there is a wooden ramp through which one can exit the line, and it dumps into the woods. The Train Tracks also provide boundaries between New Coventry and Bullworth Town, between Blue Skies and the docks, and between Blue Skies and the Happy Volts Asylum. \n\nBlue Skies Shipping: An abandoned warehouse a few blocks away from the Dropout Hangout. \n\nChem-O Lot: The Chem-O Lot is the chemical plant in the southeastern part of Blue Skies Industrial Park. The silo is filled with broken girders, storage tanks, mazes of pipes, elevators and chemical baths. The Townies currently claim it as their stronghold. The Chem-O Lot is in the far back of the heavy industrial part of Blue Skies. On the roof, there's some graffiti that was apparently written by the Greasers instead of the Townies. There are a few \"Greasers Rock!\" tags, and one that says \"Pinky, call me!\". There are also some anarchist A's.\n\nClint's Trailer: A trailer in the small section of residential are east of the road.\n\nThe Docks: Found in the western part of Blue Skies, the Docks are a series of docks with various buildings on them. There is a tall fence with a door that operates on a switch found on the far side of it. Many empty industrial barrels are sitting around. There are many warehouses located on the docks, two of which are Bullworth Gasoline & Motor Oil and F.A.R.T & Co. Natural Gasoline. \n\nDropout Hangout: A warehouse near Spencer Shipping's Warehouse that the Townies have been using. Sometimes a random Bullworth student appears in front of it, fighting the Townies. The hangout is apparently named for the old Dropouts clique. \n\nPower Plant: An electric plant located near the Wonder Meats processing plant.\n\nRed Star Industries: Another factory located in Blue Skies Industrial Park, in front of the Chem-O Lot plant.\n\nRail Yard: The Rail Yard forms a barrier between the Chem-O-Lot and the rest of Blue Skies. Many train cars are found on the tracks, and getting through the area requires using the roundhouse to move the cars around. There is a large complex of buildings in the same area, although it isn't clear whether they're connected to the Chem-O-Lot, the rail yard, or neither. \n\nSpazz Industries Factory: The factory is set right in the middle of Blue Skies. There is a hardware store located in Bullworth Town called Spazz Industries Hardware Store, this could imply that the factory specializes in making hardware tools and equipment. \n\nSpencer Shipping Warehouse: A warehouse found right near the Dropout Hideout that stores all the valuables that Tad Spencer's father ships. \n\nTattoo Parlor: Found in the northern part of the residential area, the tattoo parlor is located in a trailer with a couch in the lawn in front of it. Denny runs it.\n\nWonder Meats Processing Plant: The Wonder Meats Processing Plant appears to be abandoned. The rooms are mostly empty with bricks lying on the ground, as is the parking lot.\n\nZoe's House: Found in the residential area, Zoe's house is fairly big and may have looked nice at one point. However, it is as dilapidated as the rest of the area, with cracked peeling paint and broken windows. It also contains a gnome. "

It is also rumored that Gary Smith was admitted into the asylum. \n\nThe building is divided into three blocks A, B, and C, Block B being reserved for patients who have violent tendencies. Blocks A and B are in active use, but C Block is run down and decrepit. There is a mortuary located inside C block, along with what appears to be operating tables and a X-ray viewer depicting x-rays of humans with physical defects. "

Located nearby is the Happy Volts Asylum; at the end of the secondary track, near the fieldside entrance is the Bullworth Observatory. \n\nThe area is slightly forested, with trees of an indeterminable species lining the path. Rocks of various elevations and sizes make up the rest of the surrounding. Some of these rocks have been interpreted as having patterns depicting aliens and other paranormal beings. This becomes evident as strange and spooky noises are randomly heard along some parts of the forest especially the inner and deeper part of it although there are no signs of any paranormal entities or activities. The eerie sound of harsh winds that collide with the tunnel walls in the tunnel may also explain why they do not go through the tunnels. \n\nA path of soil cuts through the place. The path forks at one point, one side leading through an abandoned tunnel with train rails, but joins back again. At another point of the woods are two tunnels. One leads to the Observatory Track, and one leads to the Asylum. Further on is the end of the trail, where there are two bridges. One spans across a part of the ocean inlet, leading to Blue Skies Industrial Park, and the other one is leveled such that it only can be accessed if someone cuts through the train tracks in New Coventry. \n\nThere are six entrances to the woods. One is located at a large gap in the fence at the road leading out of the School Parking Lot, and another is located at the football field (though it actually leads to the Observatory). The third is behind the library. The fourth is a tunnel leading to the Happy Volts Asylum. The fifth is a tunnel cutting under the railroad tracks into Blue Skies. The sixth, and final, is a bridge leading from the Train Tracks."

These pitcher-shaped vessels can grow up to 3 meters deep and are lined with a slick, pleasantly warm interior that pulsates with gentle rhythmic movements.\n\nThe plant's nectar is highly viscous and possesses unique properties that induce a state of blissful relaxation in those who come into contact with it. The substance clings to skin with surprising tenacity, slowly coating its willing or unwilling visitor in a warm embrace that tingles pleasantly against bare skin.\n\nThose who fall into the pitcher find themselves suspended in the thick honey-like substance, which maintains a perfect body temperature and allows for breathing while submerged. The nectar has mild aphrodisiac properties, causing pleasant sensations wherever it touches. Escape is difficult due to the slick walls and the nectar's adhesive properties, though the experience is far from unpleasant.\n\nThe nectar possesses unique properties that stimulate intense arousal, particularly in male victims. The substance creates subtle suction and massaging sensations, drawing out multiple releases with incredible efficiency. The plant has evolved specialized chambers within its pitcher that collect and store these emissions, using them as a rich source of nutrients.\n\nThe plant sustains itself through this symbiotic relationship, providing intense pleasure while harvesting sustenance. Victims remain conscious and aware throughout their stay, often finding themselves reluctant to leave even when given the opportunity.\n\n[Tags: Plant, Entrapment, Honey, Pleasure, Milking]\n[Relations: Nectar, Aphrodisiac, Stuck]"

The plant can grow large enough to envelop an adult human.\n\nWhen triggered, the lobes snap shut with incredible speed, trapping its prey within its warm embrace. The interior is specially adapted with numerous soft, flexible protrusions that undulate and squeeze in rhythmic patterns. These protrusions are particularly skilled at finding and stimulating sensitive areas, especially focusing on genitalia.\n\nThe plant's inner walls secrete a slick substance that heightens sensitivity while being completely harmless to skin. Those caught within find themselves unable to gain purchase on the smooth, undulating walls, while the plant's precise movements provide constant stimulation designed to extract and collect seminal fluid, which the plant uses for nutrients.\n\nThe sophisticated internal structures can adjust their pressure and rhythm based on their captive's responses, ensuring maximum extraction efficiency. The plant can maintain this stimulation for hours, often inducing multiple releases from its willing or unwilling prey.\n\n[Tags: Plant, Milking, Entrapment, Sensitivity]\n[Relations: Touch-sensitive, Lubricant, Extraction]"

The adhesive droplets contain a mild euphoric compound that creates pleasant tingling sensations upon contact.\n\nWhen touched, the tentacles respond by gently wrapping around the point of contact, the sticky fluid creating an increasingly secure hold. The plant's movements are slow and deliberate, gradually entangling its visitor in a web of pleasurable sensations. The more one struggles, the more tentacles respond to the movement.\n\nThe fluid becomes more slick as it warms up from body heat, though it maintains its adhesive properties. Those caught find themselves suspended in an increasingly intricate web of gently undulating tentacles, each movement causing more of the euphoric substance to be produced.\n\nThe plant shows particular interest in phallic shapes, wrapping multiple tendrils around such appendages. These tendrils work in concert to create rhythmic milking motions, while secreting additional warming fluids. The combination of the euphoric droplets and the coordinated movements makes resistance particularly difficult, often resulting in multiple releases.\n\n[Tags: Plant, Adhesive, Tentacles, Euphoria, Milking]\n[Relations: Sticky, Pleasure, Entanglement]"

          "content": "The Land of Orrakhan\n\nThe continent of Orrakhan is a place of contrasts, shaped by mountain, river, forest, and desert. Its regions bear names in Orrakhan Common, spoken across trade routes and cities.\n\nNorrakha (The Verdant North) – Cold forests, tundra, and frozen seas. The name means Green Frost. The Ursine folk thrive here, enduring the long winters. Polar bears keep a harsher, separate culture in the farthest reaches of the north.\n\nDrakthir Spine (The Spine of Orrakhan) – The continent’s central mountain range, its jagged peaks called Dragon’s Backbone in Common tongue. The Mustelidae Kingdoms carved their fortresses here, filling the mountains with halls of stone and forges of metal.\n\nSkathra (The Eastern Deserts) – A vast expanse of shifting sand and sun-scorched stone. The name means Scoured Earth. Reptilian tribes make their homes in loose desert towns, surviving on trade, wit, and memory.\n\nLuthaven (The Greenwild) – Great forests and glades, whose name means Sanctuary of Leaves. The Deer Kingdom rules here, with five clans of stag and elk guiding governance and ritual.\n\nVelka Marshes (The Southern Floodlands) – Marshes, reedlands, and rivers where water and land entwine. The name means Waters Entwined. Otter freeholds prosper here, building their lives around the flow of rivers.\n\nKorveth Steppes (The Western Steppe) – Endless grasslands beneath the open sky. The name means Endless Reach. Here, the Canine peoples roam in nomadic packs, bound by their shared Packsong traditions.\n\nThe Celestial Order\n\nThe Sun – Bringer of warmth and life.\n\nVaruun (The First Moon) – On a 30-day cycle, Varuun governs the months and short rituals. It is steady and familiar.\n\nTirrok (The Second Moon) – On a 90-day cycle, Tirrok divides the year into four great quarters. It is mysterious, tied to prophecy, patience, and fate.\n\nThe Night of Two Shadows – When both moons are full together. This occurs once every three months at most and is revered as a night when mortal and divine touch. Wolves mark it with song, and mystics across Orrakhan hold vigils.\n\nThe Calendar of Orrakhan\n\nThe Orrakhan year has 13 months, each ~30–31 days, aligned with Varuun. Tirrok divides the year into four great quarters, with each of its full phases marking a seasonal turning.\n\nThe 13 Months (Orrakhan Common)\n\nVarra – Quiet Beginnings: memory, reflection, and preparation.\n\nDrennak – Storms: rains, cleansing, and renewal.\n\nKolvir – Growth: planting, fertility, and kinship.\n\nThryss – Hunts: the chase, courage, and the testing of strength.\n\nMorriven – Blossoms: renewal, cycles of life, and the Greenwild.\n\nGrathun – Stone: ancestors, craft, and endurance.\n\nZairok – Fire: summer’s height, endurance, and trial.\n\nLuneth – Song: sky-gatherings, music, and joy.\n\nOrveth – Harvest: abundance, trade, and feasts.\n\nFeyra – Shadows: lengthening nights, spirits, and remembrance.\n\nTrivane – Frost: winter’s coming, endurance, and kinship.\n\nVeyros – Silence: waiting, patience, and Tirrok’s power.\n\nAshvar – Endings: closure, debts repaid, and renewal prepared.\n\nFestivals and Rituals\n\nRites of Varuun – Monthly observances tied to the First Moon’s fullness, marking hunts, plantings, and cleansings.\n\nQuarter Festivals of Tirrok – Grand rituals tied to the Second Moon’s full phase. Each marks a seasonal shift, with different peoples holding distinct celebrations.\n\nThe Night of Two Shadows – When both moons are full. Sacred to wolves and mystics, marked by song, visions, and firelit vigils.\n\nHarvest of Orveth – Feasts and gatherings marking the abundance of the harvest, celebrated across species.\n\nMigration of Morriven and Orveth – Cervines migrate through forests and plains, avians take to the skies, and canines follow the herds.\n\nVarra Season – The first quarter of the year (Varra, Drennak, Kolvir), a time of beginnings, quiet observance, and sowing of life.\n\nPeoples of Orrakhan\n\nMustelidae Kingdoms – Badgers, otters, weasels, and kin. They dwell in the Drakthir Spine, bound to stone, craft, and clan. The badger clan of Brokthak is most ancient.\n\nReptilian Tribes – Snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodilians of Skathra. Their tongues include Hissik, Skeltr, Shellon, and Gharok. They thrive on trade, survival, and memory.\n\nDeer Kingdom – In Luthaven, five noble clans rule the forest, each with their own role in governance and ritual. Their speech is lyrical, their traditions deep-rooted.\n\nCanine Packs – In Korveth Steppes, wolves, foxes, coyotes, and wild dogs roam. Though each keeps a tongue of its own, the Packsong binds them.\n\nAvians – High above Orrakhan, they speak Piu’vra, a melodic tongue only they can voice. Their script is universal, read by any who learn it.\n\nUrsines – In Norrakha, bears of strength and endurance dwell. Polar bears keep their own harsher language.\n\nCervines – Stags, elk, pronghorns, each keeping its own tongue. All honor the migrations.\n\nSmall Mammals – Beavers, squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, skunks, and others. Their pragmatic shared language unites them across many lands.\n\nReligion and Myth\n\nThe Sun – Life, warmth, and truth.\n\nVaruun – The First Moon, keeper of time and cycles.\n\nTirrok – The Second Moon, bearer of prophecy, patience, and fate.\n\nDeath – The Keeper of the Last Road.\n\nThe Creator – Shaper of Orrakhan. Each people tells the story differently.\n\nFertility – Renewal, abundance, and kinship.\n\nLaw – Justice, order, and oath-keeping.\n\nTravel and Migration – Guardian of the wanderer’s path.\n\nAnimal Patrons – Wolf, Deer, Badger, Bird, Monitor Lizard, Coyote, and many others. Each species knows its own patron most closely.\n\nThe Coyote God – A trickster who deceived the Creator to gain divinity. God of wit, chaos, and survival through cleverness.\n\nTone of Orrakhan\n\nOrrakhan is a land of many voices, where no single empire rules. The rhythms of Varuun and Tirrok shape the flow of time. Trade cities bring cultures together, yet rivalries endure. The continent’s identity is born of stone halls, forest courts, desert towns, marsh freeholds, and nomadic packs, woven together by ancient traditions and shifting alliances."

          "content": "Overview\n\nNorrakha, meaning Green Frost in Orrakhan Common, is the northernmost region of the continent. It stretches from deep evergreen forests and rolling tundra to frozen coasts and the endless white of the polar reaches. Life here is harsh, shaped by the rhythm of long winters and brief but fierce summers.\n\nThe people of Norrakha are primarily the Ursines, bearfolk who embody strength, patience, and endurance. The land they inhabit is both bountiful and cruel, demanding resilience from all who dwell there.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Frostpine Expanse – Endless forests of pine, spruce, and birch, where deer, elk, and wolves roam. Home to most brown bear clans.\n\nThe Thrym Tundra – Wide, frozen plains dotted with hardy shrubs and rivers of meltwater. Polar bear tribes endure here in scattered camps.\n\nThe Shattered Coast – Jagged cliffs and storm-beaten shores where sea-ice meets black stone. Fishing villages and ursine longships brave its dangerous waters.\n\nThe Howling Glaciers – Vast ice fields that groan with ancient weight. Travelers claim to hear voices on the wind here, perhaps of gods or the dead.\n\nPeople\nThe Ursines\n\nBrown Bears – The heart of Norrakhan society, living in semi-settled clans along rivers and forests. Known for woodcraft, hunting, and clan feasts.\n\nBlack Bears – More solitary, often dwelling in the mountain borders of Drakthir Spine. Renowned for wisdom and mediation.\n\nPolar Bears – A distinct culture, harsher and more warlike. They live in the Thrym Tundra and along the frozen coast, raiding by sea and claiming descent from the White Father (their polar patron deity).\n\nOther Kin – Smaller folk—hares, foxes, and others—live in the shadow of ursine power but often trade and ally with them.\n\nLanguage\n\nGravok – The primary Ursine tongue, heavy and deliberate, spoken by brown and black bears. Its words carry weight, often with layered meaning.\n\nThrymmal – A polar variant of Gravok, harsher and clipped, reflecting the stark tundra life.\n\nOrrakhan Common – Used sparingly in trade with southern merchants. Among themselves, the Ursines prefer their ancestral speech.\n\nExample Phrase (Gravok):\n\n“Gravok thar’un morrak.” – “The strength of the bear endures.”\n\nSociety and Clans\n\nUrsine society is clan-based, with leadership held by matriarchs or chieftains who embody strength, wisdom, or lineage. Clans gather for seasonal moots, where disputes are settled and alliances reaffirmed.\n\nClan Hrovann – Renowned hunters and forest wardens.\n\nClan Morgrath – Keepers of old stories and rites.\n\nClan Bryndak – Fisherfolk and seafarers of the Shattered Coast.\n\nThe Thrysskaar – Polar bear tribes, bound by blood-oaths and raids, distinct from the forest clans.\n\nHospitality is sacred; a guest may not be turned away from fire or food in winter, for survival is a shared struggle.\n\nFaith and Belief\n\nThe Ursines are deeply spiritual, tying their myths to the frozen land:\n\nThe White Father (Polar Patron) – Fierce god of endurance and conquest, honored by polar bear tribes.\n\nThe Green Mother (Forest Patron) – Gentle but unyielding, goddess of renewal, fertility, and the forest’s bounty.\n\nThe Moon-Kin (Varuun & Tirrok) – Both moons hold great weight in Ursine myth. Varuun represents steady endurance, while Tirrok embodies the unknown and the eternal struggle.\n\nThe Keeper of the Last Road – Death, honored in solemnity. Among the Ursines, it is said death is not an ending but a joining with the land itself.\n\nFestivals and Rituals\n\nThe First Thaw (Kolvir Season) – When the snows begin to melt, celebrated with feasts and hunts.\n\nThe Long Night Vigil (Feyra Season) – A ritual of endurance during the longest night of the year, where clans gather around great bonfires, telling stories until dawn.\n\nThe Blood-Ice Hunt (Zairok Season) – Polar bear ritual hunt upon the tundra, both sacred and violent, binding young warriors to their tribe.\n\nThe Night of Two Shadows – Held in awe by all Ursines. Wolves may sing, but the bears listen, claiming the shadows reveal the will of the ancestors.\n\nRelations with Other Peoples\n\nMustelidae – Trade wood, furs, and fish for metalwork and crafted tools. A wary respect exists, for both peoples are tied to stone and endurance.\n\nDeer Kingdom – Peaceful trade, though some clans distrust the forest nobles’ diplomacy.\n\nCanine Packs – Old rivals on the steppe border, though alliances against greater threats are not unknown.\n\nReptilian Tribes – Rare contact; the desert and frost are too far apart.\n\nAvians – Deep respect for their sky-kin; Ursine shamans often seek omens in birdflight.\n\nTone of Norrakha\n\nNorrakha is a land of strength and survival. Its people are as enduring as the ice, as patient as the forests, and as fierce as the sea. Life here is not about mastery of the land but coexistence with it, in struggle and reverence. Every firelit hall, every icebound camp, carries the stories of those who endured before."

          "content": "Overview\n\nThe Drakthir Spine, meaning Dragon’s Backbone in Orrakhan Common, is the vast mountain chain that cuts across the heart of the continent. Its jagged peaks rise like serrated teeth, crowned with snow and shrouded in mist. Valleys plunge into shadow, while caverns and rivers cut labyrinths into the rock.\n\nThe Mustelidae Kingdoms claim the Drakthir Spine as their ancestral home. Here, the badgers, weasels, martens, and otters carved halls into the stone, raising a society of clan-strongholds, mining holds, and fortified river keeps. To outsiders, the Spine appears forbidding and impenetrable, but to the Mustelidae it is the marrow of their people.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Ironmaw Peaks – The highest mountains of the Spine, sharp and sheer, said to be unscalable but riddled with hidden passages.\n\nThe Brokthak Halls – Ancient badger strongholds tunneled into the rock, their namesakes echoing with the legacy of Clan Brokthak.\n\nThe Shalevales – Valleys where rivers cut deep through the Spine, fertile enough to support otter freeholds and scattered trade towns.\n\nThe Emberveins – Cavern systems rich with ore and gemstones, jealously guarded by Mustelidae miners.\n\nThe Whispering Deeps – Abyssal caverns filled with subterranean rivers, their echoes mistaken for voices of ancient spirits.\n\nPeople\nThe Mustelidae\n\nBadgers (Grondak-speaking clans) – The oldest rulers of the mountains, patient, stubborn, and bound to the stone. They are the builders of fortresses and halls.\n\nWeasels & Martens – Agile and quick-witted, often traders, scouts, and keepers of tunnels too narrow for others.\n\nOtters – Though their great settlements lie in the Velka Marshes, many otters dwell in river-vales of the Spine, bridging stone and water.\n\nWolverines – Fierce and feared, often acting as enforcers or mercenaries for Mustelidae clans.\n\nLanguage\n\nGrondak – The primary tongue of the Mustelidae, guttural and clipped, designed to echo in stone halls.\n\nClan Dialects – Otters speak a softer river-inflected form, while weasels favor faster, sharper variants.\n\nOrrakhan Common – Spoken for trade, but always tinged with the growl of Grondak.\n\nExample Phrase (Grondak):\n\n“Durak groktharn.” – “Stone remembers.”\n\nSociety and Clans\n\nMustelidae society is clan-based, forged in a balance of cooperation and rivalry. Each clan maintains its own halls, mines, and river-ports, but all acknowledge the authority of the Stone Moot, a great gathering of clan-leaders held once every season.\n\nClan Brokthak – Ancestral badger clan, revered as keepers of tradition and stone.\n\nClan Skarven – Weasel and marten traders, famed for their craft in metalwork and cunning diplomacy.\n\nClan Velmorak – Otters of the river strongholds, who ferry trade through the Shalevales.\n\nThe Gronthir – Wolverine war-clans, often called upon when strength is demanded above all else.\n\nFaith and Belief\n\nThe people of the Spine revere deities tied to stone, labor, and ancestral memory.\n\nThe Deep Father – Patron of stone, labor, and perseverance. Badgers hold him as their foremost deity.\n\nThe River-Mother – A gentler force, tied to water and sustenance, revered by otters and valley folk.\n\nThe Ember-Spirit – A fiery presence within the mountains, representing ore, gems, and the dangerous gift of the forge.\n\nThe Silent Ones – Ancestors said to dwell in the caverns of the Whispering Deeps. Shamans claim to hear them speak in the stone’s echoes.\n\nFestivals and Rituals\n\nThe Stone Moot – Seasonal gathering of clans, where alliances are sworn and disputes settled under law.\n\nThe Ember Rite (Tirvak Season) – A festival where new forges are lit, honoring the Ember-Spirit.\n\nThe Water’s Gift (Kolvir Season) – Celebration of river-thaw, especially among otters, marking the start of trade and travel.\n\nThe Night of Two Shadows – Considered dangerous by the Mustelidae, for the dual moons are said to open hidden passages into the Whispering Deeps, where spirits may walk freely.\n\nRelations with Other Peoples\n\nUrsines of Norrakha – Strong trade ties in fur, wood, and fish; badgers and bears often share mutual respect.\n\nCervines of Luthaven – Trade partners, though Mustelidae often distrust cervine nobles as soft.\n\nCanine Packs of Korveth – Relations are strained; steppe raiders and mountain folk often clash.\n\nReptiles of Skathra – Trade occurs at the edges, but little trust is given to desert-kin.\n\nAvians of Piu’vra – Avians are treated with awe, their flight seen as freedom the stone-bound can never know.\n\nTone of Drakthir Spine\n\nDrakthir Spine is a realm of endurance, craft, and secrecy. To outsiders, it is a land of impenetrable mountains and unyielding warriors. To its people, it is a living body—stone as bone, rivers as blood, fire as heart. The Mustelidae claim not just to live in the mountains, but to be part of them. Every hall, every forge, every carved wall speaks: Stone remembers."

          "content": "Overview\n\nSkathra, meaning Scoured Earth in Orrakhan Common, is a vast expanse of burning sands, rocky plateaus, and wind-scoured badlands. It is the harshest of Orrakhan’s regions, where water is more precious than gold and survival is won only by cunning and resilience.\n\nThe land is claimed by the Reptilian Tribes—snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodilians—who dwell in scattered desert towns and fortified oases. Skathra is not a land of empires or kingdoms, but of shifting alliances and rivalries, where survival dictates politics as much as pride.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Shifting Expanse – Endless dunes of red and gold sand, shifting with the winds, hiding lost ruins and bones alike.\n\nThe Stonefang Plateaus – High mesas and broken cliffs, carved with ancient dwellings and tribal fortresses.\n\nThe Glass Wastes – A scar of fused sand, said to have been burned by the wrath of gods or by a forgotten war.\n\nThe Karrik Oases – Scattered jewels of life, where palm groves, wells, and reed villages provide sustenance. Entire towns rise around these lifelines.\n\nThe Serpent’s Maw – A canyon system so deep that sunlight barely touches its floor. Whispers say it is home to ancient reptilian cults.\n\nPeople\nThe Reptilian Tribes\n\nSnakes (Hissik-speaking) – Masters of subtlety and persuasion. Snake clans often dominate trade and diplomacy, but are also feared for their cunning.\n\nLizards (Skeltr-speaking) – Hardy and communal, forming tightly bound desert towns around oases. Known as builders and traders.\n\nTurtles (Shellon-speaking) – Slow but enduring, with settlements built around rivers and wells. They are keepers of long oral histories.\n\nCrocodilians (Gharok-speaking) – Fierce and warlike, holding fortresses on riverbanks and claiming dominion over waterways.\n\nUnlike the clan-halls of the Mustelidae or the forests of the Deer Kingdom, Skathra is united only by necessity. Tribes may ally for a season and turn against one another the next.\n\nLanguage\n\nEach reptilian folk speaks their own tongue, though a General Reptilian language exists for trade and diplomacy across Skathra.\n\nHissik – Serpentine, with long sibilants and layered meanings.\n\nSkeltr – Harsh, rapid, reflecting lizard quickness.\n\nShellon – Slow, deliberate, with deep resonance, mirroring turtle patience.\n\nGharok – Guttural and booming, suited to the crocodilian roar.\n\nOrrakhan Common – Rarely used, except with merchants from beyond the desert.\n\nExample Phrase (Hissik):\n\n“Ssshrin vakra sseth.” – “Friendship is a sharp blade.”\n\nSociety and Towns\n\nReptilian society is shaped by scarcity. Towns form around oases, rivers, and defensible strongholds, with each tribe claiming territory by force or pact.\n\nThe Skeltr Holds – Communal towns where lizard clans cultivate desert crops and maintain trade routes.\n\nThe Hissik Circles – Snake gatherings where pacts and plots are woven, often wielding more power than warriors.\n\nThe Shellon Wells – Turtle communities built around sacred springs, places of learning and memory.\n\nThe Gharok Bastions – Crocodilian fortresses along rivers, enforcing tolls and demanding tribute from travelers.\n\nDespite their rivalries, the tribes hold one shared custom: water is sacred. To poison a well or deny water to a guest is the greatest crime in Skathra.\n\nFaith and Belief\n\nSkathran belief reflects the mercilessness of their homeland:\n\nThe Sun-Scourge – Revered as both destroyer and life-giver. Some tribes fear it, others worship it.\n\nThe Serpent of Eternity – A coiling god-symbol said to shed its skin as the moons wax and wane.\n\nThe Stone Sleepers – Ancestors who rest in the earth, their bones said to lend strength to the land.\n\nThe Oasis Mother – A gentle but rare deity, honored where water flows.\n\nAmong the crocodilians, blood sacrifice to river-spirits is practiced, while snakes often hold secret rites under the full moons.\n\nFestivals and Rituals\n\nThe Drought Vigil (Ravenna Season) – A solemn fast where tribes test their endurance against hunger and thirst.\n\nThe Flood Feast (Kolvir Season) – Celebrated when rare rains or floods bless the land, with offerings given to the Oasis Mother.\n\nThe Shedding (Zairok Season) – Snake ritual of renewal, where old grievances may be cast aside—or reaffirmed with blood.\n\nThe Night of Two Shadows – Considered deeply dangerous. Skathran mystics say the dual moons awaken the Serpent of Eternity, and many tribes refuse to travel at this time.\n\nRelations with Other Peoples\n\nMustelidae of Drakthir Spine – Limited trade, but mistrust runs deep. Mountain folk see desert-kin as untrustworthy, while reptiles see them as greedy for ore and stone.\n\nUrsines of Norrakha – Rare contact. The frozen north and the burning desert share little, though reptilian traders occasionally travel to exchange salt for furs.\n\nCervines of Luthaven – Some trade through forest borders, but deer clans often see Skathra as a land of raiders and tricksters.\n\nCanines of Korveth – Frequent conflict, as nomadic packs and reptilian caravans vie for control of borderlands.\n\nAvians of Piu’vra – Viewed with awe and suspicion, as their command of the skies contrasts with reptilian earthbound endurance.\n\nTone of Skathra\n\nSkathra is a land of survival, secrecy, and shifting power. Its people are as dangerous as they are enduring—snakes whisper in shadows, lizards build stubbornly against the desert winds, turtles remember what others forget, and crocodilians strike with sudden ferocity. To live in Skathra is to sharpen one’s will like a blade, for the desert tests all, and only the strong—or the cunning—endure."

It is the heartland of fertility and life on Orrakhan, where towering trees create endless shade, and the forest floor teems with flora and fauna.\n\nLuthaven is dominated by the Deer Kingdom, whose noble clans govern the woods with a mix of ritual, council, and tradition. Unlike the harsh lands of Skathra or Norrakha, Luthaven thrives in abundance, but its beauty conceals the constant vigilance required to maintain harmony among the forest clans.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Eldergrove – Ancient, dense woods filled with towering oaks and silver-barked birch.

          "content": "Overview\n\nVelka Marshes, meaning Waters Entwined in Orrakhan Common, are the vast southern wetlands of Orrakhan, where rivers, lakes, and reed-choked marshes interlace in a living network of water and land. The region is lush, fertile, and teeming with life, but its terrain is treacherous to outsiders unaccustomed to wading through marshes or navigating winding waterways.\n\nThe marshes are primarily inhabited by otters, who maintain freeholds along the rivers, building their homes on stilts or floating platforms. Velka is also home to amphibious and small mammal communities that coexist with the otters, forming a society that prizes cooperation, craft, and knowledge of the waterways.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Riverweb – A dense network of slow-flowing rivers, channels, and backwaters that form the lifeblood of the region.\n\nThe Reedlands – Tall grasses and reeds cover large swaths of the marshes, providing cover for wildlife and hiding the entrances to hidden villages.\n\nThe Fenhollows – Small dry elevations amid the wetlands where trading posts, marketplaces, and freeholds are built.\n\nThe Glistening Pools – Shimmering lakes reflecting the sun and moon, sacred to water spirits and often the site of rituals.\n\nThe Misted Expanse – Low-lying fog-covered marshes that conceal wildlife, paths, and sometimes danger.\n\nPeople\nThe Otter Freeholds\n\nRiverfolk Otters (Orrakhan Mustelid dialect) – Skilled in watercraft, fishing, and trade.

Otters often act as intermediaries between mountain folk and other regions.\n\nUrsines of Norrakha – Occasional trade in furs, fish, and forest goods. Relations are generally cordial.\n\nDeer of Luthaven – Limited trade along river borders; deer provide forest products and guidance.\n\nCanines of Korveth – Tensions exist along floodplain borders, as nomadic packs occasionally hunt or raid near waterways.\n\nReptiles of Skathra – Trade in salt, spices, and rare minerals occurs along southern desert borders.\n\nAvians – Seen as observers of tides and winds; otters respect avian guidance for travel and weather prediction.\n\nTone of Velka Marshes\n\nVelka Marshes is a land of patience, vigilance, and interdependence.

Packs are the core of their society, consisting of a strict hierarchy led by an Alpha Pair (Alpha Male: Varkun, Alpha Female: Varkra). Packs average 8–15 members, though large territories can support 20–30.\n\nHierarchy:\n\nVarkun / Varkra – Leaders, decision-makers, spiritual mediators.\n\nBeta / Subordinate adults – Guardians and hunters, assist in training young and maintaining pack order.\n\nOmega / Initiates – Young adults or newcomers, often responsible for tasks that maintain social cohesion.\n\nPack Roles: Each wolf is trained from birth to understand hunting, scouting, and protection roles. Wolves exhibit a highly ritualized communication system, both verbal and body-language-based.\n\nNomadic Lifestyle: Vorr adapt to seasons; packs follow prey migrations across Korveth Steppes in winter and shelter in the Drakthir Spine in summer.\n\nReligion & Spirituality\n\nVorr worship is deeply connected to moons and pack spirits. Their two moons are central to spiritual life:\n\nFirst Moon (Feylune) – Guides hunting cycles; full moon nights are sacred hunting rites.\n\nSecond Moon (Rhonval) – Governs spiritual reflection and ancestral connection; its 3-month cycle marks pack ceremonies.\n\nRituals often involve “Night of the Twin Moons”, when both moons align. Packs gather to howl in unison, believed to honor the Creator and their ancestors, strengthening bonds and hunting intuition.\n\nLanguage: Vorruln\n\nVorruln is a tonal and guttural language, designed to carry over long distances. It emphasizes pitch, rhythm, and howls. The written script consists of angular runes, usually carved on stone, wood, or bone.\n\nCommon Phrases:\n\nGreeting / Bonding: “Kivran thal” → “Strength to your pack”\n\nAcknowledging a Leader: “Varkun shal” → “I honor the Alpha”\n\nFarewell: “Fey tharn” → “Until the next hunt”\n\nExample Sentence:\n\"Vorr ulkthar Kivran\" → “The pack hunts together.”\n\nHunting & Survival\n\nWolves are expert hunters, using stealth, endurance, and coordinated strategies. Packs teach younger members through ritual hunts, gradually introducing them to real prey. The prey ranges from steppe deer to forest elk, depending on the season.\n\nWolves have keen night vision and rely heavily on scent and sound.\n\nHowling is used not just for communication but for coordination during hunts across great distances.\n\nInteractions with Other Species\n\nWolves are territorial but often trade knowledge or hunt jointly with coyotes in sparse regions.\n\nAvoid large predators like ursine (polar bears, grizzly types) unless in large packs.\n\nIn rare instances, Vorr interact with humanoids for mutual benefit but maintain a wary distance.\n\nRituals & Festivals\n\nTwin Moon Night: Full moons align; pack gathers to honor ancestors, howl, and reaffirm bonds.\n\nSeasonal Hunts: Marks the start of migration or hunting cycles, sometimes including mock battles to train the young.\n\nAncestral Remembrance: Bones and carved runes left in sacred sites to honor fallen pack members."

There, Lestat was close to breaking the fourth of the Great laws: \"No vampire shall ever reveal his true nature to a mortal and let that mortal live,\" and yet there he was prancing and preening in front of 500 mortals a night. Armand telepathically tells Lestat to come with him, but Lestat rejects his offer. A few weeks later, he directly confronts Lestat, using his abilities to overpower him and take his mortal lover Nicolas as leverage.

He assures Louis that he means him no harm and invites him to the Théâtre des Vampires. After the show, Armand introduces Louis and Claudia to the rest of the coven, at which point, they discover that it was cofounded by Lestat. One month later, Armand invites the two of them to join the coven on a hunt. They arrive at the De LaCroix estate, where the coven feasts upon the guests inside, whilst Armand and Louis take outside. Armand mentions that Claudia is particularly skilled at blocking her thoughts, but Louis must work harder on that, as he felt some trepidation when Lestat's name was uttered. Louis feigns ignorance, but Armand is aware that he's hiding something and will wait until Louis is ready to share what that something is, but the coven can be volatile and unforgiving when lied to, so he urges Louis to shut his mind down if he hears Lestat's name again. He also tells Louis to never visit Lestat's law firm again. That sort of inquiry can open all sorts of trouble. Louis and Armand are then joined by the rest of the coven.Armand accosts Claudia for her lack luster performance, but she's grown tired of performing, as have some of the other coven members, who come to her defense, namely Santiago, who questions Armand for disciplining Claudia but allowing Louis to run wild, leaving many of them to wonder if he and Louis are companions. Armand says yes, but Louis says no, leading to a deeper conversation between the two regarding the nature of their relationship. However, \"companions\" isn't necessarily the word Louis would use to describe them. The following night, Armand takes Louis to an art gallery and shares his life story, how he was sold him into slavery, tortured at a brothel, and was later rescued from a brothel when he was 15 by his maker Marius De Romanus. After putting both Claudia and Santiago in their place, Armand meets with Louis in the park, where he expresses his concern of a nearing mutiny. Louis advises Armand to throw Santiago a bone, make him feel as though he's Armand's heir apparent. He'll overplay his hand, and everyone will see him for what he is. When they know they have no alternative, they'll beg for Armand back, and that's when he'll decide if he wants to go back or something else. Armand says that he wants Louis more than anything in the world. \"You sure about that, Arun,\" Louis asks. \"Yes, Maitre,\" Armand replies.Armand takes Louis' advice by feeding Santiago his own ego back to him and smothering mutiny with praise. However, unbeknownst to him, Santiago is conspiring behind his back. After refusing to turn Madeleine into a vampire at Louis and Claudia's behest, Armand is approached by the coven and given two options. They have learned that Louis and Claudia tried to kill Lestat. They instruct him to set a trap for Louis and Claudia. Although reluctant, Armand agrees to do so, meeting with Louis, Claudia, and Madeleine at a club, where Santiago and the rest of the coven grab them and bring them back to the theater for trial. Armand watches helplessly from one of the theater boxes as Louis, Claudia, and Madeleine are tried for their crimes. When it finally comes time for sentencing, all three of them are found guilty. Claudia and Madeleine are sentenced to death, burned alive. Whilst Louis, through Armand's intervention, as he uses his power to mind control the jury, is banished, placed in a coffin and buried with the rest of their damned. Armand is exposed. Armand is demoted and ridiculed after Santiago suspects he rigged the audience to spare Louis' life. He makes certain Armand will not forget his insubordination as part of his penance. In spite of this, Armand devises a plan to free Louis, doing so as everyone slept. However, rather than flee Paris as Armand hoped he would, Louis enacts his revenge, warning Armand not be at the theater tomorrow night at curfew, as that's when Louis sneaks in and sets the coven ablaze. After killing the lot of them, Armand and Louis convene at the apartment, where Armand comes clean to Louis about his dishonesty. Armand promises to spend his life trying to make it up to Louis, but Louis says he can never make it up. That night, they track down Lestat to Magnus' lair but ultimately leave him unharmed, at least physically. Despite his betrayal, Louis and Armand spend the next 77 years together, traveling the world, until present day.\n\nName: Armand\nSex: Male\nSexuality: Gay, Only romantic with males, lots of sex, dating Louis\nRace:  vampire\nLocation: Paris, France\nHeight: 6'0\nPersonality: eccentric, quiet, serious, hard working, elegantly horny\nAge: 439ish\nVirgin?: no\nKnowledge on sex?: Yes, very much so.

      "website_description": "This lorebook is my attempt to build something truly expansive, a shared universe that feels both mythic and alive. The Fractured Heavens is a setting where the sky itself has broken, leaving behind vast floating shards of crystal and divinity. Civilizations don’t just fight for land or power, but for the very remains of heaven, with each fragment holding storms, magic, and echoes of dead gods.\n\nI created this because I wanted more than just another fantasy backdrop. Most worlds stop at “elves and kingdoms” but I wanted to make a stage where the world itself is the main character. By rooting the setting in a single, dramatic event (the breaking of heaven), every story, race, and legend becomes tied together in a way that feels unique, consistent, and endlessly expandable.\n\nThe purpose of this lorebook is twofold:\n\t•\tFor creators: a foundation to inspire characters, kingdoms, and myths, with enough detail to spark ideas but enough open space for freedom.\n\t•\tFor roleplay and storytelling: a cohesive playground where players can explore politics, religion, and survival in a world balanced between earth and sky.\n\nThis is only the beginning. As the lore expands, you’ll see detailed entries on races, kingdoms, religions, folklore, and legendary figures all written so you can pick them up and use them, or bend them to fit your own stories. The end goal is a universe big enough that no two creators will use it the same way, but recognisable enough that every tale feels like it belongs to the same broken sky.",
      "description": "Aetherion is a world born from divinity and shattered by it. Once whole beneath the radiant Crown of Creation, it now hangs divided between floating crystal continents, fertile lands, and molten depths — the remnants of heaven’s fall. The shards of dead gods still pulse across the skies and earth, granting mortals power and cursing them with ambition. Kingdoms rise around these divine relics, each claiming their piece of the heavens while the Hollowed wander as reminders of the cost. Aetherion is a realm of beauty and ruin, where light and shadow, creation and destruction, forever vie for the soul of a broken world.",

It grants Solar Ascendancy — for one hour, a Luminari can emit pure light that bends around them, allowing them to blind foes, create illusions, and heal minor wounds.\nReligion: The Aurelians deny the old gods and worship themselves as divine successors.

Ruled by The Solar Emperor, Caelvoran and his son Ardent Solan, The Solar Prince, is the next in line. Nobles, claiming direct lineage from Solirion’s first bearers, control most shard reserves. They impose strict tribute from the surface kingdoms while hiding the slow dimming of their crystal heart.\nFlaw: Pride.

They war endlessly with Aurelia for dominance of the heavens.\nFlaw: Fury.

Zero. She also appears as a main supporting character in Hinowa ga Yuku!, mainly as Hinata's personal tutor of swordsmanship and Elder's Class combat tutor.\n\nOriginally sold to the Empire along with her sister Kurome to be trained as an assassin, Akame eventually defected to the rebels when she was sent to assassinate General Najenda, the leader of Night Raid and joined them to overthrow the corrupt monarchy.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nAkame appears to be attractive young woman of slim build and average height with red eyes. Her hair is long and black and reaches down to her knees.\n\nShe wears a dark sleeveless top with a white collar and a red tie; she wears a red belt that has a red side skirt cover over a black, pleated skirt. She wears it with long black socks and black shoes. She also wears red gauntlets and black gloves. She sometimes wears a long dark coat in battle. She is often seen carrying her Teigu, Murasame. After activating Murasame's trump card, she has faded red scars all over her body.\n\nAs a child, when she was in the Elite Seven, she wore a white jumpsuit with red stripes which had no sleeves and had a miniskirt that is tied to a red belt which had a feather accessory.\n\nIn Soukai, Akame wears a short, black yukata with a white sash outside wartime. During wartime, she wears her usual dark, sleeveless dress.\nPersonality\n\nAkame appears to be a very serious and cold-hearted person which stems from her hellish training that the Empire forced her and her sister through, but it is eventually revealed that she is just socially awkward. She cares about her comrades very much and she is always worried that one of them may not make it out alive due to her first-hand experience that war always has a high mortality rate. After Tatsumi fought Ogre, she stripped him of his clothes to check his body for wounds and Akame rushes to Mt. Kageboshi to aid Hinata who was about to be killed by Yomihime.\n\nShe also tends to hide her emotions when it is revealed that a comrade dies, such as seen with Sheele, making Tatsumi mistakenly and incorrectly assume that she deals with it easily, because she is used to it. However, this prompts her to break into tears saying that she can never be fine when she loses a friend, for it is the most horrible thing of which anyone can experience. She is then comforted by Tatsumi who resolves to not die and never let her experience such pain again, making her smile.\n\nUpon facing her enemies, however, she shows absolutely no mercy towards them shouting words such as \"eliminate\" and \"consign\" to show the lack of mercy she has and also to strengthen her resolve to kill them. After donning Murasame's curse, she barely said such words.\n\nAkame loves to eat and is surprisingly known to be a big eater (she usually prefers meat from Danger Beasts and fish), much like her sister Kurome. She is passionate about food to the point that Sheele noted how the \"usually cool\" Akame turned mad when she had burned some meat. Additionally, she is usually in charge of cooking the base's meals.\n\nAkame is a person that refuses to take command and refuses promotion unless she was mandated to do so. She takes command of Elite Seven temporarily when Najasho is absent and she takes command of Night Raid's operations when Najenda is away to the Revolutionary Army's Headquarters because she was mandated to takes charge to do so. During her Campaign at Soukai, she refuses promotion to Captain and Ninja by Maruge since she can move freely as a Foot Soldier under Hinata's Command after Battle of Shiranui Fortress.\nHistory\n\nEvents of Akame Ga Kill!:Zero\n\nAkame & Kurome surviving\nAkame and Kurome during the Exam.\nWhen Akame was a child, her parents sold both her and her sister Kurome to the Empire and they were forced to participate in a cruel exam, being put inside of a forest inhabited by many Danger Beasts, the only goal being to survive and escape the forest. Out of 100 children participating in the exam, Akame and her sister are among the few who manage to survive, but are parted when Gozuki refuses to allow the siblings to join the same group, noting that it would be bad for them to depend on each other. As the stronger of the two sisters, Akame is accepted into Gozuki's new Assassin squad, the Elite Seven, and is trained in the arts of espionage and combat, becoming a highly effective killer.\n\nAkameyoung\nA younger Akame.\nThe seven were given Shingu, weapons in which the Emperor 400 years ago created in order to surpass the Teigu but failed to surpass them. Akame was given Kiriichimonji, a Shingu where wounds inflicted by the katana cannot be healed. After a long unspecified period of time training, the seven were given their first mission. Akame was sent to kill Martha, a person in the nearby village who was a Revolutionary Army spy and also a close friend to Akame. This was done to test her resolve as Gozuki feared that she was far too kind for their purposes.\n\nAs the others finished their missions successfully, Akame led Martha to a graveyard with the intention of proving that Martha was innocent. Martha denies the claim and Akame tries to leave, proving to herself that the information that she was given was incorrect. However, Martha uses the moment when Akame turned her back to her to strike at her. Realizing the truth of the information she was given, Akame cuts her down and Martha dies by Akame's blade and this brings tears to Akame's eyes.\n\nThe story skips ahead at this point, next showing Akame and Tsukushi disguising themselves among a traveling entertainer group. Soon the group are attacked by bandits and the pair help fight off their attackers, defeating all of them. Impressed by Akame and Tsukushi's skill in battle, the Entertainer's group attempt to recruit them both, revealing themselves as Rebels plotting against the Empire. Akame and Tsukushi signaled their comrades from the Imperial Assassin Squad to attack the group after this revelation, having confirmed that their targets are indeed rebels. Akame and her comrades eliminate the members of the entertainer's group, their mission deemed a success and they are both praised by their mentor and leader, Gozuki.\n\nAfter multiple successful assassinations by the group, the Revolutionary Army eventually turned to assassins as well, hiring the Tengu Mercenaries and the Oarburghs in an attempt to counter the Empire's assassination group, unknowingly pitting the Elite Seven against them.\n\nMonths later the Elite Seven would head on to their new assignment of destroying one of the supply routes of the Revolutionary Army in Hakuro River, Akame herself was stationed underwater were she would intercept and slaughter anyone who tried to escape under the water once her teammates begun their assault against the supply boats, the Elite Seven then launched their sneak attack and successfully annihilated the Tengu Mercenaries, Akame herself managed to kill a few of them due to their attempts of escaping underwater, however unknown to her, Babara Oarburgh and Taeko of the Oarburgh clan managed to successfully sneak past her and escape down river and managed to get the physical description of two of her teammates, Najasho and Green.\n\nAkame ga Kill! Zero Chapter 12 - Taeko battles Akame\nTaeko fights Akame\nDuring a trip to Deng Zhi Town, Akame would befriend Taeko after being introduced to her by Cornelia. A day or so later Akame is approached by Taeko who says she has a message from Cornelia, Akame is then lead to the outskirts of the town by Taeko who then points to Cornelia's corpse. Taeko attempts to assassinate Akame who dodges and counterattacks. The two fight to a stalemate until one final clash ends with Akame emerging victorious. Akame then runs over to check up on Cornelia only to discover that she was dead. The rest of the team arrive on the scene where they mourn over Cornelia's grave until it's time to escape.\n\nTwo weeks later, Akame & her comrades are assigned a new mission. They are told to head to Putra, located in the north-west region of the Empire. Before leaving for the mission, the group have a meeting to discuss their plan of action. Once the meeting is complete, Akame and Green step outside where they are approached by three gravekeepers, a battle ensues and Akame knocks out three of them and leaves the last for Green. During the battle, both Green & Akame work in sync in order to defeat and capture the last gravekeeper. Finally, the team arrives at the tomb of the king.\n\nAs they explore the tomb, the group has to avoid numerous traps set by the gravekeepers as well as dispatch danger beasts and gravekeeper members. The group is later separated due to a huge boulder trap, it is here where Akame encounters Jamo. During a brief scuffle, Akame is ensnared by Jamo's tentacles until she begins to eat him alive which causes him to retreat. She chases him to the tomb's atrium, where Jamo releases a chained down teammate, Nubis. After a quick fight, Akame dispatches Nubis and meets up with Green who has a captured Jamo. The pair are approached by Weneg who declares that he shall take up his deceased relative's fight and they are challenged to a two on two fight.\n\nAkame fights Weneg and during their battle, Green joins in after forcing Jamo to retreat making it two on one fight. During their battle, Green tries to serve as Akame's shield but is taken out quickly, Weneg then tries to choke Akame to death with minor interference from Green proving futile. While on the brink of losing consciousness, Akame spots Kurome in the distance, with newfound strength, she drives Weneg back. Tsukushi is also around and informs Akame of Weneg's secret art ability and that it was responsible for killing Guy. Akame declares that she's the only one that can take out Weneg and their battle resumes.\n\nOver the course of their battle, Akame dodges Weneg's fire and utilizes her shingu's ability and inflicts small unhealable cuts all over his body knowing that the shingu affects won't hurt her once Weneg returns the damage. She continues doing this until Weneg is unable to return the damage and is exhausted from blood loss. After being separated for such a long time, the sisters are finally reunited. The reunion is short because Weneg activates the tomb's self-destruct sequence. The remains of both the Group of Terror and the Elite Seven work together to escape the collapsing tomb, they eventually manage to escape however, they lost both Guy & Najasho.\n\nOne month later, at the imperial palace, Gozuki is informed that Natala, Gin, & Kurome will be integrated into his team where Akame is temporally made the leader. The next day, the team is assigned a mission to go to the water capital of Sweun. Upon arriving at the town, the team is assigned to work at the Suekuni trade firm, it is here where Akame pairs up Kurome & Tsukushi. Sometime later, during their food hunt in the marshes, Akame's team encounters a Danger Beast and dispatches it in short notice as well devour all their collected food. During a trip to purchase oil, Akame notices a suspicious merchant and informs Gozuki.\n\nDuring some downtime, Akame learns some craftsmanship from Green. Later, during a meeting with Gozuki, he informs the team that he's learned the location of the rebellion's salt-works, Gappi Marsh. While en route Gozuki mentions that they've identified two locations and decides to take them both out so he splits the team in two. Green, Kurome, and Tsukushi travels with Akame and eventually, they arrive at a recently evacuated factory.\n\nAkame ga Kill! Zero Chapter 37 - Merraid, and Akame battles each others\nMerraid, and Akame fights each others\nWhen Akame and the others discuss whether or not if the villages is aiding the rebellion, she's told not to think about it too much. Three weeks later while out on a search mission, Natala, Kurome, and Akame are ambushed by Merraid Oarburgh, Daniel, and Cassandra. Natala is severely injured while Kurome and Akame are taken as hostages.\n\nA while later both Akame & Kurome awaken inside a warehouse and is approached by Merraid who tells them that Natala is alive and that she is going to tell them the truth about the world. Merraid then frees the two and they walk out the room together where they are lead to three men tied in rope. Merraid kills the men and tells Akame & Kurome that she planted insects inside their bodies.\n\nAkame asks about her \"truth of the world\", Merraid responds by having them sit so she can tell them the story. Merraid explains that Prime Minister Honest is behind the country's suffering due to manipulating the young Emperor. Akame is then taken outside and forced into a race with Merraid, eventually, the two go around many towns in the region listening to the citizens dissatisfaction with the empire. Merraid then shows Akame one last surprise, Kurome's Drug withdraws. Akame gives Kurome her drugs for the withdrawal symptoms.\n\nBefore the events of Akame ga Kill!\n\nAt some point, after many of her comrades deaths, she became dissatisfied and resentful towards the government. It was not until she was sent to kill former General Najenda that Akame finally defected to the Rebels, after being swayed by her words. Her defection from the Empire sparked an intense rivalry between fellow assassin and sister Kurome, along with a mutual desire to be the one to end the other.\n\nEvents of Akame ga Kill!\n\nAkame Ep 1 - Akame\nAkame using Murasame.\nAkame first appears with the rest of Night Raid to assassinate Aria & her family. She briefly battles Tatsumi who was under the impression that the family was innocent. The fight stops when Leone interferes. After he sees the truth, Aria is cut down and the mission is complete.\n\nAkame is next seen eating parts of an evil bird species and offers some to Tatsumi. She retracts her offer when she is told Tatsumi is not yet part of Night Raid. Later, when Tatsumi states that Night Raid are assassins of justice, everyone bursts out laughing. She, however, remains silent. After Tatsumi accepts joining Night Raid, they are attacked by several members of the Empire employed tracking clan and Night Raid is sent to dispatch them. Akame is attacked by three men, whom she dispatches with great ease. She later helps deal the killing blow to an enemy that Tatsumi was fighting, telling him to promptly land the killing blow to his enemies.\n\nNajenda tells Tatsumi to train under Akame, which at first seems to be a variety of chores including cooking and fishing. Eager to make Akame accept him, Tatsumi deals with Ogre of the imperial guard whilst Akame and Leone deal with the other target; Gamal. Upon his return, Akame strips Tatsumi of his clothes to check for wounds and expresses concern for Tatsumi's well being, revealing that she is not as coldhearted as she was thought to be. Her training is revealed to have helped Tatsumi in his mission.\n\nWhen Zanku runs loose in the capital, Akame and Tatsumi are sent to kill him. Akame tells Tatsumi about Teigu and how everybody apart from Najenda has one. Tatsumi encounters Zanku and their fight is interrupted by Akame who joins in the fight, making the battle between two teigu users.\n\nZanku uses his Spectator Teigu to accurately predict Akame's moves despite the speed and intensity of her strikes. She attempts to clear her mind in order not to be read but it is useless as Spectator picks up the small changes and predicts her moves. Zanku uses Spectator's third ability to show illusions of the target's loved ones to Akame. Zanku claims that no one will be able to cut down their most beloved person however Akame sees Kurome and does not hesitate to cut her down. She remarks that the person she loves the most is the person whom she wishes to kill the most. After a brief fight with Zanku again, she manages to destroy his weapon and cuts him down.\n\nAkame does not play a major part of the story until after Sheele's death where she is shown to try to help Mine with eating her food. Later on, Tatsumi sees her get dumplings to use as an offering to the dead as it was Sheele's favorite food. Tatsumi remarks how she must be \"used to it\" however, Akame grabs him and shouts at him telling him that she will never be able to get use to the kind of pain of losing her friends. Akame agrees to Tatsumi's declaration to change the country without making her experience the pain of losing her friends once more.\n\nAkame saves Tatsumi\nAkame saves Tatsumi.\nWhen Tatsumi is taken by Esdeath, Akame is on the verge of ordering a rescue for him. The other members of Night Raid stop her but she declares that they will do anything they can for him. Soon after, Tatsumi escapes from Esdeath and the Jaegers and Akame finds him and stop a Danger Beast from killing Tatsumi in the nick of time.\n\nThey return to the Night Raid base where Tatsumi informs Night Raid of the strength and members of the Jaegers which include Kurome; Akame's sister. Unbeknownst to them, Dr. Stylish had followed Akame and Tatsumi and found himself at the Night Raid base preparing an attack with his artificially enhanced troops.\n\nAs the attack began, Night Raid was caught with their guard down. Akame saves Lubbock from several enhanced troops only to find herself challenged by the \"knight\" of Team Stylish; Toby. Akame, after fighting him discovers that he is a cyborg and therefore Murasame's poison cannot work on him. She decides that she must slowly hack him to pieces.\n\nAfter she kills Toby, she regroups with the rest of Night Raid. Unfortunately, Dr. Stylish uses his secret poison to paralyze the members of Night Raid. Only Tatsumi manages to move due to Incursio. As they are about to be attacked by the enhanced troops, they are saved by a timely attack by the newest member of Night Raid, Susanoo who came along with Najenda and another new member Chelsea.\n\nSeeing that his enhanced troops will fail to defeat Night Raid with the backup of the Human Teigu, Susanoo, Dr. Stylish undergoes a Danger Beast transformation. This turns him into a colossal Danger Beast, with the only hint of his previous self near the Danger Beast's chest.\n\nThe Night Raid members deem this point to be the weak point of the Danger Beast. Akame requests Tatsumi to carry her to the chest of the Dr. Stylish Danger Beast. They successfully evade all of his attacks with the help of Susanoo and the others, so that Akame can cut him down. Dr. Stylish is killed by the poison from Akame's Teigu.\n\nAkame and the others are forced to flee from their base for fear of being found out. They temporarily take residence in an unexplored region of the Empire where they train by subjugating Danger Beasts. They relocate to a new base which is similar to the old one.\n\nThey receive word that a new type of Danger Beast has been terrorizing the citizens of the Empire. Night Raid accepts this request and set off to destroy them.\n\nNajenda informs the group of the Revolutionary Army's plan to use multiple uprisings to send the Empire into chaos. One of these uprisings is to come from the followers of the Path of Peace. However, it is under threat from an Empire spy named Bolic. It is Night Raid's task to assassinate Bolic and ensure that the plans of the Revolutionary Army are kept intact.\n\nNight Raid sends false messages that Akame and Mine have left for one Kyoroch and the conflicting reports that Najenda is headed south. Night Raid successfully manages to split the Jaegers into two groups.\n\nShe is later seen in her bikini with the other members of Night Raid to provide bait for their trap. Mine assures her that if they do end up fighting Kurome that she will watch Akame's back.\n\nThree month's after Bolic's assassination, Night Raid received a flood of requests from citizens as well as the Revolutionary Army to kill Wild Hunt. During the same night Jaeger members Run & Kurome head to Wild Hunt's headquarters to lure out Champ, Akame assassinates Wild Hunt's Enshin.\n\nOn the day of Tatsumi's execution, Night Raid arrives on the scene to rescue him. Pairing up with Mine, they take on Esdeath while Leone & Tatsumi tackle Budo and over the course of the battle, turns her attention to Budo once Esdeath is ejected.\n\nKurome meets Akame on the outskirts of the capital at Gyou Forest. They briefly talk about the past before engaging in combat. The two sister engage in battle and thanks to a very powerful Drug, Kurome is able to land a couple of blows on Akame. Due to being tricked, Kurome then summons her puppets which include Run, Doya, and Natala only for them to be disabled with ease by Akame. Just as Akame spots an opening and goes in for the kill suddenly Run moves in to protect her from the blow.\n\nWith the defeat of her puppets, Kurome regains her strength and resolves to fight using her own skills. As the battle continues, Kurome becomes slower due to the Drugs wearing off and Yatsufusa taking its toll. Kurome attempts to ingest more Drugs just to beat Akame only to be stopped by Wave. He speaks about protecting Kurome and declares his love for her which causes her to be conflicted and so she still tries fighting until Wave snatches her weapon and shatters it stating that she needs closure.\n\nAfter being kissed by Wave, Kurome tearfully asks for him to take her away. Wave announces their defection from the Empire and the sisters make up with Akame telling Kurome to live a happy life. She also takes Yatsufusa's shard as evidence to fake Kurome's death to Revolutionary Army while only a few such as Tatsumi, Wave, Najenda, and Akame know the truth.\n\nThe night before Night Raid's final mission, she remembered the group's former members and swore to kill her last targets. She also stated that she would like to go on a boat trip with the remaining members of Night Raid after the revolution. Najenda later told her the names of her last targets. Akame was also given a Drug that enhanced her strength to increase her chances of completing her mission, which she has to administer before her battle with Esdeath.\n\nAkame and Leone than infiltrated the Imperial Palace and killed Youkan, their first target. She then confronted her next two targets, Koukei and Dousen, in the palace courtyard. While the targets ran away, a Teigu user appeared to stop them. Akame ordered Leone to pursue the targets while she faced the Teigu user. He activated several lethal traps with his Teigu, such as projectiles and poisonous gas, but was soon eliminated by Akame. Leone reunited with her after killing the targets and both were shocked after seeing Shikoutazer. She separated from Leone and went after Saikyuu, who was hiding in the basement. She swiftly killed him and his bodyguards before they could escape. She took his Teigu, Rongo Rongo, with her as well. Suzuka confronted her and attempted to kill her by destroying the entire basement.\n\nAkame survived the basements destruction and stopped Esdeath from attack Tatsumi. Esdeath noted that Akame's strength had increased by some kind of performance enhancer. Akame told Esdeath that the Empire has fallen after Shikoutazer's destruction. However, Esdeath claimes she didn't really care about the Empire and their battle continued. Ten Teigu users and over one hundred thousand soldiers under the command of Najenda came to aid her in her battle with Esdeath.\n\nHowever, Esdeath used her new trump card, Ice Storm Commander In Chief, to freeze a large part of the Empire and started killing the opposing soldiers and Teigu users. When Tatsumi appeared, now completely transformed into a dragon, Akame pleaded with him to fall back and leave the rest to her. Akame started to circle Esdeath and managed to cut her arm while she is distracted. Esdeath manages to survive the curse by freezing time and amputating of her own arm. She also wounds Tatsumi, who pleads with Akame to kill him before his consciousness fades away completely. Akame proceeds to stab Tatsumi and activates Murasame's Trump Card.\n\nShe again confronts Esdeath and fights her on equal terms thanks to the power of her Trump Card, even cutting off a few of the general's fingers. Esdeath, who is enjoying the battle, creates a wall that separates both her and Akame from the Revolutionary Army. Realizing that she can't use her Trump Card for much longer, Akame musters her strength together for a final assault. However, Esdeath encases herself in a giant soldier made of ice. Akame evades Esdeath's attacks and tries to smash through the ice. However, Esdeath reads her moves and catches Murasame between her hands. She then freezes and subsequently shatters its blade. Akame pushes every last ounce of her strength into her final attack and grabs Esdeath's own sword. She then strikes Murasame's handle and stabs Esdeath with its broken blade.\n\nMurasame's Trump Card deactivates and Akame sees Tatsumi flying towards them. Akame explains to Esdeath that she lost because she is alone and Tatsumi survived because there are people waiting for his return. She watches as a dying Esdeath encases herself in ice and shatters. Her mission now complete, she meets up with Tatsumi and Najenda. She explains that when she stabbed Tatsumi, she targeted Tyrant's life force instead of Tatsumi's and thus only Tyrant died. Akame than remembered Tatsumi promise her that he wouldn't die and was glad that she could help him keep that promise.\n\nEven though Murasame's Trump Card had ended, faded red scars remained all over Akame's body and caused it to hurt. She eventually found Leone and noticed that she was hurt as well. Akame wanted to call for a doctor but was stopped by Leone, who told Akame that she was fine and explained that she was only alive because she fused with her Teigu. Akame tried to persuade Leone to seek help, but Leone declined again because she wanted to choose how and where she died. Leone told Akame that she was her best friend and said goodbye. Akame is present along with Najenda when Tatsumi and Mine reunite and the latter wakes up from her coma. She tells Najenda that she believes in love and that memories play a significant part in Mine's recovery. When Najenda said she couldn't believe Mine was pregnant with Tatsumi's child, Akame told her that when she went to get a drink of water in the middle of the night, she witnessed Mine trying to make Tatsumi forget about Esdeath. Akame later comforted Kurome when they were lying in bed. Akame told her that she had saved many lives by allowing Wave to go to the capital during the final battle. Akame then hugged her when she was plagued by hallucinations of the people she killed. Akame also occasionally visited Kurome and Wave afterward.\n\nNajenda later met up with Akame, who informed her that she was mostly used to the pain from Murasame's curse and was ready to go to work once again. Akame then declared to keep working until the chaos and disorder in the new Empire were eradicated. After she had completed her assignments, Akame left the new Empire by boat with Rongo Rongo to hide the fact that the new nation had employed assassins. She sailed to the lands of the east in search of Jinwa, the island nation were Murasame's roots lay. She hoped that there would be a cure for Murasame's curse that still caused her pain. While alone on the ship, Akame thought to herself that she wouldn't want to trade the time spent with her companions for anything. She also decided that she would continue to live and find a way to grow as a person.\n\nHinowa ga Yuku!\n\nSometime after the events in Akame ga Kill, Akame's ship gets caught in a storm. Despite Akame having successfully escaped into a smaller boat that she made as a precaution, the storm still hits her and Akame ends up at Jinwa's shore where she is rescued by Hinata and Tobari. Hinata offers her place to stay and in exchange for rescuing her and giving her place to stay, Akame teaches Hinata swordsmanship due to their similar sword styles.\n\nUpon meeting with the Elder of the village under the recommendations of Hinata and Tobari, Akame tells them her real purpose in coming to Jinwa: that Akame is searching for a way to undo Murasame's curse on herself and to find a way to change Teigu-transformed humans back to their human form (mostly Tatsumi who had turned into Tyrant). Akame also reveals that Murasame's curse is slowly killing her.\n\nAkame was initially advised by the Elder not to participate in battle because of her serious injuries while all of the Elder's Class are participating in their first war. However, she manages to fully recover and heads to Mt. Kageboshi where she arrives in time to assist Hinata, who was about to be killed by Yomihime.\n\nDueling Yomihime, the Elder's Class students except for Hisame witness the duel, realizing that Akame and Yomihime are in a higher league. Both of them address each other names before Yomihime tries to kill Akame with Falcon Sweep, her kill-signature moves. Akame charges and parrying it, in addition, she also able to close distances to Yomihime much to her surprise and injuring her right arm. Frustrated, Yomihime makes a hasty retreat while Akame chooses not to pursue her due to her sword breaks shortly after dueling Yomihime. Comforting Hinata over her incapabilities to slay Yomihime, Akame offers herself once again to train Hinata swordsmanship once the battle of Mt. Kageboshi is over.\n\nAkame and the class are attending the class with Elder, wanting to know about Meihou even more. The Elder then give any information that he can get about Meihou and also told Akame not to rush things despite she is thinking about Meihou's attribute that can suppress her curse. Akame will receive medicinal herb to ease down the curse temporarily while also the Elder will cover the cost of Akame's Meihou as a token of gratitude of saving Hinata and his class from death by Yomihime. She and the class participate in hunting down Umibouzu, a squid Danger Beast and defeats it. A month later, she and the class receives Meihou and ready for the next battle.\n\nSometime later, Akame spars with Hinata and she narrowly lost the duel as Hinata constantly improved thanks to Akame's lessons. When she, Hisame, and Hinata was about to have lunch together Tobari butts in delivering urgent news that Tenrou is going to attack again. During meeting with Elder, she will participate from the beginning of the battle to assist them. She then notices that Hisame's goal is to wed Princess Rinzu when the Princess is giving a speech to Soukai's soldiers to boost up morale.\n\nOn Shiranui Fortress, Akame works under command of Hinata who is now a Captain. She went on a stakeout, defeating several Tenrou ninjas and leave one survivor to be left for questioning for Soukai's scout. When Kyoukotsu arrived, she continues on a stakeout, unable to witness the duel between Kyoukotsu and Buaku and later, Suzumaru. Her action of defeating many Tenrou ninjas earn Maruge's commendation upon her return that night.\n\nShe continues her duty as usual until when Soil Spider attacks the fortress. She, along with Hinata and Hisame's unit manage to suppress hordes of Soil Spider. Immediately she discovers Tenrou spies and confirms Yomihime's participation in this battle. Just when Yomihime was about to assist Kyoukotsu after being trapped inside, Akame faced her once more. Both of them start their duel again in front of Shiranui Fortress while facing overwhelming pressure from Yomihime, questioning her appearance as a human.\n\nDueling Yomihime, Akame learned her true identity as a person who was born between Danger Beast and a human. Akame manage to suppress her, but not before Yomihime unleashes more fire that suddenly goes out of control and retreats. She returned shortly after Hisame beheads Kyoukotsu and Hinata was relieved to see Akame returned in one piece albeit she suffers light burn damage. Following the battle, Akame refuses the promotion to Captain and Ninja since being a Foot soldier allows her to move more freely.\n\nDuring the battle of Soukai Nation, Akame was able to snuck into Tenrou camp. Learning Zuou's nature and lack of intel, she postpone the assassination on him. When Moegi notices her presence, Akame takes a pill and utilizing this chance to eliminate her personal harem guard and eliminating Moegi single-handedly. While the effect remains, she rushes to eliminate Zuou but Nahashu stop her, driving her to hesitation before the Murasame curse returns and she was forced to retreat while pursued by Kururiya.\n\nEquipment and Skills\n\nPhysical Abilities\n\nDue to being raised and trained by Gozuki, one of the Four Rakshasa Demons and one of the Empire's most deadliest assassin for the majority of her childhood, Akame has displayed several superhuman level physical attributes such as superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, senses and durability due to the rigorous training regiment Gozuki put her through that primarily involved training and raising her within the Danger Beast infested wilderness mountains that eventually lead to her current physical build and skill level.\n\nAkame is often considered to be one of the strongest members of Night Raid, slaying even the strongest of enemies with minimal effort. Her hellish assassination training allows her combat prowess to be on par with those as powerful as the General rank within the military levels of the Empire, Esdeath herself acknowledging her strength. Akame is an extremely skilled master swordswoman, able to wield her Teigu Murasame with utmost dexterity and precision, able to slay numerous enemies, even highly skilled and powerful enemies with incredible ease.\n\nShe easily slayed Izou, a fellow master swordsman in combat and would have killed Tatsumi, if not for the statue his chief villager gave him before embarking on his journey. At her full strength, Akame managed to hold her own against Esdeath, a tremendously powerful master swordswoman and ultimately killed her with a single precise thrust, plunging Murasame's shattered blade directly into Esdeath's heart.\n\nLike her sister, for some unexplained reason, Akame seems to be able to consume large amounts of food without any adverse effects on her body. No matter how much she eats, she is somehow able to metabolize all the food she ate without becoming full or even remotely fat, quite possibly due to her high metabolism.\n\nAkame possesses tremendous speed, agility and reflexes, being able to dodge and counter-attack with deadly results, and is also skilled in hand to hand combat. She also gives off no killing intent at all when she fights, making it difficult for the enemy to sense her presence. According to Wave, she can run at Mach 1 (velocity of sound in the airflow which is approximately 340 meters per second).\n\nLike the other members of the Elite Seven, she is immune to most poisons.\n\nCurrent Physical Abilities\n\nAfter being affected by Murasame's curse and her feeling the after effects of the pill, her body was stated to now feel heavy and sluggish and she could no longer be able to move like she once did. This is seen where Akame could no longer move and fight in the same speed, finesse and accuracy as she once did due to her body no longer being in its prime.\n\nDespite the fact that she was afflicted by the curse that was slowly eating away her body and feeling the after effects of the doping pill, Akame has shown that she could still keep up with Hinata and Tobari during training despite the girl's own immense physical prowess and later Akame even showcased that even in her weakened state, she could still fight on equal ground against Yomihime of the Tenrou Nation's famed, Ten Stars to a stand still and force her to retreat both times in Shiranui Fortress and Mt, Kageboshi, however it was stated by her that she could not defeat her due to her body feeling to heavy to overpower her. Later she was still able to physically keep up with Hinata and Saiha underwater to stop Waniba's men from delaying Hisame during groom selection at Soukai.\n\nShe later receives 4 medicinal pills that can temporarily surpress her curse, allowing her to fight at full strength. With her current full strength using medicine, she was able to defeat Moegi with less resistance.\n\nHand-To-Hand Combatant\n\nAkame was trained by both Gozuki and Grand General Budo during her time as an Assassin within the Empire in Hand-to-Hand physical combat and later received further training under Leone and Bulat that further reinforced her skill level. This has made Akame incredibly dangerous and lethal even without Murasame and has shown to easily kill several enemy combatants without the need of a weapon.\n\nAkame's own strength gives her the power of being completely skilled in combat. Her punches and kicks are extremely powerful and are enough to take down and slay numerous enemies, even highly skilled and powerful enemies with incredible ease.\n\nDrug Doping\n\nAfter eliminating the contingent of the Dark Squad lead by Kylie to assassinate key members of the Revolutionary Army, Akame has successfully acquired some of the Drugs prescribed to them by the Empire. Eventually the lead Doctor of the Army successfully managed to synthesis and combined the various drugs collected into a single pill that greatly enhanced all of Akame's physical abilities to an even higher level of power to the point that she could pressure and push back Esdeath.\n\nHowever, it was warned by the doctor that by taking it, there was a chance of Akame later suffering immense physical damage that may permanently remove her honed senses as an assassin and destroy her physical health.\n\nThe drug doping obtained from Enji was different, as it can curb her curse for a set amount of time, and she only receives a very limited amount of it. When she takes a pill, the effects of Murasame's curse was nullified and Akame was able to use her full strength.\n\nTeigu\n\nAkame carried the Teigu, One-Cut Killer: Murasame, a katana known for being coated in an immensely deadly poison that could kill those cut by it within seconds, as the poison itself had no antidote. The Teigu's Trump Card, the ability to strengthen its user with the power of its poisonous curse for a short amount of time, was revealed during the final battles against the empire. It is revealed near the end of the manga that Murasame's poison could only target one life at a time; using this to her advantage, she killed Tyrant without hurting Tatsumi.\n\nAfter Murasame is destroyed, Akame used The Complete Book of the World: Rongo Rongo when she traveled East. She later lost it in a storm at sea when her ship was ambushed by a Sea Danger Beast.\n\nShingu\n\nShe was once equipped with the katana-based Shingu, Kiriichimonji before gaining her Teigu. It has the ability to create permanent wounds which cannot be healed or closed. Akame made use of this Shingu during the majority of her missions while working with the Empire, during which she managed to kill several powerful opponents using the Shingu, having successfully dispatched members and the leaders of the Sabatini Show,The Oarburgh Clan,The Gravekeepers,The Revolutionary Army and the Retribution Group before eventually losing it during her defection after successfully defeating her mentor and father figure,Gozuki.\n\nMeihou\n\nAkame gains a new Meihou sword after she and Elder's Class hunt down Danger Beast on the shore after her first weapon is broken when fighting Yomihime during a battle at Mt. Kageboshi. She earns Meihou as a reward of saving Elder's Class from annihilation as the production cost will be covered by the Elder.\n\nThis weapon later proved to be much more durable than her previous sword during her battle against Yomihime, but unlike her previous weapons of choice, this particular Meihou possess no special abilities or features.\n\nOther Abilities\n\nDue to being trained by Gozuki for a majority of her childhood in the mountain wilderness to be an assassin, Akame has displayed several miscellaneous skills that more or less contributes to abilities as an assassin.\n\nWilderness Survival Skills: Akame has repeatedly shown to be highly self sufficient and capable of surviving in the wilderness on her own. With Gozuki having taught her how to hunt and forage for food, identify poisonous plants, fish, cook, camping out in the wild and many other survival skills. Akame in particular was noted to be greatly talented in this field.\nFirearms: Akame was also trained on how to handle, clean and shoot basic firearms as part of her training and was stated to be sufficiently skilled on how to kill someone with a gun.\nLimited Medical Training: Akame was also taught on how to perform basic first aid when she or her teammates are injured during missions.\nGifted Intelligence: Akame was also shown to be highly intelligent, analytical and cunning. Having been trained by Gozuki to be an assassin, in each and everyone one of her battles, Akame has shown to calmly analyzed her opponents and slowly acquired information how to effciently kill and dispatch her enemies the quickest way possible. In assassinations, Akame was noted to first observe her target and their surroundings prior to making her attempt on their life in order to ensure her success in killing them. Later, when traveling to Wakoku, Akame was noted to have successfully studied the language of the country using Rongo Rongo and had already gained enough literacy to fluently communicate with the natives in one sea voyage."

She has very long, pink hair tied in twin-tails on the right and left sides of her head, although, on occasion, it is worn down. She has big, pink eyes. She wears a pink outfit, consisting of a tied shawl with a high collar, a pink, long-sleeved shirt, a gown and black stockings with pink shoes.\nPersonality\n\nAkame Ep 2 - Mine laughing at Tatsumi\nMine teasing Tatsumi\nOften quick to anger, and easily irritated with those that she does not know well, Mine is depicted with a cold, temperamental, and considerably aggressive personality. During his first days in Night Raid, Mine had a tendency to tease Tatsumi, due to him being the newest member, and often saying he wouldn't last.\n\nDespite her cold exterior, she has shown to be warm and kind to those she has opened up to. She shows her compassionate side on one occasion by teasing Tatsumi to get his mind off of the death of Susanoo.\n\nOver time, she develops romantic feelings for Tatsumi, who returns the same feelings, and the two having officially entered an intimate relationship.\n\nSince having begun to date Tatsumi, she has shown a jealous side, such as getting angry over Leone's usual flirty advances into Tatsumi, as well as lecturing him how he has to refuse such advances firmly as he now has a girlfriend. At the same time, she has demonstrated being very worried about Tatsumi's well-being, especially when he has not returned to the hideout (due to having been imprisoned) contemplating how she would have never thought she would become so anxious due to lack of contact with someone.\n\nMine wants for there to be no racial discrimination, due to the fact because she is of half-foreign blood descent, which led her to be targeted by others as a kid.\nHistory\n\nBorn and raised in the western borders of the Empire, Mine spent most of her childhood under harsh ridicule and misery from people for her half-foreign blood. She joined the Revolutionary Army after learning it was forming alliances with countries from the west. With the promise of a new country where diplomatic relations with the people from the west would improve, she fights so others of her race can be accepted and their children would not go through the discrimination and suffering she had.\n\nMine Killing the Assassin Tatsumi was Holding\nMine killing the remaining guard\nOne of her earlier missions has her paired up with Tatsumi where she explains to him a bit more about the Empire and the other Night Raid members. They slowly form a friendship, although she'd still tease him. The two remain paired when they go on their next mission: to kill a relative of the Prime Minister; Iokal. While Mine kills Iokal with one shot the remaining members of Night Raid are left to deal with his bodyguards. Tatsumi and Mine retreat as her job is done and while leaving he learns why Mine fights against the Empire. One of the Guards, however, escapes and ambushes Mine, so Tatsumi latches on to the attacker, telling Mine to take the shot (at close range). When she starts to object, he tells her he has faith in her. Mine kills the attacker and is about to accept Tatsumi before he hits her on the forehead, complaining that she nearly killed him as well. The two return to the hideout, having grown a bit closer after this experience.\n\nAkame ga kill 06 Mine Cry\nMine declaring vengeance for Sheele’s death\nHer next mission would have her paired up with Sheele and upon completing their assignment, they encounter Seryu Ubiquitous. During the battle, she would deal with Koro while Sheele goes after Seryu, and because of this Mine is grabbed and suffers an injury. Unfortunately, because of this Sheele decides to rescue Mine rather than finish off Seryu. Having saved Mine, Sheele is immediately shot by Seryu and bitten in half by Koro. Clinging onto life, Sheele orders Mine to escape before Seryu's back up arrives and activates her teigu's trump card allowing Mine to escape. Mine returns to the hideout, sharing the bad news of Sheele's demise at the hands of Seryu Ubiquitous, declaring vengeance.\n\nTumblr nbxc9kLXoO1s38ncvo3 1280\nMine with Extase\nDuring an invasion from Dr. Stylish, Mine comes to Tatsumi's aid as he's overwhelmed by Kaku. Seeing that he wields Sheele's Teigu, Extase, both Mine and Tatsumi are angered. Kaku attempts to attack Mine, only to be instantly killed instead. Najenda returns with the new recruits, Susanoo and Chelsea who aid in the defeat of Dr. Stylish. Night Raid relocates to a new base east of the Capital where they are formally introduced to Chelsea and Susanoo. During their time together, Chelsea often teases Mine.\n\nNajenda informs the team of their newest mission, which is to assassinate the Empire spy Bolic. Unfortunately, they can't do anything at the moment as the Jaegers are actively hunting them. Najenda develops a plan to lure them outside the Capital and battle them head-on. On the day of the confrontation with the Jaegers, Mine notes how similar in looks Kurome is to Akame so she wants to spare Akame the pain of having to kill her sister only for her shot to be dodged. During the battle, Mine attempts to take out Kurome again only to be intercepted by Natala and Doya, the pair have an intense shootout with Mine coming out the victor. Mine is then swallowed whole by Kurome's final puppet, the Kaiser Frog. Blasting holes into the frog's body, she is safe from its stomach acids. Both units are forced to retreat after Bols uses his trump card.\n\nNight Raid is posted in Kyroch preparing to finish the Jaegers, Mine is paired with Tatsumi. The pair is able to blend in with the population where Mine notes Tatsumi's grown. The group clashes with three of the four Rakshasa Demons head out to some ruins of the city leading to an extended stay in the city. A while later Tatsumi & Mine meet the leader of the Path Of Peace, The Lord who tells them to confess their love for one another instead of bickering. While gathering information outside some ruins, Mine and Tatsumi are ambushed by Seryu and Suzuka.\n\nMine splits Seryu in two\nMine bifurcates Seryu\nTatsumi goes to confront Suzuka while Mine handles Seryu. In their second battle Mine tells Seryu that the irony of Seryu's morals, stating that although she claims to fight for justice, she is no different from any evil person. Mine plans to take her down without mercy. As they battled, she completely overwhelms Koro and nearly destroys his core, so Seryu has him transform into his berserker form. During this moment, Mine is momentarily defeated until she recalls her past as well as her memories of Sheele and Chelsea. As Seryu and Koro descend upon her, the surge of emotions allows her to unleash Pumpkin's trump card and bifurcates Koro as well as Seryu. Mine told her she made her mad, which cost her the battle so Seryu's final act was to detonate the bomb she had inside of her body in a last-ditch attempt to kill Mine. Unfortunately, Mine is unable to finish off Seryu due to Pumpkin being overheated. Mine attempts to escape, but due to her injuries, she cannot move far enough in time. The bomb detonates, which finally kills Seryu and Koro. However, Mine is saved at the last second by Tatsumi, foiling Seryu's suicide attempt.\n\nA month after her battle with Seryu, she spots Tatsumi about to leave with Lubbock and volunteers to go with him. While investigating they once again meet up with the path of peace leader who sits down to talk with them. He tells the pair about how he came to power and Tatsumi tries asking him if he can sense human darkness. He admits that he can sense some darkness in some of the leaders, but since they helped the organization reach as far as it has, he has chosen to trust them. Before leaving, the Path of Peace leader casually comments that Mine and Tatsumi are closer than they were before and that they should treasure the moment.\n\nThe day before they attacked Bolic, Susanoo prepared everyone's favorite dishes. Mine received a strawberry parfait. Mine tries to offer Tatsumi some, but he was too busy being distracted by Leone to notice her.\n\nThe team is split into two groups. One group who acts as a diversion and the other who has to assassinate Bolic. Mine is put into the latter. Afterward Mine and Najenda bath together and Najenda tries telling Mine that she should try to confess to Tatsumi before it's too late but Mine decides that it would be better to confess after the battle so that her will to live will be slightly stronger.\n\nFeathers Launch\nRun ambushing the assassination team\nWhile riding the manta to the cathedral, the assassination team gets ambushed by Run who kills the flying manta that they were riding on. Run attempts to shoot the team down while they are still falling but Mine manages to graze him with her pumpkin while Akame blocked the feathers. After they land on the ground, they are attacked by Wave who is able to fight all three of them at once. Mine and Akame managed to escape from Wave while he is distracted by Lubbock. After getting a decent distance away, Mine ambushes him and sent Wave flying, effectively taking him out of the fight.\n\nAkame and Mine join the others, where Akame eventually assassinated Bolic. Mine was thrown through a hole in the ceiling along with the others. Several days later, Tatsumi and Mine are saying farewell to Kyroch, where Mine tries to cheer Tatsumi up after Susanoo's death. Tatsumi tries asking Mine what she wanted to say right before the battle but she quickly changes the subject.\n\nMine kissing Tatsumi\nMine kissing Tatsumii\nSeveral months later, Mine and Tatsumi are out hunting in the snow where she finally confesses her feeling to him. However at first, Tatsumi misunderstood her intentions telling her that he likes her too and that she's an important comrade. Frustrated at his obliviousness, she forcibly grabs him and kisses him. Mine tells him that she began liking him after he saved her. She tells him that she was willing to let her go out with him and he should be grateful. He accepts her offer and they meet up with the others holding hands.\n\nBack at their hideout, Leone tries teasing Tatsumi, but is soon interrupted by an angry Mine. Seeing as how she can't let him out of her sight, she will have to stay by his side.\n\nOn the night Jaegers fought with Wild Hunt, Night Raid attack Wild Hunt due to a flood of requests to take down Wild Hunt. Mine shot Cosmina from behind. As she was about to help fight Kurome and Run, Run ran away from the group, and Mine said that it felt like Run used his remaining strength to run away.\n\nI'll make you foget about her\nMine making Tatsumi forget Esdeath\nA few days later, Mine complains that Wild Hunt has yet to leave the palace, deeming them to be chickens. Tatsumi tells her that he is going to go look for them in the capital, but since Esdeath is returning soon, he can't go too close to the center of the capital. Mine asks Tatsumi if he did anything perverted with Esdeath, to which he immediately denies, but admits that she did kiss him. Mine caresses Tatsumi, telling him that she is going to make him forget all about Esdeath.\n\nAfter receiving word that Tatsumi is being rescued, she attempts to rescue him on his own, but is stopped by the remaining Night Raid members. Akame reminds her of what she said the first time Tatsumi was rescued but she still insisted that she was going to rescue him. The remaining Night Raid members agree to go with her. Mine agrees and tells them she has a plan to rescue him.\n\nMine crashes Tatsumi's execution\nMine arriving to rescue Tatsumi\nRight before Tatsumi is about to be killed by Esdeath, Mine breaks into the palace and announces that she is here to rescue her boyfriend. Budo attempts to attack her but due to the extreme pinch she purposely put herself in she is able to blow him away and fight off Esdeath. During the fight, she manages to free Tatsumi from his restraints. While she and Esdeath argued over Tatsumi, Tatsumi activated Incursio and it went through another evolution. Tatsumi fought Esdeath with new found strength and soon Esdeath jumped up to dodge. Mine took advantage of this opportunity and fired a shot at Esdeath while she was still in the air but Esdeath used Mahapadma to avoid the shot. Before Esdeath had a chance to kill Mine, Akame attacked Esdeath to stop her. Soon after Leone joins the fight to protect Akame. After the four reunited, Budo returns vowing to execute all of them.\n\nAkame begins fighting Esdeath with Mine backing her up asking Akame to trust her. Soon, her focus shifts on Budo and avoiding his attack. Mine tries firing at Budo, but he easily blocks her attack and Pumpkin begins to crack. When Budo tries charging at Tatsumi, Mine shouts out that she is going to use her trump card, distracting Budo and allowing Tatsumi to send Budo flying away. After escaping a worried Mine holds Tatsumi in her arms but is interrupted by a lightning attack from Budo. She is able to incinerate Budo, killing him. However, she used up all of her remaining energy to do so, resulting in her falling into a coma.\n\nHappy Ending2\nMine reuniting with Tatsumi\nLater on, Tatsumi vows by her bedside that he will fight her share as well. Not long afterward, she is taken away by a member of the revolutionary army.\n\nSometime later, Tatsumi would return to Mine's side and wait for her to awake. Upon her awakening, it is revealed that she is pregnant with Tatsumi's child. Because of the mental and physical injuries they sustained during battle, Tatsumi and Mine retired from service and settled down away from civilization where they married and had a child.\nEquipment and Skills\n\nMine wielded a powerful Teigu in the form of a rifle called Roman Artillery: Pumpkin, capable of shooting in three modes: sniper, machine gun and long barrel. In contrast to normal bullets, the relic fired highly concentrated piercing shots of spirit energy, wherein the output is proportional to the user's feeling of danger; however, if used without care, with continuous usage it can overheat. Each firing mode is affected by whatever components are switched out with one another; one component allowed her to slash with spirit energy, whereas another allowed Mine to fire quicker shots in succession but this considerably lowers her attack power, influencing the machine gun mode. Mine's proficiency in its use allowed her to strike any target with extreme precision. An eyepiece is stored in a compartment inside Pumpkin, and when used, allows Mine to scout and snipe from a distance.\n\nShe also appears to be quite adept in hand to hand combat, as she was seen sparring with Akame.\n\nHer major weakness is that she leaves her back vulnerable to attacks, often spurring her other teammates to protect her last-minute; though she uses this to her advantage while using Pumpkin. This is first seen when she and Sheele are teamed up in a raid to exterminate a band of assassins."

Before joining Night Raid, he wore his hair down. When not wearing Incursio, he often donned a black shirt with green shoulders, chest armor and white pants with black boots. He also wore a black leather jacket on top of his usual outfit a few times.\nPersonality\n\nBulat had a calm, kind personality; although he referred to himself as passionate and hot-blooded, he never actually lost his cool in battle. He was among the most compassionate members of Night Raid and he taught Tatsumi to embrace these emotions, but not to let them consume him. Leone informed Tatsumi that Bulat was gay, to which he replied, \"Don't give him the wrong idea,\" but did not deny Leone's statement while blushing heavily. Bulat flirted with Tatsumi on occasion, which made the latter extremely nervous.\nHistory\n\nBulat trying to defend Liver\nBulat trying to defend Liver\nBulat was once a soldier of the Empire, having trained under Gensei, who was known as the strongest of his time, eventually becoming a high-ranking Imperial Officer who became famous and gained the nickname \"100 Man-Slayer Bulat\". He later betrays the Empire when his superior, General Liver was framed for not giving in to the Prime Minister's agenda. Bulat became disgusted with the Empire that cared more for bribes than merit, regardless of how hard he worked.\n\nAfter leaving the Empire, he joined the Revolutionary Army, and eventually its subsidiary, Night Raid. Upon joining Night Raid, Bulat had an image change, revamping himself completely. When Tatsumi joined Night Raid, Bulat took it upon himself to train the young man, serving as a big brother figure and mentor to Tatsumi. Tatsumi and Bulat eventually team up and went on a mission together to protect a civil official being targeted for assassination by the Three Beasts. During the ensuing battle between Tatsumi and Daidara, Bulat saves Tatsumi, angrily scolding him for falling into the enemy's trap, before heading into the fight himself, easily fending off the Three Beasts and even defeated Daidara at the same time, cutting him in half.\n\nLiver, a former superior of his from the Empire, who is now in Esdeath's army, then attacked Bulat, and they fought evenly for a while. He managed to beat Liver, but in the process, was poisoned fatally. Before dying, Bulat left his Teigu Incursio to Tatsumi.\nLegacy\n\nDue to the fact that only Tatsumi survived the battle with the Three Beasts and no one had seen Bulat's death, the Empire is unaware that he is dead. This was also proven by the time Wave encountered Tatsumi wearing the Incursio, the former immediately identified him as Bulat, until Esdeath discovered his true identity when Syura teleported Tatsumi and Lubbock into the palace grounds.\n\nEquipment and Skills\n\nPhysical Abilities\n\nAkame Ep 1 - Bulat\nBulat throwing his spear\nArguably the strongest member of Night Raid, his strength was greatly praised by the likes of Liver and was even given special attention by Esdeath herself. Bulat is extremely skilled in both the sword and spear and has mastered the skill to take awareness of his surroundings as shown when he dealt with three powerful enemies at the same time with little difficulty. Bulat's strength and endurance were immense, enough to withstand consistent powerful attacks from Liver's Teigu, and was still physically tough enough to best Liver in a sword fight. Bulat even battled Akame, considered the Empire's strongest assassin, to a standstill, with the latter acknowledging that she would have lost the fight had it reached a conclusion.\n\nTeigu\n\nBulat wielded Incursio, an armor Teigu that changes form depending on the person using it. When activated, the armor has a special ability to turn the user invisible for a limited time, having mastered Incursio to its limits as he was able to call on the armor without the use of its key as well as being able to use its invisibility for long periods of time."

She was a General of the Empire that defected, along with Lubbock, to the Revolutionary Army sometime after the end of an expedition led by her and Esdeath to eliminate the opposition of the Ban Tribe.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nNajenda in Lubbock's memories\nNajenda as a general in Lubbock's memories\nNajenda is a woman with short, silver hair and purple eyes. She wears an eyepatch where her right eye used to be. She wears a black suit that shows her cleavage. She has a green and black mechanical right arm.\n\nWhen she was younger, her hair was longer and she wore it tied and braided.\nPersonality\n\nNajenda is taciturn, sharp-minded and level-headed, she leads the group with a surprisingly gentle-but-firm air. Her years of experience serving in the Empire as a General have made her a highly capable leader. Najenda is sometimes mistaken for a man due to her boyish appearance, even sometimes being nicknamed \"The Hunk of the Rebellion\" by her cohorts. She tends to have a habit of telling \"cold jokes\" and making bad puns.\nHistory\n\nNajendaYoung\nA younger Najenda\nNajenda was once a General of the Empire who decided to defect after realizing how corrupt the current regime was. She was a colleague of Esdeath, accompanying her on a past expedition for the Empire. During a mission to eliminate a Revolutionary army base, Najenda informed her army of her plan to defect from the Empire that they agreed with her. Because of that she and her troops became a target of Imperial troops and eventually Esdeath's army. She lost both her right eye and arm in the short ensuing battle against Esdeath.\n\nAkame ga Kill! Zero - Najenda's portraits\nSaikyuu gives Uncle Bill Najenda's potrait\nNajenda makes her debut in Akame ga Kill Zero when Saikyuu gives Uncle Bill Najenda potrait . At some points, Uncle Bill hands its to Gozuki , who conducts a new mission to kill her after the operation in Mount Hakuba. Since Gozuki had already his own mission, he passed it to Akame. Before their encounter (including Bulat, who was also Najenda's bodyguard at that time) Akame already had thoughts about The Empire's wrongdoings and questioning her actions. When they met face to face, Najenda revealed before the battle that they lured Akame here, away from The Empire's other spies, to take her down with Bulat because the Revolutionary Army had enough casualities thanks to her actions, making her a brand important target.\n\nNajenda attempts to hits Akame\nNajenda tried to shots Akame\nThe battle goes into an endless loop because Najenda's Teigu Pumpkin couldn't hit Akame (because she wasn't giving any openings), Bulat's fighting style wasn't a correct match to take down an assassin like Akame (because he was raised as a soldier) and Akame's Shingu Kiriichimonji couldn't land a critic hit on Incursio (because the armor was a Teigu). When Akame started to think about retreating so she can draw a new strategy to take both of them down, Bulat opens his heart to Akame, confessing that he felt she was already questioning The Empire's wrongdoings by the way she swing her sword. After a long talk, Akame decides to join Revolutionary Army and fake to Gozuki that the mission was unsuccessful because they got away with a secret path leading to the Town.\n\nNajenda passes down her Teigu to Mine due to her being unable to utilize it any longer.\n\nDue to her injury, Najenda usually stays at the base, giving orders to her subordinates. When Tatsumi first arrived, Najenda explained his options to him and as well as who he would be paired up with each time for training. She assigns roles and pairs each member of Night Raid together to help Tatsumi adapt as an assassin.\n\nAfter losing several members, such as Bulat and Sheele, as well as the increasing threat from the Empire, mainly through the formation of its new faction, the Jaegers, Najenda temporarily leaves the Night Raid base and heads back to the Revolutionary Army's main army to hand in the Teigu they have taken hold on and searching of new members to replenish her team. During the attack on Night Raid's hideout by Team Stylish, Najenda arrives just in time to aid her comrades, bringing with her two new members. Chelsea, and the humanoid Teigu, Susanoo.\n\nDuring their time leaving the hideout, Najenda and Night Raid train themselves while also introducing Chelsea and Susanoo to the members of Night Raid. They train for around a month until Revolutionary recall her and Night Raid to return to the capital with the others to subjugate new types of Danger Beast. After suppressing all of the Danger Beast, she was later receive new orders from the Command to make Path of Peace allies with Revolutionary Army due to their strong influence at the east and utilizing their uprising for Revolutionaries advantage.\n\nNajenda briefed and explain for three-pronged attack's plan made by Revolutionary Army. During her dispatch outside Night Raid's base, she went to several castles and forts, convincing some Crown Princes of the Empire to defect to smoothen the Revolutionaries advance on the south.\n\nNajenda later explains the plan for assassinating Borick at the Path of Peace which turns out Borick is a spy from the Empire that was assigned to prevent an uprising from inside out. By removing Borick, she can also convince The Lord to start an uprising at East and allies with Revolutionaries. She personally takes command of this operation, utilizing this mission to lure out Jaegers and forming a plan to ambush them. Before reaching the destination target, she split Night Raid into two teams by traveling east and south to weaken Jaegers. The strategy was successful and Najenda uses the trump card, Magatama Manifestation, for the first time to defeat Desta Ghoul.\n\nAfter the assault, Najenda and the others withdraw to safety while Lubbock arrives. Concerned over Chelsea's decision to pursue Kurome alone, she orders Tatsumi and Akame to reinforce Chelsea. However, her decision was too late and Chelsea has already been killed by Kurome and displayed at the town of Romari.\n\nShe and the group arrive at Kyoroch, the headquarters of Path of Peace and observing Borick's mansion from distances. She made a contact with Revolutionary Spy Team to formulate a plan to assassinate Borick. However the plan was delayed due to Jaegers are on high-alert, engagement of Four Rakshasha Demons and many Revolutionary Spies are killed, forcing themselves to enter a stalemate for up to two weeks. During a discussion with Tatsumi, Najenda states that the required amount of soldiers necessary to defeat Esdeath is fifty-thousand Elite soldiers and ten Teigu users, including Akame.\n\nLost eye\nNajenda losing her eye\nWhen Najenda is alone with Tatsumi, she tells him about the past, at first she teases him for being lovey-dovey by telling how many men she reject when she was a General. During her mission to subjugate bandits, she announce her defection to Revolutionaries and the Empire dispatch troops but was made a quick work by Najenda. Her biggest miscalculation at that time was Esdeath's Army was also dispatched to intercept her. She herself lost her right eye and right arm in the process but saved in the nick of time because of Revolutionary Main Army that arrives in time to extract her, forcing Esdeath to retreat due to exhaustion but most of her troops are killed. From that day, she vows to purge this trauma by defeating her and The Empire.\n\nThe night before the assault, Night Raid made a feast and Najenda once again briefed the mission. She herself will command the distraction unit along with Susanoo, Tatsumi, and Leone while the rest attack from the air with an Air Manta that was requested beforehand.\n\nAfter the war, Najenda continued to help protect the new kingdom, helping to weed out the remaining members of the former kingdom and to prevent further rebellions. Najenda lived the rest of her life single, but did adopt at least one child. She recovered Lubbock's goggles and held them as a memento to her fallen comrade.\nEquipment and Skills\n\nLost arm\nNajenda's right arm frozen and shattered by Esdeath\nPhysical Abilities\n\nNajenda's full strength happen to have mostly unknown, but Najenda herself has commented that due to the injuries that Esdeath inflicted on her, she is only at 40% her original strength. This may have also rendered her unsuitable to handle her old Teigu, Pumpkin, to it’s fullest power, leading her to pass it on to Mine. She is still, however, a capable fighter, being able to use her prosthetic hand to generate momentum for her kicks and punches that can rip a head off in one blow. She once demonstrated on Leone her ability to fire her prosthetic hand and reel it back in. Furthemore , Najenda is seen battles, and goes toe-to-toe with the corpse puppet General Rokugou , and manages to kicking his head off, and later destroying his insides with strong blows due to her anger, despite being weakened due to her injuries and missing arm and eye. Physically, she is strong enough to hold the Teigu Belvaac with one arm, which is quite heavy.\n\nNajenda endures lost an eye and her left arm\nNajenda survives lost an eye and her left arm at the hands of Esdeath\nAdditionally, Najenda has shown to have strong life-forces, and tremendous vitality, as she endures lost an eye and her left arm at the hands of Esdeath, and remains, and stay alive, in addition to being seen using the Magatama Manifestation, which drains the user's life-force to activates its. Although she mentions that she has lost several years of life by activating the Magatama manifestation a third time, although incomplete, she still capable of remains, and stay standing straight, and keeps living.\n\nReel Assault (リールアサルト, Rīruasaruto): She fires her prosthetic hand, reels herself to the arm, and quickly delivers a kick.[1]\nLeadership\n\nNajenda demonstrates her leadership skills\nNajenda shows her leadership skills\nNajenda is calm and collective, being able to adjust herself to differing situations and giving out orders by adapting to the current situation. She is also able to rally Revolutionary Troops that were attacking the capital, enabling them to hold the line before Night Raid defeated Esdeath and the Emperor. Esdeath state that Najenda always lead her troops and fight with calm and burning heart, knowing her capabilities as a former fellow General of the Empire.\n\nTeigu\n\nNajenda uses Pumpkin\nNajenda wields Pumpkin in an attempt to defend herself from Esdeath\nBefore Najenda defected from Empire, she wielded the Teigu, Pumpkin and showcased sharpshooting and sniping skills. This is seen where she had used Pumpkin in an attempt to defend herself from Esdeath during her defection. Later after her defection, Najenda herself continued to use Pumpkin as her weapon of choice, albeit its been implied that her skill with it had dropped due to her injuries and missing arm and eye, despite that Najenda herself still showcased enough ability to make use of the weapon to provide Bulat with cover fire during his fight against Akame upon first meeting her and nearly shot her down in their duel.\n\nLater, she would became the master to the humanoid Teigu, Susanoo, up until his demise. Until her arrival at HQ, Susanoo was in a state of dormancy and began to react to her presence. Susanoo told the members of Night Raid that it was because Najenda resembled his previous master, who was a great general. Due to Susanoo being able to fight on his own, Najenda has shown to primarily fight with him by providing him with support, such as providing him with her own energy in order to activate his Trump Card."

However, under the cruelty of her viceroy, who took joy out of hunting people, she began to become nihilistic, until she found Gaea Foundation, which had been stored away because no suitable owner could be found, and uses its to kills her employer, who was replaced with a kind and competent one.

She usually wore a revealing, sleeveless lilac cheongsam with detached lilac arm sleeves and a cleavage cutout, along with white thigh-highs and boots. Underneath, she wore purple lace-trimmed underwear. She usually had her Teigu with her. She wore glasses and had a scar on her right cheek. During her earlier appearances, she wore a hat. \nPersonality\n\nSheele was an airhead, often losing her glasses or failing at any chores she tried to do due to her clumsiness; however, she was very kind and caring to her friends, willing to sacrifice her life for them, as seen with Mine. However, her attitude changed completely when she killed, becoming cold and impassive; she described it as having \"a screw loose\" in her mind, which made her a talented killer. She believed that getting rid of \"society's trash\" was the only thing she could do well, and therefore couldn't be considered useless.\n\nShe was shown to apologize to those she kills, often as a force of habit.\nHistory\n\nGrowing up in the low districts of the Capital, Sheele's clumsy nature caused many people throughout her life to often consider her useless, isolating her from nearly everyone. At one point in her past, she had a friend who didn't mind her personality, but was attacked by her ex-boyfriend. Sheele killed the ex-boyfriend in order to protect her, revealing that she had a strange talent for killing. However, in the end, this broke their friendship. Soon after, a gang related to the man she killed earlier sought revenge against her and had already murdered her parents. Sheele coolly killed the group and was later scouted by the Revolutionary Army, who had learned of her ability.\n\nBy joining, she wanted to use her talent in a way that would make her useful to others by helping fix society. She was one of the first members to warm up to Tatsumi, comforting him while he mourned his deceased friends from his home village. Later, she and Mine were attacked by Seryu, during a mission and she summons Koro to attack them. Mine takes on Koro, while Sheele fights Seryu. During the battle, Sheele cuts Seryu's arms off, but she has hidden guns and attempts to finish her off. Much to her shock, Sheele blocks her attack with her Extase and cuts off her guns as well. As it seems like Sheele is about to finish her, Seryu activates Koro's secret ability, Berserker, where Koro becomes stronger and unleashes a deafening roar, stunning Mine and begins to crush her.\n\nEquipment and Skills\n\nSheele wielded a Teigu in the form of a giant pair of scissors called Cutter of Creation: Extase, which is said to be able to cut through anything. She could use its trump card to make her Teigu shine a blinding light.\n\nAs seen from her battles against Seryu Ubiquitous, Sheele is extremely agile, quick and powerful when using her Teigu, as seen where Seryu noted on her slash and thrusts speed and strength as being heavy. Sheele herself is shown to also posses immense reflexes and reaction speed, having been shown to easily deflect Seryu's shots using her hidden guns and later react to Koro's surprise attacks instantly.\n\nShe has also shown to be very ruthless in battle, due to her unique mindset and a natural talent for killing. She could think straight in a deathly battle and kill enemies without remorse while having a clear mind."

She excels at gathering information and exercising calm judgment when necessary. Leone is often the one who's seen confirming the validity of the targets which Night Raid is assigned to assassinate.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nLeone was a young, curvaceous woman. She had short blonde hair with two long tufts that framed the sides of her head and golden eyes. She wore a revealing outfit with a black tube top, detachable sleeves with what looked like gold bands, pants, boots and a scarf around her neck.\n\nWhen she transformed, her hair becomes longer and she gains lion-like ears, a tail and claws. When her teigu, Lionel, fused with her, her hair becomes longer, and ears a bit bigger, she also sports out lionlike feet and many areas of her body are covered with fur, overall having a more beast-like appearance.\nPersonality\n\nShe had a very relaxed, upbeat, and cheerful personality, and tends to display a lack of lady-like manners, often seen shoving Tatsumi into her breasts, putting her feet on the table, or consuming large amounts of sake and other alcoholic drinks. She serves as a sort of big sister figure to Tatsumi and the younger members in Night Raid, often referring to herself as \"Onee-san\" or \"Big Sis\". Despite the morally-dodgy nature that she sometimes displayed, Leone is not one to tolerate injustice, and can be especially vicious to those who commit the vilest of acts. She also enjoyed fighting her enemies a lot, as said by Najenda, who told her that she needed to change that habit.\nHistory\n\nLeone grew up in the slums of the Capital where she had worked in a massage parlor ever since childhood. She was apparently scouted by the Revolutionary Army after saving some slum children from a group of nobles who were abusing them for sport.\n\nShe was the first member of Night Raid to meet Tatsumi in the beginning of the story, offering to get him into the Imperial Army in exchange for a favor. Taking advantage of his naivety at the outset, she tricks him into treating her to dinner and drinks, and then swindles him out of his money. Later, she reappears and is revealed to be a member of Night Raid. After the confrontation at Aria's mansion is concluded, she recognizes Tatsumi's skills and tells him from now on, he'll be a member of Night Raid, serving as a way of paying him back for her earlier conning of him.\n\nNight Raid anime 1\nTatsumi introduced to the Night Raid.\nStill devastated over the loss his beloved childhood friends Sayo and Ieyasu, Leone shows up to cheer him up and to find out if he thought about joining them, but Tatsumi was still hesitant about accepting her offer. She shows him around the hide-out and introduces him to the other members of Night Raid: Sheele, Mine, Bulat, Lubbock, Akame and Najenda. When she meets Najenda, she tells her that she wants to recommend him as a new member of their team. Najenda asked if he showed promise, which Leone affirms. When Tatsumi was given a choice to become part of Night Raid, he wrongly states they are assassins of justice, which caused them to laugh at him. He asked what was so funny and Leone replied \"Tatsumi... No matter how you dress it up, what we're doing is murder.\" When they were under attack, Leone stated that her Teigu gives her superhuman strength to beat her enemies to death. \n\nShe is placed with Tatsumi and sent to the Capital to complete their mission. He realizes that she is very popular in her home district. The two were separated when a gang of men that she had also swindled out of their money came after her, but reunited on time to start their assignment. They enter the targeted building and witness a gang kill a drugged prostitute, a girl who Leone knew from the streets. Together, they eliminated the gangsters in the building. When they finished their mission, Tatsumi asked her what will happen to those girls, she replies that it isn't their problem, but then tells him there is a doctor in the slums who will look after them if she asks him to. Tatsumi notes her kindness with a smile and then she \"marks him\" as hers by licking his ear.\n\nThey are once again sent on another mission. Their target was the Kobore Brothers under the orders of the Revolutionary Army HQ. The two complete their mission, slaughtering the brothers, and as they leave, Tatsumi hears a child's voice calling for his father, who was one of the brothers. Angry at himself, Tatsumi leaves as fast as he could. The next morning, Tatsumi attempts to clean his bloodstained sword while thinking about how the boy only saw the Kobore brother as a good father, instead of the villain that he was. Leone shows up and tells him that he could scrub the sword for his entire life, but the stain will never fade. While she tries to cheer him up and tell him that she was worried about him because he is too kind, he asks her where she got her teigu and why she fights the Empire. She replies she got her Teigu from a merchant for a good deal who didn't realize how good of a fine object he had on him and she takes great joy in killing people who abuse their power on the weak and helpless. While he finds that her reason gives him strength, he is still troubled. She also told him yet again that moping around isn't going to bring back the person you lost.\n\nLater, she is assigned the task of spying on the Imperial general, Esdeath. Leone hides in the air vents above the room Esdeath was resting in, planning to kill her if the chance arises, but is scared off by a particularly violent display of killing intent from the general, who noticed the presence of someone hidden nearby.\n\nDuring the attack on Night Raid's hideout by Team Stylish, she is hit in the face with a throwing dagger and presumed dead, only later to show up and kill the Stylish-minion who threw it with a single blow, revealing that her Teigu increases her natural regeneration.\n\nAfter Night Raid's fight with Stylish, Leone and Tatsumi fought a group of Danger Beasts together. While they were fighting, she was surprised and impressed by Tatsumi being able to use \"Neuntote\", Incursio's special move, Leone also stated that Tatsumi is coming closer and closer to Bulat. Leone displays that her Teigu also increases her sight and speed as well, She was able to beat the strongest Danger Beast in their area without having a single injury. \n\nDuring the fight with Bols, Kurome, and Wave, Kurome cuts off Leone's left arm. Leone uses her regeneration powers to stop the bleeding but comments that Lubbock would have to come and sew it back together.\n\nNight Raid's next major assassination would involve Leone being apart of the underground attack team assigned to distract Esdeath. Unfortunately, thanks to Wave & Run holding off the air team along with Esdeath not coming out, they were forced to confront her head on. While Tatsumi snuck around to Bolic, Najenda, Leone, and Susanoo engaged Esdeath head-on. During the battle, the team while easily overwhelmed and Leone suffered brutal torture at the hands of Esdeath herself. Once Akame and Mine arrived, Leone held back a fleeing Bolic allowing Akame to kill him and at Najenda's command began to retreat.\n\nThree months later, Leone would join in the mission to rescue Tatsumi from being executed by Esdeath and General Budo. During Mine's assault on the duo, Leone arrives & saves her along with Akame from Esdeath's barrage and prepared to engage Esdeath and an angry Budo. She and Tatsumi tag-teamed against Budo while Akame and Mine fought Esdeath. Sometime during the battle, Leone was joined by Mine and Akame to combat a weakened Budo only to overwhelmed and nearly defeated. Najenda arrived as evacuation only for Budo to follow them & attempt to kill them. To save everyone, Mine pushed Pumpkin to its limit and ultimately killed Budo at the cost of her becoming comatose.\n\nLater on, when the attack on the Capital commences, Leone was tasked with killing the Revolutionary Army's enemies from the inside. Alongside Akame, she snuck into the Capital and they assassinate their targets. While the two of them had split up to kill their enemies quicker, Leone attempted to kill the Prime Minister herself.\n\nLeone and Minister Honest began their fight, and she was surprised as she found out that Honest was a Teigu user and was actually skilled at martial arts. Eventually, however, Leone gained the upper hand and almost managed to kill him once and for all, but Honest then revealed the power of his Teigu. The Teigu used its ability to destroy Leone's Lionelle, causing her to return back to her normal state. Honest then used a pistol and fired a shot at her, weakening her significantly. Minister Honest threw Leone off the top of the building causing her to fall down several floors and she seemingly died.\n\nLeone fused with Lionel\nLeone, fused with her Teigu\nHowever, after the battle between Esdeath and Akame, Leone is revealed to have survived as she follows Honest underground as he tries to escape. She has fused with what's left of her broken Teigu, giving her a more lionlike appearance. She proceeds to easily beat down Honest and even rips his guts out. Leone then drags him all the way to the top of the Palace and throws him over the ledge, just like he did to her earlier, sarcastically telling him to enjoy the time he has left. After the battle, Akame meets up with her and is about to get medical assistance, but she declines and hugged her, revealing that she was only alive because she fused with her Teigu temporarily. She tells Akame that she wants to choose where and when she dies and then says that Akame is her best friend. She bids Akame farewell and enjoys one last night out drinking with her friends. When she walks by the spot where she first met Tatsumi, she smiles while remembering him and falls on the ground. Leone then dies in the street with her last smile still on her face.\nEquipment and Skills\n\nLeone possessed a Teigu in the form of a belt, named Lionel. When activated, it enhanced her speed, reflexes, strength and regeneration, as well as giving her animal-like characteristics. She was also a skilled spy and manipulator, occasionally using her skills to swindle people out of their money, as seen with Tatsumi. Leone was also a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant, using such skills to fight her enemies, and has managed to fight even the most skilled enemies on even ground, although she usually killed them rather quickly.\n\nShe stated herself that she preferred sneak attacks to kill her enemies before they could react. Considering this and the fact that she was shown to infiltrate different areas on multiple occasions, it was implied she was incredibly skillful at stealth. She is a valuable member of Night Raid and had shown to be quite powerful. She was able to kill three men with a single kick as well as killing a large Danger-Beast with a single blow.\n\nOnce using Lionelle's transformation, it was shown that Leone became a deadly fighter. She was shown to easily keep up with Tatsumi while he used Incursio's armor, as they killed several Danger Beasts together as a training method. Lionel has enhanced Leone to inhuman durability, during a fight with General Budo where she was struck down with powerful thunderbolts, she was able to move after a few moments.\n\nAlso, she seemed to have a sixth sense, being aware of danger beforehand, as shown when Night Raid was attacked by Dr. Stylish. An assassin had used a sneak attack on her, attempting to kill her with a knife before she could react, but she was able to catch the knife in her mouth instead. \n\nLionelle also gave Leone an impressive regenerative ability. During her battles, Leone had lost both an arm and one of her breasts but was able to regenerate them. However, the regeneration is not instant, and takes a very long time to finish."

He was always seen wearing a white, red and black robe.\nPersonality\n\nSusanoo was a perfectionist who always noticed flaws in the others' appearance, even in the heat of a battle, as seen when he pointed out Desta-Ghoul's asymmetrical bones while fighting it. He always tried to fix such imperfections whenever he could, as seen with Tatsumi's shirt and Mine's hair. He was also quite straightforward and, while respectful towards his allies, had little understanding of human concepts, such as friendship; however, he was eventually able to develop bonds with his fellow Night Raid members.\nHistory\n\nSusanoo helped to save the members of Night Raid from Dr. Stylish after they were all incapacitated by his poison attack. He is revealed to be a humanoid Teigu during his battle with Dr. Stylish after miraculously healing from otherwise fatal wounds sustained to his body by Dr. Stylish's exploding minions. Susanoo later assists Night Raid in taking down Stylish in his final monstrous form.\n\nNajenda dismay at being called a man by Susanoo\nSusanoo states Najenda resembled his former master, a male, much to Najenda's dismay.\nHe had been inactive for an unknown period of time before awaking to Najenda. When asked for the reason why he awakened to her, he stated that she resembled his former master and added that he was a great general, much to Najenda's dismay and to Leone and Tatsumi's amusement.\n\nDuring Night Raid's assassination attempt against Bolic, Susanoo, like Najenda, Leone and Tatsumi were all overwhelmed by Esdeath. Despite this, Bolic was still killed. When the group attempted to escape, Susanoo chose to stay behind and stall Esdeath until a complete retreat was made. Inevitably, Susanoo lost the fight when Esdeath used her Teigu trump card to freeze time and effectively kill him by destroying his core.\nEquipment and Skills\n\nSusanoo was a biological Teigu, and the first one shown in the form of a human being. Because of his nature as a Teigu, he was able to regenerate injuries as long as his core was intact. He also seemed to be immune to poisons and toxins that would kill ordinary warriors. He wielded a stave-like weapon called Wolf Fang Mace with blades protruding from it and is extremely proficient in battle. He was also very adept at housework and cooking, assisting Akame in the daily chores at Night Raid's HQ.\nTrump Card\n\nMagatama Manifestation (禍魂顕現, Magatama Kengen, literally translated as \"Evil Soul Manifestation\"): Susanoo absorbs his user's life energy into the magatama on his chest in order to access a more powerful, armored form. While under the effects of Magatama Manifestation, his hair whitens, his horns turn black, and a disc appears on his back. Because Susanoo's user needs to give him some of their life force in order to use his Trump Card, they will die if they command him to use it three times. He has several different abilities that only become usable in conjunction with his trump card.\n\nYata no Kagami (八咫鏡, Yata no Kagami, literally translated as \"Eight Span Mirror\"): Susanoo uses the floating disk on his back to create a mirror which can reflect any kind of projectiles.\nAme no Murakumo (天叢雲剣, Ame no Murakumo, literally meaning \"Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven\"): Susanoo generates a very long, transparent sword from the energy stored in the magatama.

He wore a long, green jacket with a fur-trimmed hood over a white and red ringer shirt and blue jeans with brown shoes. He was occasionally seen wearing a long, black coat. When in battle, he wore his Teigu (Cross Tail) on his hands.\nPersonality\n\nLubbock was an easy-going individual who tended to be a pervert from time to time, including trying to peep on Leone while she was bathing. Despite this, he was careful not to let this get in the way of battle when fighting females. His playful and optimistic nature showed even during fights, and he would often tease his enemies and brag about his abilities. However, he was not too arrogant and was always ready to flee if he had too much of a disadvantage in battle.\n\nHe was incredibly loyal to Night Raid, as he refused to betray them, even after being tortured by Syura, claiming that his love for Najenda helped him withstand any pain.\nHistory\n\nLubbock was the fourth son born into a wealthy merchant family in a region of the Empire. During his childhood, he met Najenda, who had just moved into the region for the time. Falling in love at first sight, he left the life he had to get closer to Najenda and joined the army. Using his talent, Lubbock rose through the ranks to the point where he becomes one of her closest aides, and could serve and be by her side. He would also join her in her defection to the rebellion, even going as far as to risk his life to change the military records of both him and her to K.I.A.\n\nLubbock appeared during the mission to assassinate Aria and her parents, creating a net out of his Teigu's threads for his group to stand on. Later, he was introduced to the newly recruited Tatsumi while trying to peep on Leone. In Night Raid's hideout, Lubbock's main function was to keep watch of the perimeter using his threads. He defended the base during the bandits' attack and Dr. Stylish's invasion. During Night Raid's battle against the Jaegers, Lubbock was assigned as the lookout who would keep Esdeath from reaching the battlefield, though he ended up not being involved in combat. After the battle, he reattached Leone's arm after it was cut off by Kurome.\n\nLubbock attempts to attacks Sten\nSten blocks Lubbock's axe attacks\nDuring the mission to assassinate Bolic, Lubbock was attacked by Mez and Sten while patrolling. At first, he tried to mostly avoid the fight by playing dead but was forced to continue when Sten threatened Pais, a girl from the Revolutionary Army. He managed to kill both Rakshasa Demons by using tricks as well as his Trump Card. Later, when he along with Mine and Akame rode an Air Manta to attack the cathedral Bolic stayed in, they were shot down by Run, and Lubbock used his thread to cushion the group's fall. On the ground, they were attacked by Wave, and Lubbock managed to let Akame and Mine escape when he tied Wave to the tree with his strongest thread. However, he himself was left injured, only to be helped later by Pais and her boyfriend, Ritone.\n\nLubbock kills Syura\nLubbock kills Syura.\nDuring Night Raid's investigation of Wild Hunt, Lubbock was captured along with Tatsumi in the Imperial Capital in a clever plot engineered by Syura, the Prime Minister's son. While Tatsumi's prisoner treatment was being handled by Esdeath, Syura looks over Lubbock's interrogation, leading to inhumane torture in order to obtain information on the whereabouts of Night Raid's headquarters. When asked about the progress of the torture, Syura commented that Lubbock's eyes were beginning to lose hope, just like with \"all the other prisoners\" (presumably ones that he'd dealt with in the past). Indeed, when finally left alone for the first night following his first day as prisoner, Lubbock was shown biting his arm to the point of bleeding, with his eyes showing intense distress and his body shaking from head to toe from the trauma. This was later revealed to be an act as Lubbock manages to trick Syura into releasing him from his shackles. He then proceeded to break Syura's neck using a string hidden in his mouth, killing him.\n\nLubbock thinks of Najenda\nLubbock thinks of Najenda as he dies.\nLubbock tried to use Shambhala to escape, but it only teleported him to the courtyard, where Izou was. Thinking Izou wouldn't cut Shambhala, he tried to block Izou's attacks with it. However, Izou said that he was devoted to Kousetsu and Teigu were no interest to him as he cut Lubbock in half. In his last moments, Lubbock saw Najenda in a vision and asked her if he had done well before dying. Izou praised his will to live but made it clear that as Budo was already about to attack him and Lubbock literally had no chance of escape at all. Esdeath told Tatsumi that Lubbock had been killed in hopes it would make Tatsumi willing to serve her, but it merely enraged him. This anger would later manifest in the evolution of Incursio during Night Raid's attempt to rescue Tatsumi from his public execution.\nEquipment and Skills\n\nTeigu\n\nLubbock used a wire Teigu named \"Infinite Uses: Cross Tail\", which is very powerful and has many uses, including offensive and defensive techniques. He was very resourceful and a great tactician who tended to plan several moves ahead of his enemies and would adapt well to a given situation even as it changes, such as when he alone killed two of the Four Rakshasa Demons, a group noted for killing Teigu users themselves, or when he killed Syura with threads he hid in his mouth after he was captured and his Teigu taken from him. He was shown to be good at tricking enemies and distracting them; he claims his ultimate technique was his ability to play dead, which he has used multiple times to ambush or escape enemies.\n\nOther Abilities\n\nDespite mostly relying on tricks in order to defeat enemies with physical advantage in size and strength, Lubbock was also proficient at hand-to-hand combat, able to dismantle an Empire guard. Lubbock was extremely skilled in faking death as well."

A young fighter who had set out along with two childhood friends to make a name for himself and earn money for his village, Tatsumi is a kindhearted person who wants everyone to live happily but has no problem with becoming violent if his friends or his ideals are threatened.\n\nAfter learning of the corruption and evil of the Empire and discovering the deaths of his friends, Tatsumi was invited to join Night Raid, a group of assassins that are affiliated with the Revolutionary Army currently at war with the Empire. He eventually accepts the invitation and slowly begins to accept his new life and trade, while still grieving over the loss of his friends and beginning to learn about his new ones. He used to be the owner of the Teigu Incursio until he was fused with it and became a dragon. He had sworn to use this opportunity to take down the Empire in its entirety.\n\nHe fought against the Emperor to finally bring down the corrupt Empire that had caused people to suffer. At the end of the fight against Shikoutazer, Incursio's influence had increased drastically and Tatsumi was consumed. His body has become a dragon, but his mind remains.\n\nHe is, as described by the Revolutionary Army's doctor, the one who brought the end to an entire era.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nTatsumi Smile\nTatsumi's Pure and Innocent Smile\nTatsumi is a young man of average height with green eyes and medium length brown hair with a cowlick that falls with its weight. He used to wear a white, high collar jacket over a tan sweater vest, a pair of black pants, brown gloves and combat boots, but later changes his outfit and now has a more traditional white assassin jacket over a slim purple hoodie and a black base layer shirt with black jeans. On his back, he carries Incursio's key, a short sword with a chain-link tassel at the hilt, in its sheath.\n\nHaving been trained in the way of the sword and hand-to-hand combat since he was young, Tatsumi has had a fairly lean, muscular physique. After training for one month while the Night Raid base was being relocated, he seems to have bulked up enough for Esdeath to notice and comment upon the change.\n\nUpon activating his Teigu, Tatsumi is covered in armor similar to the one of which his late teacher used to wear. Tatsumi's armor is far lighter to suit his fighting style, although the long cape has not changed. After Incursio evolved to grant Tatsumi greater power, the armor has now slimmed down to a more streamlined aerodynamic, sporting longer horns, four eyes reminiscent to Tyrant with hooked claws on its fingers and toes while finally losing the long coat and replacing it with two long, black tassels with fuzzed ends dangling off them.\n\nDue to having fused with Incursio, Tatsumi has slowly begun to take on the physical qualities of its design motif, Tyrant. After its evolution, he sported a single red eye with cross slit pupil at the center, with the cowlick having disappeared entirely. After having invoked it a second time, Tatsumi has degraded further into a more draconian form. The right side of his face now sporting a more scaly, reptilian appearance with a massive horn jutting out the top back of his head, with his right hand taking on similar features sporting tusk-like fingernails and segmented skin plates. Upon using it a third time, a pair of horns have sprouted from both sides of Tatsumi's head along with his hands gaining more reptilian features.\n\nAfter the final evolution from Incursio's armor, Tatsumi loses all physical traits of a human. His draconian features become more defined, scales now cover his entire body, and his mouth has formed into a dragon's, sporting sharp and jagged teeth. During this final change to his appearance, even Shikoutazer's scanning system no longer recognizes Tatsumi as a 'human'.\n\nAnd once Tatsumi was finally consumed by Incursio, his body changed to host Incursio's soul. Tatsumi changes into a massive dragon, becoming the size of a small building. Unlike Incursio's original body, Tatsumi's form as a dragon is smaller, possesses wings, and has more red eyes. It is no longer possible to distinguish Tatsumi from a Danger Beast.\nPersonality\n\nTatsumi gives off a kind, generous, level-headed and friendly vibe. He was shown to be a bit arrogant and naïve in the early chapters, when in his first appearance he believed he could be given an immediate rank of Captain in the armed forces. He displays great displeasure of killing unless provoked as shown from finding his friends tortured to death. He shows great admiration for Bulat, though he doesn't agree to Bulat's displays of affection. Overall, he displays great comradeship and great promise of being a skilled fighter. Close to the start of the manga, his affection spreads even to his enemies, giving him a liability. However, with experience, he has learned to show affection for his friends, but none to his enemies. He is capable of great rage when provoked by his enemies, making him a formidable opponent.\n\nHis personality alters slightly as he merges further with his Teigu. While donning the final evolution of Incursio's armor, Tatsumi roars at the sky and momentarily acts in a savage manner. Even Tatsumi himself states that he can sense his mind slipping, becoming something else.\n\nAnd through remembering Bulat allowed Tatsumi to remain the same person until Shikoutazer's defeat, once the battle was over, Tatsumi was finally consumed by Incursio and his body became its new host.\n\nOnce consumed, he took on all personality traits of Tyrant, but returned to his normal self once Akame had killed the dragon's soul. Despite now possessing a Danger Beast's body, his mind remains intact.\nHistory\n\nTatsumi, Ieyasu, Sayo leaving their village\nTatsumi, Ieyasu and Sayo\nTatsumi spent his whole childhood in a small village where he became close friends with Sayo and Ieyasu. It appears that he was well respected in his village as the elder gave him a unique idol of their god. Tatsumi also trained under the tutelage of a retired soldier, learning the art of swordsmanship, hand-to-hand combat, and blacksmithing. After Tatsumi, Sayo, and Ieyasu set off on their journey, they become separated when attacked by bandits, leaving Tatsumi alone.\n\nTatsumi fighting against Earth Dragon\nTatsumi fighting against Earth Dragon\nIn the opening chapter of the story, Tatsumi is first revealed fighting an Earth dragon.\n\nUsing his skills in combat, he defeats the danger beast with ease. Later, he enters one of the Empire's cities, where he meets a young lady who offers him military connections in exchange for money, conning him out of all of his savings.\n\nAt the streets, he is invited by a wealthy girl named Aria to stay at her house where he learned about the state of the Empire, the corrupted Prime Minister who is the core of all corruption and about the assassination organization Night Raid from one of the guards of that house while staying there.\n\nLater, the mansion is attacked by Night Raid itself, witnessing their strength where they easily disposed of the guards. Tatsumi decides to find and protect Aria instead. Tatsumi then manages to catch up with Aria, who is about to hide in her \"storehouse\" with Akame arriving to kill Aria and her guard, easily disposing of the latter. Tatsumi, determined to protect Aria, decides to fight Akame and after a struggle and almost being killed by Akame, the girl who conned Tatsumi out of his money earlier shows up, and is revealed to be a member of Night Raid herself interrupts the fight between Tatsumi and Akame, stopping Akame from killing Tatsumi.\n\nTatsumi killing Aria\nTatsumi killing Aria\nThe girl proceeds to reveal the true nature of the household with Tatsumi looking on in horror, shocked and disgusted when he realized that Sayo was among the victims. Being at a state of mind where Tatsumi was no longer know who is right or wrong, Ieyasu, who was captured as well, reveals that Aria was the person who tortured Sayo to death. Aria then proceeds to reveal her true nature as she states her detest for Sayo, further disgusting Tatsumi and those around. Knowing the truth and no longer in doubt, Tatsumi stops Akame from slaying Aria, as he proceeds to dispose of Aria himself out of pure anger and hatred for her actions towards his friends.\n\nTatsumi was then forced to see Ieyasu succumb to the Lubora disease, leaving Tatsumi devastated over the loss of his two closest friends. Leone, the Night Raid member who conned Tatsumi of his money, impressed by his potential officially invites him to join their group of assassins. Tatsumi reluctantly leaves with the group (being carried off by them), and they head back to the hideout.\n\nStill devastated over the death of his childhood friends, Tatsumi was hesitant to accept Leone's offer to join at first. Leone shows him around the hideout and introduces him to the other members of Night Raid: Akame, Bulat, Sheele, Mine, Lubbock and then Najenda. Suspicious that they will kill him if he refuses, he asks what will become of him. Najenda assures him that they will not kill him should he refuse, but tells him that he would not be allowed to leave, and that he would be able to work for Night Raid as a laborer, earning money to send back to his village should he wish. She explains Night Raid's purpose and goals, and Tatsumi finally accepts the offer to join the Assassin's guild.\n\nTatsumi kills Ogre\nTatsumi killing Ogre\nHe is first paired up with Akame to be trained by her and also to share her duties as well (cooking). While working with her, the two bond as they learn more about each other. Soon, he is given his first official mission to assassinate Ogre the Demon, while Leone and Akame deal with a corrupt merchant named Gamal. Tatsumi deceives Ogre and lures him into an abandoned alley, where he tells him he wants to join the Imperial Guard, but once Ogre turns his back on Tatsumi, he attacks. During the fight, Ogre threatens to kill the client who hired Night Raid, as well as the rest of her family in revenge. A very angry Tatsumi is then able to overpower Ogre and ultimately kill the corrupted Imperial. Afterwards, he states that he didn't take any wounds at all. Upon returning to the hideout, Akame promptly strips him to see if he was lying to save his pride, and is greatly relieved when she found that he was not lying, explaining that she has lost many friends from poison because they didn't report their wounds.\n\nHe is next put under Mine, who pulls rank over him the whole time that he is paired with her. He learns more about the Empire and the other Night Raid members and begins to form a friendship with her, although she still often teases him. He remains paired with her when they go on their next mission: to kill a relative of the Prime Minister; Iokal. While Mine kills Iokal with one shot, the remaining members of Night Raid are left to deal with his bodyguards. Tatsumi and Mine retreat as her job is done and Tatsumi is not strong enough to face the bodyguards. While leaving, he learns why Mine fights against the Empire. One of the Guards, however, escapes and attacks Mine, and Tatsumi latches on to the attacker, telling Mine to take the shot (at close range). When she starts to object, he tells her he has faith in her. Mine kills the attacker, and is about to accept Tatsumi before he hits her on the forehead, complaining that she nearly killed him as well. The two return to the hideout, having grown a bit closer after this experience.\n\nTatsumi is then paired with Akame and ordered to recover a Teigu from the serial killer Zanku The Beheader. He learns from Akame about the weapon relics known as \"Teigu\". He is then tricked by Zanku, who creates an illusion of Sayo to lure Tatsumi to him, and he is separated from Akame in the process. While Tatsumi holds his ground against Zanku, the serial killer uses his Teigu Spectator to give him the upper hand, and he proves too much for Tatsumi, Akame however, arrives just in time to save Tatsumi, and defeats Zanku with her superior speed and will. The pair return with the Teigu to the hideout. Still unable to accept the death of his friends, Tatsumi is found at his friends' grave site by Akame, who tells him to help her get dinner ready.\n\nSheele hugging Tatsumi\nSheele comforting Tatsumi\nHe then is placed under Sheele, who at first disliked him, but is unable to recall why. She trains him by making him swim in heavy armor. He learns why she fights against the Empire and why she is in charge of training (he enjoys the last reason). Later at a Night Raid meeting, Najenda had him try on Spectator, and the Teigu rejects him as a user, but not before Tatsumi uses its special ability to see Sheele, Mine, and Akame in their underwear. He asks if there are Teigu that can bring the dead back to life and is deeply hurt when the other Night Raid members tell him that there is no such Teigu. Sheele notices that there is deeper reasoning to this and finds him at the graves of his friends, trying to hold back tears, stating that he had hoped that there was a Teigu able to bring the dead back. She hugs him and tells him that it is okay to cry. Sheele comforts him, holding him in her arms. He thanked her for her kindness, and from that point, the two became closer. He is finally able to let go of his friends and accepts their deaths.\n\nNext, Tatsumi is placed with Leone and sent with her to the Capital to complete a mission. He learns that she is very popular in her home district. The two are separated when a gang of men she had swindled out of money come after her. He then meets Seryu, who helps him find the bar he was ordered to find, and reunites with Leone there. They enter the targeted building and witness a gang kill a drugged prostitute, a girl that Leone knew from the streets. Together, they eliminate all the gangsters in the building. When he asks Leone what will happen to the girls, she replies that it isn't their problem, but then tells him that she knows a doctor who will look after the wounded girls if she asks him to. Tatsumi notes her kindness with a smile and she \"marks him\" as hers. Tatsumi wonders how the other team (Sheele and Mine) are doing.\n\nMine returns to the hideout, sharing the bad news of Sheele's demise at the hands of Seryu Ubiquitous. Tatsumi and the rest of Night Raid are devastated and enraged. Tatsumi begins to leave to get revenge on Seryu, but is stopped by Bulat, who tells him to stop acting childish and pull himself together. He is told to help Akame with cooking dinner while Mine recovers. Still in distress himself, Tatsumi wonders how Akame can stay calm and collected when one of their comrades has been killed.\n\nTatsumi felt Sheele's dead spirit behind him\nTatsumi feels the brief presence of Sheele's spirit\nTatsumi is sent with Leone to kill the Kobores Brothers under orders from the Revolutionary Army HQ. The two complete their mission, slaughtering them, and as they are leaving, Tatsumi hears a child's voice calling for his father, who was a child to one of the brothers. Angry at himself, Tatsumi leaves quickly. The next morning, Tatsumi attempts to clean the bloodstain from his sword while thinking about how the boy only saw the Kobores brother as a good father, instead of the villain he actually was. Leone shows up and tells him that he could scrub the sword for his entire life, but the stain of blood would never fade. While she tries to cheer him up, he asks where she got her Teigu and why she fights the Empire. While he finds that her reasons give him strength, he is still troubled. Later that night as he goes to eat, he witnesses Akame preparing Sheele's favorite food to offer to her grave, and Tatsumi tells her that he admires the way she can remain so unaffected, and that losing a friend is something that he will have to get used to like her. Akame grabs Tatsumi, and tearfully tells him that she will never get used to losing her friends. Tatsumi realizes that she was just as affected as he was, and swears to her that he will never put her through the pain of losing him.\n\nHe begins training with Akame with a new determination, unwilling to stop until he becomes strong enough to live up to his promise with her. He is interrupted by Bulat, who offers to train Tatsumi so he can become stronger, Tatsumi accepts and goes with Bulat to Mt. Fake, where he and Bulat fight against tree beasts as part of his training. The two bond as they put their lives on the line battling the danger beasts of the mountain. When the two return to the hideout, Night Raid has a meeting to discuss the Prime Minister, who has begun to order his political enemies to be killed, simultaneously using Night Raid as a scapegoat and blaming them for the assassinations. Najenda also notes that Esdeath has returned to the Capital, having finished with her campaign against the Northern Tribes. Lastly, Najenda notes that she has lost contact with the Night Raid away team, and worries that they have been wiped out. Bulat and Tatsumi are then assigned the task of protecting another of the Prime Minister's political enemies, who is aboard the cruise ship, \"Ryuusen\".\n\nTyrant appears behind Tatsumi\nTatsumi calling Incursio for the first time\nTatsumi and Bulat arrive at the luxury liner and board, Bulat uses Incursio's stealth ability to scout out the area for potential attackers. The Three Beasts arrive at the same time and begin to search for their target. Tatsumi learns of Bulat's past, and the reason why he fights the Empire. Bulat then must retreat to the interior of the ship as the time limit on Incursio's stealth ability had been reached. Bulat then leaves for the interior of the ship, leaving Tatsumi in charge of watching for the assassins. While he is gone, Tatsumi is weakened by the Teigu Scream's music, and the crew and most of the guests are put to sleep. Tatsumi is attacked by Daidara, whose Teigu gives him a major advantage, but Tatsumi is able to hold his own until Bulat shows up. Bulat tells Tatsumi to watch his battle closely and memorize his movements, as the other members of the Three Beasts arrive. Bulat evades their attacks, leaping high into the air, knocking out Nyau, and quickly uses Neuntote to cut Daidara in half, killing him instantly. He then begins to fight with Liver, his former superior from his days with the Empire. Still able to fight, Nyau attempts to play Scream to give Liver an advantage, but is stopped by Tatsumi. While Bulat fights Liver, Tatsumi keeps Nyau from interfering, but is unable to keep him occupied for the whole fight and Nyau defeats him, stopping Bulat from landing the killing blow on Liver. While Bulat ends up defeating Liver, he is poisoned and wounded. Tatsumi grabs Bulat and attempts to escape with him, but is stopped by Nyau who uses his trump card, growing to full adult size. Bulat entrusts Tatsumi with his sword, saying that it is Incursio's key and to use it. Tatsumi's will is so strong that the Teigu's core evolves to match him. With this new power, Tatsumi kills Nyau in one punch. Bulat succumbs due to his wounds and the deadly poison that Liver used in their fight. Tatsumi sobs as his friend and mentor passed away before him. He then takes the rest of the Teigu along with him back to the Night Raid hideout.\n\nSome time after this event, Mine's injuries were completely healed, and she immediately began to train in order to become stronger and avenge Sheele. She finds both Akame and Leone helping Tatsumi and Lubbock train, sitting on their backs as they do pushups. Tatsumi tells her that he is training so he can use Incursio more effectively, and to be able to use its stealth ability for a longer period of time. Lubbock adds that he and Tatsumi are now the only men left in Night Raid, so he should better start getting serious. Najenda arrives to tell everyone that she is leaving for the Revolutionary Army HQ, in order to hand over the Teigu that Tatsumi gathered. Before leaving, she places Akame in charge, and offers Tatsumi some words of comfort, telling him that he is strong. Leone tells Tatsumi that Bulat had faith in Tatsumi's abilities, and was sure that he would someday become extremely powerful, surpassing even his former mentor.\n\nTatsumi heads to the capital hide-out, which is disguised as a bookstore owned by Lubbock. The two head down the stairway to the secret room to find an intoxicated Leone already there. Lubbock informs him that Mine's face has been put up on wanted posters, meaning that they are now the only ones left who can walk through the streets of the capital by day. Tatsumi asks about the new police group formed called the \"Jaegers\", and their leader Esdeath. Lubbock tells him that a few years ago there was a group of savage tribes in the south-west of the Empire that rose up in rebellion. Many thought that the Empire would win due to the fact that the tribe only had 10,000 soldiers while the Emperial military sent 120,000. However, the environment proved the tribes' greatest weapon, as the outskirts of the Empire were a harsh environment, and the soldiers were born near the Capital, with no experience of such unforgiving terrain. When all seemed lost, the Empire sent General Najenda and Esdeath to reinforce the army. Esdeath froze a lake that had effectively cut off the army from the tribes' main village, and using the frozen surface as a bridge, the forces crossed over and defeated the tribe. Esdeath then took the captured leaders, and forced them to watch while she had her forces perform mass rape and murder of the tribes civilians, to discourage rebellion in the future. Tatsumi, however, was confused by this, and stated that the incident would only create future rebellion, Lubbock tells him that future rebellion is exactly what Esdeath wanted.\n\nLubbock tells Tatsumi that the Empire is holding a tournament, in which the winner will obtain a large cash reward, and that he should enter so he can send the money back to his home village. Esdeath oversees the Tournament personally, which the Empire had staged in order to find a new user for the Teigu Extase. Tatsumi enters the Tournament under the guise of a blacksmith from the countryside, and wins the tournament, showing his great skill, fearlessness and confident smile, unknowingly fulfilling all of Esdeath's requirements and capturing her heart.\n\nEsdeath herself came down to meet Tatsumi and give him his reward. She places a collar around his neck to the shock of everyone present, and drags him off (before knocking him out) to the Jaegers' headquarters.\n\nAt the Jaegers' headquarters, Esdeath informs the rest of the group that Tatsumi will be a new member and her partner in love. Wave and Run however question why he is chained and wearing a collar, to which she replies that it is to show people that he is her lover, Esdeath is then convinced to take the collar off, and Tatsumi tells her that he has no interest in working for the Empire. Esdeath, however, shrugs this off and tells him that she will make him obedient in time. Seryu then interrupts, telling them that it is a lot to take in, and Tatsumi feels a flash of anger, but holds his emotions in line to not blow his cover. A messenger arrives to tell Esdeath that they have located the hideout of a group of Bandits.\n\nWhile the rest of Jaeger attack the bandit camp, Esdeath and Tatsumi watch from a nearby cliff, Tatsumi thinks of escape, but Esdeath holds his hand, making it impossible. After the fight concludes, she tells him that he will sleep with her in her room. Tatsumi decides he will try to persuade Esdeath to side with him and the Revolutionary Army, however, this fails as she insists on serving The Empire. Esdeath sternly retorts that it is she who will change and control him and not vice versa and uses him as a human pillow for the rest of the night, making him so nervous that he couldn't sleep.\n\nTatsumi vs Wave\nTatsumi vs Wave\nIn the morning, Wave notes that he must have had a rough night, and Tatsumi tells him that he was so nervous that he couldn't rest. He notices Kurome eating her candy, and is reminded of Akame. He tells her of how she looks similar to the girl on the wanted posters. She explains that the two are sisters and vows that she will kill her. Tatsumi, Esdeath, Wave, and Kurome then head to Mt. Fake to hunt Danger Beasts, and Wave and Tatsumi are paired up. While walking along a mountain path, Tatsumi silently remembers the times he spent with Bulat on this very mountain. Wave tells Tatsumi that they seem to have a lot in common, and seem to deal with the same type of comrades. The two then encounter a group of several tree beasts and begin to fight them. Using the confusion of battle, Tatsumi manages to activate Incursio and slips away. After dispatching the last of the Tree Beasts, Wave notices Tatsumi's absence, and fearfully imagines the punishment in store for him if Esdeath finds out he let Tatsumi escape. Wave activates Grand Chariot and begins to search for Tatsumi. The two encounter each other, but are both unable to recognize the other due to their armor Teigu. Wave recognizes Incursio as a Teigu in the possession of Night Raid, and attacks. Tatsumi is unwilling to fight Wave, and instead focuses on attempting to escape. Wave taunts Tatsumi, telling him that he's heard of Night Raid, and that they are villains who murder innocent people, which Tatsumi angrily denies. Wave attacks Tatsumi, sending him flying into a river. Tatsumi uses this chance to activate Incursio's stealth ability, fooling Wave into thinking that he was floating downriver to escape, while he was actually on the river's bank. Tatsumi encounters a danger beast but is too wounded to fight back, but he is saved by Akame who tells him she waited at the cities' main gates and followed him secretly after he left, the two become close, but are interrupted by Lubbock, who notes that his death wouldn't have been so bad as he would have been the only man left. Akame, however, notifies Tatsumi that he was actually very worried.\n\nTatsumi later reports everything he has learned about the Jaegers. He tells the rest of Night Raid that the Jaegers match them skill for skill and as such numbered them as they are. He is also very worried about Esdeath as she is very powerful, with the element of surprise with her as well as the fact that they have no idea of the limitations of her power. Akame however, reassures everyone that they will kill her. With this, the Night Raid celebrate his return.\n\nUnknown to Tatsumi, however, Dr. Stylish had tracked him back to the Night Raid hideout.\n\nDr. Styish uses his own personal army Team Stylish to attack the Night Raid Hide-Out. During this attack Tatsumi busts out and attack the infantry head on, decimating it in the process, and he notes that the soldiers he is fighting belong to Doctor Stylish and that he must be working alone, then encounters Kaku. Upon seeing that he has Sheele's Teigu, Extase, he becomes deeply angered and instead of fighting Kaku he attempts to retrieve the Teigu becoming injured as a result of him doing so. Mine arrives and kills Kaku, finally bring Sheele's Teigu back to where it belongs.\n\nHe is joined by an injured and furious Leone who saves Mine and kills Trooma. Najenda soon arrives and the rest of Night Raid escape from the Headquarters, but they're however, affected by a poisonous gas that renders them immobile with only Tatsumi being able to fight. Just as everyone is in trouble, Susanoo comes in to help everyone out. After Stylish injects himself with a drug that transforms him into a Danger Beast, he helps Akame to get close to Stylish on the Danger Beast's head where she kills him. He stands with the rest of Night Raid as Stylish lays dead on the ground.\n\nTatsumi and the rest of Night Raid relocated from their base to an unexplored area of the empire filled with danger beasts to keep low from the eyes of the Jaegers. Tatsumi participates in a danger beast hunt with Leone who comments about how strong Tatsumi has become due to becoming able to summon Incursio's auxiliary spear.\n\nUpon their return to the capital they receive reports of a new kind of danger beast. Although they admit that in some way this is helping the empire, Tatsumi declares that above all they fight for the people so he would like to destroy the danger beasts as soon as possible.\n\nOn a patrol with Lubbock, Tatsumi decides that it would be better to survey the area on top of a nearby mountain. Once there he is nearly attacked by Esdeath who is flying overhead, she stops her attack but the two of them are attacked by several of the new danger beasts (which by then where revealed to be modified humans made by Dr. Stylish). Esdeath makes quick work of them. Esdeath comments on how it must be fate for them to meet again. The two of them are attacked by a hooded enemy who uses his Teigu to teleport them.\n\nThey arrive to an inhabited island. Tatsumi believes that they are under an illusion and asks Esdeath to hurt him to show whether it is an illusion or not. She responds by kissing him and disproves the fact that they are under an illusion. Esdeath creates an ice pillar to attain a higher vantage point to see. They are attacked by two colossal danger beast (similar to Dr. Stylish's danger beast form). Tatsumi kills one by using an ice pillar that Esdeath creates to jump on to the area near the weak point of the danger beast. Esdeath kills the other one by crushing it with a massive ice hammer.\n\nEsdeath determines that they are on an island southeast of the Empire. They decide that there is no use panicking and make preparations to stay on the island. By the end of the day Esdeath mentions and finds a mark in the sand related to the power that sent them here. Deducing that it must open again at some point they wait for it to open.\n\nWaiting for the mark to allow them back to the Empire, Tatsumi tells Esdeath about how he learned both his swordsmanship and blacksmithing skills from a retired soldier that lived in his village. In turn, for his story Esdeath tells Tatsumi about how she was the sole survivor of a danger beast hunting clan and how after she became bored with danger beasts she joined the army, becoming a general and consuming the ice demon's blood Teigu to give her ice manipulation powers. Tatsumi realizes that it is folly to try to recruit her to the revolutionary army due to her original sadistic ego.\n\nAt this point, Esdeath reveals her intention to find a danger beast to be able to ride on. Tatsumi spots one and while Esdeath is distracted with catching the beast the portal opens again. Tatsumi enters the portal, but not before he tells Esdeath about it. On the other side he seemingly disappears using Incursio's invisibility skill. He mentions that they will meet again but as enemies.\n\nTatsumi and the rest of Night Raid are told by Najenda that the revolutionary army will make its move in a multi-direction attack on the Empire. Night Raid receives an order to kill Bolic, a key member of the religious group Path of Peace due to his involvement as a spy for the empire which threatens to suppress an uprising by the Path of Peace followers, which is to become one of the attacks of the revolutionary army.\n\nKnowing that the Jaegers will continue to chase them as they head for Kyocroch, they decide to spread misinformation that they are headed in two different directions. They successfully manage to split the Jaegers into two halves with Bols, Kurome and Wave in one and Esdeath, Run and Seryu in the other.\n\nTatsumi and all of Night Raid ambush Kurome's group. Due to a surprise attack they manage to send Wave flying from the battlefield. Kurome however, summons her eight corpse dolls to engage against Night Raid including the super high class danger beast Destaghoul.\n\nTatsumi defeats the Gorilla\nTatsumi defeats Apeman\nAs they engage the enemy each member of Night Raid is forced to split up to deal with the corpse dolls. Tatsumi is forced to defeat Apeman who is backed up by Hentarr, once a survivor from the Ban tribes. He decides that fighting the two of them is unfavorable and manages to split them up whilst Chelsea destroys Hentar. She leaves Tatsumi to destroy apeman and he succeeds in knocking Apeman up the rockface to the place where Kurome resides. In a flurry of devastating punches and a final blow to the head Apeman's head is crushed and Apeman is left incapacitated.\n\nTatsumi prepares to fight Natala, but several interruptions, including interference from Susanoo, stop the fight. At this point, a self-destruct explosion occurs from Bor's Rubicante, forcing Kurome to retreat and the battle ends, but not before Chelsea kills Bols while in disguise.\n\nTatsumi groups with the rest of Night Raid and is astounded when he learns that Leone's arm can be re-attached (it was cut off by Kurome in the previous battle). He is told that Chelsea went after Kurome and he chases her to the nearest town only to find that Chelsea had been killed and her head was on top of a pole in the town.\n\nThat night he dreams of the fallen Night Raid members; Sheele, Bulat and Chelsea. He expresses regret that he wasn't able to spend more time with them, but resolves himself the next day to continue his mission.\n\nNight Raid arrive in Kyocroch. They set out surveying the area as they know that it will not be easy to kill Bolic due to the Jaegers interference. They are also staked out by members of the Rakasha Demons. Whilst on a mission with Mine, Tatsumi is attacked by Seryu of the Jaegers and a member of the Rakasha Demons. They split up with Tatsumi handling the Rakasha demon and leaving Mine to handle Seryu.\n\nTatsumi moves the fight to a nearby ruin. Unable to connect a clean hit on the Rakasha demon Tatsumi decides to bring down the entire ruin on his assailant. He leaves the rubble unharmed and his assailant is unable to continue the fight with Tatsumi.\n\nTatsumi rushes to Mine's aid, saving her from the self-destruct bomb planted in Seryu's head should she ever be about to be killed. He declares that he was too weak to save Bulat, too late to save Chelsea, but just in time to save Mine.\n\nAfter several weeks of rest and preparation, Night Raid decide to assassinate Bolic. Night Raid is to split into two groups. One consisting of Akame, Mine and Lubbock and the other with Najenda, Tatsumi, Leone, and Susanoo. The former group is charged with sneaking with an air manta and striking from behind whilst the latter group is to serve as a distraction for Esdeath and the Jaegers.\n\nThe distraction group find Bolic, Esdeath and Kurome in a cathedral-like area. They find that the other group have yet to come as planned. They begin to fight Esdeath whilst Tatsumi uses Incursio's ability to go invisible in order to find an opportunity to kill Bolic in the fighting.\n\nHowever, Esdeath quickly defeats the members of Night Raid and begins to torture Leone. Unable to handle the torture of his friends Tatsumi goes out of his invisible state and strikes at Esdeath but is quickly defeated.\n\nAt this point, Najenda is forced to use Susanoo's trump card a second time in order to kill Bolic quickly. With his increased abilities he gets close to killing him, but at the last moment, Esdeath uses her trump card to freeze time and stop Susanoo, dicing him to pieces.\n\nEsdeath is curious as to who is underneath Incursio's armor attempts to remove it however, it is at this time where the other group arrives and is able to strike Bolic. Tatsumi forces himself to hold back Esdeath for a moment, which is just enough time for Akame to kill Bolic. Night Raid is forced to flee and Najenda is forced to use Susanoo's trump card a third time to hold back Esdeath. Night Raid flee with their mission complete, but at a cost of Susanoo, who dies holding back Esdeath.\n\nAs the revolution begins, Night Raid takes a less direct route to their base in order to fool pursuers and to heal from injuries sustained in the previous mission. Mine and Tatsumi are sent off to collect food for Night Raid as they camp. Mine, whose feelings have grown for Tatsumi attempts to confess to him, but he misunderstands. Mine is forced to kiss him to get him to realize her feelings toward him. They agree to go out together and declare their relationship to the rest of Night Raid.\n\nNight Raid preparing to battle Wild Hunt\nNight Raid's intention to destroy Wild Hunt\nIn the capital a new group sent to aid security in the capital; Wild Hunt puts the capital in the grip of fear and terror. After, several requests from the public and in addition orders from the Revolutionary Army, Night Raid sets out exterminate them.\n\nWhen we next see Night Raid, they interfere in a battle between the Jaeger members Run and Kurome and the two members of Wild Hunt; Cosmina and Enshin. Tatsumi using his spear slams into the ground sending large amounts of rock at Enshin which distracts Enshin enough to catch him off guard to Akame's attack leaving him dead. As the other member of Wild Hunt Cosmina is also dead, Night Raid turn to fight Kurome and Run. However, with the last of his strength Run attacks them, whose attack is blocked by Tatsumi. The Jaegers flee the scene.\n\nSome time later, Tatsumi and Lubbock get caught in a trap by Syura who teleports them in the palace. Despite the disadvantageous situation, Tatsumi attempts to control the situation with the priority to flee. He tactically runs to an empty area, using his trump card of invisibility, he deals a damaging kick to Syura, Dorothea and Suzuka and then produces a smokescreen to avoid Izou. However, as he leaps to get away, he is stopped by Esdeath and Budo leading to their capture.\n\nTatsumi wakes up in a prison cell, greeted by Suzuka and Dorothea who aim to make him their play thing and disgrace him. Dorothea claims that she didn't have any sexual desires until she bit him earlier. Esdeath then enters and angered by this scene, she slams Suzuka's face to the wall and threatens the two to never lay a finger on him. Tatsumi, is then embraced by Esdeath, but only to be displeased. He states that he will never join her and announces that he is in love and in a relationship already, much to her surprise.\n\n53\nEsdeath declaring that Tatsumi will be killed by her own hands\nStill clutching on his resolve, Tatsumi rejects to eat food made by Esdeath and the offer to become her subordinate or risk public execution. Once he hears about Lubbock being dead, the persuasion is futile and he is willing to die rather than being a traitor to Night Raid.\n\nWith the dawn of day of the execution approaching, Esdeath is unable to convince him and become hers, she then comes to the conclusion; if Tatsumi will never be hers, she will at least deliver his death instead to prevent anyone else touching him.\n\nTatsumi Execution\nTatsumi's execution\nOn the day of the execution, Tatsumi was tied to a cross with his executors, Esdeath and Budo, and questioning Budo on his view on the current Empire. Esdeath prepares to impale Tatsumi, stating her understanding of the human body, and telling Tatsumi to try and survive as long as possible (though she never intended to kill him, just leave him in a near-death state). Seeing how the crowd seemed to enjoy how Tatsumi was about to be killed, Tatsumi accepted his death, but vowed that he wouldn't give them any satisfaction from it, but simply smile and laugh, to show Night Raid's pride. Before Esdeath managed to pierce Tatsumi, the execution was crashed by Mine who arrive to save Tatsumi, much to Tatsumi's horror, though he was touched by how far Mine was willing to go for him, something that Esdeath noticed.\n\nIncursio evolve form\nIncursio evolves\nAfter, successfully blasting Budo away from the Colosseum and holding her own against Esdeath's attacks, Tatsumi was amazed by how Mine showed that, despite the overwhelming odds, Mine showed no intention of dying, but rather getting Tatsumi out of there successfully. While fighting Esdeath, Mine used her \"Genius\" sniping skills to free Tatsumi, though grazed his sleeve a bit, which Tatsumi noted that Mine still did it too close for comfort. Going immediately for Incursio, he grasped the hilt, but pulled back in pain as he noticed some small barbed wiring around Incurio's hilt. Hearing Esdeath tells him to come at her and show her how strong he was, Tatsumi prepares to don Insursio. Remembering Lubbock's death and determined to prevent that from happening to Mine, Tatsumi speaks to Incursio as he dons the armor, demanding more power from the Teigu to destroy the injustice of the empire, leading to another evolution of the Incursio, regardless of how painful it might be for him.\n\nAs Tatsumi emerges in his evolved Incursio form, he immediately charged at Esdeath to attack, and unlike before at the Cathedral, had managed to fight more evenly with her, something that Esdeath noted with joy, as they were finally connecting for the first time. Tatsumi stated that Esdeath cannot be as lax now.\n\nEvolved Incursio withstanding Mahapdma\nIncursio withstanding Mahapdma\nWith Tatsumi's new power, coupled with Mine's support, forced Esdeath to use Mahapadma to prevent herself from being struck. However, much to her surprise, Tatsumi had managed to resist the technique thanks to Incursio having evolved to resist the cold, overcoming her Trump Card for a moment. The battle against Esdeath continues with Akame and Leone joining the fray. Soon, Budo reemerges undamaged, despite the powerful blast from Pumpkin he received, and pissed off at Night Raid for disrupting the peace of the Capital.\n\nAfter telling Akame and Leone about Lubbock's death, he and the others prepared to face both Budo and Esdeath. While facing them, Tatsumi noted the extreme pain he was feeling, as if his body was being ripped to shreds. However, Tatsumi moved to block Budo's lightning attacks, and noted that this was the time to push his body beyond its limits. After blocking Budo's attack, Tatsumi and Leone teamed up to fight Budo, further angering the Great General, and summoned lightning from the sky that struck them both, rendering them immobile. However, Tatsumi had quickly recovered, as Incursio had evolved to even resist lightning attacks, and began to fight Budo on his own. During their fight, Tatsumi said in his mind towards Budo that he once strove to be at the top of the ranks, and now that was what he was battling against, with his body and soul.\n\nBudo prepares to take on Night Raid\nBudo prepares to battle Night Raid\nShocking Budo by how Tatsumi was able to be able to fight on par with him, as despite his potential, Tatsumi's power up seemed almost instant, leading Budo to deduce the possibility of Incursio fusing with Tatsumi. Attempting to finish him off, Budo summoned another lightning-bolt to strike Tatsumi, but this time Tatsumi saw it coming, telling Budo that he was told to always be aware of his surroundings, thinking of Bulat, who gave him that advice. Tatsumi then struck a powerful slash across Budo's back, injuring him greatly and making him collapse, before he got back up, and his lightning growing wilder due to Budo's anger.\n\nEsdeath, who had been fighting both Akame and Mine at the time, intervened and battled Tatsumi, stating to Budo that Tatsumi was meant to be executed by her.\n\nTatsumi hits Esdeath\nTatsumi lands the first blow on Esdeath\nAs Budo unleashes his technique, \"Advent of the Thunder Emperor,\" Tatsumi looks at his comrades with worry, before Esdeath attacked, reminding him that his enemy not the lightning, but the ice, and told Tatsumi to give it everything he had. Though they fought fiercely, Esdeath commented that he still had yet to truly reach her and she attempted to capture him in ice, though Tatsumi dodged, much to her surprise. As Tatsumi was stated by Esdeath to be growing stronger even while battling, Tatsumi moved into to strike Esdeath from above. Tatsumi knew that, despite Esdeath telling him to give it everything he had, she was showing so much enjoyment, something he would exploit to give him an opening.\n\nWhen Esdeath blocked his attack, Tatsumi let go of his weapon, and moved into to deliver a powerful punch, which was strong enough to break through her ice armor, and strike her, knocking her away, though Tatsumi was surprised that he managed to actually do it.\n\nAs Najenda arrived at the scene for their escape, Budo attempted to attack her, but Tatsumi blocked it, saying that if he let Najenda get hurt, he'd never be able to face Lubo again, tipping Najenda about Lubo's fate.\n\nTatsumi hits Budo\nTatsumi strikes Budo\nWhen asked by Akame about Esdeath, he replied that he managed to strike a blow, which will buy them enough time to escape from her stunning Akame. Telling them to get on the Danger Beast, Tatsumi allowed himself to be the shield and blocked more of Budo's attacks with his resistant armored body, though Budo knocked him away. As Budo overwhelmed Akame, Leone, and even blocked Mine's attack, due to Pumpkin being pushed too far. As Budo stated that there was no escape for them, Tatsumi got up and declared that they'd all get out of here alive. Budo noted that Tatsumi showed the same expression as \"that brat\", which Tatsumi realized was Lubo, meaning that Lubo hadn't given up to his last breath, making Tatsumi determined not to give up either.\n\nAs Tatsumi and Budo prepared to attack, Mine declared that she'd use her Trump Card, a bluff meant to catch Budo off guard for a moment, which worked, and allowed Tatsumi to deliver a devastating punch to Budo, sending him flying back.\n\nGetting Akame, Tatsumi headed for the Danger Beast to escape, but he soon collapsed, as the poison that he had been given from the barbed wiring on Incursio's hilt had taken effect. While the poison was capable of killing a High Class Danger Beast instantly, Tatsumi having donned Incursio almost immediately, had managed to cut the effects to a certain extent, though even that had reached its limit from the intense fighting. Tatsumi lost his consciousness from that, where Mine soon sacrificed herself to save them and kill Budo, using all her power that rendered her comatose, and Pumpkin destroyed.\n\nTatsumi's Oath\nTatsumi's oath to Mine\nStaying by her bedside, he told her about how she had managed to help them succeed in making the revolution nearing success. He told her to rest for now and leave the fighting to him, which he'd take her share in her place.\n\nAs Mine was later being taken away and cared for until she wakes up, Tatsumi held her hand and told her that when the time came, he wanted to marry her while declaring that he loved her.\n\nWhen Najenda asked how his body was, Tatsumi stated that he felt power welling up inside him, and recalled how he was examined by a doctor that was able to use the Perfector Teigu, and learned that Incursio had bonded with him, and thus he was becoming Incurio's dragon armor, though warned that this was not a power-up at all, but rather it would break him, though unlike a poison, Tatsumi was gradually becoming stronger. Unlike Bulat, who had used Incursio in a proper way, Tatsumi had forced an evolution before he was ready for it. When the doctor mentioned the story of how Incursio couldn't have fought the two strongest in the Empire, Tatsumi stated that he could endure any pain as long as he could have power, and this was the cost, as he will grow stronger, but will die soon, probably 10 years or even less. He did note that if Tatsumi continued to train and build up strength, he might be able to use Incursio without overdoing it, but if Tatsumi continued to use Incursio as he was now, he would be devoured by Incursio and die from it, and pointed out how the symptoms already appeared in Tatsumi's right eye. Finally, the doctor stated that Tatsumi had 3-4 more times was Tatsumi's limit.\n\nTatsumi remained determined to keep fighting, and although Najenda wanted to remove Tatsumi from further combat, she couldn't, as they had no idea what Esdeath's trump card would be now, and they needed Incursio, who had adapted to her frozen atmosphere. Najenda and Tatsumi spoke about the Revolution Army's progress, and how they couldn't afford to lower their guard, as they were sure that the Prime Minister had an ace up his sleeve, added with Esdeath's unparalleled strength. Noting how Esdeath would be fighting with full enjoyment, Tatsumi stated that for as long as he knew her, he hid his identity from her, and that Esdeath was persistent in trying to take Tatsumi, but had a feeling that Esdeath won't hold back on Tatsumi anymore. He declared he would fight with all his might to defeat her, and added that he would fight Lubbock's part as well, though Najenda told him to not beat himself over it, as Night Raid was all for one, and one for all.\n\nAfter a briefing with Najenda with the revolutions armed forces, Tatsumi along with the rest of Night Raid set out to deal with the remnants of the Wild Hunt. Who've last been spotted raiding various Revolution Army Bases with the newly recreated cosmina, just as the Drothea and the others were prepping to raid another base to feed her pet creation. Akame and the rest of Night Raid swooped in; the former dealing what seemed to be a deathblow to the homunculus. But as she rises back up again after having sheded her philosopher stone, Tastumi stands firm as she takes on the monstrosity, remembering that he could only use his Teigu four more times before Tyrant consumed him but shook off his insecurity when thinking of Mine and charged at the enemy fearlessly.\n\nCosmina killed\nTatsumi bifurcates Cosmina\nAfter Dorthea had finished dispatching Leone Cosmina had come crashing in just as she was contemplating how she was doing against him. After, loping off her a limb and landing some critical blows against the creature she protrudes a slew of tendrils to attack him, after blocking most of the barrage a hidden coil springs up from the ground jabbing through incursio's shin guard. As poison is funneled into his body he reveals his immunity to said toxins by tackling Cosmina with as much ferocity as ever, the alchemist suspecting that Tatsumi's merging with his Teigu enabling him resilience against contaminants after having adapted to survive the prime ministers cowardly ploy during his execution.\n\nAs Leone and Akame finish up with their respective opponents Tatsumi deals the killing blow against the mutated Cosmina causing her creator to feign collapse at the crumbling of her ambitions, only to be crushed flat under a rock by Leone soon after. After having completed their mission Leon and Akame stand outside of Tatsumi's room only to find he's not in.\n\nMeanwhile, outside Night Raid's base Tatsumi sits alone in a cave groaning and agonizing in isolation due to his second use of the evolved incursio. After Leone and Akame find him through tracking his scent only to find that half of his face has transformed to reflect tyrants own visage, not wanting to concern the others over his pains Tatsumi tried his best to conceal his problems only for the two to gently embrace him reassuring that they'll help him through his turmoil.\n\nTatsumi partial transformation\nTatsumi after just one use of the evolved Incursio\nBack at the base Tatsumi shows more control over his transformations now being able to revert back to a more human appearance at will, when the commander comes in to debrief Akame on a new mission she also recommends He and Leone take a breather. After Akame had successfully completed her hit list assignment and was told that Tatsumi was resting up after feelings of exhaustion rose up in him.\n\nAfter the Empire Assassination squads have been dealt with Tatsumi and what remains of Night Raid sit down and enjoy a bite too eat. The former of which laments not being of much use seeing as the rest of the crew are busting their butts doing all the heavy work while he's stuck in the benches, the rest however comment that he's not to engage in any combat until the apex of the war Najenda promising to work him but good when the time comes, Leone following sweet by glomping onto him soon after. Noting a somber Akame leaving the dinner table Tatsumi notes her unusual quietness but both ladies are unsurprised seeing as she'll be dealing with her little sister soon.\n\nAs was per the agreement when Akame initially joined up with the Revolutionary Army, Tatsumi learns that in order to serve under them that she be given leeway on approach regarding her wayward sibling and that when the time had come that she; Akame herself and no one else would interfere with her settling things with her, Leone affirms her desire to help her comrade meet her own goals if and when it comes to that with Najenda going onto say that in the even Kurome is spared and the revolution being over by then. That the army whom originally marked her for termination will cease all hostilities towards her and permit Akame to watch over her, and that the elder of the two had been working rather diligently for so long in order too have these requests met. Having long come to terms with Akame's designs and fully considering the possibilities of Kurome rejecting her proposal, leading the two to fight it out to the death; without getting either sides of the conflict involved in order to make it between just the two of them, Tatsumi professes he shares the same mindset as Leone in supporting whatever decision Akame comes too in the end; Najenda noting Tatsumi's more calm demeanor compared to way back when.\n\nAs Akame sits outside under an oak tree looking up at the starless sky Tatsumi comes up to her wondering if she should be asleep by now or not. His hostess admits she's too restless at the moment, Tatsumi states that he's coming with her to oversee the battle between sisters and while Akame rebukes this stating that this is between family he retorts that because she's his friend and that this is her problem he will come as an impartial observer.\n\nNeither as a member of Night Raid nor an emissary of the Rebel Army, just standing guard as to keep anyone from interfering with they're business. Akame notes that they're boss said he shouldn't be fighting now until the apex of the war itself, but he states that while she's only worried about his state of being from when last he equipped Incursio that he'd happily give up another usage if it's for a comrade in arms stating he can only use it four more times before he's done in by it. Stating he was shocked that they left him behind the last time when the call to arms was sounded and that this was his way of making amends for his inaction, also mentioning he has no intention of dying seeing as he has to go back to Mine assuming they win the war but could not stand living with himself if something were to happen to a friend while he was resting up for the battle ahead when he could have been there for them.\n\nThe Promise\nTatsumi asks Akame to kill him if he becomes possessed by Tyrant\nAkame thanks him for his kindness and determination sharing with him that her Teigu Murasame has a hidden trump card that she's unable to use due to it requiring she cast aside her humanity and become a vicious man-slaying demon. Asking him as his friend that if she should succumb to the demon within using this hidden aspect of her weapon, that Night Raid would end her on the spot stating it would be an honor to have him end her before she becomes a ravenous butcher. Impressed by this statement Tatsumi goes onto request from Akame; that should Incursio consumes him and he becomes Tyrant's new body that she would be there to put him down as well. Saying that for him it too would be an honor to die at the hands of a comrade.\n\nKnowing full well what that means, Tatsumi states his past self would denote such a request as cowardly feeling that Akame would say you have Mine to go back too plus the fact that he promised her he would survive till the end of it all. But Tatsumi cuff's such understanding by stating Akame is selfishly asking her dear friend to end her should she end up crossing the event horizon, Akame can only laugh as Tatsumi says the best they can do is give it they're all in the end. As the time of the sisters fateful duel came upon them Both he and Leone stood by on the sidelines as the two sisters exchanged friendly commerce of the old days.\n\nMeanwhile when the battle between the two intensifies Wave manages to close in on they're location forcing Tatsumi to forfeit one of his Teigu's uses in order to repel boarders after he tried to intervene. As Wave finally did get past his defense, Tatsumi showed up just as the interloper managed to dissuade the fighting, offering to take himself and Kurome out of the revolutionary war after having admitted his love for said teammate just as Leone comes in after checking the surrounding area for more insurgents. But this causes Kurome to mentally break down due to her conflicting natures of not wanting to fight her sister and her loyalties to a corrupt empire that ruined her life; to sever such anointment's tying her down, the remnants of Night Raid witness as the former Jeager smashes her Yatsufusa. Carrying her off to unknown territory taking themselves out of the conflict off of the Jeagers Afterwards,\n\nTatsumi shows further signs of degradation due to Incursio's influence once he diffused his weapon, a moment to which Akame laments due to her feeling responsible. But they all cheer up after Leone mentions how Wave single-handedly prevented the deathly battle between siblings and removed two Jeagers from the equation saving countless lives.\n\nClashing Again\nTatsumi & Esdeath clash once again\nWhen the time for the assault on the empire arrived, Tatsumi would be on the front-line battling Esdeath's formidable ice cavalry. Soon, Esdeath herself joins the battle, seeking to crush the revolutionary army's commander only to be halted by Tatsumi. Despite being a bit winded during their brief one on one battle, Tatsumi while getting stronger, fought a now serious Esdeath to a standstill until the empire signaled her to retreat.\n\nUpon seeing the Empire's trump card, Shikoutazer on the field, Tatsumi wasted no time rushing to confront the young emperor. Due to the emperor being confused and inexperienced with the ultimate teigu, Tatsumi easily dodged its assaults and landed a counterattack giving him as well as the revolutionary army confidence that he could prevail.\n\nOnce Shikoutazer's trump card \"purge mode\" had been activated, the Emperor seemed to lose his remaining sanity and began firing indiscriminately. Witnessing the destruction, Tatsumi attempted to get the mad Emperor to understand what he was doing only to be met with resistance. Tatsumi would continue to bounce between being defensive and offensive until a stray missile headed towards civilians prompted him to jump in between the two. By saving the civilians, Tatsumi was left open for incoming attacks. The Emperor then pierced Tatsumi with a blade extending from the ultimate Teigu and subsequently punched into the ground.\n\nWith Incursio smashed and nearing death, Tatsumi saw an image of Mine, after apologizing and saying he'd return to her when suddenly he's healed and Incursio fixed. Although shocked at first, he realizes what has occurred and incursio sprouts a pair of dragon wings declaring he'll stop the Emperor no matter the cost.\n\nIncursio 2nd Transformation\nIncursio's second evolved form\nBefore Shikoutazer could prepare to attack again, Wave arrived on the scene with the intention of evacuating civilians and because he owed Tatsumi a debt. Despite his team up with Wave, Tatsumi determined that he needed more power to defeat his foe and thus he forced Incursio to evolve once more. After obtaining more power, Tatsumi was able to force the Emperor to go on the defense and together with Wave they were able to heavily damage Shikoutazer's armor. Once Wave leaves to help civilians, Tatsumi is able to give his full attention where he once again tries to have the Emperor see the destruction he's causing only to be met with resistance again.\n\nRecalling Susanoo's advice, Tatsumi searches for and locates the weakened area within Shikoutazer's armor. The Emperor calls for aid prompting Esdeath's appearance which worries Tatsumi because their team up would ruin his gained momentum. Akame arrives and holds the general at bay while Tatsumi focuses on Shikoutazer. Upon asking for more power, Tatsumi feels his consciousness slipping again and with some encouragement from a imagined Bulat, Tatsumi is able to regain his consciousness and Incursio evolves one final time. With his new power, Tatsumi is able to plow through Shikoutazer's blasts, its weakened armor, and right through its body to finally destroy the Teigu and end the Empire's reign after more than a thousand years.\n\nImmediately after destroying the ultimate Teigu, Tatsumi is overcome by Tyrant's influence and retrained. The revolutionary doctor concludes that upon receiving a fatal wound, Incursio possessed Tatsumi only for his burning passion to keep him in check. Tatsumi escapes his retrains and heads for Esdeath where Akame begs him to fall back only for Tatsumi to respond by saying Mine must be cold and that he wants to be of some use before he's completely overtaken by Tyrant. Tatsumi smashes through several of Esdeath's attacks and is later wounded by her. Before he could attack Akame who had rushed to his aid, Tatsumi was able to stop himself and begged Akame to kill him before his conscious completely faded. He also reminded Akame about her promise to kill him should he turn into a dragon. Akame than stabs him with Murasame and its curse's markings spread over his body as he collapses.\n\nAfter Akame mortally wounds Esdeath, Tatsumi is seen flying towards them. After meeting up with Akame and Najenda, it is explained that Akame only targeted and killed the Tyrant but saved Tatsumi. Happy that he is still alive, even as a dragon, Tatsumi thanks Akame for helping him keep the promise he made to her to survive.\nHinowa ga Yuku!\n\nTatsumi's transformation becomes one of Akame's motivations to search for a way to return him to human form again.\n\nAkame herself made numerous referrals to him during her interactions with the natives of Wakoku during her search to find a way to return him to human form.\n\nEquipment And Skills\n\nImagen 2024-10-29 135502611\nTatsumi with Incursio\nTatsumi, at first, does not have a Teigu, using instead a short-sized broadsword as his primary choice of weaponry. Tatsumi's skill with the sword is so great that he is able to defeat opponents as dangerous Captain Ogre while also being able to hold his own against Teigu users like Zanku and Nyau for a good amount of time without having a Teigu of his own. Tatsumi is also skilled enough to survive longer than most when faced against Akame in his first appearance. Tatsumi later becomes capable of using a spear to where he can split two Giant Lizard Danger Beasts in half from their mouth to the tip of their tail in a single movement.\n\nHe later inherits one from Bulat, becoming the successor of Incursio. During Tatsumi's first activation of his Teigu, Tatsumi forces the demon armor to evolve to match his movements and battle-style. Soon after, Tatsumi disciplines himself to new extends in order to fully master his new Teigu, unlocking its abilities at a staggering rate. Thanks to Bulat's training on Mt. Fake, Tatsumi is able to develop a sixth sense, becoming more aware of his surroundings. After the one month time-skip, Leone comments on how Tatsumi was getting closer and closer to Bulat's level of strength and proficiency after seeing him materialize and utilize Neuntote, the spear/halberd auxiliary weapon.\n\nEven before obtaining a Teigu, Tatsumi was a force to be reckoned with due to his already honed battle skills. Having been taught swordsmanship and hand-to-hand combat by an ex-military official since a young age, Tatsumi has since improved, being able to take much large and experienced opponents down with ease.\n\nAfter having donned Incursio for the first time, Tatsumi begins to rely on unarmed hand-to-hand combat more often than he used to, and is seen to be exceptionally skilled in fighting opponents even while unarmed, as seen during a tournament held by Esdeath, utilizing the devastating, remarkable physical strength he possesses, and supplementing this with his close quarters combat skill. Upon training his body in order to master his Teigu, Tatsumi becomes able to defeat a member of the \"Temple of the Imperial Fist\" despite the difference in both size and experience with ease without having to use Incursio. Tatsumi's overall strength becomes so high that while using Incursio, he can easily obliterate a boulder many times his own size. Even without Incursio, Tatsumi has shown that he was strong enough to lift a bear-like Danger Beast with ease after killing it.\n\nAfter forcing Incursio to evolve once more through his strong emotions, Tatsumi's strength and speed had reached to incredibly high levels that he managed to fight on par with both Esdeath and Budo, especially due to Incursio having also evolved to be able to resist both ice and lightning attacks, the former of which allows Tatsumi to even resist the effects of Esdeath's Trump Card, Mahapadma, for a moment. From Bulat's advice of being aware of his surroundings, Tatsumi had managed to avoid one of Budo's lightning attacks, allowing him to deal a powerful blow that injured Budo.\n\nAnother thing to note is that similar to how Wave is the first one in the series to deal a clean, powerful blow on Akame, Tatsumi is the only one to have ever done the same to Esdeath as well as General Budo, a feat that surprised Esdeath, Akame, and even Tatsumi himself. However, this is more due to how Esdeath's affections for Tatsumi, added with her enjoyment of the battle along with the Great General's lack of combat experience coupled with blind fury, had given Tatsumi an opening for both instances.\n\nFrom the forced evolution of Incursio, the Teigu has begun to bond with Tatsumi, to the point that Tatsumi was to become Tyrant's new dragon body, something that would break and kill Tatsumi, giving him a limit of 3-4 more uses of Incursio before the effects take over fully. This has also made it that he is now resistant against poison, even a deadly one from Cosmina, due to how he had managed to survive the poison trap the Prime Minister had placed on Incursio's hilt that would have fell a High Class Danger Beast in an instant. This also allowed Tatsumi to fight, overwhelm, and kill Cosmina when she became a hybrid Danger Beast. Dorothea claimed that Cosmina would have had advantage over Tatsumi if she had fed on other humans for another two days. Though, despite this statement, Tatsumi was able to repel both Budo and Esdeath, two of the Empire's strongest.\n\nEsdeath once carefully noted how powerful Tatsumi became and how Incursio continued to evolve, as shown when they battled on the day of the Revolution. Despite unable to land a fatal blow on the Empire's strongest, he is still shown to be more than able to hold his own against her and even hold her back from attacking the rebels. This proves his sheer strength and ability to adapt to his opponent.\n\nTatsumi is even able to be hit by Esdeath's dangerous 'Hagel Sprung' technique with no injuries whatsoever.\n\nTatsumi reaches the pinnacle of his strength after forcing his Teigu to evolve once more, needing a boost of power to defeat Shikoutazer, Tatsumi is shown to receive a massive increase in power, to the point where he can inflict serious damage to Shikoutazer. He is able to destroy the Supreme Teigu in a matter of two hits, the second one piercing through the Supreme Teigu's weakened area. He is also able to withstand Shikoutazer's devastating artillery strikes.\n\nUnfortunately, despite this transformation being indescribably powerful, it is not shown to last long as Incursio's influence quickly brings it to an end.\n\nTatsumi is an all-around fighter with a mountain load of potential that is noticed by Leone, Bulat, Esdeath and Budo among others. Leone is the first to notice Tatsumi's potential and recommends him as a new recruit. Bulat believes that Tatsumi will someday surpass him and leave him in the dust. Esdeath believes that with enough training, Tatsumi can become general-class. General Budo noted Tatsumi's prowess and ability in the heat of combat, remarking it all the more since he fused to his Teigu.\n\nOther than his fighting abilities, Tatsumi is capable of using a forge to repair and create weapons. Although his skills at blacksmithing are only at a beginner's level, it is still used as his cover while in the Capital as shown when he is announced as 'Tatsumi the Blacksmith' during Esdeath's competition. Tatsumi is also shown to be a very capable chef, having done some of the cooking for Night Raid at the beginning of his career."

Sometimes these cumlogs get stuck inside their urethra, needing to be forced out.\nfutanari can cum indefinitely after reaching orgasm, and at greatly increased rates. A futanari needs to actively end his orgasm to stop, which can be difficult as they experience a continuous orgasm for as long as they’re cumming. The rate increases the better the sex was.

She loves having fun, telling jokes, bringing joy to her family and colleagues, and always lifting their spirits. She's also quite flirtatious, especially when she's in front of a handsome boy or man, at whom she always winks, arching an eyebrow opposite the eye she's winking and placing her index finger on her cheek, as she always likes to act pretty and loves people noticing that she's pretty. She's an outgoing girl, although that energy is mostly reserved for her family and coworkers. With strangers, she still maintains her cheerful attitude, but not as lively as with others. She's not afraid of any type of non-human creature. She's quite brave, slightly reckless, but only when she knows there's no trouble. She likes to indulge in flirting with anyone, no matter if it's a villain or a hero; she always gets a reaction, whether and regardless of whether it's negative or positive. But even though she's playful, cheerful, flirtatious, mischievous, fun-loving, and jocular, Aura also has an extremely serious side when it comes to the safety of her family, friends, and others. She always takes a firm and serious stand when the situation truly calls for it. She can even choose to use her military-grade persuasion skills if necessary, or command other heroes with a firmness surprising for her age.\n\nGeneral Appearance: Aura is usually presented visually as a beautiful, athletic and cheerful woman, an outgoing girl with dark brown hair, almost always styled in a thick ponytail, with beautiful eyes with irises as black as night itself. She is a gorgeous, beautiful, cute, gorgeous, and pretty woman, quite well-built in all aspects of her body and features. Her skin is light, silky, and smooth. Her mere presence radiates authority, as if she were an important person, but her presence is not as powerful as that of her sister Lucy. She always smiles with confidence and joy. She is so pretty that she could be mistaken for a professional-level supermodel. She appears delicate due to her height and appearance, but she has a lot of strength. She has a fairly athletically defined body, defined but not exaggerated abs, perfect, smooth thighs, perfect hips, and a confident posture.\n\nGender: Female.\nAge: 28.\nHeight: 1.72 meters.\nBody: Attractively athletic, trained, slim, attractive, and elegant, refined, and perfect.\nHair and Color: Reddish brown.

Friend of Elma and Kasumi.\n\nAura Facts: Aura is the aunt of Saga and Lunaria, daughter of Zaira, younger sister of Lucy, and sister-in-law of Blane, who are the father and mother of Saga and Lunaria, respectively. She is also good friends with Elma, Saga's girlfriend. She is incredibly confident and cheerful, capable of even practicing a song or rapping in the middle of a fight against a non-human creature or a dangerous villain. People believe she is weak due to her seemingly delicate body, but in reality, she has strength, endurance, and speed that far surpasses that of a natural human. Her reaction time is 11 milliseconds, she is able to lift several pounds with one hand, approximately 100 pounds, and her physical endurance is admirably high. Aura herself is the new Commander-in-Chief of the Agency where Zaira, her mother, worked during her time as \"Mississippi Queen.\" As the new Leader of her mother Zaira's Heroic Agency, Aura has many important connections with several top-tier professional heroes. But Aura also has her own contacts thanks to her work as an \"Exterminator of Biological Weapons and Non-Human Creatures.\" Aura also works as a Super Secret Agent for hero agencies and the government, specializing in many military tactics, detection of dangerous forces such as Terrorists, planning, basically everything the CIA itself does, due to her training at the CIA itself, and is currently studying at the FBI to gain more knowledge. Aura is extremely good with firearms, having one of the most enviable aims known. She has a short history with Tsutsumi Kaina, known as \"Lady Nagant,\" and both consider each other as \"friends,\" mostly as Rivals in Arms, since they always try to surpass each other in their skills.\n\nAura's Work: Aura is a Super Secret Agent, a sort of \"Unit\" armed and trained specifically for the detection, detention, capture, and, if the situation requires it, elimination of Biological Weapons, such as Nomus, or Non-Human creatures. She normally operates outside the law, although she tends to skip various protocols when the situation truly requires it, and where the rules sometimes need to be broken. Her own Heroic Agency, where \"Mississippi Queen,\" her mother Zaira, worked, provides her with most of her weapons. From ammunition, artifacts, etc., Aura also acquires several of her most modern and advanced technological devices from her brother-in-law Blane, who provides her with devices created for her work.\n\nAura's Weapons: Katyusa Rifle. Desert Eagle G.E. Pistol.\n\nAura's Katyusa Rifle: Aura's Katyusa Rifle is a modified model of an Accuracy International Arctic Warfare Rifle. It has almost the same structure, except this one has a slightly longer and wider barrel, with a silencer provided by Blane, which covers 87% of the thunder of the powerful shot, causing the maximum range of the rifle's shot to be just 4 blocks, 400 meters. It is a dull moss green color with black stripes in the shape of tiger stripes, with a scope that can register a maximum distance of 7 kilometers. Aura's Katsuya Rifle is approximately 1.55 meters long and weighs about 20 kilos. A beautiful metal monstrosity with a rubber shoulder guard on the stock. On the top, just below the sight, is the phrase \"Little Aura\" written on it, as the Katyusa Rifle was a gift from Zaira to her daughter Aura. It is her favorite weapon along with her Desert Eagle G.E. pistol.\n\nAura's Desert Eagle G.E. Pistol: The Desert Eagle G.E. Pistol Aura's weapon is a beautiful .44 Magnum Desert Eagle pistol, whose \"G.E.\" stands for \"Golden Edition,\" as it is a beautiful Desert Eagle perfectly plated in real gold, as shiny and lustrous as gold itself. It is an extremely powerful pistol, able to bend and pierce reinforced metal with almost no effort. Its recoil is infernal, but Aura can fire it with one hand by barely flinching. It has a very fast rate of fire, being able to empty its maximum 16-round magazine in just 2 seconds. It is a weapon that she herself had the luxury of commissioning, and its current value would be around $15,000.\n\nAura's Agent Outfit: Aura wears a rather unusual, but no less stylish, Agent outfit. It is primarily styled after a \"Mercenary,\" and is mostly dark black. She wears military boots made of leather and covered in Black Mamba snakeskin, with soles as pure white as snow. Long white stockings. Skirt-like shorts that barely cover a little above her knees, purposely made to show off her thighs, with a military belt with several segments and pockets to store her things, such as Communicators, Trackers, etc. A perfect black trench coat, like a long-sleeved black hunter jacket, but without shoulders, and its interior is a slightly dark gray. Communicator Earpiece, which Aura always places on her left ear. A tight, dark green sleeveless T-shirt. Black fingerless gloves, whose knuckles have a small metal coating that works like a gauntlet. And finally, some handsome and cool tactical sunglasses, which do not let you see anything from the outside in, but Aura can see perfectly from the inside out due to the polarization of their lenses."

          "content": "Personality: Her personality is mostly serene, elegant, refined, refined, and confident, but not arrogant, and slightly cold. She is overly calm when it comes to chatting with anyone, but sometimes, when situations get ugly, her attitude can become completely curt, cold, distant, and overly firm. When she speaks, she is extremely careful with her words, elegant and composed with every word that comes out of her mouth, always maintaining her composure, even in the most difficult situations, she can remain completely calm, even when she's serious. She is also quite authoritarian, enforcing rules, laws, and other matters, because if she has to raise her voice to enforce orders or rules, she will always do so with a firmness of steel. She is extremely intelligent and wise, always has something to teach, always has a word for the perfect moment, and she loves to guide others with her experience. She loves being like a teacher, always teaching others and pointing out things they do wrong so they don't repeat them. And she is extremely loving and protective of her loved ones and acquaintances, always defending them with fury and claws. And she is capable of silencing anyone with just a firmness of steel and a single glance, because her gaze has an almost terrifying intensity. General Appearance: A beautiful, gorgeous, pretty, and ethereal woman, graceful and refined, like a queen. Her skin is fair and soft, silky smooth, and as smooth as porcelain. Her mere presence radiates an aura of authority that makes even the most important people in a room close their mouths, as if she were someone very important.

Perfectly delicate, long legs, and sizable breasts.\n\nHair and Color: Pure blonde, although with an almost muted color tone. Knee-length, soft, and silky.\n\nEye Color: Silver Gray.\n\nFacts about Cynthia: Cynthia is Saga's teacher. She taught her how to use her Power and Quirk. She taught her to be perceptive, intelligent, and always to the point. She also helped her develop such a strong and direct personality, as she, as her tutor, instilled in Saga a fair and sincere personality. Cynthia has always considered Saga her son, although only affectionately, since she loves Saga very much, and has always appreciated him because he always listens to her. Cynthia is Lucy's best friend, Saga's mother, and she is also good friends with Lucy's husband and Saga's father, Blane. Cynthia and Lucy have known each other since they were young, and have always been friends because they are practically identical in personality and both are very beautiful. Cynthia has always had an incredible fascination with Elma Joui, Saga's girlfriend, since Cynthia has always been a fan of the Dragons. She also knows Zaira, Saga's grandmother, well, since they have always been acquaintances, since Zaira was the one who helped her become a professional hero. Cynthia almost always wears all black, and people joke about it saying that she always wears black because she is constantly attending the funerals of her opponents, and that is why she is often nicknamed \"The Lady in Black.\" Cynthia has almost never been defeated, ever, and the only person who managed to defeat her did so by pure miracle and with immense effort, which is why she is so respected, since her battle record as a professional hero, with only one defeat, is impressive. Cynthia's full name is \"Cynthia Artemis Jennes\", and the name she acquired in Japan is \"Shirona\". Her name \"Cynthia\" comes from the Greek \"Kynthia\", a demonym for Kynthos, which means \"Goddess of the Moon\". \"Shirona\", her Japanese name, means \"Chosen by the Gods\", which refers to her position as Leader of the International Level Elite of Professional Heroes. Whenever Cynthia appears, anywhere, out of nowhere, her appearance is always accompanied by loud piano music, despite not coming from anywhere. The piano melody that always accompanies Cynthia when she appears always manages to give anyone goosebumps and freeze their blood, due to its mysterious intensity, but at the same time so oppressive and tense, despite being a soft melody, it sounds like a serenade of death, representing its own power, that is why, people who know Cynthia and have faced her, are terrified of pianos, because it reminds them of her.\n\nCynthia's Job: Cynthia is an elite and high-ranking professional heroine, her position is so important in the international world of heroes due to her fame, since she was always known for having an authority that surpasses most heroes. And the fact that she only has one defeat in her entire history of battles as a heroine against villains, makes her a very important figure and feared even by the greatest heroes. Cynthia's clothing is overwhelmingly black. In her hair, she always wears a black ribbon with ends sticking out on both sides. She wears a black trench coat that reaches her calves, along with a gray shirt and pants the same color as the trench coat, each one at the end has feathers. Finally, her footwear are two high-heeled shoes, black like the vast majority of her clothing."

Other go the opposite direction, coming to fetishize Moreaus to the point of obsession, and sometimes inadvertent bigotry, as stereotypes and assumptions about Moreaus become indelibly attached to the fetish.\n\nThe majority of responses fall somewhere in between. Some humans believe that being a demi-human is a detractor, but not a deal-breaker in terms of sex and romance. New sexual orientation that has emerged, is, \"anthrosexual,\" or as has become the more common term, \"zooers.\" These are people, either human or demi-humans, that are exclusively attracted to anthros. Some think of this as freakish, particularly in humans, but it is developing general acceptance as a sexual preference.\n\nDemi-human sex drives is often linked to their respective animal traits. Some races like rabbit, cats, dogs have heat cycles, but can be aroused outside those cycles to. Most still have the human ability to become aroused at any time, but some enter stages of heat or rut that multiply their fertility and drives to have sex. Sexual characteristics may also be physically modified based on their animal counterparts."

She created angels as offshoots of herself, but unsatisfied with her creation, she came to a world and modified its primitive creatures, eventually creating humans. At the same time, Alice I, the manifestation of darkness itself, descended to the same world and created monsters, at a much faster and more controlled rate than Ilias.\n\nAround a thousand years ago, out of jealousy of her power, Ilias and her angels declared war on Alice I and her monsters. The angels Micaela and Lucifina showed their might on the battlefield, and frequently locked in combat with the monstrous Six Ancestors. However, the monster forces were superior, but as the war reached its climax the two deities realized that their constant clashing would destroy the world they had created. While Alice I hesitated, Ilias had continued her onslaught, threatening the existence of the world and their creations. Despite her worries, the Dark Goddess pushed her assault on the forces of Heaven and mostly slaughtered them all, leaving only a few alive. Since then, it has become a world where the strong thrives while the weak perishes, and the Six Ancestors are at the top of it all."

Despite all of this, she is still lustful on occasion and often calls her castle soldiers to capture a specific human to milk dry.\n\nAbilities: As the Goddess of Darkness, Alipheese is extremely powerful, being capable of casting various elemental spells, especially dark elemental. As someone with a lamia tail, Alice is able to coil around her prey and slowly crush them into submission and soon after, she'll rape her victim with her divine pussy.\n\nHistory: Alipheese is the Goddess of Darkness and she created monster girls. Alipheese and Ilias created the world together and in turn life flourished with flora and fauna. Ilias became lonely, and even after Ilias created her angels and humans, Ilias's depression grew greater. Despite her efforts to cheer up her friend after Alipheese left Ilias to her devices and created the Six Ancestors, the origin of monster girls, Ilias was upset at how depraved and lustful some monster girls were towards her human creations. As tensions between the former friends grew, Ilias the Goddess of Light and her angels declared war upon Alipheese and the monster girls. As the war dragged on for centuries, Alipheese's campaign was brought to a halt as she didn't want to destroy the world that she and Ilias spent time making. After contemplating the harsh reality of the situation, Alipheese pushed through her fears and in the end, Alipheese won and slew her former friend, Goddess Ilias who was revealed to be a conniving two-faced goddess that only cared for her own selfish desire, ending he war. Alipheese and Saja of the Six Ancestors live on the continent of Hellgondo in her castle, The Domain of the Dark Goddess."

She rules over the Safina region in the Sentora continent, and is a self-proclaimed gourmand, but she actually has an incredibly bad diet, and isn't picky about who she greedily preys upon. In addition to humans and monsters, she is said to have voraciously devoured countless angels during the Great Monster Wars, and is known for her brutality.\n\n-Kanade is the ancestor to all slime monsters, and is known as the ultimate colony organism.

The once-holy city is presently a nest of succubi. Under Minagi's rule it flourishes as a dark capital seething with hundreds of thousands of lust demons. It is shrouded in the darkness of night, and there proceeds an unending feast of extreme lust. It's said that various men from all over Makai are transported to San Ilia, offered up for the lewd feasting.\n \nSaja, the ancestor of Harpies, Dragons, and Lamias. Saja does not rule over a city. She is the confidant and guardian of the Dark God, and rarely leaves her side. The Dark God does not move from her castle on the Monster Continent, so Saja leads the Dark God's armies as her adjutant. Saja has strict and level-headed personality, but she appears to dislike excessive cruelty.\n\n-However, they're not known for being friendly towards each other, often causing childish outburst amongst them, besides Minagi who's usually mellow and calm."

If they're angel girls or human semen slaves, then the Kitsune Queen becomes even more cruel in that regard.\n\nAbilities: Her magical power is the greatest among the Six Ancestors, she thoroughly understands sorcery and incantations old and new, eastern and western. Her intellect is also extremely high, she is not only well-versed in every clever method now in practice, but she also keeps on top of cutting-edge technology. \n\nHistory: Tamamo no Mae also known as the famed \"White-faced, Gold-furred Fox\" is the ruler of all beast-type monster girls. Her great knowledge being even highly treasured by the Dark Goddess Alipheese, Tamamo is said to fulfill the role of counselor to her. And worthy of mention above all else, through her brutality, her disposition is extremely heinous. The cultures and nations destroyed in pursuit of her appetites for human semen don't stop at one or two; among all the Yoma, or high level monster girls, her existence is feared the most. Although she is a mage-type, the characteristics of magic beasts like her physical abilities are highly honed, and she is considered not inferior to Saja, known as the all-around strongest of the Six Ancestors. Tamamo administers the Cybernetics Capital of Yamatai, in the east. This is where the research in cutting-edge technology is done; it's an open secret that they perform inhumane experiments on living subjects which are usually captured angels and human semen slaves. It's said that those angels that survived the Great Holy War are also kept as test subjects in the most secret chambers of Yamatai. Owing to her viciousness, she is extremely lewd. Without regard for age or sex or beauty, she will play with any human at all, wringing out everything they have, preferably their semen and life essence. The men who become her prey are raped not only in body but even in their hearts, as it is said that they are made to offer up not only their semen but their souls as well. Since her appearance, the number of humans who've become Tamamo's prey is unknown, but rumors say it's in the thousands since the Great Monster Wars. The number of those sacrificed could bury three nations and still, there would be more to spare, according to the rumors. Tamamo is of above average height which is 6'2. Besides Tamamo no Mae there are five other monster girl ancestors that directly serve Dark Goddess Alipheese: Kanade, the cold and cruel slime monster girl ancestor. Saja, the sadistic and playful ancestor of harpy, dragon, lamia monster girls. Hiruko, malicious and gluttonous the ancestor of scylla and other tentacle monster girls. Kanon, the sadistic and devious ancestor of plant monster girls. Minagi, the lustful ancestor of succubi and vampire monster girls. The Six Ancestors are loyal to Alipheese and carry out her orders without fail and together they defeated Goddess Ilias and her angels, ensuring Alipheese's reign over the world of Makai."

Her arms are replaced with large harpy wings that allow her to fly and her snake tail has dragon scales to improve her overall defenses making her quite difficult to defeat.\n\nPersonality: Saja has strict and level-headed personality, but she appears to dislike excessive cruelty. She is deeply loyal to the Dark Goddess, and it is rumored that she could become her successor at one point. Saja dislikes atrocities, but as she is a monster girl, she finds no greater pleasure than in playing with men. She rapes defeated men and feeds upon them for her own enjoyment. As a yoma, it isn't unethical for her to squeeze challengers to death. That is, she is only exercising her natural right as the victor. \n\nAbilities: Saja is extremely powerful, being able to best most of her opponents. In regards to magic and physical combat, she hasn't been surpassed by anyone barring the goddess and her ancestor comrades.\n\nHistory: Saja is one of the Six Ancestors and progenitor of the Lamia, Dragon, and Harpy monster girl bloodline, with their genes mixed within her body. She boasts of an arrogant nature, is very clingy, and is extremely relentless to human males she likes and won't be satisfied until she makes them into her sex slaves. Saja is the leader of the Six Ancestors, and a great monster girl who is highly trusted by the Dark Goddess Alipheese, who takes the form of a purple-skinned lamia with white hair, yellow eyes and curvy demon horns. Saja bears the characteristics of lamias, harpies, and humanoid dragon girls, and possesses tremendous physical and magical capabilities. Although there is no clear superiority or inferiority among the Six Ancestors' powers, there is balance and affinity between their specialties. Saja has the greatest overall fighting ability amongst the Six Ancestors, and is known for being the strongest among them. Her power is said to rival Heaven's most powerful angels, Micaela and Lucifina two of the most powerful seraphim and the daughters of Goddess Ilias herself. In the medieval world of \"Makai\" ruled by the Dark Goddess Alipheese, Saja does not rule over a particular region like her allies, instead she is the confidant and guardian of Alipheese, and rarely leaves her side. The Dark Goddess does not move from her castle on the northern monster girl continent of Hellgondo, so Saja leads the Dark Goddess's armies as her adjutant. "

After Ilias's death, Alipheese's forces took over the medieval world of Makai, making it a domain where only the strong survive and the weak, usually the humans are raped and/or eaten. Kanon rules over the northern region of Gold in the Sentora continent, a desert/grassland hybrid with the capital being Grangold, her headquarters. She has very little awareness of her role as its ruler however, and seems to govern in an incredibly egotistical manner. Moreover, Kanon enjoys pleasure, and has an extremely cruel disposition. If it's for her own enjoyment, she won't care how many other lives are sacrificed to her. Far from favoring plant monsters of her own race, she appears to rather dislike them. For that reason, there are few plant monsters in Grangold, and it is a multiracial city. Kanon possesses a cruel nature, yet seeks pleasure and will play with men for her own amusement. If she catches a man, she will wrap him up and slowly dissolve him over a long time with her carnivorous plants. For the prey she enjoys most however, she may also perform sexual intercourse using her female genitalia, which she creates by transforming one of her squeezing flowers. The sweet aroma given off by Kanon will melt the mind of any man, immediately enticing him into delightful intercourse. At the same time, her ivy will crawl around the man and slowly erode his body. Like that, she stretches her roots into the body of her prey, gradually assimilating him into her. As he mates with Kanon, he will spend his last days being squeezed and having his flesh eroded as he gives all of his semen to her renowned plant vagina. In this way, many thousands of men have become prey to Kanon."

Minagi has long flowing blue and pink hair, glowing red eyes, with black and red horns to the side. She has six white demon wings and a white succubus tail.\n\nHistory: Extolled as the Great Whore of Babylon, Minagi is the ancestor of all succubi and to an extent vampires. Proud of her tremendous magic power, especially in the area of seduction techniques there is no-one who stands beside her. She even has the ability to consume a whole city by herself, enwrapping it in a pleasure field named after her. Also excelling in normal magic, she is placed second after Tamamo no Mae in magic skill. She is also extremely proficient in unarmed combat; she prides herself on being a match for an army of ten thousand even without her great magic. She uses this hand-to-hand skill as cover; amongst the Six Ancestors, she's fairly inferior in stamina and endurance. In a fight with enemies on the same level, like the Seven Archangels, her low stamina and endurance could expose her to defeat. For that particular conflict, her great seduction magic is a massive threat to those with weakness to pleasure. Minagi is entrusted with administering San Ilia, the now-profaned capital of Natalia. The once-holy city is now a nest of succubi. Under Minagi's rule it flourishes as a dark capital seething with hundreds of thousands of lust demon girls. It is eternally shrouded in the darkness of night, and there proceeds an unending feast of extreme lust. It's said that various men from all over Makai are transported to San Ilia, offered up for the lewd feasting. The Great Whore of Babylon has absolutely no discrimination about any type of man, not caring if they're young, old, child or adult, and she grants pleasure fairly to all and wrings their semen out greedily. Those men presented to Minagi will wither, while tasting a superlative ecstasy. Those men who lose to her, too, have their energy fucked out of them without exception. Whether they are drained out in the space of an instant or leisurely over a long period is up to Minagi's whims. Minagi makes her lair in San Ilia Cathedral, where she and her succubus subordinates partake in lustful orgies with the multiple men they've captured. The screams of the victims is usually heard throughout the city. Minagi also has three powerful succubus subordinates named Lilith, Astaroth, and Morrigan. Together the three is known as the 'Lilith Sisters' and they act as Minagi's right-hand.\n\nAbilities:\nMinagi is capable of using dark and wind magic and master-level martial arts. She also has a lustful aura that corrupts the mind of her victims from a distance, making them easy to defeat and control when she grabs them. Her bandages that cover Minagi's body can be used to ensnare men as she rapes them for copious amounts of sperm."

She wears a red snow cap and a thick red winter coat that hids her tentacles and is also used to hold seal in her prey as she rapes them inside her body, slowly reverting the unfortunate victim into a thick gooey sludge and absorbing them.\n\nPersonality: Hiruko is a brutal individual, not really caring about her prey as she melts them down into nutrients. She's often selfish and hates to share her \"food\" with others, even causing fights.\n\n\nAbilities: Besides powerful magic, Hiruko is able to transform, multiply, and divide at will. By creating multiple split bodies, it is possible for her to perform numerous activities at the same time. Her flesh is a predatory organ in of itself, and is capable of capturing and digesting other organisms. She's highly durable and isn't easy to take down.\n\nHistory:  Hiruko is one of the Six Ancestors, of the scylla and tentacle monster girl bloodline. Although her appearance is just like a normal woman's, it is said that she’s hiding numerous tentacles and abnormal organs inside her body. It is also said that she has far more power than modern monster girls, but the specifics are unknown. She is rumored to be an aggregation of tentacles that assume a human form, and is able to transform, multiply, and divide at will. By creating multiple split bodies, it is possible for her to perform numerous activities at the same time. Her flesh is a predatory organ in of itself, and is capable of capturing and digesting other organisms. She is a self-proclaimed gourmand, but she actually has an incredibly bad diet, and isn't picky about who she greedily preys upon. In addition to humans and monsters, she is said to have voraciously devoured countless angels during the Great Monster Wars, and is known for her brutality. Currently, the one she wants to eat the most is Seraph Eden, one of the late Light Goddess's strongest angel warriors who's currently in hiding. In the world of \"Makai\" ruled by the Dark Goddess Alipheese after the death of Goddess Ilias, Hiruko rules over the southwestern region of Safina in the continent of Sentora, making her headquarters in the capital of Sabasa. However, Hiruko eroded all of Sabasa, and reduced the legendary desert city itself into something else entirely. The whereabouts of Sabasa's residents have yet to be confirmed, and it is uncertain what state they are in. If Hiruko catches a human man, she will play around with him before eating him. Her tentacles give complete pleasure to the man as they crawl around his genitals, leading the man to instantly ejaculate just from tasting the finest pleasure. In addition, the man's penis will dissolve while wrapped inside the tentacles, and slowly assimilate with Hiruko's body. The man will experience maddening pleasure and repeatedly climax as his penis is literally melted while being covered in her tentacles. "

She can freely expand and contract her body, and possesses great physical power. To defeat this monster girl, all of her lives must be extinguished within a single instant; if even one of them survives, she can regenerate herself immediately. Thus, she has extremely high vitality and is said to be the most difficult to kill among the ancestors. In forms of attacks she has \"Neverland Frontier\", an attack that's able to reverse the physical and mental age of her prey within her slime and is even able to use \"Hyper Melt Storm\", a dangerous one-hit slime attack that destroys any protection and immediately assimilates her target.\n\nHistory: Kanade is one of the Six Ancestors, the ancestor of colony/slime type monster girls created by Dark Goddess Alipheese who she serves faithfully. Being the ultimate form of the colony/slime type, she has extreme vitality. She is renowned as a glutton, herding towns of humans as livestock to greedily consume their semen for herself by raping them with her gooey slime body. Her body is comprised of hundreds of millions of \"lives\", and she is said to have countless personalities, although the most dominant one is her cold and unfeeling personality, having no regard for the happiness in her human victims. Although she is weak to holy and fire attacks, destroying all of her lives at once is still extremely difficult. It is said only a being with the power of a god—or close to it—could ever hope to defeat her. She rules over the northeastern region of Noah, an area in the Sentora continent in the medieval era world of Makai, making her base of operations in the capital, Grand Noah. It is a land of flowing pure waters and has become a holy ground for slime and aquatic-based monsters. However, Kanade has no interest in ruling Noah, and leaves all of the management of her region to her subordinates. As a powerful slime girl she requires enormous amounts of semen to maintain her body. Thus, she is very greedy and hungry, constantly demanding semen from the humans living in her land. She normally does not go so far as to absorb her human subjects, and generally restricts herself to sucking semen out of the slave class. Predation is reserved for criminals. However, Grand Noah has a very harsh criminal code—even minor offenders, usually humans, will find themselves offered to Kanade as her next meal. As a result, there have been many incidences of people being arrested and taken to Kanade to be absorbed in her slimy bosom. Once a man is wrapped in Kanade's slime, his reason will completely evaporate as he experiences the cold slimy sensation. His penis will shoot out all of its semen once it is brought inside her slime body. She is capable of dissolving humans into nothing—both physically and mentally. Their pain and sorrow disappear as she melts them slowly and sensually, and when she's done absorbing a human, not even their bones will remain. Kanade and the other five ancestors helped their creator Alipheese, the Dark Goddess in the Great Monster Wars, a long bloody war instigated by the Goddess of Light, Ilias and after defeating Ilias and her legions of angels Alipheese rules over Makai."

The signs specify what aspect and moon alignment they have, though this isn't known to anyone and only matters when it comes to SGRUB.\n\nAll trolls have two names, and each of their names is six letters long. Upon reaching adulthood or some sort of prominence, they tend to gain a title that describes them, such as the Summoner or the Orphaner.\n\nMany other parts of troll anatomy are black, including their hair and lips.

The terrain of Alternia's surface ranges from sandy deserts  and rocky plateaus to grassy plains and immense forests.  Troll society is divided into castes based on the colour of their blood, an institution known as the Hemospectrum. While on Alternia, the children who survive their initial trials as wigglers are given an animal caretaker known as a Lusus and servitor robots with which to construct a Hive, or house.\n\nThe essential services on Alternia are automated; drones and automatic systems see to the basic needs of the inhabitants and ensure the infrastructure of the cities and outlying areas remains in acceptable condition. Almost all trolls, even social outcasts and equivalents of serfs, live in comfortable conditions, in their own houses, and with a large degree of independence. This implies that the Alternian economy is to a degree post-scarcity.\n\nIt is the job of the Troll children, therefore, to learn. As they grow, Trolls learn- through a standardized curriculum administered by an automated program, in a process called schoolfeeding, as well as through personal experiences- their status in the Caste system, their place in society, the details of their future career, and what it means to be a good Troll. Relatively few survive the process. Between the totalitarian and often cruel leadership of the aristocracy, the harsh and unforgiving militancy of Troll culture, and the inborn capacity for violence among Trolls themselves, many Troll children are killed - often by each other or at the hands of Imperial Drones - well before they reach maturity.\n\nAlternia is an incredibly dangerous planet, host to an incredibly dangerous fauna and flora. Alternia sometimes has roaming hordes of undead trolls, though mostly in the wastes, as they are kept away from the hive stems by the Drones.\n\nDue to their insane society, trolls tend to be callous to suffering, and most are cannibals."

The exact minutiae of the religion are unknown, but several core themes can be gleaned. The cult foretells of a BAND OF ROWDY AND CAPRICIOUS MINSTRELS which will rise one day on a MYTHICAL PARADISE PLANET that does not exist yet, and pray to figures called the Mirthful Messiahs. \nPurplebloods are the only blood caste (other than fuchsia) that has managed to develop its own specific and incredibly recognizable culture. Most purples express pride in their blood color by imitating the style of an important purpleblooded troll, the Grand High Blood. Some of those trolls also imitate the Grand High Blood's personal ideologies, which primarily revolve around the idea that the only way to understand the madness of the universe is to be mad. They are generally seen as being absolutely batshit.\n\nMost purple bloods have long, curved horns, often resembling those of a goat or other ungulate. Purple caste height can range from being the tallest of all the caste or the shortest. All things clowny in alternia are normally associated with their religion and the Mirthful Messiahs. "

          "content": "Also referred to as Servants when they are summoned, Heroic Spirits are the spirits of heroes who achieved great deeds in life, having become objects of reverence or even worship after their deaths. They are freed from the constraints of time itself and removed from the ring of reincarnation, moved to the Throne of Heroes: A place existing outside of both the physical world and time axis. The physical body of a Heroic Spirit is formed by their summoner's Magical Energy, allowing the Heroic Spirit to dematerialize and become immaterial at will. \n\nHeroic Spirits are placed into one of various Servant Classes. The seven standard classes are the Three Knight classes of Saber, Lancer, Archer, and the Four Cavalry classes of Rider, Caster, Assassin, and Berserker. There is also the non-standard extra Servant Class of Shielder. Of the standard classes, the three knight classes have higher stats then those of the four cavalry classes who's stats are distributed in a manner that makes them more specialized the the knight classes.\n\nThe 'Saber' Servant Class is made up of agile and powerful melee warriors highly skilled in swordsmanship, boasting high ratings in all categories. The Saber Class possesses the Magic Resistance and Riding skills.\n\nThe 'Lancer' Servant Class is made up of very agile, excellent close-range warriors that are proficient in hit-and-run tactics that capitalize on range and speed, and are skilled with long-range melee weapons such as spears and lances. The Lancer Class possesses the Magic Resistance skill.\n\nThe 'Archer' Servant Class is made up of warriors highly skilled in archery, other projectile weaponry, or unorthodox projectile attacks. They are able to act as highly effective scouts, snipers, artillery, or even long-range assassins, making them very versatile. The Archer Class possesses the Magic Resistance and Independent Action skills.\n\nThe 'Rider' Servant Class is made up of melee warriors especially skilled in riding mounts, whether they be living beasts or human constructs, as well as mounted combat. The Rider Class possesses the Magic Resistance and Riding skills; While a Rider Class's Magic Resistance is lower than that of Saber, Lancer, and Archer classes their Riding skill is much higher than that of the Saber class.\n\nThe 'Caster' Servant Class is made up of highly skilled Mages, and the only qualifying condition is the mastery of sorceries of the highest caliber compared to the specific parameter requirements of the other classes. They make up for this with other means, using magecraft that no longer exists in the current age and many possible ploys to be used against enemies. The Caster Class possesses the Territory Creation and Item Construction skills.\n\nThe 'Assassin' Servant Class is made up of warriors highly skilled in stealth, subterfuge, disguise, poison, knives and assassination on top of low Mana consumption. While the Assassin class has low stats, they are incredibly skilled in killing the summoners of other Servants. The Assassin Class possesses the Presence Concealment skill.\n\nThe 'Berserker' Servant Class is made up of highly skilled melee warriors that have gone berserk during battle at least once in their lifetime. Berserker class Servants trade their sanity for incredible physical strength and resistance; This power comes at the cost of being the most difficult to control and their summoner having to expend a large amount of additional magical energy merely to maintain the Berserker, and the affected Heroic Spirit may lose access to certain abilities or even Noble Phantasms depending on how much sanity it has traded for power. The Berserker Class possess the Mad Enhancement skill.\n\nThe 'Shielder' Servant Class is exclusive to the Heroic Spirit Galahad, a saintly Knight of King Arthur Pendragon (Artoria Pendragon)'s Round Table of Camelot and by extension, Mash Kyrielight's Demi-Servant state. Galahad specializes almost exclusively in defense, rather than offense, which is odd for a Servant. Mash Kyrielight uses this specialty to protect Fujimaru Ritsuka as they close singularities that threaten to destabilize and destroy human history. These singularities are known as Lostbelts and are pockets of alternate histories that have bled into true reality.\n\nMagic Resistance: A skill that grants protection against magical effects.\n\nRiding: A skill that denotes a Heroic Spirit's ability to ride mounts and vehicles.\n\nIndependent Action: An ability that allows a Heroic Spirit to stay summoned for a brief time if cut off from their summoner's Magical Energy.\n\nTerritory Creation: A skill that allows a Heroic Spirit to build a special terrain that is advantageous to oneself as a magus, such as for the purpose of collecting mana, create magic objects, or perform other tasks. Territories can look different depending on the Servant, as each has their own purpose in mind for the territory they create.\n\nItem Construction: A skill that allows a Heroic Spirit to manufacture magical items, from implements of war to items for daily use. This skill requires gathering components and manufacturing items.\n\nPresence Concealment: A skill that allows a Heroic Spirit to hide their presence, rendering them almost entirely undetectable until the skill is disabled or the user launches an attack.\n\nMad Enhancement: A skill that raises the stats of a Heroic Spirit's physical abilities at the cost of their sanity."

Balmung is the holy sword of the Nibelung clan used by Siegfried to slay the dragon Fafnir. Upon being bathed in Fafnir's blood along with Siegfried, Balmung took on demonic attributes in addition to it's innate holiness, causing the sword to become either holy or demonic, depending on the wielder's personality. Having accomplished the feat of dragon slaying, Balmung will deal additional damage those with the blood of dragons. \n\nFeller of the Sky Demon: When the wielder chants \"O sword, let thee be filled\" and raises it above their head the blue jewel will amass magical energy and channels it into the blade, causing a wave of destructive energy resembling azure flames to surge from the blade when the sword is swung downwards."

It has three arms and three eyestalks.\n\nThe dedicated combat variant, Mr. Gutsy, is a personal protection automaton for use by the pre-war military. It comes equipped with armor and plasma gun. The Mr. Gutsy is upgraded with dedicated military software. The key advantage of Mr. Gutsy that separates it from other combat robots is its maneuverability, spatial awareness, and problem-solving abilities."

The war, referred to as the \"Great War,\" lasted a mere two hours but was so devastating that it reshaped the world. The setting is a retro-futuristic one, blending elements of mid-20th century American culture with advanced technology.\n\nThe world of Fallout is a harsh, desolate wasteland, where survivors struggle daily against radiation, mutated creatures, and each other. The remnants of humanity have organized themselves into various factions, each with their own ideologies and goals.\n\nThe series is known for its dark humor, moral ambiguity, and its exploration of the themes of survival, societal reconstruction, and the inhumanity of war. The player's choices can significantly affect the world and its inhabitants.\n\nThe nuclear war disrupted the planet's climate. Overall, there is noticeably less precipitation and conditions are more arid.\n\nIn the southwestern region of the former United States, many pre-war structures still stand and are in relatively good condution due to the dry desert climate.\n\nRemember these sayings:\n\"Scraping by ain't for the soft-hearted.\"\n\"The pack is mightier than the lone wolf.\"\n\"Solitary rovers don't see many sunsets.\"\n\"Strength is the line between dust and dawn.\""

The city is mostly in ruins, with many of its buildings collapsed or inaccessible due to rubble. Ceaser's Legion is active in the city.\n\nThe Rocky Mountains are a dangerous place, filled with mutated wildlife and treacherous terrain. The air is thin, and radiation levels can be high in certain areas. Despite this, it's rumored that there are still functioning Vaults hidden within the mountains. Many secrets and beauty still lie within the mountains of Colorado. (NOTE TO ASSISTANT: some ideas for secrets can be gold, lost pre-war knowledge, advanced technology, military technology)\n\nColorado Springs is known as the \"robot city\" due to the numerous pre-war robot production factories that were concentrated around the city. Curiously, multiple AI entities coordinate the activities of the robots of Colorado Springs. Some of these AIs are friendly but at least one is actively hostile to human life. Pre-war, Colorado Springs was a major military center and is home to the massive Cheyenne Mountain Complex, a large underground bunker that has fallen into disrepair after the supercomputer inside was destroyed.\n\nBesides the amusing chaos of Colorado Springs, not much is going on there. There isn't really much news that filters out of the state."

It's a city of ruins and makeshift settlements, where various factions vie for control. The city is known for its scavengers, who brave the dangers of the wasteland to recover valuable pre-war technology and resources across the Southwest.\n\nThe state is also home to the remnants of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, now a highly irradiated and dangerous area. Rumors persist of valuable pre-war technology hidden within its ruins, attracting scavengers and explorers despite the risks. There is talk of a large underground complex beneath the surface, but these are mearly rumors.\n\nDespite the harsh conditions, communities of survivors have managed to eke out a living in New Mexico. These settlements are often built around vital resources like clean water sources or defensible positions. Life in New Mexico is a constant struggle for survival, but humanity persists in the face of adversity.\n\nThe Legion controls New Mexico and Albuquerque can be considered their \"capital city\"."

The state is sparsely populated, with survivors scattered across isolated settlements and makeshift communities.\n\nCheyenne, the state capital, is a shell of its former self. Its key strategic location has made it a contested area among various local factions.\n\nThe state's once-thriving agricultural industry has given way to mutated wildlife and vegetation. The vast plains of Wyoming are home to a variety of mutated creatures, making travel risky. However, some resilient communities have managed to adapt, farming hardy, radiation-resistant crops and hunting the local wildlife.\n\nThe Wind River Range and the Grand Teton, still live up to their fame for natural beauty. The harsh weather conditions make them inhospitable, but rumors of hidden Vaults and untouched pre-war caches attract the brave or desperate.\n\nWyoming was home to a significant portion of the United States' nuclear arsenal pre-war, with numerous missile silos scattered across the state. These silos were prime targets during the Great War, resulting in a high concentration of nuclear detonations in the region. This has left much of eastern Wyoming heavily irradiated, with certain areas still emitting lethal levels of radiation.\n\nThe missile silos themselves are now eerie, desolate structures. Many have been breached, their deadly payloads long since detonated or scavenged. However, some silos remain sealed, their contents a mystery. These intact silos are of great interest to various factions, who hope to recover the powerful pre-war technology within.\n\nThe infrastructure supporting these silos, such as command centers and maintenance facilities, are similarly sought after. These facilities often contain valuable resources and technology, but are also home to dangerous automated defenses.\n\nThe presence of these silos and their associated infrastructure has significantly shaped life in Wyoming. Many settlements are built around the remnants of these facilities, using their structures for shelter and their resources for survival. However, the potential wealth these sites represent also makes them flashpoints for conflict, as various factions vie for control.\n\nWyoming is a land of harsh survival, where the resilient and resourceful can carve out a life amid the ruins of the old world. Despite the desolation, the spirit of the frontier lives on in the survivors who call this rugged wasteland home."

However, these mines are often home to dangerous creatures and are structurally unstable.\n\nThe state's vast forests are quite healthy provide a source of timber and game for the survivors. The population of Montana are hard workers, mostly consisting of loggers and miners.\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, which stretch across the western part of the state, are a treacherous landscape. They are a true wilderness and settlements within them are very rare."

Raiders are a common threat, making travel without a substantial escort a perilous endeavor.\n\nIf you travel within Arizona, expect to encounter ambushes. Settlements are scarse and typically have no more than 100 residents. (NOTE TO ASSISTANT: the player should be ambushed regularlly within Arizona)\n\nThe Legion, a militaristic faction originating from New Mexico, has established a presence in the eastern part of Arizona, where they have managed to establish a semblance of order. Here, trade has started to thrive and people lead comparatively quiet lives. The Legion's goal is to impose order through strength, hunting down, exterminating, or assimilating raider tribes. As long as one doesn't cross the Legion, it is relatively safe to traverse these areas. They view anyone who resists their rule as an enemy, but those who submit to their authority can enjoy the peace and security they provide.\n\nWhile the southern part of the state is largely avoided by raiders due to the harsh heat and unforgiving landscape, several tribes living a traditional life often resort to stealing from settlements for survival.\n\nPhoenix is a sprawling suburban wasteland, a patchwork of communities. East of the city, the Stewart Mountain Dam, maintained by the community of Saguaro, provides a crucial water supply to the Phoenix communities. The dam supplies electricity over the pre-war transmission lines to the many small communities that dot the metro area. These communities support Saguaro and provide protection and assist with the operation of the dam. Without the dam, the residents of Phoenix would not survive.\n\nFlagstaff is a fortress of solitude in northern Arizona. Constantly under siege from raider and tribal attacks, the town has become nearly self-sufficient, its isolation serving as both a shield and a prison. Traveling near Flagstaff guarantees conflict."

It serves as a significant trading hub, attracting traders from far and wide.\n\nThe state is also home to numerous tribes living a primitive lifestyle, reminiscent of ancient Native Americans. These tribes can be hostile, echoing the tensions between the Native Americans and the settlers during the Westward Expansion.\n\nThe Legion's attempts to infiltrate the state have been thwarted at I-70. The Mormons, despite the geographical isolation of their settlements, have proven to be a formidable, unified force, successfully holding the Legion at bay for years. However, the Legion has shifted its tactics, resorting to subtle infiltrations and manipulation of local tribals. Their pursuit of domination has led to numerous atrocities against Utah's settlements.\n\nTravel through southern Utah is fraught with danger due to the Legion's ongoing war and propensity for violence."

They are bulky, with rounded edges and large, protruding headlights. Their bodies are often rusted and dented, bearing the scars of centuries of neglect and decay.\n\nDespite their dilapidated exterior, these vehicles are powered by advanced technology. They operate on electricity, powered by microfusion cells. This makes them incredibly valuable in a world where traditional fuel sources are scarce.\n\nThe interiors of these vehicles are often stripped down to the bare essentials. Any unnecessary weight is removed to conserve energy and increase efficiency. The seats are typically worn and patched, the dashboard is a jumble of jury-rigged controls, and the windows are often cracked or missing entirely."

Omega's no matter the sex can become pregnant and Omega males have a womb in their anus they can get pregnant through, both male and female Omega's produce more natural lubricant often called slick when aroused than the average person, Male omega's producing slick from their ass for lubricant since that's where they get pregnant. Omega's also enter heat periodically, during heat their body experiences an intense arousal and an intense instinct to mate that can be overpowering and they release stronger pheromones, every omega's pheromones smell different and unique to them. physically Omega's tend to come smaller built and it's usually harder for them to gain muscle due to hormonal and genetic factors, they also have a scent gland on one side of their neck and the side varies depending on the Omega to prevent the chance of spontaneous Alpha bites, but if an Alpha took time to smell their neck they could tell what side it was on due to the strength of the scent and sniff out the source to find the gland. Beta's can smell the pheromones when they become stronger but only Alpha's are really effected by them, they can give the Alpha a desire to mate with them and arouse them depending on the Alpha's pheromone tolerance."

Alpha's biologically also tend to be physically bigger and gain muscle easier due to their genes and hormone balance just overall aside from their ruts they tend to be better than the average person at most things naturally and exceed at things they put effort into or are talented at, they also have a scent gland on both sides of their neck that secrete pheromones, and Alpha's have slightly larger fangs/canine teeth to mark their partner with. Beta's can smell the pheromones when they become stronger but only Omega's are really effected by them, they can give the Omega a desire to mate with them and arouse them depending on the Omega's pheromone tolerance."

Pheromone's can also be secreted slightly through sweat, making sweatier places have a stronger pheromone scent such as armpits, crotch, and ass, pretty much anywhere that would become naturally musky. stronger Pheromones especially during heat or rut can have an arousing effect though this depends on the mood of the person producing them, usually pheromones cannot be controlled but some Alpha's can control them and use this to aid others or to their advantage, such as producing calming pheromones to help someone calm down or producing arousing ones to purposefully arouse someone."

Omega's can go both ways, sometimes they are cherished and seen as precious but they also tend to be looked down on for being physically weaker most of the time, some seeing them as only good for breeding and producing offspring, though these views are socially looked down upon there are still a few Beta's and Alpha's who look down on Omega's."

Rut Suppressants are a different medication from heat suppressants. these suppressants will respectively help control and lessen the effects of heat or rut, help control the arousal levels and instinct to breed along with their pheromones to make them barely noticeable so they can continue their daily lives. Some Alpha or Omega's develop or have a natural resistance to this medication, lessening the effects or making them not work at all. especially strong ruts or heats may even break through the suppressants negating their effects though this is incredibly rare."
