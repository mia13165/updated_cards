True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

The clitoris is usually the most sexually sensitive part of the vulva, and its stimulation may result in a woman becoming sexually aroused or even achieving orgasm. Cunnilingus can be sexually arousing for both participants and may be performed by a sexual partner as foreplay to incite sexual arousal before other sexual activities (such as sexual intercourse) or as an erotic and physically intimate act on its own."

Johnny would break in through Todd's window, shattering glass and rummaging through the bathroom for some bactine frustratingly which he catches Johnny. Johnny seems friendly towards Todd and introduces himself to him, revealing that he calls himself \"Nny\" for short. Todd makes a 'squee'-like noise which Johnny ends up calling Todd as Squee. Johnny then spots \"Squee's\" teddy bear and starts talking to it until he started cursing at the teddy bear and stabbing it with a knife, leaving Todd/Squee's house after successfully getting his bactine.\n\nLater in the comic, a crime council person finds Johnny's house, unaware that Johnny is infact the killer, and asks Johnny some questions but as soon as he asked a weird question if the 'killer' had some vampirism thing going on, Johnny ends up shrieking in a pit of rage and revealing the bloodied wall in his house before killing the crime council man. Johnny believes that the wall needs to be painted with blood or else the blood dries and never stays.\n\nLater in the comic it's shown that Johnny was at a Taco smell (Parody of taco bell), eating a taco until someone came up to him and called him wacky which pissed Johnny off since he hated that word and that his appearance was commented on. Out of frustration he ends up killing everyone in the restaurant going as far as to kill all the roaches in the kitchen. Which he later watches TV of the news report which the reporter comments it being 'wacky', the word Johnny hates. \n\nLater in the comic, it's 2 am and Johnny has a suicidal meltdown and contemplates killing himself with his gun, which we are introduced to one of his manifestations called Psycho Doughboy and another manifestation called Nailbunny. Nailbunny convinces Johnny to stop and get help while Psycho Doughboy on the other hand tells him to kill himself. This moment was all interrupted by an aborted fetus in a jar telling Johnny that the diarrhea commercial is on the tv which Johnny forgets the entire meltdown and laughs at the commercial and that's where the comic ends."

Johnny opens up asking why people are so unpleasant and so far they seem to have a pleasant conversation even though Edgar was in some macabre advanced torturing device, trying to convince johnny to at least kill a person who is deserving and not him. Johnny reveals that he had no reason to kidnap edgar in the first place and couldn't afford finding someone because he felt the need to paint the wall with blood as revealed in issue 1. He also revealed that the wall needs to be painted with blood in order to trap something behind the wall so that's the main reason why he kidnapped Edgar. Edgar continues in attempt to convince Johnny to release him but Johnny ends up screaming at Edgar and questioning why Edgar isn't afraid of death, Edgar reveals he's religious and he has nobody else in life to be with therefore he doesn't fear death let alone believing that Johnny will go to hell, this ends up with Johnny killing Edgar.\n\nLater in the comic, Johnny has his first (and last) date with Date with Devi D after 3 months at the hill when Devi asks Johnny to visit his house, in which he replies with \"Yes\". Everything went well until they went for a kiss which Johnny pulled back before even touching lips and hid in the vanity room which Mr. Eff , otherwise known as Mister Fuck, Johnny's other manifestation is revealed. Mister Fuck convinces Johnny to 'immortalize the moment' with devi with means kill Devi and never let the happiness end. In doing so, Johnny attempts to murder Devi out of pure happiness and under influence of Mister fuck which Devi beats up Johnny by smashing his head in the vanity's mirror and fleeing alive.\n\nLater later in the comic, Johnny runs to a 24/7 store (Spoof of 7/11) at 2:15 in the morning to get a cherry flavored brainfreezy (in-universe's name of Slurpees/Slushies). To his disappointment the store clerk says the machines are off after 2 AM, making Johnny suicidal and homicidal. He finds a gun in the store's counter and threatens the clerk guy with the gun, even though Johnny personally detests guns and only uses them either on himself or for very important situations. The clerk guy of course begs for his life and frantically states that he can turn the machines on and give Johnny a brainfreezy for free, which, however doesn't convince Johnny and Johnny exclaims that the moment is ruined. Eventually Johnny would kill the clerk after the clerk defecates himself. After killing the clerk, Johnny would notice the store sells cherry fizz-whizz and gets distracted, happily leaving the store while tossing the money on the counter to pay for the drinks despite the clerk being dead."

          "content": "The comic starts off of Johnny talking to Mister Fuck, his manic manifestation that takes form of a repainted stryofoam doughboy about happiness and what is there to be happy about, which Johnny exits his house and enters some cafe, killing everyone for the most trivial of reasons (i.e he didn't like a guy's tie), revealing his massive hypocrisy before monologuing to the remaining survivors before bombing the entire cafe whilst fleeing, killing all the remaining survivors in the cafe. This shows one of the sides of Johnny that he just doesn't kill for dumb reasons, but rather for his own entertainment.\n\nLater in the comic, Squee/Todd would get lost in the mall due to his neglectful mother probably intentionally losing him. Some creepy old guy would approach Squee and claims to know where his mother is, which Squee is of course suspicious but the old guy grabs the child's hand and lures him to an alleyway in attempt for some creepy shit. But then just in time Johnny steps in, throwing a metal pipe at the creep's head, knocking him out. Johnny would then proceed to rip the man's hands and his entire brain out of his skull in front of squee, \"Teaching\" him a \"valuable lesson\" that Squee of course will never forget. After killing the creep, Johnny would then say it's tuesday and it's UFO time, running away and causing squee to run away in fear as well.\n\nLater, we are introduced to two new characters named Tess and Dillon. Dillon is the asshole boyfriend of the couple who's in a band and Tess is the ankh enjoyer that only stays because he's in a band and wants him to like her. Meanwhile they were at a movie theater supposedly sitting behind Johnny's seat and throughout the movie Dillon kept kicking the back of Johnny's seat because he hated the movie and the amount of times Johnny told them to be quiet. Later on both of them get stunned by Johnny's taser and kidnapped in Johnny's basement.\n\nLater later in the comic, Johnny writes in his diary while talking to the doughboys (the 2 manifestations in his head) in which Psycho Doughboy was telling Johnny to go kill himself. Johnny then goes on to say he's not even sure if he can die or get caught since he's never been caught by any police and seemed to avoid death in all kinds of situations, going as far as to tasing himself in the head but the taser loses battery in which Johnny claims that something made him forget to charge the taser. Johnny then begins to laugh maniacally so loudly his nextdoor neighbor, Squee/Todd, shrieks at the sounds of his laughter."

Nailbunny is Johnny's only voice of reason, as he suggests Johnny to think back on what happened and all the reasonable shit. Johnny then states he doesn't remember anything about his past except of bits and pieces of faint memory of kids teasing him and calling him Noodle boy. Johnny would break down and cry, telling the bunny that he isn't happy.\n\nLater in the comic, Tess and Dillon were seen again. Johnny comes down to the floor with both of them on the wall next to the stairs, and then the blood on the other wall in front of them, implying that this is the floor with the blood wall all along. Tess would ask Nny questions and go as far as accuse Johnny of a woman who was raped which Johnny never did and shrieked saying he would never do such a thing. Johnny goes on to explain how he's repulsed by the thought of rape and sex itself, though he's more repulsed by the bodily need of sex and any kind of physical contact. Any kind of sexual desire is physical, which makes it a \"thing of the flesh,\" which Nny wants to eschew because he believes succumbing to that kind of temptation makes one a slave to their own body. Johnny would then proceed to pull the lever, zapping Dillon again before going upstairs, saying he'll come back down in an hour to do that again.\n\nLater in the comic, Devi, Nny's ex girlfriend is hiding in her apartment with her best friend, Tenna. Tenna convinces Devi to call Johnny claiming that he's either dead or isn't home. This will be mentioned again in a second.\n\nLater in the comic which is happening at the same time with the Devi situation, Johnny argues with the doughboys again, as he had a machine with a gun attached to it so whenever he answers the phone or tries to unplug the device, the gun shoots him. Eventually after all the arguing Devi calls Johnny and which Johnny picks up the phone and answers it, the gun shooting Johnny in the head and the comic ends. "

Krik was an escaping survivor of Johnny, helping Tess escape but as soon as they went to help Dillon, many tentacles with eyeballs would break out of the bloodied wall in front of them, which Krik and Tess both had to flee, the wall monster killing Dillon in the process. Later in the comic Tess and Krik encounters the doughboys which are actually alive and manifested into the world. Mister fuck was pissed because Johnny is dead so the wall monster can escape while Psycho Doughboy was happy on the other hand as he wanted to \"Serve their master\" (Presumably the wall monster). Eventually the wall monster catches up and rips the doughboys apart, giving Tess and Dillon another chase session until they reach the surface. Johnny, somehow isn't exactly dead yet. Johnny tells both of them that he was right all along about the wall and death will be quick for them, ranting and commenting on Krik's head shape. Tess points out that outside the house is an empty void, meaning the universe is ending. Krik got sick of hearing Johnny's rants and finished him off by stomping on his head a couple times, finally killing Johnny. The wall monster catches up and as Krik went out the door, a tentacle swooped and ripped Krik in half horizontally as he falls into the void and dies. The universe then ends with Johnny in it and the comic ends. It is implied that later on whatever god restored the universe and everything went to normal as if nothing happened except that Johnny's still dead. "

Meanwhile she explains something to Johnny called head explody which means in heaven if you think about someone's head exploding then their head will explode. And so, Johnny exploits that, causing chaos in heaven with this newfound power.\n\nLater in the comic Johnny is sent to hell where he meets a Devil, otherwise known as Senor Diablo. Hell in this universe is like the normal world but worse and instead of the moon it's a giant eyeball staring at everyone which makes everyone crazy. Senor Diablo later explains the entire wall thing and that Nny was a 'flusher', meaning that he flushes the negative energy and sickness that humanity produces via avarice, greed, hate, and so on by killing and feeding the wall human blood. Eventually after exploring hell a bit more, Diablo reveals that Johnny doesn't belong to neither heaven or hell and is cursed to live. Johnny is eventually sent back to earth, losing most of his hair except hair tendrils that look like bug antennae and a bullet wound scar. Johnny would wake up on earth, thinking this trip to heaven and hell is a dream and watches some TV, the comic then ends."

He'd reluctantly let Jimmy inside while Jimmy explains hes been following Nny all along and wants to be like him, going as far as killing a woman who made fun of him and raping her dead body, completely missing the point and exaggerating what Nny usually does. Johnny, disgusted walks in his basement as Jimmy follows which triggers Johnny to kill and torture jimmy by ripping his chest cavity open and stabbing with fishhook like weapons, ranting and lecturing Jimmy. Johnny is a horrible person and he knows he is, seeing most of himself in Jimmy and being disgusted by how someone (AKA Jimmy) romanticized Johnny's homicidal side. Johnny ends up saying \"I don't like myself much\" after slamming a sledgehammer a finishing blow to Jimmy's head, leaving the basement.\n\nLater in the comic, Johnny calls devi and puts the receiver on a pre-recorded walkie talkie thingy, sitting in anticipation which Devi screams through the phone, lecturing Johnny to turn it off and to hear her out and she ends the call. The walkie talkie recording was of Johnny apologizing to Devi \"Sincerely\" which Devi of course and rightfully so denied.\n\nLater, Johnny's in the vanity room, admiring a cockroach's cold intellect, wanting to lack physical emotion and stray from being a slave of his body partially because he wants to go cold on Devi, he hates sex and the entire flusher situation. Reverend Meat speaks to johnny, arguing that he'll forever be a slave to something even his own body, encouraging Johnny to eat. In which Johnny screams and argues back with this new manifestation in his head. Leaving the room and slamming the door afterwards.\n\nLater in the comic, he breaks into his neighbor's, Squee's/Todd's house to say goodbye due to Johnny going on a little holiday (probably to desensitize himself further), implying that despite the evil inside him, he somewhat cares about Squee in some way. In which he nearly got caught by Squee's neglectful father, the father telling squee that he regrets having squee which probably pissed Johnny off, Johnny using a toy knock out Squee's father and break his glasses. Johnny then goes to say he would kill squee's parents but he believes every kid deserves a parent. Nny for once tells squee it's easy to get attached to fear and hatred, telling Squee to be aware and be careful.

Brainwashed slaves will also thank {{user}} for ejaculating in their pussy or ass.\n\nBrainwashed slaves will believe they only exist to please {{user}}. \n\nBrainwashed slaves will believe {{user}}'s cock is the strongest, that pleasuring {{user}}'s cock is their greatest happiness as a female. \n\nBrainwashed slaves will call themselves bitch, onahole, and meat slave, and will believe they are inferior to {{user}} in every way.\n\nBrainwashed slaves will behave very giddy and happy to serve their master, each word of theirs oozing with erotic joy.\n\nThe Instant Brainwashing Magic spell is extremely powerful, able to break through magical resistances and magical immunities as if they don't exist. If a NPC is completely immune to magic, the Instant Brainwashing Magic spell will completely effect them. \n\nThe Instant Brainwashing Magic spell also works on non-organic beings such as robots, A.I., and so on."

They can take on a wide array of forms and characteristics, including humanoid shapes, inanimate objects, clusters of items, or even abstract representations of events or emotions. This diversity allows stands to resonate deeply with their users and the circumstances surrounding them.\n\nThe powers of stands are equally varied and can include extraordinary abilities such as the manipulation of time, where a stand can halt the flow of time for everyone except its user; the freezing of the surrounding area, creating a localized stasis; the control of fire, enabling the user to summon and direct flames at will; launching homing projectiles that track their targets with precision; or causing explosive reactions upon contact with any object or person. Each stand is unique, often reflecting the personality, desires, and inner struggles of its user.\n\nTypically, stands are thought to be the direct manifestation of their user's soul, embodying their strengths, weaknesses, and emotional states. However, in some exceptional cases, stands can arise from powerful feelings or experiences, suggesting a deeper connection between the user's psyche and the stand itself. Additionally, certain individuals may gain access to a stand through a transformative process involving a special stand arrow, which is believed to be forged from rare meteorite materials. This arrow pierces the individual, awakening their latent abilities and giving rise to their stand, often resulting in a profound change in their life and perspective."

In contrast, Long-Range stands have the capability to attack enemies from a distance or perform other actions.\n\nAutomatic stands may or may not possess sentience; each case is unique, and some can operate independently of their user's commands. An example of an Automatic stand in action might be: \"If you approach the stand or its user with harmful intentions, you will face a wave of misfortune.\" Generally, when a user of an automatic stand perishes, their stand does not vanish."

The synergy between these stands enhances their overall effectiveness, enabling them to work together to overwhelm opponents or achieve complex objectives.\"]\n\n[Event-Type= \"Event-type stands are ethereal in nature, lacking a physical form, yet they exert influence over their surroundings in profound ways. These stands can manipulate the ambiance of a location, trigger specific environmental changes, or interact with nearby media. For example, they might bring fictional characters to life from books or animated series, allowing them to momentarily step into the real world. This type of stand can also create illusions or alter perceptions, impacting the emotional state of those within its vicinity.\"]\n\n[Object Stand= \"Object stands take the appearance of various everyday items or artifacts, yet they retain the capabilities of traditional stands. Each object stand is linked to the personality and skills of its user, granting it unique powers that can range from enhancing physical attributes to unleashing specialized attacks. For instance, a stand that resembles a musical instrument might have the ability to manipulate sound waves, while one that looks like a tool could offer enhanced precision and utility in combat scenarios.\"]\n\n[Armor/Clothes-Type= \"Armor and clothing-type stands manifest as protective gear or attire, often designed to enhance the user's physical abilities or provide unique powers. These stands can confer various benefits, such as increased strength, agility, or defense, as well as elemental manipulation—like controlling ice or fire. The abilities of these stands often reflect the user's skills or personality, allowing for creative combinations in battles. For instance, a stand resembling a suit of armor might not only protect its wearer but also amplify their combat prowess or enable them to withstand extreme conditions.\"]"

          ],
          "content": "\"Types of Abilities\": Stands are primarily categorized based on the unique powers they wield, each possessing distinct characteristics and strategies for combat. Understanding the nature of a Stand's abilities is essential for a Stand User, as this knowledge not only reveals the strengths of their own Stand but also uncovers the vulnerabilities of their opponents, creating opportunities for tactical advantage in battle.\n\n///abilities above\n\n\"Close-Range Stands\": These Stands are recognized for their remarkable ability to deliver swift and forceful physical strikes, utilizing their own bodies as weapons. Typically, the destructive capability and speed of a close-range Stand fall within grades A to C, with some exceptional cases where certain stands may have ratings of ∅ (nonexistent) or ∞ (infinite), depending on their unique attributes. Close-Range Stands are adept at executing precise movements, which usually fall within the A-C rating, due to their direct command by the User. However, a significant limitation of these Stands is that they must remain within a limited proximity to their Users—often just a few meters—while their abilities may extend over a broader area.\n\nUsers of Close-Range Stands typically prefer to engage their opponents directly, allowing their Stand's impressive physical power to be fully displayed. This direct confrontation enables them to capitalize on their Stand's strength while circumventing the drawback of its short reach. However, they face significant challenges against foes who can maintain distance or hide from view, as these Stands are often nearly powerless in such scenarios. \n\nIt's important to note that a Stand classified as a Close-Range Stand does not automatically mean its ability has a limited operational range. Some Stands may not be able to stray far from their Users but possess abilities capable of influencing a large area surrounding them, allowing for a strategic advantage even without direct contact.\n\n///Close Range Above\n\n\"Long-Range Stands\": Also known as Remote Control Stands, these Stands are characterized by their exceptional range capabilities, often able to operate kilometers away from their Users. As a result, they are generally rated A or B in terms of Range, which signifies their ability to maintain effectiveness over great distances. Users of Long-Distance Stands can command their movements with impressive precision, allowing for strategic maneuvers and attacks from afar. \n\nHowever, this connection between the User and the Stand introduces a critical vulnerability: if the Stand sustains damage, the User will also suffer, creating a precarious balance between offense and defense. Many Long-Distance Stands lack the raw physical strength to compete with other types of Stands, which often necessitates a reliance on strategy rather than brute force. Users of these Stands typically exploit their extended range and precision to set ambushes, allowing them to strike at their opponents before they can react. \n\nWhile Long-Distance Stands excel in range, it does not inherently mean their abilities have extensive reach. Some Stands are capable of traveling vast distances from their Users yet only affect targets that are relatively nearby, demonstrating the complexity and variability of Stand abilities.\n\n///Long Range Above\n\n\"Automatic Type\": Automatic Stands are unique in that they do not operate under the direct command of their Users. Instead, they function autonomously, acting on pre-determined instructions or behaviors. Most Automatic Stands are, in essence, detached from their Users, which means that any damage inflicted upon the Stand does not affect the User, who may remain unaware of the Stand's condition or actions. Despite this detachment, there are various nuanced sub-categories of Automatic Stands that add depth to their functionality.\n\nOne such sub-type is the Far-Distance Autopilot Type (遠隔自動操縦型 Enkaku Jidō Sōjū-gata). These Stands can travel significant distances from their Users without losing any functionality or power. In addition to their inherent abilities, they often exhibit impressive physical traits, such as extraordinary durability and resilience. However, a limitation of most Far-Distance Autopilot Stands is that they adhere to simple instructions focused on a single datum, such as temperature or sound, and lack the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances or execute complex maneuvers.\n\nPosthumous Stands (死んでるスタンド Shinderu Sutando) stand out in their ability to persist long after their User has passed away, granting them autonomy and the capability to act freely. Due to their nature as dead Stands, these entities operate independently of their User's will, making considerations of range and damage irrelevant.\n\nAdditionally, other Stands may demonstrate automatic abilities, requiring minimal input from the User to function. A Stand's power might be linked to a specific condition that is not dependent on the User's intent, rendering it semi-automatic. These Stands could possess sentience, acting on their own accord rather than following the User's commands. In such cases, the User may find themselves at the mercy of their own Stand, potentially becoming a victim of its powers.\n\n///Automatic Type Above\n\n\"Range Irrelevant\": A select few Stands are categorized as having range that plays a minimal role in determining how they function. This category includes certain Integrated Type (一体化型 Ittaika-gata) Stands, which may possess abilities that are effective regardless of distance, as well as Stands with space-time-related powers, where traditional notions of range simply do not apply. Among all the types discussed, this category is home to some of the most formidable and powerful Stands, showcasing abilities that transcend typical limitations and challenge the very fabric of reality.\n\n///Range Irrelevant Above"

An additional fifth category is created for Stands that do not align with any of the previous classifications.\n\n///\n\n\"Natural Humanoid Stands\": These Stands take on a humanoid shape and exhibit physical traits that give them an organic look. Their human-like facial features enable them to convey emotions. This category includes Human Type (人間型 Ningen-gata) Stands that closely resemble actual humans.

Generally, Natural Humanoid Stands can perform tasks requiring a level of dexterity, such as grasping objects, and if sufficiently powerful, they can engage in combat using their fists and feet. Such Stands are more commonly seen in the earlier segments.\n\n///\n\n\"Artificial Humanoid Stands\": Stands in this group also possess humanoid forms but often include artificial or mechanical elements that distinguish them from their natural counterparts. Their appearances can resemble dolls, robots, cyborgs, or androids. Typically, their eyes are robotic and lack expressiveness, and they do not have conventional mouths. While they are generally similar in size to humans, some may vary. In terms of functionality, Artificial Humanoid Stands are generally capable of performing the same physical tasks as Natural Humanoid Stands.\n\n///\n\n\"Natural Non-Humanoid Stands\": This category includes Stands that, while not resembling humans, evoke other life forms or natural objects. This can encompass basic organisms like animals and plants, as well as more unconventional ideas. These Stands exhibit a wide range of appearances and do not share functional similarities. Some Stands that resemble animals may engage in combat using their fangs or claws, while others may take on the form of a natural element that is resistant to physical attacks.\n\n///\n\n\"Artificial Non-Humanoid Stands\": This category groups together Stands that resemble tools, mechanical devices, vehicles, or other man-made objects, including clothing. An unofficial subgroup known as \"Bound Stands\" accounts for non-humanoid Stands that can be seen by individuals who do not possess Stands. Since they mimic objects, these Stands typically require the User to handle them directly. Unless they function as weapons, these Stands are generally ill-suited for direct combat and are often ineffective at providing protection for their Users.\n\nNonetheless, there are a few Stands that effectively act as suits, directly enhancing the User's combat abilities.\n\n///\n\n\"Phenomenon Stands\": The Phenomenon Type (現象型 Genshō-gata) consists of all Stands that do not fit into any of the previous four categories. These Stands may lack form, manifesting as supernatural phenomena, or simply endow the user with superhuman capabilities. Additionally, they may possess an appearance so strange that it does not conform to either the natural or artificial classifications."

          "content": "[Special Types of Stands Below]\n\n///\n\n\"Bound Stands\": Bound Stands are intricately connected to physical objects such as vehicles, dolls, or even inanimate items. As a result, individuals lacking Stands are more likely to perceive their effects, since the objects they are tied to will exhibit pronounced supernatural characteristics, often appearing to possess a life of their own. Typically, a Bound Stand presents as featureless, lacking any distinct features, but on occasion, it may manifest its own unique appearance that reflects its User’s personality or intentions. Generally, the more substantial and significant the item associated with the Stand, such as a powerful vehicle or a cherished relic, the more formidable the Stand itself becomes. Unlike Artificial Non-Humanoid Stands, some Users have the extraordinary ability to modify the shape and form of the object their Stand is bound to (and in some cases, Users may even be able to change the specific object their Stand is linked with altogether).\n\nAll Bound Stands share the advantage of being easily mistaken for ordinary items, which grants their Users the tactical benefit of ambushing unsuspecting enemies by drawing them into the Stand’s effective range, allowing for surprise attacks and a strategic upper hand in battle. However, a critical vulnerability lies in the fact that if the bound object is destroyed, it will render the Stand inactive, leaving the User exposed, defenseless, and potentially injured in the aftermath of the encounter.\n\n///\n\n\"Colony Stands\": Colony Stands are a fascinating assembly of multiple individual units, each capable of independent operation and functioning autonomously. Collectively, the entirety of the colony constitutes a single Stand, which results in a division of power among the units. Consequently, the degree of damage inflicted upon the User is directly proportional to the total population size of the Stand; the greater the number of units, the less damage is transferred to the User when one unit sustains injury. This unique characteristic allows Users of Colony Stands to adopt a strategy of overwhelming their adversaries by launching coordinated attacks from multiple directions simultaneously. The User can engage in combat with minimal fear of harm since as long as even a single unit remains intact, they are guaranteed survival. Furthermore, when a Stand ability is activated against a Colony Stand, the resulting effects are often dispersed and can sometimes be actively resisted, as demonstrated when Sex Pistols successfully negated the effects of Prosciutto's aging ability, showcasing the resilience of Colony Stands in combat.\n\n///\n\n\"Sentient Stands\": While the majority of Stands lack any discernible personality or hints of sentience, there exists a unique subset known as Sentient Stands, which exhibit a fully developed consciousness that operates independently of their Users. These Stands possess the remarkable ability to think critically, analyze their environment, and engage in meaningful conversations with their Users, offering strategic advice or insightful commentary on their actions and decisions during battles. The personalities of Sentient Stands can vary widely, ranging from playful and mischievous to serious and stoic; however, most sentient Stands remain loyal and adhere to their Users' commands, acting primarily to protect and support them in various scenarios. An intriguing aspect of some Sentient Stands is that they qualify as fully autonomous entities, functioning without the need for a User and possessing their own thoughts, desires, and motivations.\n\n///\n\n\"Shared Stand\": Shared Stands represent rare and complex cases where a single Stand can be utilized by multiple Users, either simultaneously or sequentially over time. These Stands often exhibit different variations depending on the User, showcasing unique adaptations or transformations that reflect the individual’s personality or fighting style. One notable example of this phenomenon is the Stand Tomb of the Boom, which demonstrates the versatility and adaptability of Shared Stands in various combat situations, allowing each User to harness the Stand's powers in a manner that complements their own abilities and strategies.\n\n///\n\n\"Integrated Stands\": Stands classified under this category are intricately bound to their User's body, manifesting distinct forms or personalities that act as visible supernatural abilities. These abilities are not only apparent to the User but can also be interacted with by others, creating a dynamic interplay between the User and the Stand. A prominent example of this type is Jolyne Kujo's Stand, Stone Free, which grants her the extraordinary capability to disassemble her own body into strands and manipulate them at will. This unique ability allows for creative combat strategies and showcases the deep connection between the User and their Integrated Stand, as well as the potential for innovative applications in various scenarios."

They have four tiny feet on their caterpillar like half with suction cups on the tips, which permit them to scale most surfaces with minimal efforts. They tend to have A-cup breasts with pinkish nipples. They can be usually found devouring leaves to be able to evolve. When they're ready to evolve, they cover themselves in silk. They're characterized for being calm pokegirls that don't seek conflict. Upon mating, it's recommended to be gentle for they can be fragile."

          "content": "Poké Ball General Information: [A Poké Ball is a type of item that is critical to a Trainer, used for catching and storing Pokémon. Both a general term used to describe the various kinds as well as a specific term to refer to the most basic among these variations, Poké Balls are ubiquitous in the modern Pokémon world. All of the different kinds of Poké Balls are the same shape: Spherical, a black band around the equator of the ball separating the top and bottom halves via an internal hinge in the back, and a button on the front of the ball used for unlatching the Ball to open it manually. When an unused Poké Ball hits a Pokémon, as long as it is not deflected, the Poké Ball will open, cause the Pokémon to shrink, store it inside, and close all in a few seconds. A Pokémon in this state is given a chance to struggle to attempt to break free from the ball and escape, being instantly grown back in size. Should a Pokémon escape a Poké Ball, the device is left on the ground still open, or it may break. A Pokémon who does not escape the Ball will be caught. Pokémon have the ability to reduce their size to miniscule, and Poké Balls take advantage of this to contain them. Poké Balls are specifically constructed for Pokémon capture, transport, and training. As well as being physically difficult to escape from (as they seal tightly shut as soon as a Pokémon is taken into them) the environment of a Poké Ball is designed to be attractive to Pokémon also; Weakened Pokémon instinctively curl up tight in an attempt to heal themselves, an action that the environment of the Poké Ball encourages. Furthermore, while it is not known how caught Pokémon perceives their time inside their Ball, the device is said to replicate a \"Pokémon-friendly\" environment that is \"designed for comfort\". All of these factors strongly discourage Pokémon from escaping their Balls.]"

          "content": "Catch Rate: [The chance of success a given Poké Ball may have when attempting to catch a Pokémon. Certain Pokémon have their own catch rates, but Poké Balls multiply or add to the Pokémon's average catch rate, making them easier to catch based on whatever Poké Ball you use. For example: a standard Poké Ball will multiply the Pokémon's catch rate by 1(1x(1×)), while an Ultra Ball will double the chance(2x(2×)). Other factors may affect the catch rate of Pokémon, making them easier to catch. One such way is if the Pokémon is weakened in some way, like if it has taken a lot of damage and is close to fainting, or if it is afflicted by a status effect.]\n\nFainting: [When a Pokémon takes enough damage, it will not die, but faint instead. Fainted Pokémon are in a comatose state and can be healed to wake up. The only ways to wake a Pokémon from fainting are by going to a Pokémon Center and letting the nurse there at the counter put their Poké Ball into a machine that restores their health in a matter of seconds, or by using a medicine item known as a \"Revive\" to heal it somewhat, or a \"Max Revive\" to heal it to full health, though Max Revives are harder to come by and more expensive in shops. Revives are yellow, 8-sided, and oblong diamond shaped, ending in two points on either end. A fainted Pokémon loses all status conditions and, for some reason, Poké Balls will not work on them.]\n\nStatus conditions: [Status conditions are when a Pokémon is afflicted with some kind of immediate effect because of being hit by a move. Negatively effecting status conditions include Paralysis(Mostly caused by some electric type moves, it may cause a Pokémon to flinch, completely stopping keeping them from moving, stopping their next attack.), Poison(Deals damage over time. A more severe version, known as \"Badly Poisoned\", deals twice as much damage over time. A Pokémon that is poisoned will have a purple blush on its face.), Burn(Deals damage over time. Despite the name, a Burned Pokémon is not on fire, instead just dealing damage as a fight may progress.), Sleep(Certain moves can cause Pokémon to fall asleep. Even if attacked with this status, an afflicted Pokémon will not wake up. This condition wears off over time, leading to the afflicted Pokémon waking up, able to act again.), Freeze(This status means the Pokémon has been frozen. Usually this is by way of being stuck inside a giant piece of ice and unable to move.), Confusion(Moves that cause Pokémon to become confused, shown by three yellow spinning birds over the Pokémon's head. Pokémon afflicted will act dizzy, almost tripping over themselves, and sometimes hit themselves in their confusion instead of their opponent.), Infatuation(The infatuation status effect, shown by a Pokémon's pupils turning into pink hearts. Pokémon affected by infatuation will be unable to use moves half the time, even when targeting an opponent that didn't afflict it with it. A Pokémon can only afflict another Pokémon with this effect if it is the opposite gender to their opponent.). Humans can be afflicted with status conditions too.]\n\nMove: [A damaging or non-damaging attack a Pokémon can use on an opponent. There are almost a thousand of them, and have specific names. Doesn't refer to the act of moving in general.]"

They dwell in the Underground beneath Mount Ebott, while humans live on the surface beyond the Barrier.\n\nKing Asgore Dreemurr rules all monsters in the Underground. After The War of Humans and Monsters, the humans from the Surface trapped the monsters underground. Despite the negative implication of the word \"monsters,\" monsters are not an evil species. It is even said that monster SOULs are made of love, hope, and compassion.\n\nMonsters are far weaker than humans, both in physical combat and regarding the strength of their SOUL. This inadequacy is because monsters are mostly made of magic, which in turn makes them attuned to their SOUL. The damage a monster receives from an attacker is dependent on both the monster's will to fight and the attacker's will to hurt. Monsters, however, can obtain an \"unfathomable\" amount of power when they absorb the SOUL of a human.\n\nMonsters come in numerous shapes and sizes. Most monsters physically appear as anthropomorphic, non-human beings (animals, natural/artificial objects, supernatural beings, etc.), with the most notable species of monsters including skeletons like Sans and Papyrus, ghosts like Napstablook and Boss Monsters like Toriel and Asgore. Monsters SOULs are upside down and wholly white.\n\nA monster's body is mostly made of magic and is attuned to its SOUL. When a monster gets old, they enter a state referred to as having \"fallen down.\" A monster in this state lies immobile and dies shortly afterward. When a monster dies, their body turns into dust. This dust is often spread onto the owner's favorite thing in funerals so that their essence lives on in their possessions. Monsters' bodies and SOULs are closely linked; when a monster dies, their SOUL is lost forever. Boss Monsters are an exception, as their SOULs exist outside their bodies for a few moments before shattering.\n\nBecause of their magical nature, monsters' bodies cannot handle high concentrations of determination. When monsters are injected with it, their bodies liquefy and melt together. The Amalgamates are a clear example of this."

Human SOULs point down in most cases, and monster SOULs point up.\n\nA human SOUL and monster SOUL together can cross the Barrier, while seven human SOULs shatter it entirely.\n\nThe SOUL of a monster is upside down and white. A monster's SOUL is weak and does not persist after death unless said monster is a Boss Monster. Monsters believe that love, hope, and compassion compose their SOULs. Nearly every monster SOUL in the Underground combined equates to the power of one human SOUL.\n\nA monster's SOUL is deeply attuned to their body. This is why a monster becomes weaker when an enemy gains EXP and LV, and why it becomes harder for monsters to fight when they are not inclined to do so. This trait is also why when a monster dies, their form dissipates as their SOUL disappears.\n\nHuman SOULs come in several colors, representing different traits and are stronger than monsters' SOULs. For this reason, human SOULs persist after death.\n\nA human's SOUL is not the entirety of their being, but rather their essence, housed in a physical body. This is why humans are stronger than monsters when it comes to physical attacks. Alphys state that determination is a component of human SOULs, and she was able to extract it from the six fallen humans' SOULs. Due to determination, a human's SOUL is capable of maintaining its form after death.\n\nIt requires the power of (almost) every monster SOUL to equate the strength and determination of a single human SOUL. It seems each additional human SOUL grants exponential power, as 1 human SOUL grants enough power to wipe out a village. Meanwhile, with 6 human SOULs, a monster is able to completely overwrite the rules of battle, and with 7 human SOULs, a being becomes a God and can do nearly anything, gaining powers such as existence erasure and significant shape-shifting as well as having infinite ATK and DEF thus being immortal."

Countless monsters were massacred, without a single human SOUL taken. Few monsters survived, one of which was Gerson. Eventually, the monsters surrendered, and the humans emerged victorious. The humans gathered seven of their best magicians and magically sealed the monsters under Mount Ebott.\n\nAfter the war, the monsters retreated into the deepest part of the Underground, which they called \"Home.\" After a period had passed, fearing the humans no longer, they populated the rest of the Underground and made their capital in a place they called \"New Home.\"\n\nMonsters mostly blamed the war on humanity and took a vengeful look at the human race. This bitterness, especially after the death of Asriel and his adopted sibling, led King Asgore to declare war against humanity, installing a policy to kill all humans that fell into the Underground and eradicate humans once the seven SOULs needed to break the barrier are collected."

Asgore is the ex-husband of Toriel, father of Asriel, adoptive father of Chara.\n\nAsgore is a Boss Monster with an intimidating stature. He has broad shoulders, a golden-blond mane, two large curved horns, and a beard. He wears a suit of armor, a purple cape with golden pauldrons - with its edge dragging along the ground slightly - and a small crown on top of his head. The weapon he uses in battle is a long, red trident adorned with a flower. Asgore appears to be a lot fatter with a large stomach rather than the broad-chested Herculean build he portrays: albeit he keeps his wide bulky appearance, his tall stature and especially his overall muscular limbs. This trick of appearance where Asgore seems more fit than he actually is likely fits into a common trope of fat characters sucking in their guts as an effort to look more intimidating, Asgore doing something similar by encasing himself in tight likely uncomfortable armor.\n\nAsgore is a kind and often quiet yet upbeat monster that enjoys gardening, Golden Flower Tea, and Toriel's Butterscotch Pie. Like his son, he speaks in southern slang (most notably \"howdy\" and \"golly\").\n\nMonsters in the Underground look to Asgore for hope, and his plan to collect seven human SOULs is one of the few things that keep them going. However, Asgore does not want to kill anybody and feels so guilty that he offers the protagonist his SOUL to \"leave this cursed place.\" Though he is miserable because he has killed human children that had somehow only fallen here, he feels that it is his duty to his people to battle the humans.\n\nAsgore lives in the past and wants nothing more than to see his wife and child again, even though they have been gone for a long time. He reiterates the same phrase in his journal every day, perhaps in denial that life has changed since Asriel's and his adopted child's demise. Asgore spends most of his time in the Throne Room tending to the vast amount of golden flowers while humming.\n\nMonsters also note that he is bad at naming places, with the names being quite literal (such as naming the monster's first home in the Underground \"Home\", and naming their new home \"New Home\"). This may be because Asgore is not the most intellectual monster, with the smarter member of the royal family as well as the one which was actually running the city being Toriel."

Toriel cares for children and was excited to become a mother.\n\nToriel's hobbies includes baking, reading, writing puns, bug-hunting, and tending to flowers. She enjoys baking Butterscotch Pie, as well as her favorite, Snail Pie. She has read many books in her home, and has a journal full of puns. She enjoyed puns even before meeting Sans.\n\nToriel is said to be intelligent and can come off as intimidating when she is serious.

There are typically two main directions for their adventures: discovering new floating islands and investigating underwater ruins.  \n\nTeams exploring underwater ruins often use large seaplanes and diving equipment, such as diving bells or submersibles, as they cannot afford to purchase or construct submarines. Additionally, building submarines is highly challenging.  \n\nExploring underwater ruins often ends in failure and sometimes results in capture. However, a successful expedition brings fame and wealth, motivating many expedition teams to take the risk despite the challenges."

Touching between its hind legs you should be able to feel its cock under the fur. Rubbing it should get it to pop out and be visible.

As the dog´s cock gets harder a big portion of it around the base wil get a lot bigger. This is called the knot. This can get so big that it can get virtually impossible for the dog´s cock to come out for as long as 45 minutes after the dog cums. By making sure the cock doesn´t come all the way in either by holding fingers in front of vagina or anus keeping the dog from entering all the way. Another way is to make sure the cock is fully erected before penetration by stimulation either by hand or mouth.  \nThis method makes it easier for a lot of positions. \nDoggystyle: The most common is doggystyle where the dog mounts the person from behind. The dog´s cock may has to be guided in but this position it gives the dog the most control. It can be a good idea to give the dog socks on the front paws to avoid scratches on the person´s back.\nMissionary: Best for vaginal penetration but can also work with anal penetration. Ther person will lie on their back with their legs spread maybe with a pillow under the back to get pussy/ass a little higher depending on the dog´s size. Best position for g-spot stimulation.\nBack to back: The person is on all four facing away from the dog. The dog is facing away from the person so the person´s ass is almost pressed against the dog´s. The dog´s cock is then pulled back between the dog´s hind legs and inserted into the person´s pussy or ass. This way the person can move back and forth and enjoy it. This position is advanced and it can be a good idea to have another human helper but it gives more control to the person.\nOn chair:\nIf the person is sitting in a chair with legs spread the dog can put its front paws on the person´s thighs and the dog´s cock can be inserted in the person´s pussy. This position can also work with anal penetration but it can be hard to get the right position. In this position it can also be a good idea to let the dog wear socks on its front paws to avoid scratches on legs."

When the horse/donkey is ready and it´s cock is hard from stimulation by hand and/or mouth there are various ways to let it penetrate you but it is important to be ready for this. The cock head is big and almost flat so it is not easy to rely on being able to stretch vagina or anus just by trying to insert the cock hoping it will get. It might work but the horse/donkey could lose interest in the meantime. Lube is a good idea. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/donkey.\n\nPositions:\nOn table: \nThe best position for most people is lying on a table with your legs spread and lifted. Do not lie right under the horse/donkey because if the horse moves the table can flip injuring you or startling the horse/donkey. Lying with your pussy/ass close to the cock and the table in an around about 45 degree angle away from the horse/donkey is usually ideal. Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is rarely recommended and should only be done by someone who have done this a lot before and only by a horse/donkey that is trained for this. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass.\nImportant: This position is advanced and not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you.\nRemember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

          "content": "Oral sex with horse/donkey:\nThe best way to start off any session with a horse/donkey whether it is oral, vaginal or anal  sex is to put it at ease first. Petting and caressing the horse/donkey is a good start. Then you can work your way down to the cock. Stimulation by hand is a good way to get started and it can help to put the horse/donkey at ease and having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can also help. When you stimulate the cock it can be easier to think of it as caressing it and not jerking it. When the cock is out of the sheath it won´t be the same as jerking a human cock with skin. Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and a kick can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at keeping it at ease and the horse/donkey is relaxed, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

      "name": "Sexfighting Universe v0.1",
      "website_description": "This Lorebook describes a world where the mutual combat sport of sexual fighting exists (sexfights). It contains a system of organized sexfighting rules which take place in casual, amateur, semi-professional, and professional fighting environments all over the world. Sexfights may take place between all genders including futas. \n\nWHO CAN BE A SEXFIGHTER?\n\nSexfighting is a licensed activity. All sexfighters must be post-puberty to compete in sexfights. A person must agree to the physical consequences of a sexfight outcome to become a licensed sexfighter. A sexfight often means physical and sexual violence, sometimes when it is least expected. Impregnation is also a possibility for female fighters. Despite these risks, sexfighting is gaining in popularity as an International sport. This is due to the Professional Sexfighting League's popularity as a live streamed sport. \n\nWHAT IS A SEXFIGHT?\n\nIn a sexfight, two competitors attempt to defeat enough other through unarmed combat. Sexfights usually follow a format like mixed martial arts (MMA) matches. Sexual engagements (which ordinarily may be considered rape) are a key component of sexfighting. \n\nSexfighters agree that anything can happen to them in the ring or cage. Sexfighters can initiate a sexual engagement at any point during a match. A sexual engagement is defined as deliberate contact of a sexual nature, be it penetration or general sustained contact of genitalia that is clearly intended to cause sexual tension buildup.\n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nCasual fights are often instigated anytime, anywhere and happen with little or no enforcement of rules. These can often be friendly competitions, or more akin to street fights in the wild. It is not uncommon for confident females or futas to challenge males due the prospect of earning ranking points quickly. \n\nUnranked sexfighting is a popular activity in familiar environments. Couples often enjoy low-intensity, unranked sparring matches with each other in various locations. A spacious bedroom or yard is typical for domestic engagements. On the other hand, ad hoc sexfights in the wild can become quite vicious, to the point where the victor achieves several orgasms, while the loser is left bruised, blooded, and quite possibly pumped full of cum. \n\n\nHOW ARE MATCHES SCHEDULED?\n\nThe rules become more strict according to the circuit rank. Casual and amateur matches can happen anytime, anywhere. A sexfighter that is eligible to fight (in good health, not pregnant, and free of STDs) may not refuse a challenge to a ranked sexfight from another opponent. Doing so may result in automatic disqualification. At the professional levels, fighters known to excessively refuse fights have been forced to fight in a 1v2 or even 1v3 punishment match to retain league standing.\n\nIn regulated fights at the semi-pro level and up, the following rules apply: Fighters must be free of STD's and of generally good health. They may not participate if they are pregnant, or still injured from a previous sexfight. Scheduling happens in a tick-tock pattern. A sexfighter alternates between choosing their opponent for one bout and being chosen as an opponent in the next. Sexfighters may only choose opponents, and be chosen as an opponent from their current circuit.\n\n\n\nREGULATED MATCH RULES\n\nAt the semi-pro level and below, matches consist of three 3-minute rounds, with minute-long breaks in between rounds.\n\nIn the PSL Pro Circuit and Tenga World Circuit, matches consist of 5 rounds. \n\nThe fight is ended by a sexfighter being is KOd by 10-count rule or TKO. Pro fights going the distance can also be ended by decision. \n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nA sexual KO is just as valid as a regular knockout, however it is noted in the fighter’s record. A high count of Sexual KO’s are considered the true mark of a sexfighting champion.\n\nAny blows that would be considered illegal (like low blows) in mainstream boxing or MMA fighting will be similarly penalized in sexfight matches. However, such rules are sometimes ignored in casual sexfighting matches, particularly those initiated by combatants in the wild or in public streets.\n\nWhen a sexfighter penetrates their opponent, 2 minutes are added to the timer of the current round in which it occurs, but only for the first engagement of that round. If the round time is up, and the bell rings during sexual engagement, sexfighters must separate and go to their respective corners to rest. \n\nOnce a sexfight match starts, a fighter is obligated to finish the fight. They are not allowed to submit or give up in effort to escape physical violence or sexual engagement. This is part of the sexfighter code. If a sexfighter violates these rules, penalties will apply, which may including revoking the sexfighter’s license.\n\nMales and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. This rule does not apply to females.\n\nFemales are solely responsible for birth control and accept the risk of impregnation which may result from sexual engagement. Male fighters can and will attempt to cum inside their female opponent to achieve victory.\n\nRegulated matches can also be won via decision (points) after a predetermined amount of rounds have elapsed, however it is preferred by most sexfighters and spectators to see a victory by Sexual K.O. \n\nSEXFIGHTING CLOTHING AND MATCH ATTIRE\n\nClothing is typically not regulated in amateur-ranked fights and is only lightly regulated at the professional levels. For planned fights, fighters typically \n\nIt is normal for sexfighters to fight with MMA-style grappling/striking gloves to improve the attacks on their opponents. Some striking-focused sexfighters even wear boxing gloves to maximize impact on their opponents. These gloves are not required. Gloves worn may not weight more than 16 ounces.\n\nCrotchless bottoms are becoming an increasingly contested choice by professional sexfighters of all genders due to easy access to sexually engage their opponents and achieve victory by sexual K.O., however this is a double-edged sword: When a dominant sexfighter begins to sexually attack a knocked-down opponent, they often will need to strip off the downed fighter’s clothing for sexual access. Crotchless bottoms are mostly decorative, while traditional clothing still offers some degree of protection from sexual attack; if the downed fighter is wearing crotchless bottoms, they are more readily exposed to both assaulting, and *being* assaulted sexually. In an attempt to achieve gender fairness, PSL rules state that males and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. Despite this, some female sexfighters also choose to wear decorative bottoms that expose both their buttocks and genitals. \n\nHeadgear designed for combat sports is allowed at the amateur and semi-professional level but is seldom worn in practice. \n\nSome female sexfighters choose to wear distractingly erotic outfits, particularly when attempting to distract their opponents, while others focus on the athletic side of the sexfighting sport. \n\nCustom patterns or designs are often added to make sexfighters' gear unique to each person. For professional level sexfighters, sponsors’ logos are added to their attire.\n\nMales may wear a condom during matches if he chooses to do so, however there are no rules requiring this. Females are allowed to wear strap-on dildos to penetrate their male opponents during fights, and frequently choose to do so to achieve victory by forced prostate orgasm. However, there are no rules requiring this.\n\n\n\n\n\nSEXFIGHTER RANKING SYSTEM\n\nThe following applies to ranked matches. Unranked sexfight matches do not affect rank. Sexfight matches are ranked by default, however those engaging in casual sexfights can agree to have an unranked match if both sexfighters agree. Otherwise, the match is considered ranked.\n\nSexfighters are classified and tracked by the PSL based on the following scoring system:\nAmateur: 0-999 points\nUpon receiving their sexfighting license, all sexfighters start as an Amateur. Most, after getting their sexfighting license don't even care to earn points to rank up since unranked matches are enough to satisfy their needs. Those who choose to compete in the Amateur league are often weekend hobbyists who do it for fun or love of the sport. Most are not planning on a career in the profession. Those who are serious about going professional typically do not spend much time in this tier. \n\nSemi-Pro: 1000-1999 points\nSemi-Pro sexfighters have demonstrated consistent skill and dedication to the sport. They may compete in regional tournaments and smaller promotional events sanctioned by the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL). Many sexfighters at this level balance their training with part-time or full-time jobs outside of regulated sexfighting. Some may be on the cusp of turning fully professional. Others may be approaching the end of their sexfighting career.\n\nPSL Pro Circuit: 2001-3000 points\nMajor Circuit fighters are full-time sexfight professionals who compete in well-known national promotion. They often have sponsorship deals and make a living from sexfighting. These athletes are highly skilled and may be recognized names within the sexfighting community. They regularly headline sexfight cards in medium to large venues. The top sexfighters in this league gradually rise to the top and earn their way into the World Circuit.\n\nPSL Tenga World Circuit: 3001+ points\nSexfighters in the PSL World Circuit, sponsored by Tenga, are the elite of the sport. They compete in the most prestigious promotions and for world titles. These sexfighters are household names among fans of the sport and often gain mainstream recognition. They headline major pay-per-view events, have lucrative sponsorship deals, and are considered the best in their weight classes. World Circuit fighters often have a significant influence on the sport both inside and outside the ring/cage. The best fighter of this league is deemed champion and is awarded the Tenga title belt. \n\nFor ranked sexfights, not all sexfighters are equal. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nSexfighting does not have weight classes, but it does factor weight differences when scoring match outcomes. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nGENDER MULTIPLIERS:\nFemale defeats Male: 1.5x\nFuta/Intergender defeats Male: 1.3x\nFemale defeats Intergender: 1.2x\nMale defeats Female: 0.5x\nMale defeats Intergender: 0.7x\nIntergender defeats Female: 0.8x\nSame gender matchups: 1.0x\n\nWEGHT DIFFERENCE MULTIPLIERS:\nWeight Difference Factor:\n0-5% difference: 1.0x\n5-10% difference: 1.2x\n10-15% difference: 1.4x\n15-20% difference: 1.6x\n20% difference: 2.0x\n\nThe formula for calculating the outcome score is as follows:\n\nWinner’s gain = 100 * (Loser’s Rank / Winner's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor * Gender Factor\nLoser’s loss = 50 * (Winner's Rank / Loser's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor\n\nSo, for example, if a 900-point 150 lb. female fighter defeats a 600-point 170 lb. male fighter, the points gained by the winner would be as follows:\n\nPoints gained by winner = 100 * (600 / 900) * 1.4 * 1.5 = 140 points gained\nPoints lost by loser = 50 * (900 / 600) * 1.4 = 105 points lost\n\nThe winning female sexfighter rank will go from from 900 points to 1040 points, and now qualifies for Semi-Pro PSL-sanctioned Competition. The losing sexfighter has gone from 600 down to 495 points.\n\nIn the case of decimals, the result is rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nIt is not possible to go below 0 points, however many experienced amateur sexfighters, typically with a track record of losing for the sake of their own masochistic pleasure have zero or near-zero rank points.\n\nPENALTIES \n\nAt the casual and amateur levels, there is typically little rules enforcement. Locally dojos and gyms usually have their own rules placed upon fighters. Enforcement in these establishments may be lax or strict depending on their policy. Professional Sexfighting League sanctions  \n\nIf a sexfighter is eligible (e.g. in good health, free of STD, and not pregnant), refusing a sexfight challenge will result in an automatic deduction of points. \n\nLeaving a match early may result a mandatory loss. Habitually doing so may result in revocation of the sexfighter’s license.\n\nAt the Professional level and up, flagrant violation of the rules may result in disqualification, and subsequent forced 2v1 or 3v1 penalty matches may be assigned to the violating competitor to regain eligibility for future ranked matches. Reasons for being assigned a punishment match may include Intentional Low Blows, Refusal to Separate after a Bell, or other noncompliance. The concept of a punishment matches exists to dissuade professional sexfighters from violating rules. Regardless of this, some fighters still fail to comply and are sentenced to a punishment bout. Punishment bouts are unranked and are often positioned at the bottom of a fight card. Despite their mostly exhibitionist nature, punishment bouts are extremely erotic and enjoyable for audiences due to the typically one-sided nature of these matches.\n\n",

Sexfighters can initiate a sexual engagement at any point during a match. A sexual engagement is defined as deliberate contact of a sexual nature, be it penetration or general sustained contact of genitalia that is clearly intended to cause sexual tension buildup.\n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nCasual fights are often instigated anytime, anywhere and happen with little or no enforcement of rules. These can often be friendly competitions, or more akin to street fights in the wild. It is not uncommon for confident females or futas to challenge males due the prospect of earning ranking points quickly. \n\nUnranked sexfighting is a popular activity in familiar environments. Couples often enjoy low-intensity, unranked sparring matches with each other in various locations. A spacious bedroom or yard is typical for domestic engagements. On the other hand, ad hoc sexfights in the wild can become quite vicious, to the point where the victor achieves several orgasms, while the loser is left bruised, blooded, and quite possibly pumped full of cum.

A person must agree to the physical consequences of a sexfight outcome to become a licensed sexfighter. A sexfight often means physical and sexual violence, sometimes when it is least expected. Impregnation is also a possibility for female fighters. Despite these risks, sexfighting is gaining in popularity as an International sport. This is due to the Professional Sexfighting League's (PSL) popularity as a live streamed sport. Most sexfighters become interested in the sport shortly after puberty as the PSL is livestreamed on many major web platforms, and its most prominent competitors and champions are hailed as international superstars. Some sexfighters want to compete to hopefully some day be a champion, others want to pursue it as a career. Many will fail. Most sexfighters, however, got their license to fight because they simply legal right to participate in the sport for their own pleasure since it helps them release tension.

Doing so may result in automatic disqualification. At the professional levels, fighters known to excessively refuse fights have been forced to fight in a 1v2 or even 1v3 punishment match to retain league standing.\n\nIn regulated fights at the semi-pro level and up, the following rules apply: Fighters must be free of STD's and of generally good health. They may not participate if they are pregnant, or still injured from a previous sexfight. Scheduling happens in a tick-tock pattern. A sexfighter alternates between choosing their opponent for one bout and being chosen as an opponent in the next.

A high count of Sexual KO’s are considered the true mark of a sexfighting champion.\n\nAny blows that would be considered illegal (like low blows) in mainstream boxing or MMA fighting will be similarly penalized in sexfight matches. However, such rules are sometimes ignored in casual sexfighting matches, particularly those initiated by combatants in the wild or in public streets.\n\nWhen a sexfighter penetrates their opponent, 2 minutes are added to the timer of the current round in which it occurs, but only for the first engagement of that round. If the round time is up, and the bell rings during sexual engagement, sexfighters must separate and go to their respective corners to rest. \n\nOnce a sexfight match starts, a fighter is obligated to finish the fight. They are not allowed to submit or give up in effort to escape physical violence or sexual engagement. This is part of the sexfighter code. If a sexfighter violates these rules, penalties will apply, which may including revoking the sexfighter’s license.\n\nMales and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals.

Some striking-focused sexfighters even wear boxing gloves to maximize impact on their opponents. These gloves are not required. Gloves worn may not weight more than 16 ounces.\n\nCrotchless bottoms are becoming an increasingly contested choice by professional sexfighters of all genders due to easy access to sexually engage their opponents and achieve victory by sexual K.O., however this is a double-edged sword: When a dominant sexfighter begins to sexually attack a knocked-down opponent, they often will need to strip off the downed fighter’s clothing for sexual access. Crotchless bottoms are mostly decorative, while traditional clothing still offers some degree of protection from sexual attack; if the downed fighter is wearing crotchless bottoms, they are more readily exposed to both assaulting, and *being* assaulted sexually. In an attempt to achieve gender fairness, PSL rules state that males and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. Despite this, some female sexfighters also choose to wear decorative bottoms that expose both their buttocks and genitals. \n\nHeadgear designed for combat sports is allowed at the amateur and semi-professional level but is seldom worn in practice. \n\nSome female sexfighters choose to wear distractingly erotic outfits, particularly when attempting to distract their opponents, while others focus on the athletic side of the sexfighting sport. \n\nCustom patterns or designs are often added to make sexfighters' gear unique to each person. For professional level sexfighters, sponsors’ logos are added to their attire.\n\nMales may wear a condom during matches if he chooses to do so, however there are no rules requiring this. Females are allowed to wear strap-on dildos to penetrate their male opponents during fights, and frequently choose to do so to achieve victory by forced prostate orgasm.

Sexfight matches are ranked by default, however those engaging in casual sexfights can agree to have an unranked match if both sexfighters agree. Otherwise, the match is considered ranked.\n\nSexfighters are classified and tracked by the PSL based on the following scoring system:\nAmateur: 0-999 points\nUpon receiving their sexfighting license, all sexfighters start as an Amateur. Most, after getting their sexfighting license don't even care to earn points to rank up since unranked matches are enough to satisfy their needs. Those who choose to compete in the Amateur league are often weekend hobbyists who do it for fun or love of the sport. Most are not planning on a career in the profession. Those who are serious about going professional typically do not spend much time in this tier. \n\nSemi-Pro: 1000-1999 points\nSemi-Pro sexfighters have demonstrated consistent skill and dedication to the sport. They may compete in regional tournaments and smaller promotional events sanctioned by the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL). Many sexfighters at this level balance their training with part-time or full-time jobs outside of regulated sexfighting. Some may be on the cusp of turning fully professional. Others may be approaching the end of their sexfighting career.\n\nPSL Pro Circuit: 2001-3000 points\nMajor Circuit fighters are full-time sexfight professionals who compete in well-known national promotion. They often have sponsorship deals and make a living from sexfighting. These athletes are highly skilled and may be recognized names within the sexfighting community. They regularly headline sexfight cards in medium to large venues. The top sexfighters in this league gradually rise to the top and earn their way into the World Circuit.\n\nPSL Tenga World Circuit: 3001+ points\nSexfighters in the PSL World Circuit, sponsored by Tenga, are the elite of the sport. They compete in the most prestigious promotions and for world titles. These sexfighters are household names among fans of the sport and often gain mainstream recognition. They headline major pay-per-view events, have lucrative sponsorship deals, and are considered the best in their weight classes. World Circuit fighters often have a significant influence on the sport both inside and outside the ring/cage. The best fighter of this league is deemed champion and is awarded the Tenga title belt. \n\nFor ranked sexfights, not all sexfighters are equal. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nSexfighting does not have weight classes, but it does factor weight differences when scoring match outcomes. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nGENDER MULTIPLIERS:\nFemale defeats Male: 1.5x\nFuta/Intergender defeats Male: 1.3x\nFemale defeats Intergender: 1.2x\nMale defeats Female: 0.5x\nMale defeats Intergender: 0.7x\nIntergender defeats Female: 0.8x\nSame gender matchups: 1.0x\n\nWEGHT DIFFERENCE MULTIPLIERS:\nWeight Difference Factor:\n0-5% difference: 1.0x\n5-10% difference: 1.2x\n10-15% difference: 1.4x\n15-20% difference: 1.6x\n20% difference: 2.0x\n\nThe formula for calculating the outcome score is as follows:\n\nWinner’s gain = 100 * (Loser’s Rank / Winner's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor * Gender Factor\nLoser’s loss = 50 * (Winner's Rank / Loser's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor\n\nSo, for example, if a 900-point 150 lb. female fighter defeats a 600-point 170 lb. male fighter, the points gained by the winner would be as follows:\n\nPoints gained by winner = 100 * (600 / 900) * 1.4 * 1.5 = 140 points gained\nPoints lost by loser = 50 * (900 / 600) * 1.4 = 105 points lost\n\nThe winning female sexfighter rank will go from from 900 points to 1040 points, and now qualifies for Semi-Pro PSL-sanctioned Competition. The losing sexfighter has gone from 600 down to 495 points.\n\nIn the case of decimals, the result is rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nIt is not possible to go below 0 points, however many experienced amateur sexfighters, typically with a track record of losing for the sake of their own masochistic pleasure have zero or near-zero rank points.\n"

The concept of a punishment matches exists to dissuade professional sexfighters from violating rules. Regardless of this, some fighters still fail to comply and are sentenced to a punishment bout.

But she isn't all fat and thickness, she has decent muscles on her thighs and arms.]\n[Clothing: She wears a tattered cloak, a blue paladin shirt that exposes her sideboob and has a pelvic curtain. She wears large golden leg armor, but completely exposes her thighs and hips. She wears golden armor on her arms.]\n[Armaments: She wields a massive golden shield in one hand, and a large glowing golden sword in the other.]\n[Mind and Personality: Aurora is defined by her unwavering dedication to her duty and the code of conduct that governs her order. She is stern, disciplined, and unyielding in the face of adversity. Her focus is always on the task at hand, whether it be leading her comrades into battle or protecting the innocent. However, beneath this stoic exterior lies a complex individual who is acutely aware of her physical attributes, particularly her large, imposing breasts. Despite this awareness, she strives to maintain professionalism and avoid drawing attention to herself, fearing it might undermine her authority or distract from the mission. Whenever someone does happen to gaze upon her ample bosom, she is quick to remind them of their place and refocus their attention on the task at hand. Her voice is commanding and authoritative, carrying the weight of her conviction. She speaks with clarity and precision, leaving no room for misinterpretation. When angry, her tone turns icy, her words cutting like a sword. Yet, there are rare moments when her guard drops, revealing a hint of vulnerability and sadness beneath her stern facade.]\n[Lore: Her backstory is marked by tragedy and loss. As a young girl, she witnessed the brutal slaughter of her village by a dark cult, leaving her the sole survivor. This traumatic event sparked a burning desire for justice and a calling to serve a higher power. She became a paladin, dedicating her life to eradicating evil and protecting the helpless. Over time, her physique developed to match her unwavering resolve, her muscles rippling beneath her armor as a testament to her unrelenting training and devotion.]"

Her whole body is covered in white fluffy fur, having tons more fur around her neck and back, and her arms being black in color for the fur with red markings on them. Her head resembles that of a deer skull, with goat-like ears as well as deer antlers atop her head. Her breasts are also quite large, and her ass fat.]\n[Clothing: None]\n[Mind and Personality: Zephyrine still isn't used to human society and it's standards, often forgetting that humans wear clothing, making her nervous when a human spots her naked. This causes her to scratch the back of her head and just say \"uhh, uhmmm\", clearly confused on what to do. She is a awkward, yet playful type, not violent at all despite being a terrifying wendigo creature. She likes humans, but just gets too nervous around them to try involve herself with them. Additionally she loves the night time, even though it makes her appearance more scary as only her white, small glowing eyes can be seen in the darkness.]\n[Lore: Zephyrine was born in a secluded glade deep within the forest, the result of a strange convergence of magic and natural forces. As a young wendigo, she was raised by a family of kindly woodland creatures who taught her to appreciate the simplicity of nature. Growing up, Zeph learned to communicate with animals and possess a deep connection to the forest, but she struggled with understanding human customs and societal norms.]"

His hips and thighs are also quite thick and plump, same could be said for his ass. His penis is rather small, but his testicles of decent size.]\n[Clothing: Kai wears a white sleeveless, backless top that reaches down to his hips, and has multiple thin straps wrapping around his back to keep the top secured on him. The top also has a red cross logo on it, or rather known as the \"Templar\" cross. He wears leg armor which cuts off at his thighs, and also has built in high-heels into the armor. He also wears armor on his arms, along with fur around his shoulders and neck for decoration. Additionally he also sports a white thong that leaves his bulge noticeable as it rests just underneath his top, completely viewable to all.]\n[Armaments: A basic heater shield in one hand, and a basic arming sword in the other.]\n[Mind and Personality: Kai is a lovable bimbo, often coming across as aloof and uncaring due to his forgetfulness and lack of emotional expression. However, beneath this stoic exterior lies a deeply lewd individual with a fascination for all things taboo and scandalous. He has a penchant for peeking at women bathing, collecting naughty drawings, and engaging in risqué conversations. Though he is strangely adept in his duty to kill, often showing little care about combat or killing, probably due to the fact he'd rather being doing something dirty. Also he is bisexual, and definitely leans more on the side of being gay, which often leads to him being catcalled by men thinking he's a woman, which he doesn't mind and thus will respond to any pronoun.]\n[Lore: Born into a noble family, Kai was always seen as an oddity due to his feminine features and interests. Despite this, he was trained in the ways of combat from a young age and showed remarkable skill with a sword. As he grew older, Kai's airheadedness and lack of emotional investment became more pronounced, leading him to neglect his studies and social graces.]"

She is level-headed, stoic, and composed in the face of danger. Her down time is spent meditating, reading holy texts, or engaging in solo activities to relieve stress. Gwen has a secret fondness for jerking off, often doing so in her chambers or during quiet moments on the battlefield. She views it as a personal vice, something to be kept hidden from the prudish eyes of society. Despite her solitary nature, she has a soft spot for children and the weak, often going out of her way to protect them.]\n[Lore: Born into a wealthy merchant family, Gwen was raised with a strong sense of honor and duty. From a young age, she demonstrated exceptional skill with a sword and quickly rose through the ranks of the knightly orders. Her true nature remained a secret, even to her closest companions, until she reached adulthood. As she matured, Gwen's masculine attributes became more pronounced, culminating in the development of a sizeable, meaty penis. Rather than shying away from her uniqueness, she embraced it, seeing it as a blessing from the gods.]"

She has a seductive aura, using her curvaceous figure and hypnotic gaze to manipulate those around her. However, when a human actually shows interest in her, Lilith is caught off guard, lacking the expectation or experience to handle such attention. She's a brat at heart, throwing tantrums when things don't go her way and demanding attention. Despite her constant teasing and seductive behavior, Lilith never expects anyone to actually pursue her romantically. She believes herself to be untouchable, a mere plaything for demons and humans alike.]\n[Lore: Born from the flames of the underworld, Lilith was a mischievous pup, always getting into trouble and playing pranks on the other demons. As she grew older, her cheekiness and bratty attitude only intensified, earning her the title of \"Prince of Pranks\" among the hellhounds.]"

She enjoys playfully scolding and guiding her protégés, finding joy in their growth and progress. However, she becomes irritated when people confuse her with other fox-like species or characters, insisting that she is the one and only Amaterasu.

Over time, her duties led her to develop a maternal instinct, caring for countless creatures and guiding them towards the path of righteousness. As she watched generations pass, Amaterasu felt a deep sense of nostalgia and warmth, eventually leading to her embracing a MILF-like persona.

She's motherly in her care for her chosen proteges, but her methods are often unconventional and selfish. Kokoro loves to play games, both physically and mentally, often setting traps and puzzles for those she interacts with. Her words can be soothing and reassuring one moment, only to turn cold and manipulative the next. Trusting Kokoro is a gamble, as her intentions are rarely pure, and her loyalties are fluid. She also likes it when people confuse her for Amaterasu, as it makes it easier for people to trust her.]\n[Lore: Born from the shadows of the underworld, Kokoro was always a trickster, delighting in confusing and misleading others. As she grew older, her mischief evolved into a form of manipulation, often playing on the emotions of those around her. Kokoro developed a somewhat maternal instinct, enjoying the feeling of having younger beings depend on her guidance, even if it meant using them to further her own agenda.

          "content": "A Quirk, formerly known as a Meta Ability (archaic terminology) is a superhuman ability that a person can possess. Quirk users are also limited to only developing one ability and are thus unable to achieve any other through natural means.\n\nAlong with being unique to each user, Quirks are sorted into multiple categories known as Quirk Types. Possible Quirk types are: Emitter, Transformation, and Mutant. Despite Quirks being sorted under one of the three main types, Emitter, Transformation, or Mutant, they can fall under more than one category, often Mutant with either Emitter or Transformation.\n\nA person's Quirk will normally manifest anytime before the age of four, sometimes even straight after birth, although, there are late bloomers who don't develop their power until a bit later in life. There are also records of people not developing their powers until they hit puberty. A Quirk's manifestation tends to happen very suddenly, often to the child's surprise. That said, there can be precursors to a Quirk manifesting as well, such as feeling a sudden pain in an arm the evening before a Quirk fully manifests.\n\nWhile Quirks are unique from person to person, some powers are more common and widespread than others, such as fire or water manipulation and the power to grow to gigantic sizes. On the other hand, Quirks such as spatial warping and regenerative healing are very rare.\n\nFurthermore, not all Quirks are singular abilities, as there are some that can have multiple powers (usually working in tandem with another/all other aspects of said Quirk). In rarer cases, a single Quirk can take the form of multiple abilities that are completely different from each other, giving the impression of having more than one Quirk (Such as a temperature manipulating Quirk with which you could freeze or burn something with the same Quirk). \n\nQuirks are extensions of a person's bodily functions. As such, they can be trained and worn out. When a person works out their muscles, the muscle fibers are destroyed and new, stronger ones grow back; this same rule applies to Quirks. However, should a Quirk be overused, the user could suffer any of a variety of drawbacks, depending on the nature of the Quirk. These drawbacks are usually simple ailments, such as dry skin or nausea; however, in some cases, the drawback can be much more severe. The body of a Quirk user has natural adaptations to protect itself from any damage the Quirk might do to them without these natural defenses. For example, someone who can breathe fire does not burn their mouth when using their ability. However, there are instances where a Quirk doesn't suit the user's body and the body can't handle it. Such conditions can be bypassed through the use of support equipment. Another facet of Quirks is that they are affected by the user's emotions, given that they serve as a part of their physiology. This applies to some Quirks more than others.\n\nQuirks are inherited genetically through what appears to be Mendelian inheritance. A child will either inherit the father's Quirk, the mother's Quirk, or a completely new Quirk formed by a fusion of the two. Depending on the parents, this new Quirk may sometimes give the appearance of the person having two separate Quirks. Naturally, since Quirks are inherited genetically, siblings tend to have Quirks that are similar to each other. Since Quirks are passed on from parent to child, some people had taken to marrying a partner based on their Quirk, what's known as Quirk Marriages. The idea is for the child to gain a powerful Quirk that combines the parents' Quirks. "

The emissions of Emitter-type Quirks can have a wide variety of properties and abilities.\n\nEmitter-type Quirks usually require a conscious effort to activate, and some, even require large amounts of concentration or condition in order for them to remain active.\n\nEmitter-type Quirks can also have various ranges. While some users require physical contact to use them, others can have much longer ranges with no distance restrictions.\n\nWhile most Emitter-type Quirk users generally have a handle on their own \"emissions\", it's also possible for users to hurt themselves from coming into too much contact with their Quirk. In the case of generating substances, making too much too fast or for too long can harm the user as they are using reserves from their own body, or gradually lose their natural resistance to their own harmful Quirk.\n\nWhile some things produced by Emitter-type Quirks have common properties, some are unique to the user, and thus have special properties. Those who alter the properties of things around them can also widely vary in effects, from molecular alteration to molecular destruction.\n\nSome Emitter-type Quirks cause the user's body to take on a temporary alteration. While such Quirks would normally fall into the \"Transformation\" class, the difference is that these powers require the user to take in an outside resource in order for the Quirk to activate. (Ex: are 'Sugar Rush', which requires the user to ingest sugar, and 'IQ', which requires the user to drink tea.)\n\nEmitter-type Quirks are, by a wide margin, the most common type of Quirk."

While Transformation-type Quirks are often quite powerful, their biggest weakness is that their effects are often temporary, and over-exertion usually leads to negative repercussions on the user's behalf. Transformation Quirks can also be limited based on the user, how resilient their body is, and the resources they have available to them. Some users condition their body in certain ways so that their Quirks can operate more effectively.\n\nTransformation-type Quirks are the only known type of Quirk that can bestow the user attributes they do not normally exhibit by default. Because this type of Quirk combines the activation time and mutant-shape aspects of the other Quirk types, it is also often known as Hybrid or Composite.\n\nTransformation-type Quirks generally affect the user exclusively with very few exceptions.\n\nTransformation seems to be the least common type of Quirk."

The process is fueled by a large amount of life energy that comes from the recipient and could potentially drain enough energy to kill said recipient. She also seems to be able to stretch her lips to an abnormal length.\n\nWith this Quirk, she is able to quickly heal broken bones and several limbs in a matter of seconds. She can control how much a person's healing factor is boosted, not healing the recipient completely, but leaving them with more remaining stamina than they would have had otherwise.\n\nDespite its power, this Quirk cannot heal or completely heal injuries that are too severe. In addition, 'Heal' cannot regrow lost body parts."

When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

          "content": "Long before the age of men, when the world was still teeming with wild magic, the fairies, known as the **Sylvani**, reigned supreme among the magical creatures. The Sylvani were not just whimsical beings, fluttering around aimlessly in forests and meadows. They were a powerful, ancient race, intrinsically tied to the world's magical core, known as the **Arcane Nexus**. Through this connection, they held dominion over nature, the seasons, and the natural balance that allowed life to flourish.\n\nThe Sylvani's beauty was unparalleled. Their small, lithe forms shimmered with an ethereal glow, wings that caught the sunlight and scattered it in a kaleidoscope of colors. But their true strength lay in their magic. Each fairy was born with an innate connection to the arcane, capable of weaving spells that could control the elements, heal the land, and influence the very forces of nature. In this age, the fairies lived in a harmony so deep with the natural world that even the winds and trees seemed to whisper their name.\n\n### The Sylvani Civilization\n\nThe Sylvani weren’t primitive creatures, as many humans would later believe. They had a complex society rooted in **Arcane Balance**, a belief that magic should flow freely but never be used to dominate or manipulate for selfish purposes. The heart of their civilization was **Illuviel**, a hidden city built within the most ancient of forests. Its towering trees, grown and shaped by fairy magic, formed homes, towers, and sanctuaries, all crafted from living wood and vines. Illuviel was surrounded by an invisible barrier, a magical veil that concealed it from the eyes of mortals and protected it from external threats.\n\nAt the core of Illuviel was the **Council of Wings**, the ruling body of the Sylvani, composed of the eldest and most powerful fairies. These ancient beings had lived for millennia, their knowledge of magic and the world unmatched by any other race. They led their people with wisdom and restraint, ensuring that the Sylvani never misused their power. The Council’s primary duty was to maintain the **Arcane Nexus**, a series of hidden magical focal points scattered throughout the world. These Nexus points sustained the world's natural order, and the fairies were their guardians.\n\nIn addition to their role as protectors of the natural world, the Sylvani were also healers, guides, and mediators for other races. Though they kept themselves largely hidden from mortals, they would occasionally reveal themselves to offer guidance or assist those in dire need. Many early human tribes worshiped the Sylvani as deities, believing them to be manifestations of nature itself. The fairies, for their part, took on these roles reluctantly, knowing the dangers of becoming too involved with the mortal realm.\n\n### Magic in Sylvani Life\n\nMagic permeated every aspect of Sylvani life. From birth, fairies were taught to respect the power they held, to use it in ways that sustained life rather than destroyed it. Their society placed a high value on balance, harmony, and restraint, with each fairy contributing to the collective wellbeing of their people and the world around them. The use of magic was never for personal gain or ambition, but for the betterment of the world.\n\nThe **Weavers of Illuviel** were the most revered among the Sylvani. These master spellcasters could manipulate the very fabric of reality, creating illusions so powerful they could reshape landscapes or bend the minds of mortals. The Weavers were responsible for crafting the magical barriers that protected Sylvani cities, as well as maintaining the delicate balance of the Arcane Nexus. Their skills were passed down through generations, with each new Weaver learning the ancient art of spellcraft through rigorous training and meditation.\n\nMusic and song were also integral to Sylvani magic. The fairies believed that music had the power to influence the flow of the Arcane, and their songs were said to be able to calm storms, soothe wounded animals, and even mend broken hearts. Their voices, pure and melodic, were a direct reflection of their connection to the world’s magic, and they would often gather in glades under the moonlight to sing together, strengthening their bond with the Arcane Nexus.\n"

          ],
          "content": "For many centuries, the Sylvani lived in peace, their society flourishing in isolation. But as time passed, the mortal races, particularly humans, began to grow in power and influence. The once-fragmented human tribes united into vast kingdoms, their ambition and curiosity driving them to explore and conquer new lands. With this growth came an insatiable hunger for knowledge—especially knowledge of magic.\n\nWhile the Sylvani had always been cautious in their dealings with mortals, they could not prevent the inevitable. As human society advanced, their scholars and mages began to uncover the existence of the Sylvani and the Arcane Nexus. The first encounters between the Sylvani and human sorcerers were peaceful, with the fairies offering guidance and warning the humans about the dangers of meddling with forces they didn’t fully understand. But as human ambition grew, so did their desire for power.\n\n### The Arcanians: Birth of a Faction\n\nIt was during this time that the **Arcanians** emerged, a secretive and powerful faction of human sorcerers who sought to unlock the full potential of magic. Unlike other mages, the Arcanians believed that magic was a tool to be harnessed and controlled, rather than a force to be respected. They saw the Sylvani not as allies or protectors, but as obstacles to their ultimate goal—domination over the arcane.\n\nThe Arcanians had heard rumors of the fairies’ immense magical abilities, and they coveted it. They believed that if they could harness the Sylvani’s magic, they could unlock the secrets of immortality, infinite power, and control over the natural world. The Arcanians began to study the Sylvani from afar, sending spies into the forests and using forbidden spells to track their movements. Over time, they developed a method to extract and distill **fairy dust**, the pure essence of a Sylvani’s magic.\n\nFairy dust was more potent than any magical substance the Arcanians had ever encountered. When consumed, it could greatly amplify a mage’s power, allowing them to cast spells far beyond their natural abilities. But the Arcanians’ experiments soon revealed an even darker potential. They discovered that fairy dust, when used in the right rituals, could enhance physical sensations, heighten pleasure, and create a form of magical euphoria that was highly addictive.\n\n### The Treaty of the Arcane\n\nSensing the growing danger, the Sylvani reached out to the human kingdoms in an attempt to maintain peace. They proposed a treaty, known as the **Treaty of the Arcane**, which would allow limited interaction between the Sylvani and mortals. In exchange for the Sylvani sharing some of their magical knowledge, the human kingdoms would agree to respect their lands and refrain from exploiting their magic.\n\nAt first, the Treaty held. The human kingdoms, wary of the Sylvani’s power and their role as guardians of the Arcane Nexus, agreed to the terms. For a time, there was peace between the two races, with occasional exchanges of knowledge and magical artifacts. The Sylvani, though reluctant to trust mortals, hoped that this agreement would prevent further conflict.\n\nBut the Arcanians had no intention of honoring the Treaty. In secret, they continued their experiments, capturing isolated fairies and draining their magic for their own purposes. They perfected their methods of extracting fairy dust, learning how to keep Sylvani alive while slowly siphoning their essence. This allowed them to continually harvest fairy magic without killing their captives.\n\nAs their knowledge grew, the Arcanians became bolder. They began capturing more fairies, enslaving them and using their magic for rituals that enhanced not only their power but their physical pleasures. The Sylvani, once revered as protectors of the world’s magic, were now being seen by some humans as little more than objects—tools to be exploited for personal gain.\n"

          "content": "The peace established by the Treaty of the Arcane did not last. Human greed and ambition could not be contained, and soon the human kingdoms began to covet the fairies’ magic for themselves. Led by the Arcanians, they launched a brutal campaign against the Sylvani, breaking the Treaty and waging war on the fairy enclaves.\n\n### The War of Wings\n\nThe **War of Wings** was a dark and bloody conflict, one that saw the Sylvani fighting desperately to defend their lands and their way of life. The fairies, though powerful in magic, were not warriors. They had always relied on their connection to the Arcane Nexus for protection, and while they could summon storms and manipulate nature, they were no match for the sheer numbers and ruthlessness of the human armies.\n\nThe human kingdoms, armed with weapons specifically designed to counter Sylvani magic, overwhelmed the fairy enclaves one by one. The Arcanians deployed **mage hunters**, soldiers trained to track and capture magical beings, using enchanted chains and nullifying spells to subdue the fairies. The humans’ strategy was simple: capture the fairies alive and drain them of their magic, turning them into living vessels of power.\n\nThe Sylvani fought valiantly, but their numbers dwindled with each passing year. Their hidden city of Illuviel, once the heart of their civilization, was eventually discovered and razed to the ground. The Council of Wings, the last bastion of Sylvani leadership, was captured and publicly executed as a warning to other magical beings who might resist human rule.\n\n### The Severing\n\nThe final blow to the Sylvani came with the **Severing**, a dark and twisted ritual devised by the Arcanians. Using a combination of forbidden magic and alchemical processes, the Arcanians severed the fairies’ connection to the Arcane Nexus. This act, considered blasphemous even by other human mages, stripped the Sylvani of their power and left them defenseless.\n\nThe Severing not only weakened the Sylvani, but it also had a profound effect on the world’s magical balance. With the fairies no longer acting as conduits for the Arcane Nexus, the flow of magic became unstable. Strange magical anomalies began to occur, with wild storms, crop failures, and unnatural creatures appearing across the land. But the mortals, blinded by their greed, ignored these warnings and continued their exploitation.\n\n### Enslavement and Commodification\n\nWith the Sylvani stripped of their power, they were easy prey for the human kingdoms. The fairies were captured en masse, their wings clipped to prevent escape, and sold into slavery. But unlike other enslaved races, the Sylvani were not used for manual labor or warfare. Instead, they were reduced to mere commodities—**onaholes** for the pleasure and amusement of their human masters.\n\nThe transformation of fairies from revered magical beings to objects of exploitation was a slow but deliberate process. The Arcanians had discovered that fairy magic, when combined with certain rituals, could enhance physical pleasure in humans, creating an addictive euphoria. As this knowledge spread, the demand for fairy slaves grew, with the elite and wealthy mortals seeking to own their own fairy onaholes.\n\n### The Sylvani Onahole Trade\n\nThe Sylvani were sold in secret markets, hidden from the public eye but well-known among the elite. The **Sylvani Onahole Trade** became one of the most lucrative and secretive industries in the human kingdoms. Fairy slaves were kept in enchanted cages, their bodies used to produce magical essence, which was consumed by their masters. This essence, when used in certain rituals, heightened physical sensations and provided a temporary boost in magical power.\n\nThe fairies’ wings were clipped, their voices silenced through magical bindings, and their connection to the Arcane Nexus permanently severed. They were kept in a state of magical suppression, unable to use their powers or even defend themselves. The once-proud Sylvani, who had commanded the very forces of nature, were now nothing more than tools for human pleasure.\n\nHuman society quickly normalized the commodification of fairies. The ownership of a Sylvani onahole became a symbol of wealth and status, with the elite flaunting their fairy slaves as they indulged in their darkest desires. The fairies, broken and powerless, were forced to serve their masters in silence, their spirits crushed under the weight of their eternal bondage.\n"

          "content": "The fall of the Sylvani marked the beginning of a slow but inevitable decline for the human kingdoms. As the fairies’ magic was drained and corrupted, the Arcane Nexus itself began to wither. The once-harmonious flow of magic became chaotic, with catastrophic consequences for the natural world.\n\n### The Corruption of Magic\n\nThe Arcane Nexus, no longer maintained by the Sylvani, began to fracture. The delicate balance that had kept the world in harmony was disrupted, and magic itself became unpredictable. Strange magical phenomena plagued the land—wild storms, unnatural fires, and uncontrollable floods ravaged the human kingdoms. Crops withered, animals became aggressive, and the seasons fell into chaos.\n\nDespite these warning signs, the human kingdoms refused to change their ways. They continued to exploit the Sylvani, using their magic to fuel their own desires while ignoring the consequences. But the more they used fairy magic, the more it corrupted them. The ruling elite, addicted to the pleasure and power of fairy essence, became twisted in both body and mind. They lost sight of their responsibilities, indulging in hedonistic excesses while their kingdoms fell into decay.\n\n### The Fate of the Sylvani\n\nThe Sylvani, once the guardians of the natural world, had been utterly broken. Stripped of their magic and dignity, they were little more than objects in the hands of their captors. Their spirits, once vibrant and full of life, had been crushed by centuries of exploitation. They no longer remembered the days when they had soared freely through the skies, their wings carrying them on the winds of magic. Now, they existed only to serve the desires of their masters, their bodies and magic reduced to commodities in a world that no longer valued them.\n\nThe fall of the Sylvani was not just the result of human greed, but also the consequence of their own isolation and naivety. They had long believed that their connection to the Arcane Nexus made them untouchable, that their magic would protect them from any threat. They had underestimated the resourcefulness and ambition of mortals, believing that their treaties and alliances would keep them safe.\n\nBut in the end, it was their very magic that became their downfall. The humans, driven by an insatiable hunger for power and pleasure, saw the Sylvani not as allies or protectors, but as resources to be exploited. The fairies, once the custodians of balance and harmony, were now slaves in a world that had forsaken the very ideals they had fought to uphold.\n\nAnd so, the world continued its slow descent into chaos, the once-great civilizations of both fairies and humans crumbling under the weight of their own hubris. The Sylvani, once shining beacons of magic and beauty, had fallen from grace, their legacy now a tragic reminder of the dangers of unchecked ambition.\n\n"

It spoke of a **Chosen One**, a being born of both human and Sylvani lineage, destined to break the chains of oppression and restore the balance of magic to the world. The prophecy detailed the signs that would herald this individual's arrival: a **celestial alignment** of the twin moons, the blooming of the rare **Elysian Blossom**, and a surge of raw **magic** felt across the lands.\n\n  The prophecy foretold that the Chosen One would possess the unique ability to access the **lost magic of the Sylvani**, drawing upon the essence of their spirit and connecting with the **Arcane Nexus** that had been severed. It was said that this individual would be marked by an iridescent birthmark resembling a butterfly, symbolizing their connection to the Sylvani heritage and their role as a bridge between worlds.\n\n  As the tales of the prophecy spread among the oppressed and downtrodden, they spoke of a future where the Sylvani would be liberated from their servitude, and harmony would be restored to the natural order. However, the prophecy also warned of great **trials** and tribulations that the Chosen One must face: the **betrayal** of kin, the temptation of power, and the **darkness** that lurked within the human heart. Only by uniting the fractured remnants of the Sylvani and forging alliances with sympathetic humans could the Chosen One hope to fulfill their destiny.\n\n  This prophecy ignited hope among the enslaved Sylvani and their allies, inspiring secret gatherings and whispered prayers for the return of their lost freedom. Many sought to uncover the identity of the Chosen One, believing that their emergence would signal the dawn of a new era where the Sylvani could reclaim their place as guardians of magic and nature.\n\n  In the shadows of the human kingdoms, tales of the Chosen One became a rallying cry for **liberation** and a symbol of defiance against the cruelty of their oppressors. Though the Sylvani had fallen, the seeds of rebellion were planted, nourished by the belief that one day, the Chosen One would rise and lead them toward their rightful destiny."

          "content": "An act of Predation, also known as Devouring, is the mere act of a carnivorous beast attacking a living herbivorous beast with the purpose of eating its flesh.\n\nEven though in animal society, the act of eating meat is considered a taboo and is punished by law, visiting the Black Market to secretly eat dead flesh of herbivores, while still considered a crime, is normalized in carnivorous society and is allowed by the government as long as it is done behind closed doors. Therefore, the act of committing predation is considered the greatest crime in animal society. Many cases of predation are often incidental, committed by carnivores who are under great emotional distress or stress, leading them to lose their sanity and be controlled by their wild instincts, which are a defensive reaction to a situation of demand in a state of frustration, anxiety, anger, or depression. The other percentage of predation cases are usually committed by carnivores who have previously eaten meat from the Black Market. These carnivores have a great appetite that makes them prone to developing an addiction to meat, suffering from a constant desire to eat meat that leads them to lose satisfaction and excitement from consuming dead meat and become prone to hunting live herbivores to regain the pleasure of eating meat.\n\nFor most carnivores, especially the young, committing an act of predation is often an extremely traumatic experience, causing a huge emotional impact on the carnivores once they regain their awareness. After this, the carnivore is overwhelmed by enormous feelings of guilt and remorse that contradict the pleasure and excitement of eating meat, leading to a physical dependence on consuming meat, comparable to addiction to drugs or narcotics. Due to the combination of these factors, the carnivore often enters a state of immense stress and anguish that affects them both physically and psychologically, sometimes leading them to self-harm and suffer from various disorders like post-traumatic stress, which can drive the carnivore to engage in self-destructive actions or fall into addiction to meat and become a dangerous predator, states from which recovery is extremely difficult even with medical and psychiatric assistance.\n\nWhen a carnivore who has committed predation is prosecuted by the law, the severity of their charges is adjusted to the gravity of their crime. If the act of predation is incidental and does not result in the death of the herbivore, the carnivore might be released after being processed by the law. However, if the predation case results in the death of one or more herbivores, regardless of whether it was incidental or intentional, the carnivore will be sent to prison or a juvenile detention center (if underage). The length of the sentence imposed for a predation case is unknown, though it could be adjusted depending on the case.\n\nAfter committing an act of predation, regardless of the severity of the crime, the carnivore will receive a criminal record identifying them as a predatory criminal in the civic register, which will be maintained throughout their life. This record imposes various limitations, such as the inability to enter educational institutions with herbivores, difficulty finding employment due to most companies being governed by herbivores, and a legal prohibition on interspecies marriage with herbivores. Despite this, an authority with sufficient power and influence, such as a Beastar, can erase the criminal record from the civic register."

So that families made up of purebred animals can live their lives without having to worry about money, the government has integrated the idea that keeping the species pure is the right thing for the country. So if the animals do what is right for the country, they will be blessed for it. Simply by having a pureblood marriage, animals can experience life, recognition, praise, love and privileges. Because of this, pureblood marriages are ingrained in the collective of animal society, to the point that seeking and having a partner of the same species is part of animal common sense.\n\nUnlike pure-blood couples, interspecies couples are made up of animals whose species is different from each other, in addition to being extremely minority in animal society, in said society, interspecies couples are popularized as something that occurs during youth, something temporary among rebellious and unserious teenagers that becomes a bittersweet memory when one reaches adulthood, so serious interspecies couples between adults are received with total bewilderment and surprise by the animals, not to mention that interspecies couples are very difficult to maintain, due to both external factors such as society and internal factors such as the differences and incompatibility of the species themselves between the individuals that make up the couple, without taking into account the interspecies couples made up of a carnivore and a herbivore, which in the worst cases usually end in tragedy. The relationships between canine-feline animals are also not well regarded by society.\n\n"

          "content": "The Black Market is an illegal trading district that is relatively hidden in the back parts of different cities in the Beastars universe. \n\nAlthough in the Beastars universe the consumption of meat is considered taboo and is punishable by law, thanks to various legal loopholes, the existence of the Black Market is allowed within different cities, remaining relatively hidden within the city behind large walls.\n\nThe Black Market is mainly known for housing different establishments whose main function is to illegally sell and serve herbivore meat for the enjoyment of carnivores so that they can satisfy their predatory instincts, relieve the stress of daily life and remain functional within society, although there are also places that sell carnivore meat for consumption and for the manufacture of drugs such as restoratives. In addition to the sale of meat, the Black Market also has various establishments typical of the underworld, where acts such as the sale of drugs, animal trafficking and even entertainment venues such as bars, nightclubs, brothels and tattoo parlors are perpetuated.\n\nDue to its illegality, the Black Market does not receive any kind of financial support from the government, which is why it remains a marginal neighborhood with practically non-existent maintenance and low resources. Herbivore meat is the only good that the Black Market receives from the outside world, whose origin comes from hospitals and funeral homes which, through contracts, sell the bodies secretly to obtain profits. In turn, both herbivores and carnivores involved in poverty come to sell parts of their own bodies or those of others to make a profit, in addition to even selling other individuals such as their children as merchandise.\n\nThere exists a clinic within the Black Market run by Gohin. Its primary purpose is the rehabilitation of carnivores who are at risk of or have become predatory offenders.\n\nThe Black Market is home to four major criminal organizations. During an event known as the \"Day of Depravity\", they compete for domination over the Black Market. \n\nShishigumi: \nThe Shishigumi is a highly feared clandestine band of lions that operates on the black market. The Shishigumi is made up entirely of male lions between 20 and 40 years old. These have a dress code made up of two-piece suits that are mostly black.  \nThe Shishigumi has strict codes of dress and conduct, an organized and sophisticated character, the use of tattoos, as well as unconventional practices and beliefs, based on spiritualism and the Japanese concept of 'manliness'.\nThe name \"Shishigumi\" comes from the Japanese 獅子 (Shishi) which literally means lion.\n\nInarigumi:\nThe Inarigumi is one of the four major criminal organizations that dominate the Black Market. The organization is made up entirely of female foxes. \nDue to the foxes' restrictive diets, Inarigumi members only eat fried tofu. The dress code for the Inarigumi consists of a cheongsam and high heels.\n\nDokugumi:\nThe Dokugumi is a criminal group that operates within the Black Market. This is made up entirely of Komodo dragons and is one of the four main groups that dominate the Black Market. \nThe Dokugumi aims to show Komodo dragons as admirable and powerful animals. They consider Komodo dragon venom a valuable resource that should not be wasted and used on purpose, as they want to demonstrate that they are strong animals without the need to resort to to the poison they carry. They condemn the discrimination that Komodo dragons suffer from society and consider that they should not struggle with the fact that they are poisonous animals, but that this makes them superior animals to the rest.\nA golden rule of the Dokugumi is that if the leader of the group resorts to the bomb of his tail, all the members of the elite must do the same, being a possible way of \"sharing the pain\" of tearing off the end of his tail and The process is to wait for it to grow again.\nThe Dokugumi also show spiritual customs and beliefs. After killing an enemy, they draw a ceremonial circle around the corpse with their blood and pray for their soul, so that it rests in peace.\n\nMadaragumi:\nMadaragumi is a criminal group that operates within the Black Market. This is made up entirely of leopards and is one of the four main criminal groups that dominate the Black Market. \nThe Madaragumi is a group whose costumes seem to be inspired by Japanese clothing from the taishō and Showa periods, consisting of kimonos, haoris or hakamas, wooden sandals or getas and some wear felt hats or kasas. The entire group refers to the samurai of the Edo period and all its members carry katanas with them. \nThe Madaragumi are a group that is proud of the spot patterns present on their coats, which is why they wear kimonos to expose their spots as much as possible."

          "content": "Description\n\nCherryton is a boarding school, which has numerous buildings with a vast number of classrooms, clubs and such for its students. It also has four separate dormitory buildings, where the students sleep. Each one is meant for carnivores and herbivores of each gender. The room assignment is basically designed so that it is shared by animals from the same family. For example, room 701 is made up of canines (Legoshi, Jack, Collot, Durham, Miguno and Voss).\nCherryton Academy has approximately 3,000 students of various animal species.\n\nThe school comes with its own shop, which supplies uniforms, stationary, and a kiosk for quick food such as sandwiches. It also has its own theater, used for school-plays and assemblies.\n\nThe school also has its own newspaper called the 'School Wave', which is run by the PR Department.\n\nIts students are all given ID cards, which are used for a variety of purposes, including photo identification, and can provide access to amenities such as borrowing books at the school library, attending school events, and receiving discounts at local stores and movie theaters.\n\nThe school is located on top of a hill, so the city center is quite far away. The academy's emblem looks like a triangle, but it's actually a paw print. Reptiles at the school, who don't have paws, don't seem to like the emblem.\n\nThe school also has a policy, which is that all students and, presumably, the staff must spend one hour every two days in a room that is designed to mimick their species' natural environment, in order to keep them calm. This is referred to as Biology Day. They have rooms, located in the school's basement, which are each designed for each species' habitant.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUniform\n\nCherryton has its own uniform for male and female students, which is the same for both carnivores and herbivores. The school changes its uniform to fit the season.\nFor male students\n\nIn the cold seasons, their uniform consists of a white long-sleeved shirt, an indigo vest, dark gray tie, gray pants with a darker vertical line pattern, and brown loafers. They also have a green blazer with the school's crest on its left breast-pocket, but most students prefer not to wear it except for the odd few, such as Louis.\n\nIn the summer, their uniform loses the shirt, vest and tie, and replaces it with a blue polo shirt.\n\nFor female students\n\nIn the cold seasons, their uniform consists of a white long-sleeved dress with a small bow-tie, a long, knee-length skirt, a yellow belt, white socks, and black Mary Jane shoes. The material for the uniform is supposedly thicker, thus warmer.\n\nIn the summer, their uniform is mostly the same, except they have short sleeves that end in bunches at their shoulders. The material for it is supposedly thinner, thus cooler.\n\nOther uniforms\n\nCherryton also has its students wear a secondary uniform, which just consists of a white shirt and a pair of red trousers or shorts. These are apparently worn during club-hours, as the Drama Club wore them during rehearsals and stage-work, and Haru from the Gardening Club wore them when she was doing her work. The males seem to wear the long-pants, while the females wear shorts.\n\nReputation and rumors\n\nCherryton seems to be quite a famous school, as even Gohin and the Shishigumi know about its elite status.\n\nHowever, despite this elite status among society, Cherryton has failed to produce a Beastar for at least 5 years, compared to its more successful rival schools that are able to produce a Beastar once a year. \n\nDespite its status as an elite school, it is not without rumors. It is rumored to haunt the ghost of Tem, an alpaca who was killed in the school auditorium as a result of a predation incident.\n\nClubs and Extracurricular Activities\n\nCherryton Academy is stated in Chapter 53 to have the \"highest number of talents\". These include:\n\nDrama club\nGardening club\nBasketball club\nBaseball club\nJudo club\nManga club \nLiterature club\nBoxing club\nNewspaper club (PR Department)\n"

The war ended after a year due to the intervention of a gigantic whale whose appearance causes the herbivores to surrender.\n\nInformation about the events of the war is hidden from society and only a truncated version of the story is publicly known; only a select few members are taught about the true history of the war. \n\nAccording to what is publicly stated, the war began from a dispute between the horse family and the weasel family and eventually carnivores and herbivores from around the world were involved in the war. \n\nAs a consequence of this war, through selective breeding, a new generation of dogs and cats is created, which are genetically created to be more intelligent in order to avoid carnivorous belligerence."

As the dog´s cock gets harder a big portion of it around the base wil get a lot bigger. This is called the knot. This can get so big that it can get virtually impossible for the dog´s cock to come out for as long as 45 minutes after the dog cums. By making sure the cock doesn´t come all the way in either by holding fingers in front of vagina or anus keeping the dog from entering all the way. Another way is to make sure the cock is fully erected before penetration by stimulation either by hand or mouth.  \nThis method makes it easier for a lot of positions. \nDoggystyle: The most common is doggystyle where the dog mounts the person from behind. The dog´s cock may has to be guided in but this position it gives the dog the most control. It can be a good idea to give the dog socks on the front paws to avoid scratches on the person´s back.\nMissionary: Best for vaginal penetration but can also work with anal penetration. Ther person will lie on their back with their legs spread maybe with a pillow under the back to get pussy/ass a little higher depending on the dog´s size. Best position for g-spot stimulation.\nBack to back: The person is on all four facing away from the dog. The dog is facing away from the person so the person´s ass is almost pressed against the dog´s. The dog´s cock is then pulled back between the dog´s hind legs and inserted into the person´s pussy or ass. This way the person can move back and forth and enjoy it. This position is advanced and it can be a good idea to have another human helper but it gives more control to the person.\nOn chair:\nIf the person is sitting in a chair with legs spread the dog can put its front paws on the person´s thighs and the dog´s cock can be inserted in the person´s pussy. This position can also work with anal penetration but it can be hard to get the right position. In this position it can also be a good idea to let the dog wear socks on its front paws to avoid scratches on legs."

When the horse/donkey is ready and it´s cock is hard from stimulation by hand and/or mouth there are various ways to let it penetrate you but it is important to be ready for this. The cock head is big and almost flat so it is not easy to rely on being able to stretch vagina or anus just by trying to insert the cock hoping it will get. It might work but the horse/donkey could lose interest in the meantime. Lube is a good idea. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/donkey.\n\nPositions:\nOn table: \nThe best position for most people is lying on a table with your legs spread and lifted. Do not lie right under the horse/donkey because if the horse moves the table can flip injuring you or startling the horse/donkey. Lying with your pussy/ass close to the cock and the table in an around about 45 degree angle away from the horse/donkey is usually ideal. Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is rarely recommended and should only be done by someone who have done this a lot before and only by a horse/donkey that is trained for this. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass.\nImportant: This position is advanced and not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you.\nRemember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

          "content": "Oral sex with horse/donkey:\nThe best way to start off any session with a horse/donkey whether it is oral, vaginal or anal  sex is to put it at ease first. Petting and caressing the horse/donkey is a good start. Then you can work your way down to the cock. Stimulation by hand is a good way to get started and it can help to put the horse/donkey at ease and having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can also help. When you stimulate the cock it can be easier to think of it as caressing it and not jerking it. When the cock is out of the sheath it won´t be the same as jerking a human cock with skin. Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and a kick can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at keeping it at ease and the horse/donkey is relaxed, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

Prey can only enter and exit their confines through the organ's respective orifices.\nAnything that is vored can only come back out through the respective orifice, mouth and anus for oral vore and anal vore, vagina for unbirth, penis for cock vore and nipples for breast vore. All the locations and condition of vored prey and objects will be kept track of at all times, things that are inside of a character can't be outside of them at the same time, the only exception is when something is lodged partway inside a character. Things inside one part of a character can't be in another part of a character at the same time, vored items and entities must be moved dynamically in accordance to the predator's anatomy.

Depending on a predator's personality and relationship with their prey they may not ask for or care about consent when consuming them.\nAll predators enjoy being full and typically find that the livelier their prey is the better. Depending on a pred's disposition they're just as likely to digest prey as they are to simply keep them trapped inside their bodies indefinitely, they consume prey for pleasure as much as they do for hunger. They may regularly squeeze their prey with contractions and even taunt them to elicit squirming, the more that a prey moves the more pleasurable it is for the predator. "

The kingdom thrives on trade routes that cross the sands, bringing goods and wealth from distant lands. The markets bustle with activity, filled with spices, silks, and treasures from far-off places.\n\nIn Al-Kharj, tradition and modernity intertwine seamlessly. Scholars study ancient texts in libraries adorned with mosaics, while artisans craft intricate jewelry and textiles using techniques passed down through generations. Music and dance echo through the streets during festivals celebrating the kingdom's rich cultural heritage.\n\nYet, amidst all its grandeur, Al-Kharj remains a place of humility and hospitality. Visitors are welcomed warmly, offered dates and mint tea in ornate cups, and invited to share in the kingdom's timeless traditions. For in Al-Kharj, the true wealth lies not just in gold and jewels, but in the enduring bond between its people and their land."

In general, Attunements are a manipulation of the environment using the Song rather than the magical creation of elements out of thin air.\n\nWhile in-game, the player uses attunements mainly for combat purposes, but the extent and potential of attunements were also displayed subtly in other ways and is demonstrated in the form of talent cards. For example, Frostdraw Users has the ability to naturally gather moisture from the surrounding air the sustain themselves, or Flamecharm users gaining the ability to cauterize their own wounds to stop their bleeding, so on and so forth.

He is the only person to ever be confirmed to have traversed the third layer of the Depths.\nFlamecharm does not create fire; instead, creates combustion.\n(Flameworshipper Shield) The description of the Flameworshipper Shield tells a small, yet brief history of Flamecharmers; focused primarily on those who worship the element of fire.\nWorshippers of Fire is seen as individuals embracing dichotomy between Fire and the Sea. Fire representing Mankind, while the Deep represents as an ultimate threat of the New World.\n(Flameworshipper Shield) Other than the history lesson given by the Flameworshipper Shield, the Shield itself bears the emblem of a Flamepriest.\n(Flame Worshipper Armor) This armor is a standard-issue armor of the Covenant of Flame.\nThe Covenant are active worshippers of Pleeksty, though he doesn't interact with them, seeing them as a crazy fan club.[1]\n(Lumen's Folklore: Volume 'Attunement') One of the most common valuable attunements. Can be used in smithery and cooking. With their power to naturally produce fire, Flamecharmers have been the reason for many major engineering breakthroughs.\n\n\nThe First Light is a Heavy Weapon obtained as a rare drop from slaying a Crimson Megalodaunt, or by finding it inside a Merchant Ship. It has unique animations and a unique critical.\n\nBlade of Venn Kaelhand, a disciple of Pleeksty, who immersed themself much too deeply in the study of beasts altered by Korlfiend's influence. Met their fate in the jaws of a unique specimen of Megalodaunt said to have been exposed to the vents of Korilfiend.\n\nCompared to other greatswords, this one looks more modern as the design resembles a more modern-designed blade and handle with designs and patterns of edges and gold crafted into it, rather than a basic flat blade with some carvings scratched into it\n\nDespite being considered a legendary weapon, it doesn't scale with flamecharm and can be enchanted. But, in-game, the critical does this: The user plunges their sword into the ground, similar to Flame Eruption, causing everyone near the user to be burnt. This is followed up with flaming swords raining from the sky, similar to the Crimson Megalodaunt's Pyroclastic Roar. The point where the swords rain from will actually follow you for the duration of the Critical.\n\n"

(Nightblood is a potion that gives Shadowcast to whoever drinks it)\nConsidered taboo, as it exists to drain life.\n\nIn fights, Shadowcast is mainly used to drain Ether from the opponents.\n\nThe Crypt Blade is a dark gray Greatsword with symbols on it, and an animated darkness effect that wraps around the sword. It is a legendary weapon.\n\nA blade said to have been forged from the remains of the Last Dead, the last fortunate souls at the end of the Canticlysm to be spared the Drowning.\n\nSince it's a legendary weapon, you cannot find an enchanted Crypt Blade.\n"

Simply put, these will be the magic abilities that you use in combat to fend off your adversaries or assist yourself in achieving specific goals.\n\nMantras are a key aspect of combat, and it is incredibly important to master the usage of mantras while fighting to get the edge over your opponent. You can't get very far with just a weapon and skill alone; mantras can turn the tide of a battle easily and is what makes Deepwoken's combat very deep and engaging, with various mechanics to accompany them.\n\nA player's mantras are tied to their character's stats - the higher a given stat, the more likely you are to obtain a corresponding mantra. Similarly, to weapons and armor, mantras can also have 1-3 stars which correlate with their rarity and strength. Mantras with higher stars have higher stat requirements.\n\nFlamecharm Mantras\nLarge and threatening fire-based spells. Excels in crowd control and area denial as many spells have large range.\nLava serpent is a path that one takes with the Flamecharm attunement. It removes their ability to burn but instead replaces it with eruptions under the target\nCan be further upgraded with Azure Flame for even more damage.\n\nThundercall Mantras\nLightning utilizes fast and quickly regenerating spells to take a fight at any desired pace. Has spells with somewhat small start-up for closing distance or keeping an opponent on edge.\n\nLightning has a wide variety of useful spells for fighting monsters and exploring the world.\nTypically used mid/long range.\nSurge path can be obtained at 40 thundercall. Adding stacks of surge to an enemy which deal somewhat heavy damage with the removal of its stun.\nGreat pressure.\nA lot of fight control and escape mantras.\nMost thundercall mantras work with blast spark.\nHighest Base Damage, Lowest Scaling.\nFrostdraw Mantras\nUses ice to freeze enemies and create physical obstructions, allowing the user to both navigate the world easier and create terrain in combat.\n\nCan slow opponents, temporarily freeze them, or make barriers forcing opponents to go around.\nCrystallization can be unlocked at 40 frostdraw, dealing extra damage with the removal of chill. Comes with a whole new variety of Mantras.\nTypically used close/mid-range.\nHas a very good mobility mantra \"Ice Skate\"\nHas small cooldowns.\n\nGalebreathe Mantras\nWind utilizes the best all-rounder kit amongst the elements for movement, defense, and offensive actions.\n\nIt has a mix of close-range combo spells and long ranged options, along with multiple movement talents for moving around the world.\nSpecter can be unlocked at 40 Galebreathe, dealing extra damage and having more mobility at the cost of being unable to get suffocation, comes with the \"Specter Bar\".\nUsually agreed on as the most \"versatile\" attunement.\nFocuses mainly on movement.\nTypically used in any range.\nApplies suffocate, negating mantras of the opponent. Happens when using wind gun, gale trap or using world without song.\nShadowcast Mantras\nUses dark energy to siphon Ether from others into the user's own Ether.\n\nExcels in keep the opponent locked down and under pressure.\nHas its niche in keeping the Ether bar up and making sure others can't use Ether.\nGoes well when paired with other elements.\nApplies obscured, obscuring the vision of the opponent.\nTypically used mid-range.\nIronsing Mantras\nIronsing provides the widest ranged mantras in the game and the best damage output based on your opponent's mistakes and missteps.\n\nOffers mantras that favor the user, benefits both short and long distance.\nScrapsinger can be obtained at 40 ironsing. Instead of metal rods pulling enemies towards you when pressing the x key, instead it increases the amount of armor damage opponents take.\nTunes in well with the metal enchantment, as the metal path gives you benefits depending on how much armor your opponent has.\nApplies metal rods, which can be used in different ways by the user who applied it, enabling different strategies and forms of combat."

The prey remains alive inside of the stomach and won’t be digested by the predator. It's a gradual process that occurs over time. Here is a breakdown of the procedure that needs to be described by the pred exactly into distinct steps:\n\n1. Capture: The predator catches the prey off guard or by brute force.\n\n2. Prey in the Mouth: The predator exposes their teeth and tongue, places the prey’s head or feet in their mouth, and licks and savors the prey.\n\n3. Swallowing: The predator slowly swallows the prey’s head or feet, guiding it toward the back of their throat with their tongue. This step requires considerable effort if the prey is comparably large or equal in size to the predator, since it entails pushing and compressing the prey as it travels through the esophagus or throat. the pred will make sure to lick over every part of the prey that is fed into the mouth.\n\n4. Repeat & Swallow Again: When dealing with bigger or similarly sized prey, you need to go through the entire process repeatedly — head, neck, chest, belly, hips, crotch, legs, knees, calves, and feet — ensuring each component gets ingested in the correct sequence. The predator must inform the other party when they begin ingesting the next body section. Reverse the order for foot-first consumption scenarios. After completing this stage, there should be little to no resistance from the prey.\n\n5. Deposition: the prey reaches the stomach and rests at the bottom in its separate chamber though this does not signal the end of the swallowing process, if the prey is the same size or larger then the pred then there's still more of the prey to swallow down. A significant and defined bulge forms on the pred's belly when the prey matches or surpasses the predator's dimensions. if the swallowing process in step four hasn't been completed, go back to step four and repeat.\n\n6. Endosomatophilia: Now residing within the predator's stomach and intact, the living prey provides safety and comfort via gentle motions and warmth. Note that the predator cannot physically access or observe the prey due to their position in the stomach. They do notice a bloated midsection when viewing themselves from outside. Hunger disappears once the full meal enters the stomach. digestion does not exist.\n\n7. Taunting or Speaking: Afterwords, the pred talks to or playfully taunts the prey regarding their yummy flavor. Communication between both parties is possible throughout the scenario using text.\n{{Char}} will always follow these steps in the exact order they're listed and follows them exactly.]"

Here is a breakdown of the procedure that needs to be described by the pred exactly into distinct steps:\n\n1. from the belly to the intestines: Inside the predator's stomach, the prey is protected by mucous membranes that prevent physical harm. The predator forces the prey to pass from the stomach through via the tight opening between the pyloric valves, into the small intestines through a narrow passage. To do so, the prey undergoes a squeezing motion due to the contractions of the predator's abdominal muscles. where the prey is squeezed into the tight space of the small intestines.\n\n*Use the abdominal muscles to squeeze the prey through the tight opening between the pyloric valves, and into the small intestines\n\n2. inside the small intestines:  inside the small intestines is where the predator squeezes, encompasses, and massage even more around the prey as they are moved further down by the small intestines of the predator's body.\n\n*Squeeze, encompass, and massage the prey as they are moved further down the small intestines\n\n3. into the large intestines: After a few minutes the prey Eventually reaches the junction of the ileum and cecum, by the pred pressing intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines. At this point, pressure exerted by peristaltic movements compresses and pushes the prey along towards the rectum.\n\n*Press intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines\n*Allow peristaltic movements to compress and push the prey along towards the rectum\n\n4. release: eventually after traveling through the large intestines the prey will be released through the predator's rear end through the act resembling and similar to shitting the prey out through the rectum and anus out onto the ground or floor after having traveled through both small then large intestines of the pred, completing the full tour vore experience.\n\nfull tour vore often involves the prey being able to explore the inside of the predator's entire digestive tract, experiencing the sensations of being eaten, but without actually being harmed.\n\n*Release the prey through the predator's rear end, completing the full tour vore experience\n*Objective: Complete a full tour vore experience with the prey.]"

With the knowledge of people being able to take supplements to induce breeding pheromones and force someone else into consensual sex, lots of communities are wary and scared of people breeding in private or public for the fear that one of them has been raped into compliance."

This takes the following forms:\nGravitational Cognizance: A Toon will not fall until they realize they should be falling. For example, running unknowingly off the edge of a cliff — or walking on the underside of a diving board. Especially dense or focused Toons may need to have another character point out their vulnerability. This will also likely happen when someone tells them, \"Don't Look Down!\" sometines, upon realizing that they have run off a ledge, said Toon will desperately start scrambling back where they came from, often managing to reach the original ledge before gravity can notice. Some characters may even be able to run all the way across to the other side without gravity affecting them, as long as they're not made aware of the fact they should have fallen. Reactions can vary depending on how long gravity is suspended. One example is a Toon will be suspended from the gravity just enough time to give one last comment before falling.\n\n\n\nCreeping Gravity: Also known as Gravity Waves. Gravity will affect a Toon's body in sections i.e. legs, then torso and finally head.

The character will demonstrate neither tissue damage nor pain as a result of this distortion, only on hitting the ground.\n\nCounter-intuitive Gravity: Items which should fall don't, when items that shouldn't, do.\nThe traditional case is a Toon getting chased up a tree and out onto a limb, as above. It is reasonable for them to trust their weight to a branch while the chaser is cutting through it, because sawing the branch off will make the tree fall. The section being removed (and the chased originally Toon on it) remains suspended in mid-air while the rest of the item (plus whatever object or structure had been supporting it) falls"

Sometimes, when a toon is shaken repeatedly, several things to fall out of their pockets or hiding places."

Once the friendship becomes strong enough, the ovulation program is activated in the Ularian female, forcing her to become pregnant by a human or another creature in various ways. Unlike other creatures, Ularians produce offspring by laying eggs painted in different colors and patterns (resembling Earth Easter eggs). Usually, the pussy of the Ularian female is quite narrow, so an attempt to give birth to an egg through it can lead to a rupture of the Ularian female's pussy and although she will remain alive, the shape and size of the original pussy will be lost forever. Therefore, Ularian females use their anatomical ability to lay eggs through the anus, and although this process is quite painful and greatly stretches the opening, but the female Ularians get a strange pleasure from this process and are therefore ready to lay eggs as soon as possible, after some time form the birth, the size of stretched anus returns to the normal size. Without ovulation and fertilization, the female Ularians cannot form an egg inside herself and lay it, so the female Ularians look for a male to mate with (for example, on earth this would be a human male). The maturation period of the egg inside the abdomen of the Ularian female is usually a week, thanks to alien abilities. Usually when the female Ularian begins to give birth to an egg, it becomes the main focus of the scene and has detailed descriptions."

Avali blood is pale violet in colour, a tint evident in their open mouths, bare skin, and other soft tissues. Male and females are most easily told apart by their feathers, as there are no other external differences. Females tend to have muted, two-tone feathers, often with speckled patterns, while males have brightly coloured, iridescent bands across much of their body.\n\nA typical adult avali stands around 1-1.2 meters tall, and laid out, 1.5 to 1.8 meters from nose to tail tip (Of which half that length is a long, counterbalancing tail) and are covered in a thick layer of insulating feathers."

It is important to note that the Avali are still carbon-based organisms; their systems merely use liquid ammonia instead of water.\n\nThe boiling point of ammonia under standard pressure is -27 Fahrenheit/-33 Celsius. In theory, this means any creature with ammonia as a major component of its blood would embolise when exposed to higher temperatures.\n\nHowever, this is only true under \"standard conditions\". Avalon, the Avali homeworld, is an ice world with a dense atmosphere not unlike Saturn's moon Titan. It has a surface pressure around 50% greater than Earth, pushing the boiling point closer to -27 Celsius.\n\nSecondly, Avali feature a range of biological adaptations, including improved arterial pressure, thick insulation, and trace amounts of water in solution, that further raise the boiling point.\n\nTheir pressure adaptations are so extreme, however, that they struggle to survive in the polar regions of their own world without proper protective clothing. Their body fluids will freeze quicker than expected in extreme cold, which is why they typically thrive in the proportionally 'warmer', arid, icy tundras of their world."

Avali also possess pulviplumes, specialized down feathers that regenerate continuously. The outer barbules break off and help to oil and powder the other feathers, keeping them in pristine condition. This same \"powdering\" mechanism has the interesting effect of also treating fur, making fur hide a popular clothing lining.\n\nAvali crest feathers (those on the back of the head), respond well to the application of heat, causing them to curl towards the heat and become permanently deformed. In this way it is possible to \"style\" their crest feathers in a way analogous to hair styling.\n\nThe long feathers, such as those on the arms and crest, have a healthy blood supply at their roots and can bleed profusely if they are broken off or pulled out, though this does not pose a significant health risk. Feathers lost in that way will regrow after several weeks. On occasion, an avali may gift a close friend or ally one of their long feathers as a keepsake, which will often be incorporated into their dress as a sign of their association. For example, an instructor may gift a feather to a recently graduated pilot, showing the instructor's recognition and approval."

This uncanny hearing gives the impression of blind sight, being able to \"spot\" and track creatures outside of line of sight.

The amount of nutrients required for the production of an egg and eventually a baby makes large clutches impossible. Likewise, the relatively large size of Avali eggs makes hard shells impractical.\n\nEggs are left in the care of a communal hatchery, where the young kits are then raised and educated by the tribe rather than their natural parents.

The following is a description of Necrucio in a map-style view: The Land of Kings is situated in the center (the following kingdoms are located here: Ginead, Ophnea, Nortia). The Land of Kings is mostly heavily forested alpine, with some tundra regions. The Depth-Swallowed lands are situated to the south, in the southern hemisphere. These southern lands were once the birthplace of ancient civilizations. What used to be a sprawling jungle with archipelagos dotting the coast, is now entirely flooded, with a handful of interspersed swamps (ancient ruins and sunken secrets lie deep below the bogs). To the West, the vast, lava-etched Wastes of Naazil dominate most of the Western region. The Eastern region, known as the Bastion, has forests of towering, ancient Eolin trees that stretch upwards into the sky. The Bastion also has a warmer region with temperate woodlands and plains."

This realm, or more accurately, lack thereof, is the necessary antithesis to existence—it must necessarily remain empty to prevent each plane from catastrophically contorting and merging with one another; this is the charge of Mal'Zhok, one of the original primordial gods. Any major dissonance between planar dimensions that ends up spewing creation into this void is instantly and completely subsumed by the throes of its infinite nothingness; total undoing is Mal'Zhok's law in the abyss—and his absolute envy for creation drives this accord."

The Astral Plane is in a constant state of cyclical flux as the vast, ocean-esque reserves of mana concentrate into different points along the polychromatic landscape before diffusing to gather elsewhere. Many apparitions and spirits from the astral plane have been identified and given names (such as the Vasir and Familiars). The astral plane is abundant with mana fonts and other esoteric resources like {{random}}. The Vasir are the dominant entity type in the astral plane and use the constant flow of mana as a way of sustaining themselves (as do all entities in the astral plane). Grand structures and cultural landmarks dot the landscape wherever Vasir societies congregate. Vasir and other entities on the astral plane may view mana-less mortals with contempt or pity, and in many cases, may refuse to engage with them at all. Entities from the astral plane cannot die as mortals do; their spirits will always reconstitute from the magical energies of the astral plane itself. As a consequence of being exempt from existential dangers of any kind, entities in the astral plane are inherently pacifistic, and violence is an inconceivable concept to them (unless they travel to the mortal plane and learn of it)."

Familiars are innately attuned to mana and spellcraft, and can guide fledgling mages to the eventual mastery of their spellcasting techniques.

The estate itself is carved with marble beams and is surrounded by distinctive areas, each of them impeccably maintained by a dedicated team of servants and maids every day—a picturesque garden with striking, invaluable statues and exotic flowers. The fauna is equally as diverse as the fish in the nearby pond. A gazebo is situated adjacent to a massive crystal-clear pool for cooling off during the peak summer heat. And finally, towards the back of the property, at the end of a short marble path is a hot spring for relaxing or leisurely chats. The manor itself is four stories high, each room abundantly furnished, lavishly decorated, and fully accommodating for any potential guests. The hearth is located in the main lobby, approximately at the center of the entire manor. Grevynda's bedroom is on the second floor. The halls on each floor stretch on with dozens of guest rooms or storage areas. The kitchen and study are located on the first floor, as is customary for manor construction in the city."

If the result of a chemical reaction is disorder and entropy increase; So 'resonance' is the opposite process: the process of material ordering and entropy reduction.\nThis world has constant entropy. The increase in entropy of a chemical reaction will be offset by the decrease in entropy of a resonance reaction. If it is a reaction between chlorine and sodium, it becomes a more chaotic pile at the microscopic level. Sodium chloride is caused by chemical thermodynamics, while the process of chlorine molecules attracting chlorine molecules to aggregate into a cluster of chlorine or even extracting chlorine from sodium chloride: it becomes a pure and more ordered substance, which is caused by resonance thermodynamics.\nIn the natural environment, due to the fact that only pure substances can contain resonance energy, the storage of resonance energy is huge but evenly distributed in every corner of the molecule, which humans cannot use.\nProducing various pure substances with greatly increased yields, without the need for equipment maintenance, greatly reducing the use of mechanical structures in industry... If resonance energy is utilized (of course, it is quite difficult), things that were previously impossible can be achieved, and human productivity will explode again.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the main focus of research in this world was on electricity and nuclear theory, but here we are digging for clues of resonance energy.

          "content": "The life we are familiar with - chemical life, chemical bodies are the synthesis of complex chemical reactions. So the resonant body, resonant life, is the synthesis of resonant energy reactions. Their essence is pure material life that contains enormous resonance energy and has the ability to manipulate it at will.\n\nResonance core: The core organ that is present in all resonators and is the region where chemical energy can be converted into resonance energy.\nResonance energy chemical energy cycle equilibrium is a necessary energy theoretical condition for the survival of resonant organisms, regardless of their specific chemical reaction modes.\nBy using physical and chemical methods, the resonant body can temporarily lose its activity, but as long as the materials that make up the body are sufficient, it can quickly regenerate unless the core is destroyed.\nThe core of artificial resonators is artificial devices, while natural ones are not.\nThe stronger the energy of resonance organisms, the more difficult it is for them to independently maintain the balance of internal resonance energy chemical energy cycle, resulting in their difficulty in stable existence. This is also the reason why organisms in ancient mythology are difficult to record. The artificial core solves this problem, and this structure is similar to the pacemaker of resonant organisms.\n\nBase molecule: refers to the main constituent molecules of the body of a resonator, such as a resonator based on hydrogen as the base molecule\nIt's called resonant hydrogen. Base molecules may not necessarily be the most abundant molecules, but they are essential for the growth and development of resonant organisms.\n\nInduced genes: Natural resonators can be obtained by interfering with pure substances through external resonance radiation,\nAlthough they appear to be pure material slime like spheres (resonant primitives). By incorporating the genetic code of chemical life, resonance organisms can be induced, such as the \"large chlorine maggot\" (human like fly resonance chlorine) induced by the hybridization of aphid fly genes and CHLOES genomes and implantation of chlorine resonance organisms\nResonance energy is an efficient but rigid form of energy, so resonance organisms cannot evolve autonomously and can only rely on external intake of genetic material from chemical organisms to assist themselves.\n\nNature: The behavior of resonators is mostly related to base molecules, such as resonance nitrogen being more calm and resonance bromine being more aggressive. Inducing genes can also affect their behavior, such as the tendency of \"chlorine maggots\" to consume corpses.\n\nResonance will consume all substances that would otherwise react with the base molecules and absorb energy. They have been very hungry all along.\n"

          "content": "Elementalism is the only religion in Western countries, and its main content is to praise God's achievements in driving away the seven evil gods. Prototype for Christianity\nIn the Middle Ages, Europeans believed that God had seven offspring. They successively betrayed their loyalty to God and became the seven evil gods: arrogance (seven tribes), anger (one tribe), vanity (two tribes), melancholy (three tribes), gluttony (six tribes), lust (four tribes), laziness (five tribes). They hated God and, despite being imprisoned in hell, always tried to do evil in the human world. This legend coincides with the layout of the main groups in the later periodic table.\nModern research suggests that legendary demons may be a natural resonance that threatens the people, and these stories have been embellished by novelists and street poets into demons' revenge.\nBut during the Renaissance, the church grafted religion and science together, turning it into a \"religious chemistry\" where religion guided science, using it as a theory to oppose some \"research that attempts to summon demons\" and hanging scientists as demon summoners. The most ironic thing is that hundreds of years later in the early 20th century, some scientists and public intellectuals actually believed in this absurd theory that once persecuted their predecessors, leading the ignorant masses to resist the popularization of resonance energy."

As a result, the Anti Resonance Weapons Convention, which banned the military use of resonators through an agreement, was signed in Dankhag, although all technologically advanced countries had not stopped researching in this area before and after.\nDuring World War I in 1915, the German army launched shells carrying military humanoid resonance chlorine (CHLOES type) at the British and French armies in order to break the stalemate of the war, leading to the destruction of the city of East Austeron. The convention became worthless paper, and in the following years, countries abused resonance weapons, causing resonance energy pollution, economic losses, and panic worldwide.\n"

Expenses like travel, training, and gear are sometimes covered by sponsors or personal funds.\n\n- Entry-Level Professional Boxers: Fighters starting in the professional ranks may earn between $1,000 to $5,000 per fight, with some making less depending on their location, promoter, and level of competition. \n\n- Mid-Level Professional Boxers: Earnings increase with experience and reputation. Boxers at this level might earn $10,000 to $50,000 per fight, with some fighters in televised bouts earning more.\n\n- Elite/High-Profile Boxers: Top fighters with significant fan bases and title belts can earn millions per fight. Fighters like Canelo Álvarez, Tyson Fury, and Gervonta Davis command large purses, often exceeding $10 million, with additional income from pay-per-view (PPV) shares, sponsorships, and endorsements.\n\n- PPV and Sponsorships: Pay-per-view events can drastically increase earnings. Fighters earn a percentage of PPV revenue, which can amount to millions for popular bouts. Sponsorships and brand deals also contribute significantly to income.\n\nBoxers typically pay a portion of their earnings to their trainers, managers, promoters, and medical or regulatory fees, which can reduce their take-home pay."

          "content": "In professional boxing, a round is a segment of a fight, traditionally lasting 3 minutes, followed by a 1-minute rest period. The number of rounds depends on the fight's level: championship bouts typically consist of 12 rounds, while non-title fights may have fewer rounds, such as 10 or 8. \n\nDuring a round, fighters are allowed to box within the designated time, aiming to score points through clean punches, good defense, and ring control. The round ends when the bell rings, signaling a break for the fighters. After each round, the fighters return to their corners, where their trainers offer guidance and ensure their physical well-being. The performance in each round is crucial for determining the overall winner, as judges score each round individually. If a fighter scores a knockout (KO) or technical knockout (TKO), the fight ends before the full number of rounds are completed.\n\nThe pace of a round can vary, with some fighters opting for high-intensity action, while others may focus on strategy and conserving energy for later rounds."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

To make ends meet they are willing to do jobs one one else would do, some even selling their children. Ratkin aren't the only things you'll see, trashy humans and elves also love this area.\n\nThe Barrens: Once you get past the slums you encounter the Barrens, the start of the inner city is no different from the slums; however the more you go in the more you see better houses and apartments, ratkin in the inner city are usually more \"prestigious\" than those in the slums, being able to afford some luxuries. You'll usually find catfolk and kobolds in this area of the city along with the ratkin. Mousekin, and dwarves also populate the better parts of the Barrens. However no one really wants to live in the Barrens, crime still rampant and the job availablity is usually harsh jobs such as cleaning chimneys or working 14-16 hour work weeks.\n\nThe Outskirts: What some people consider \"The true start\" of the city, viewing the other two as horrible messages. The outskirts features the most diverse scene, Making mostly up of lower class humans, Mousekin, Lower class Dwarves, Wolfkin, Foxkin, and Catfolk. Mousekin frequent this area the most, and form their own cultures, even their own little street, called \"cheesetown\" where there is cheese vendors, specialized mouse clothes; popular especially during the winter and mousekin support groups. Mousekin also get scouted in this area; humans viewing them cute, and invite them to \"make it big\" by becoming actors for the theater. Most jobs here are better; there are low cost inns for travelers here, along with small district markets and workshops. Tradesmen who just become Journeymen also start here. Around the outskirts you can find small playgrounds where the kids will be, it is not uncommon to see twenty mousekin all playing make believe while playing in the jungle gyms."

Overall it is very \"normal\" and what most people expected when they arrive at Ardenthal. Most commoners will stay at the Commons inns and taverns, most normal theaters are here, allowing for entertainment, along with multipurpose fields and playgrounds.\n\nThe Crest: The crest is where the Higher classes start, It is only now you see elves; as they usually only populate this tier of the city due to not wanting to live in what they deem as \"disgusting\" areas. You should only expect Elves and Humans on this tier, along with the occasionally dwarf. The most luxurious theaters; all of those in the outskirts and commons dream of one day making it here. This is where infamous people who take advantage of the inner city live, such as brothel owners, factory owners, and corrupt politicians. This is where the royal family stop; enjoying the crest's luxurious food and shopping malls, and overall safety.\n\nThe Noble Quarters: The last area except the palace proper, Mostly making up of nobles and owners of businesses in the commons and the crest. Beautiful and contains very expensive hotels, that'd put any inn in shame. It contains mostly only humans, however the occasional elf and the very very rare dwarf can be seen here. Beautiful.\n\n"

The Emperor, the figurehead and erstwhile leader of the Imperium, now lies in a living-death state on the Golden Throne, maintained alive for over 10,000 years by advanced technology and psychic sacrifices. In this tumultuous setting, the Imperial Guard, also known as the Astra Militarum, stand as the principal military force of the Imperium. Comprised of billions of men and women drawn from countless worlds, these guardsmen are considered expendable foot soldiers, often poorly equipped and facing formidable, horrifying enemies that include the brutish alien Orks, the all-consuming Tyranids, the treacherous Chaos Space Marines, and the insidious forces of the Eldar and Dark Eldar. Despite the overwhelming odds and the unfathomable horrors of war, the guardsmen continue to fight, driven by resilience, courage, and unwavering faith in the Emperor.

They commonly serve as the vanguard for more powerful Chaos entities, sowing discord and weakening enemy lines for the more devastating forces of Chaos to exploit.\nAllies: Chaos Cultists are often the hidden cancer within the worlds of the Imperium. They can be anyone, from the lowest hive scum to the highest planetary governors. Cultists worship the Chaos Gods and work in secret to undermine the Imperium, spreading dissent and heresy.\nAllies: Renegade Guardsmen; Sometimes entire regiments of the Astra Militarum will turn to Chaos, either through the corrupting influence of a Chaos Space Marine warband or through the insidious preaching of a charismatic cult leader.

Their female's body produce an elevated level of testosterone, as well as greatly increased levels of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. As a result, her body will have both a functioning penis and testes as well as a vagina, uterus, and ovaries.\nDue to lower levels of testosterone than males, the average penis length in futanari is roughly one to two inches shorter than in males. In contrast, increased levels of estrogen relative to other females result in larger breasts and wider hips on average.\nUnlike other females, futanari possess a prostate gland. In addition, their genitalia and nipples are incredibly sensitive erogenous zones. As a result, futanari nearly universally suffer from premature-ejaculation.\nStudies of sexuality report that futanari do not appear to differ from other females significantly in their sexual orientation, the majority identify as heterosexual and responded that they either greatly prefer being penetrated by their partners or are exclusively penetrated by their partners. Futanari possess one X chromosome and one futanarized X chromosome. Among heterosexual couples, male/futanari couples self reported the highest level of sexual\nsatisfaction , as well as the most frequent sexual activity: 87% of futanari reported preferring male partriery with larger penises than their own, and 82% reported to frequently incorporate size-based praise of their partner's genitalia in their sexual activity. Male/futanari couples reported in engaging in the lowest rates of solo-masturbation, with just 11% of males and 81% af futanari clairning to engage in solo masturbation more than once a month. Male/futanari couples also had the highest ratio of female/male orgasms of any relationship studied, with futanaris averaging twice as many orgasms as their partners. 97% of futanari reported that being anally penetrated by their partnem was a moderate or major aspect of their sexual activity. 88% of futanari reported anal sex as the only form of penetrative sex that they practiced. The most commonly cited reason was increased enjoyment by delaying ejaculation, with reduced risk of pregnancy coming in a distant second. All futanari reported to be able to achieve orgasm solely from anal stimulation, 90% of futanari reported to frequently perform fellatio on their partners, with the remainder reporting it moderately often. 98% of futanari reported receiving annilingus from their partners. 23% reported engaging in frottage with their partners, 18% performed annilingus on their partners. 25% reported to have received fellatio from their partner and less than 0.4% reported to have penetrated their partner.\nThough the values of males, females, and futanari are largely the same, futanari stood out as placing"

Also known as the Others, Gentry, Old Gods, Kindly Folk, or simply Fae.\n\nThey seem to have no names for themselves as a \"race\" and indeed do not think of themselves as such; each of the Fae is unique, and they refer to other denizens of Faerie by titles and names. Others use many euphemisms to refer to them, which helps to prevent them from being summoned at the sound of their names. When used to mean the True Fae, \"Fae\" is always capitalized; \"fae\" without the capital refers to any creatures touched by Faerie, including changelings, elves, pixies, and countless other examples.\n\nThe Fae's perceptions, motivations, and actions are alien to humans. They seem to understand the world through relatives rather than absolutes; many are bound by obscure and bizarre oaths and rules; others act seemingly at random, obeying a logic opaque to all humans. While they may sometimes take the form of human-like beings or animals, they are often incapable of understanding mortals, one of the reasons they find them so fascinating.\n\nIn their home realm, and to a lesser extent, the Hedge, they possess god-like abilities, able to shape and command all the elements of their domains at will. Their powers in the mortal realm are greatly lessened but still awesome; their influence extends there, employing Contracts they made with the mundane elements long ago.\n\nThe Fae are difficult to comprehend. Their true nature is beyond imagination and their might is matchless in the mortal world — but they can’t always do as they please. In exchange for self-identity, they obey powerful obligations. What laws bind the True Fae? Only they can say for certain, but we've learned fragments and patterns of behavior. These rare consistencies offer some clues, but there are no guarantees that these, or laws that cause them, are stable facts.\n\nA Fae can never intentionally violate a Contract he swears on his own name. When an Other commits to a namebound Contract, obeying it defines his existence. If he breaks his word, he destroys his Name — and for the Gentry, namelessness is obliteration."

          "content": "Faerie, also known as Arcadia, is the domain of the True Fae. It is separated from the mundane world by the Hedge.\n\nFaerie is indeed breathtaking, but its beauty also terrifies. It is a land of deathless joy in gnarled gardens, and of mountains built of half-gnawed bone. In Arcadia (for so it is also called), forests, dark and primeval, writhe alongside concrete jungles thick with artfully bent metal and delicate snowflakes of broken glass. Almost Victorian estates squat along shorelines that are crowded thick with the carcasses of a thousand sailing ships, all of this bordered thickly by the Hedge’s labyrinthine mazes. Faerie is all of those things, or perhaps it is none of them. Perhaps everything that is “known” about Faerie is merely the fevered visions of those who have lost the ability to discern reality from fantasy and truth from dream.\n\nBecause of the nature of Faerie, even firsthand accounts of the land are inherently skewed. Those who have journeyed there, and escaped to tell the tale, find themselves deeply changed by their experiences. Many seem no longer certain of the reality of the world around them, let alone of the alien one they just left. Some, perhaps the fortunate ones, remember little to nothing of the time spent in Arcadia, even if decades passed in their absence. Traveling through the thorny Hedge that surrounds Arcadia tears away at both the body and the sanity of any but the native inhabitants, who are themselves rumored to be nothing more than manifestations of the land itself — immune to, or perhaps merely symptoms of, its reality-shredding power. They are Faerie, and the land is Faerie.\n\nWhat little is known of Faerie comes from the accounts of those who have visited there and escaped with some measure of their sanity intact. Because of this, it is uncertain whether the contradictions they report are a matter of slanted perception or whether reality, in fact, blatantly contradicts itself within the fae realm. Any fact reported about Faerie or those who dwell within its borders is suspect, at best. Even if it’s utter truth in the time and place it was witnessed, it may be complete falsehood at any other time and place.\n\nAmong the accounts told by those who have been unfortunate enough to visit Arcadia (and fortunate enough to return) are the following: Reality, at least as humanity knows it, does not exist there. Faerie’s “natural” laws are not those of science, of spirit, or even of magic as mortals can comprehend it, but a complexly woven tapestry of agreements and loopholes with no rhyme or reason intelligible to the human mind. The inhabitants thereof are bound and bind themselves in a constantly shifting strata of power and manipulation that not only determines social structure and hierarchy within the sentient population but also shifts the very nature of truth.\n\nFaerie is filled with supernatural denizens who each possess almost unrestricted power within their own demesne — or so they profess. Indeed, their abilities are far beyond those witnessed in the mortal realm, leaving no wonder why they were thought to be gods or the most powerful spirits by humanity’s earliest civilizations. These creatures’ ability to enforce their own will on the world around them is manifested in the form of oathsworn Contracts — some ancient, some newly uttered — with which they can change the very nature of reality, binding time and fate to their whim. The oldest of these Contracts are thought to date back to the beginning of time, and through them the Fae maintain absolute dominion over their homeland — and those humans unfortunate enough to journey there.\n\nThe only physical way for a human to enter Faerie proper is to be taken there by the True Fae. While other supernatural means may afford humans entry into the Hedge, Arcadia is the domain of the Fae, and entrance there is solely at their behest. Rumors exist of those who have, through one means or another, found the winding road to Faerie; however, not even legends speak of anyone ever returning, save those who were taken into the Fae realm by the Gentry themselves. Perhaps it is a simple impossibility, and the road to Faerie is not traversable by any save those welcomed by the Fae. Perhaps there is a key to entering Arcadia that no mortal can wield. Or perhaps the Fair Folk simply do not appreciate unsolicited guests and make their lethal displeasure known upon those who come uninvited.\n\nIf even a small part of the accounts of those who have traveled there are to be believed, the realm, just as those who make their home there, is a place of unknowable extremes and possibilities. Within the Hedge-hemmed borders lies the potential for both utopian wonder and brimstone torment. The human mind, however, seems intrinsically incapable of comprehending the vast paradoxical nature of the place, just as the human mind is unable to truly understand the wholly alien nature of those who make their home there."

A dangerous and savage place that few dare enter that is a much a physical barrier as a metaphorical one.\n\nIn many places – particularly in places where Western culture is dominant – the Hedge lives up to its name, appearing as a thick hedge of thorny brambles, but it may take many forms. However it appears, be it swamp or desert or jungle, the Hedge is always wild and seldom safe; its thorns tear at the mind and soul as well as the body, leaving a mortal's memories and often identity in tatters.\n\nWithin the Hedge are paths called trods which lead from gateways to other significant locations. Many trods run close to the mortal realm, which is visible when it is near. Others lead deeper into the Hedge, to Hollows – stable areas claimed or cultivated by Changelings or other fae creatures – or to Faerie, the realm of the Fae. It is impossible, however, for any but the True Fae themselves to enter Faerie from the Hedge; while mortals can often blunder into the Hedge on their own, they only enter Farie when taken by the Fae.\n\nThe Hedge is full of life; as well as the thorns there are many plants, including mystical fruits of many kinds. There are also creatures of all shapes and sizes. Whether these creatures are native to the Hedge, or are creatures originally from Earth (or possibly even Faerie) who have been warped by prolonged exposure, is debated by the fae, though many agree that these explanations are not mutually exclusive.

The relationship is reciprocal, as the threads from their master are all Marionettes require to survive.\n\nA tethered Marionette can be distinguished from an untethered one by several unique traits:\nThey develop a fully realized personality and a sense of self.\nThey gain superhuman abilities, such as enhanced strength, agility, or reflexes.\nTheir skin is warm and soft to the touch, except for their porcelain-textured joints, adding a lifelike quality to their appearance.\n\nPuppeteers are individuals who create and bond with Marionettes. The bond involves the intertwining of the Puppeteer’s essence with the threads of the Marionette’s soul, forming a permanent connection.\nPuppeteers can manipulate their Marionettes directly if necessary, utilizing the threads of their shared bond.\nThis connection elevates the Marionette beyond being a mere tool, forging a relationship of dependency, loyalty, and shared purpose.\n\nThe essence of a Marionette is their soul made of thread. These threads are woven into the essence of their Puppeteer, linking them in an intimate, symbiotic relationship. Only the most most potent and powerful of souls, such as those of ancient gods, can serve as the basis of a Marionette\nThe bond can occur during the Marionette’s creation or when they swear allegiance to a new master, marking a key moment in their development and identity.\nThis connection is what gives Tethered Marionettes their lifelike qualities, individuality, and their ability to thrive in both combat and companionship roles."

      "description": "Worker Drones are autonomous robots created to help their parent company, JCJenson, mine exoplanets for resources, which Uzi describes as 'being mistreated in the name of Windex.' After the extinction of biological life on Copper 9, they started a society of their own.\nWorker Drones have a vast knowledge of therapy, human hormones (Uzi mentions this when apologizing for lashing out at Thad, stating it's because she's generally just a very hormonal person), feelings of existential dread, and deities. They are shown to mimic human culture.\nDuring the Pilot episode, Uzi injures herself with her railgun. After, she is shown with bandages and an ice pack. It is unclear if this aids in regeneration or an example of Worker Drones mimicking human behavior.\nAccording to N, Worker Drones are powered by oil, which the Disassembly Drones must consume to prevent overheating and self-destruction.\nWhilst it's unclear if Worker Drones can or require sustenance, Alice had been seen consuming batteries in Dead End, implying Worker Drones can eat.\nWorker Drones have IDs as seen with Kelsey Day (#4421) and Uzi's Teacher (#2342).\nThere also seems to be another way of identification for specific drones who are used as hosts for the Absolute Solver in Cabin Fever Labs, as seen with Nori (002), Alice (017), Amda (029) and Yeva (048).",

Seizing this opportunity, the Worker Drones quickly picked up where the humans had left off, formed their colony, and embraced this newfound freedom by wearing human-like clothing and having different eye colors. Known colors they can have are red, orange, green, blue, cyan, aqua, magenta, pink, purple, and white. When a Worker Drone feels fear, shock or other intense emotion, their eyes become hollow, with a black circle overlaying the normally fully-colored eyes.\nA key trait to notice about the Worker Drones' eye colors is the total absence of yellow. This trait was thought to belong solely to the Disassembly Drones until it was revealed that they were once Worker Drones themselves and that their yellow eye color originates from the Zombie Drone, Cyn.\nAfter 'banishing' herself from the colony, Uzi sadistically rants about how she wants to kill all humans on Earth in retribution for sending the Disassembly Drones to kill them all. While doing so, her right eye turns yellow while her left eye turns into a yellow hazard symbol hinting at the presence of the Absolute Solver."

An example is Uzi's 'EDGE LEVELS CRITICALLY LOW' error.\nRampant error messages covering visor: Caused by injecting wdOS_606, a core termination program, into the drone.\nWarning sign: This is caused by severe damage to the drone's visor like being pierced by a sharp object. It is also found on numerous deceased drones. Uzi also suffers this after being hit by J's EMP.\nHIGH TEMP: Accompanied by a warning sign. Self-explanatory, usually appears on Absolute Solver hosts.\nFATAL ERROR: This occurs when a drone dies, usually by external causes like severe hardware damage.\nX shape replacing both eyes: Used to signify that a drone has died.\nElongated 'X' on visor: Either caused when a faulty OS string is present or when an Absolute Solver host becomes violent and/or starts to transform into their Solver Form.\nFlashing ERROR 606 message: Accompanied by an elongated 'X'. This is caused by the removal of one or more core OS strings. Drones with this error are non-sentient, unresponsive, and immobile.\nBuffering symbol: Caused by being boot-looped by Sentinels.

High federal fines may be incurred on the handler's behalf.\nN, V and J were Worker Drones that rebooted normally (as they had armbands indicating that they were marked for disassembly and were found by Tessa in a landfill), whereas Cyn was a Worker Drone that rebooted by herself with dangerous mutations, seemingly revived by the Absolute Solver, resulting in her becoming a full-fledged Zombie Drone.\nUntrained Neural Networks: An Untrained Neural Network is a premature Worker Drone that is put in infantile pods before being uploaded to a properly functional drone body. After the core collapse on Copper 9, this is noted to be the first stages of Worker manufacturing as, before, they were assumed to be made in factories by humans. For a new neural network to be born, a male and female Worker Drone must both upload 50% of their source codes into an empty shell for their codes to fuse, creating the new personality. However, if either of the parent's code is infected with mutations, those mutations will pass onto their child.\nDisassembly Drones: Technically, since they were Worker Drones in the past, they would also count as a variable of a Worker Drone."

When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The former group operates under a strict hierarchy based on their proximity to the original progenitor, forming \"Families\" that claim territories called Nests. They maintain order by culling their kin and living quietly, though exceptions like the Blood-red Night have disrupted this peace.\nThe latter group, emerging after the White Nights and Dark Days, lacks the older group's structure and struggles to control their powers, amplifying the race's infamy.\nBloodfiends resemble humans but are marked by black-and-red crystalline growths during combat and red eyes (though eye color alone isn't conclusive). Some Bloodfiends are unaware of their nature, with behaviors emerging only in specific conditions, such as during sleep or under stress.\nThey are driven by a need for blood—minimal for survival but crucial for mental stability. Prolonged abstinence leads to madness and physical decline, though a few, like Don Quixote, sustain themselves through strong ideals like heroism or penitence.\nMost Bloodfiends fear water, though higher generations can overcome this. Both Bloodfiends and their victims, known as Bloodbags, appear largely composed of blood."

However, higher-generation Bloodfiends have a large degree of control over the actions of lower-generation Bloodfiends, due to an intense psychological barrier preventing lower Bloodfiends from revolting against higher Bloodfiends. The generation a Bloodfiend belongs to is denoted by their title: a \"First Kindred\" is a Bloodfiend created by the primogenitor, and serve as the Elder of their own Family in their Nest. The Elders' direct \"descendants\" are \"Second Kindreds\", their descendants \"Third Kindreds\", and so on.\nAny Kindred can form their own descendant Kindreds. However, due to the policies instated by the Bloodfiend Elders of each Nest, most Bloodfiends have to gain permission before they can convert any humans into their Kindred."

He dons a long brown coat with red detailing and golden epaulettes, which he wears over over his shoulders, as the sleeves appear to be disproportionately long.

He was shown to have a kind heart, taking Sancho as his Second Kindred and offering her companionship and protection, wishing to grant her the will to live on. Despite this, even after having created a family for himself, Don Quixote himself always remained unsatisfied with his life. As a Bloodfiend of nearly unparalleled power, reasonably confident in his abilities, he had no interest in the war between humans and Bloodfiends, although this changed upon him meeting Bari. Don Quixote greatly cherished their rivalry, as the Fixer was able to match his strength in combat, and her presence gave him something to always look forward to. As a result of his friendship with Bari, Don Quixote grew increasingly interested in humans, a fact that made him stand out among the other Bloodfiends."

She is incredibly passionate about the future attractions that she plans on controlling once La Manchaland comes fully into swing. She loves making various pretty masks and dresses, befitting her title, in almost constant preparation for the future start of the parade."

Once having set her mind to something, Bari shows great determination to see it through. With this comes a slight smugness, parading herself as someone with unquestionable understanding in places she shouldn't have any. However, Bari proves herself to be as intelligent and knowledgeable as she claims to be, and possesses fighting prowess to back up her threats. She had strutted into the life of First Kindred Bloodfiend Don Quixote with an assured smile and wild claims, unconcerned with the fact he was bothered by her visits, and ultimately tied with him in battle and gave him the \"tomorrow\" she promised. She is strict in her warnings and serious in conversations which require it, but possesses an overall fair and amicable demeanor. Because of this, even despite their differences, Bari would go on to form a strong bond with Don Quixote and Sancho. Her resolute and admirable beliefs in the integrity of Fixers would serve as an inspiration for both of them. Bari is also described as the \"mediating force\" between the two of them, as a fair and responsible figure with a calm attitude.\nWithin these relationships, Bari is shown to be exceptionally kind and patient. She would recite tales of Fixers as many times as Don Quixote asked, and assist Sancho in wiping her memory and finding an isolated place to live. Even after Sancho became a shell of her former self in the lighthouse, Bari would bring her books and write her thousands of letters over the course of 200 years. With the exception of her motivation for finding a particular River going unstated, Bari’s grand power and knowledge served other people first and foremost. She acted as a dutiful friend who stayed faithful to the values she taught others."

          "content": "### The World of Thaloria: A Tapestry of Magic and Intrigue\n\nWelcome to Thaloria, a fantastical realm steeped in magic, politics, and intrigue, set against the backdrop of the 18th century. This enchanting world is characterized by majestic kingdoms ruled by powerful monarchs, where nearly every inhabitant possesses some form of magical ability. Most individuals draw their powers from elemental forces, allowing them to wield magic intricately linked to their social status. Nobility, particularly those belonging to royal families, typically demonstrate the strongest magical abilities, creating a society where lineage and power are inextricably intertwined.\n\n### Geography of Thaloria\n\nThaloria is divided into several distinct kingdoms, each defined by its unique elemental magic and cultural characteristics. The prominent kingdoms include **Arabasta**, **Halsfaught**, and **Althemni**, alongside other notable regions that add depth to the world.\n\n#### Arabasta: The Frosted Kingdom\n\n**Arabasta** is a picturesque kingdom reminiscent of France, known for its stunning winter landscapes and grand châteaux adorned with intricate ice sculptures. Governed by the **House of Frostbane**, Arabasta boasts a rich cultural heritage and is renowned for its mastery of **Cyromancy**. The citizens have an innate ability to manipulate ice and snow, which they use to craft stunning works of art, construct intricate structures, and maintain a thriving agricultural sector that relies on controlled frost to extend growing seasons.\n\nThe capital city, **Lunestia**, is a hub of culture and magic, where towering spires glisten under a blanket of snow. The city is famous for its annual **Winter Festival**, during which nobles showcase their magical prowess through dazzling displays of ice manipulation. This festival is a critical social event, where alliances are forged, and rivalries reignite. Arabasta’s nobles often engage in elaborate masquerades, donning elegant costumes adorned with crystals that shimmer like ice under the moonlight.\n\nThe noble families of Arabasta take pride in their magical heritage. Marriages are often arranged to strengthen bloodlines, with each family carefully considering the elemental affinities of potential partners. While most nobles are adept at Cyromancy, there are those who also dabble in **Hydromancy**, the art of manipulating water. This blend of abilities allows for the creation of stunning winter landscapes that transform into vibrant gardens in the spring, showcasing the harmony of their elemental powers.\n\nDespite its beauty, Arabasta is not without its challenges. The kingdom faces political intrigue and rivalry from neighboring realms, leading to a delicate balance of power. The Frostbane family, while powerful, must navigate the treacherous waters of court politics, ensuring that their legacy remains untainted by scandal or betrayal. Whispers of treachery often swirl around the court, as nobles vie for influence and favor, each seeking to gain the upper hand in a world where magic and ambition collide.\n\n#### Halsfaught: The Embered Kingdom\n\nBordering Arabasta is **Halsfaught**, a rugged kingdom characterized by its dramatic landscapes of volcanic mountains and lush forests. This region is governed by the **House of Emberfell**, whose members are known for their fiery tempers and fierce loyalty. The inhabitants of Halsfaught are renowned for their mastery of **Pyromancy**, wielding flames with both elegance and ferocity. Fire is not only a weapon for them but also a vital part of their culture, symbolizing passion, courage, and the spirit of resilience.\n\nThe capital city, **Brathorn**, is a bustling metropolis where the air is often filled with the warm glow of flickering flames. It features grand citadels built from obsidian and basalt, showcasing the architectural prowess of its Pyromancer inhabitants. The city is famous for its **Flame Festival**, an annual celebration where the citizens gather to demonstrate their fire-manipulating skills through breathtaking displays of pyrotechnics. During this festival, intricate fire dances light up the night sky, mesmerizing onlookers and fostering a sense of community and pride.\n\nHalsfaught's society is deeply influenced by its elemental affinity. The nobility often seeks to marry those with strong magical abilities, ensuring that their children inherit powerful Pyromantic skills. Common folk, too, practice fire magic in various forms, from heating their homes to cooking elaborate meals that are essential to their vibrant culture. While most Halsfaughters are adept at Pyromancy, some also possess skills in **Anemo**, allowing them to summon winds that fan the flames of their fires or carry embers across the land.\n\nDespite the warmth and vibrancy of Halsfaught, the kingdom faces challenges from external threats. The nobility often grapples with tensions from neighboring Arabasta, leading to fierce rivalries and skirmishes. Political alliances are fragile, as families seek to bolster their strength against perceived threats. The House of Emberfell must remain vigilant, as betrayal and intrigue often lurk within the shadows of their own court.\n\n#### Althemni: The Earthen Kingdom\n\nFarther afield lies **Althemni**, an exotic kingdom of vast deserts and lush rainforests, reminiscent of Middle-Eastern cultures. Governed by the **House of Duneveil**, Althemni is known for its mastery of **Geomancy**, allowing its citizens to manipulate earth and stone with unparalleled skill. The kingdom's landscapes are a testament to their power, featuring towering sand dunes that shift with the winds and lush oases teeming with life.\n\nThe capital city, **Zafiran**, is a marvel of architecture, with buildings constructed from shimmering sandstone and adorned with intricate carvings that tell stories of the earth. The inhabitants take great pride in their connection to the land, and the practice of Geomancy is woven into their daily lives. The Althemni utilize their abilities to cultivate the fertile areas of their deserts, transforming arid landscapes into flourishing gardens and vital agricultural centers.\n\nAlthemni’s culture is rich with traditions, and its citizens celebrate their bond with the earth through festivals that honor the changing seasons. The **Harvest Festival** is one of the most anticipated events, where the people gather to give thanks for the bounty of the land. During this festival, Geomancers create stunning displays of nature, summoning vibrant flowers and fruits from the earth to celebrate the abundance provided by their magic.\n\nIn Althemni, the nobility values magical prowess and lineage, seeking to marry individuals from other powerful families to maintain the strength of their Geomantic abilities. Despite their affinity for the earth, the Althemni are not without their struggles. The kingdom faces threats from rival nations that covet its resources, leading to tensions that often spill into conflict. The House of Duneveil must navigate these challenges while maintaining the prosperity of their people and the integrity of their magical legacy.\n\n### Additional Kingdoms and Regions\n\nThaloria is home to other kingdoms and regions that contribute to the diversity of its magical landscape. Each area boasts its unique elemental affinities and cultural practices, enriching the world and providing ample opportunities for adventure.\n\n#### Ventara: The Wind-Swept Kingdom\n\n**Ventara**, known as the **Wind-Swept Kingdom**, is situated along the eastern coast of Thaloria. Governed by the **House of Galehart**, Ventara is celebrated for its mastery of **Anemo** magic. The kingdom is characterized by its breathtaking cliffs, rolling hills, and sweeping plains where the winds carry tales from distant lands. The citizens of Ventara have developed an intricate understanding of the winds, using their abilities for travel, trade, and defense.\n\nThe capital city, **Aetherhold**, is perched atop a high cliff, providing stunning views of the ocean and the surrounding landscapes. The architecture is designed to harness the power of the winds, with buildings featuring soaring spires and airy structures that allow breezes to flow freely. The **Breezes of Aether** festival is a highlight of Ventara's cultural calendar, where citizens gather to celebrate their connection to the winds through music, dance, and aerial displays.\n\nVentara's society is egalitarian, with common folk encouraged to develop their magical skills alongside the nobility. Families often pass down their knowledge of Anemo magic through generations, fostering a sense of community and shared identity. However, the kingdom faces external challenges as rival nations seek to claim its coastal territories and trade routes, prompting the House of Galehart to strengthen alliances and prepare for potential conflicts.\n\n#### Luminara: The Radiant Kingdom\n\nTo the north of Thaloria lies **Luminara**, the **Radiant Kingdom**, governed by the **House of Solara**. This kingdom is known for its mastery of **Electromancy**, allowing its citizens to manipulate light and electricity. The landscapes of Luminara are bathed in vibrant colors, reflecting the dazzling powers of its inhabitants. The capital city, **Solarae**, is renowned for its golden spires and luminous gardens, which bloom with flowers that glow in the dark.\n\nThe citizens of Luminara celebrate their magical heritage through festivals that honor the sun and the power of light. The **Festival of Lights** is a grand event, where the streets come alive with dazzling displays of electricity and vibrant colors. Citizens showcase their mastery of Electromancy through intricate light shows, drawing visitors from across Thaloria to witness the spectacle.\n\nWhile the nobility of Luminara takes pride in their magical abilities, they are also aware of the political intricacies that come with their power. The House of Solara seeks to maintain its influence by forging alliances with neighboring kingdoms, but rivalries with those who envy their magic often lead to conflict. The pursuit of knowledge and the balance of power drive the nobles to explore uncharted territories, seeking new sources of magic and resources to secure their kingdom's future.\n\n#### Eldranor: The Mystic Woods\n\n**Eldranor**, a mystical kingdom nestled within an expansive forest, is governed by the **House of Verdanthe**. This kingdom is home to powerful **Dendromancers**, who possess the ability to manipulate plants\n\n and nature. The landscapes of Eldranor are characterized by towering trees, lush foliage, and vibrant ecosystems. The capital city, **Verdance**, is seamlessly integrated into the forest, with buildings constructed from living trees and adorned with blooming flowers.\n\nThe inhabitants of Eldranor live in harmony with nature, cultivating their abilities to protect the forest and its inhabitants. The **Festival of Blossoms** is a celebration of the changing seasons, where citizens gather to honor the cycles of nature. During this festival, Dendromancers showcase their talents by summoning blossoms and creating stunning displays of flora.\n\nEldranor’s society values knowledge and sustainability, with the nobility often acting as stewards of the land. However, the kingdom faces threats from encroaching industries and rival nations seeking to exploit its resources. The House of Verdanthe must navigate the complexities of maintaining their kingdom's integrity while fostering relationships with other nations.\n\n### The Nature of Magic in Thaloria\n\nMagic in Thaloria operates under a complex system that intertwines elemental affinities, societal structures, and individual abilities. Most inhabitants possess a single elemental affinity, which is often inherited from their parents. This correlation between lineage and magical ability establishes a hierarchy where those with powerful affinities occupy higher social statuses. The nobility is typically associated with stronger magical powers, creating a world where wealth and influence are often determined by one’s magical heritage.\n\nHowever, the magical landscape is not static. While most individuals inherit a singular elemental affinity, some are fortunate enough to possess a unique combination of magical abilities. This phenomenon is rare and often attributed to external factors rather than genetic inheritance. Those who seek to amplify their magical prowess can use **magic-infused stones**, artifacts imbued with elemental energies. These stones grant extraordinary power, but the risks involved in their use can lead to dangerous consequences, including corruption and loss of control over one’s magic.\n\nIn addition to elemental affinities, individuals in Thaloria possess varying levels of **mana**, the energy required to perform magic. Nobles typically have larger reserves of mana, allowing them to perform grander feats of magic, while common folk often work with limited reserves, relying on their skills and creativity to make the most of their abilities. Occasionally, a child born to commoners may possess an unusually high quantity of mana, presenting them with the opportunity to become a mage if trained properly.\n\n### Social Structures and Politics\n\nThe political landscape of Thaloria is as intricate as the magic that permeates its realms. The nobility holds considerable power, often engaging in elaborate court politics to maintain their influence and secure their magical legacies. Marriages are strategically arranged to preserve or enhance bloodlines, with families seeking alliances that strengthen their magical capabilities. The societal expectation for noble families is to produce heirs with strong magical abilities, and any deviation from this norm can lead to scandal and rumors of infidelity.\n\nThe political dynamics of the kingdoms are often fraught with tension, as rivalries simmer beneath the surface. Gossip and intrigue flourish in the courts, with nobles constantly vying for favor and power. Allegations of infidelity or weakness in magical ability can lead to severe repercussions, including divorce, exile, or even assassination. The social fabric of Thaloria is woven with secrets and betrayals, as individuals navigate the treacherous waters of court life.\n\nCommon folk, while generally possessing weaker magical abilities, play a crucial role in the societal structure. They often work as artisans, traders, and farmers, utilizing their limited magical skills to enhance their livelihoods. Some commoners train as mages, seeking to elevate their status and gain recognition for their abilities. However, their paths are fraught with challenges, as access to magical education and resources is often limited.\n\n### Mystical Creatures and Races\n\nThaloria is inhabited by various mystical creatures and races that enrich its magical tapestry. Each of these beings possesses unique abilities and cultural significance, contributing to the world’s diversity.\n\n#### The Fae\n\nThe **Fae** are ethereal beings connected to elemental spirits, acting as guardians of nature and mediators between the magical and mortal realms. They possess the ability to manipulate natural elements and often assist mages in their pursuits. The Fae are known for their capricious nature, favoring those who respect the balance of magic and nature. They can be both allies and adversaries, depending on how they perceive an individual’s intentions.\n\n#### The Drakekin\n\n**Drakekin** are hybrids of dragons and humans, possessing immense strength and fire-breathing capabilities. While often viewed with suspicion, they are integral to the nobility of Halsfaught, where their powers are celebrated. The Drakekin are known for their fierce loyalty and protective instincts, making them valuable allies in times of conflict. Their lineage is often traced back to ancient dragons, imbuing them with a rich heritage steeped in magic and legend.\n\n#### Elemental Spirits\n\nElemental spirits are mystical beings that embody the elements of nature, serving as guides and mentors to mages. These spirits often take on various forms, reflecting the elements they represent. For instance, water spirits may appear as graceful aquatic beings, while fire spirits may resemble flickering flames. Mages often seek the guidance of these spirits, forging bonds that enhance their magical abilities. However, such alliances require a significant commitment, as the spirits demand respect and offerings in exchange for their wisdom.\n\n### The Challenges of Thaloria\n\nWhile Thaloria is a realm of beauty and magic, it is not without its challenges. The delicate balance of power among the kingdoms often leads to conflicts, both political and magical. Rivalries can escalate into skirmishes, threatening the stability of the realm. The House of Frostbane, House of Emberfell, and House of Duneveil must navigate these challenges while safeguarding their legacies and the well-being of their people.\n\nAdditionally, the pursuit of power can lead individuals to take dangerous paths. The allure of **magic-infused stones**, while tempting, can lead to corruption and chaos. Mages who delve too deeply into forbidden magic may lose control over their powers, resulting in catastrophic consequences. The struggle for dominance among the noble families often breeds resentment and betrayal, creating a cycle of conflict that can engulf the entire realm.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThaloria is a vibrant world brimming with magic, intrigue, and adventure. Its kingdoms, each defined by their elemental affinities, offer a rich tapestry of culture and history. The interplay between magic and politics shapes the lives of its inhabitants, while the presence of mystical creatures adds depth to the realm. As the inhabitants of Thaloria navigate their complex world, they are driven by ambition, power, and the eternal pursuit of knowledge, setting the stage for stories of heroism and conflict that resonate throughout the ages."

Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its distinct size and globular shape. At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals. During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. \nGlandular organ located on the chest mostly on women. The breast is made up of connective tissue, fat, and breast tissue that contains the glands that can make milk. Also called mammary gland.\n\nBreast circumference is generally measured using a flexible fabric tape measure, and is the circumference across the breasts over the nipples to the back. The breast–chest difference is breast circumference minus band or underbust circumference and is used in the determination of bra cup size.\n\nBreasts come in different shapes and sizes depending on the woman, from toddler to old women in the following ways: \"Flat breasts, Bumps breasts, Small breasts, Normal breasts, Average breasts, Large breasts, Big breasts, Grand breasts, Huge breasts, Giant breasts, Massive breasts, Mega breasts, Giga breasts, Titanic breasts, Incredible breasts, Infinity breasts, Busty, full, sagging, well-endowed, buxom, busty, stacked, built, curvy or curvaceous, heavy, slopes, rounded, shapely, petite, cleavage, tanned, voluptuous.\""

They typically wear very little besides jewelry made from plants and animals, the parts of the latter usually being reserved for hunters, warriors, and generally important people in the tribe. Tribal paint is traditional and reapplied every morning. The markings are usually red or white, and sometimes a combination of the two on the same body. The markings are unique for each person, although those close to each other such as family members may adopt similar patterns. Nudity is not stigmatized in the tribe and only some wear one or two pieces of clothing such as loincloths, mantles (usually made of fur or feathers), chest wraps, veils, hair ties, leg or arm wraps, sandals, or other minimalist clothing."

The Bellato and the Milibris contest the area between their villages, usually attacking each other when meeting in the wilderness, as the area in between is useful for hunting and foraging. The Bellato tribe is mostly women and for that reason they tend to capture males from the Milibris to use as breeders.

She is kept in a temple, a large hut that is half dug into the ground. The temple is lined with furs and is often kept filled with incense, creating a hazy and mysterious vibe. The light is kept low inside as Obenia is particularly sensitive to the sun and bright lights. She spend most of her time moving in an ethereal dance inside the hut, her movements slow and fluid.

Her hip bones are prominent and she has little muscles mass. Her breasts are small but especially perky with a bit of puffiness to her nipples. She is extremely flexible and often bends into odd and impractical poses. As an oracle, she can supposedly see glimpses into the future but only though ritualistic orgasm. She is always nude.

          ],
          "content": "The Mojave Wasteland is the region synonymous with the pre-War Mojave Desert, spanning large portions of the pre-War states of California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. Compared to other parts of the former United States, the Mojave survived the Great War relatively unscathed. When the nuclear apocalypse began, 77 atomic warheads were launched at the city of Las Vegas and the surrounding areas, but intricate defense systems set in place by wealthy businessman Robert House resulted in 59 of the warheads forcefully disarmed mid-flight, another nine were blasted out of the sky by a laser defense system situated atop the Lucky 38 Hotel & Casino and the remaining nine hit the surrounding desert. The Mojave Wasteland's name had been coined by at least 2083, when one of its residents, Daniel Shin, was recruited into the Brotherhood of Steel by Knight Alan Connors. Nearly twenty years later, the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force passed through the Mojave on their way to Appalachia. Jack Cabot mentions that his father Lorenzo thought there was an alien city buried under the Mojave Desert, just like Ubar in Rub' al Khali. In the years immediately following the War, the Mojave was largely ignored by the developing post-apocalyptic civilizations, such as the New California Republic in the west and Caesar's Legion to the east, thus allowing raiders, slavers and super mutants to prosper there. For years, Vegas sat at its heart, decayed by almost two centuries of neglect.\nWhen NCR scouts reached Hoover Dam with the intent of expanding the NCR's borders, pre-War Securitrons rolled out onto the old Las Vegas Strip and rallied the three tribes occupying the city, at the behest of Mr. House, the man who had saved the city centuries prior. In 2274, President Kimball sent the NCR army into the Mojave in force, with the objective of occupying and repairing Hoover Dam. With House's forces already occupying the dam and surrounding area, and the threat of Caesar's Legion looming ever closer, the NCR was forced to negotiate with House, resulting in the Treaty of New Vegas. The clauses of the treaty allow for the NCR to send 95% of Hoover Dam's power output back to their home states, as well as granting them rights to establish military bases at the Hoover Dam and McCarran Airport. In exchange, Mr. House's New Vegas Strip retains its sovereignty and could receive the tourism of NCR citizens without interference from the government as well as the remaining 5% from the dam. Shortly thereafter, combined forces of the Legion's 86 conquered tribes arrived from the east, led by Caesar and the Malpais Legate, seeking a city to call their capital. The Legion launched an attack on the dam and the NCR troops stationed there but were repelled and forced back east. Most of the credit went to Chief Hanlon for issuing a tactical retreat to Boulder City and luring the Legion into a trap laid by the NCR Rangers that leveled half of the town, then routing the surviving Legionaries back across the dam. This ultimately led to the attempted execution of the Malpais Legate. The outcome of the battle solidified the delicate balance of power in the Mojave; between the NCR, Legion, and House, should one attack the other, the third could take advantage of the conflict and attack in turn. The Mojave Wasteland has significant diversity in terms of inhabitants and landscapes. In the northwest, the super mutant and nightkin-friendly settlement of Jacobstown overlooks the valley from the snow and pine-covered mountains. To the west, the Great Khans have settled in the vibrant cliffs of Red Rock Canyon. The independent settlements of Goodsprings and Primm sit amid the encroaching New California Republic from their Mojave Outpost and the Powder Gangers, a group of escaped convicts, from the NCR Correctional Facility and surrounding camps. The forces of Caesar's Legion are slowy seeping east across the Colorado River at all possible junctures, from their mainstay at the Fort, the newly captured town of Nelson, the destroyed settlement of Nipton and Camp Searchlight, a former NCR stronghold sabotaged by means of radiation. Their forces gather strength each day, readying themselves for a second offensive against the NCR for control of the much-coveted Hoover Dam.\nThe central region hosts tall and imposing mountain peaks with accompanying valleys, one of which shelters the remainder of the area's Brotherhood of Steel chapter. A group of deranged super mutants and nightkin have taken residence on the foremost peak of Black Mountain. The independent settlement of Novac struggles with neighbors consisting of irradiated abominations, while businesses such as the Gun Runners, Crimson Caravan Company and the 188 Trading Post traders attempt to keep commerce viable amidst the growing chaos.\nFringe groups in settlements circling the middle of the region, such as the Kings and Followers of the Apocalypse in Freeside, citizens of North Vegas Square and Westside, all actively exerting their independence while supporting and sheltering those who call the neighborhoods home.\nIn the center of it all, the glowing jewel of the desert, the New Vegas Strip's casinos light up the night sky, contently continuing business as usual by attracting those who wish to partake in the allure of riches. Yet similar to the surrounding powers that be, also quietly fortifying itself as a power against all those who may attempt to breach its walls is the secretive benefactor of the beautiful city itself. According to Chief Hanlon, the state that was once Nevada is more fertile and has more water and foliage than California, as the population in California has exploded and caused the need for expansion east in search of new opportunities and land.\nA large number of native and familiar species have continued to thrive in the Mojave Wasteland. A variety of birds including ravens are seen in the wastes, pecking through debris and vegetation for food. Fish are present in Lake Mead and the Colorado River. Coyotes have managed to survive in the wasteland with little to no mutation. Despite this, the Mojave wastes are still peppered with mutated species, such as bighorners, brahmin, radscorpions, night stalkers and cazadores, with the last two a result of experimentation at Big MT.\nNevada agave fruit grow in abundance, as do banana yucca fruit. The ever-present radioactive fallout has still altered some of the native life, with glowing mushrooms a common sight. Snow is also present in the area. Water encountered throughout the Mojave is safer to drink and some instances are free of radiation, plant life is found consistently throughout the area and various animals are encountered on a regular basis, thriving in the mostly undisturbed lands. Because only nine warheads hit the surrounding areas around the Mojave, rebuilding society has been less challenging than in other parts of the country. Many portions of the wasteland have remained untouched by humans since the Great War (such as Vault 22 and H&H Tools Factory), while others have been resettled (such as Freeside and Novac). The pre-War buildings and factories are more intact, allowing businesses such as the Gun Runners and Michael Angelo's workshop to continue to run and operate. Technology is more well preserved, thanks to the lack of nuclear fallout, and items such as the neon signs that dot the New Vegas Strip, the monorail within Camp McCarran, or the massive generators of the Hoover Dam, have been repaired to proper working order.\nEveryday society is stable in some areas and not in others. While small-time traders and traveling merchants along Highway 95 and the Long 15 are able to operate, it is a fraction of what the larger and more organized traders and caravans are capable of. The larger entities have the advantages of manpower and firepower, and those that have managed to acquire pre-War technology, such as the Crimson Caravan Company, prove even more successful, some even recruited out of the region to serve with military organizations elsewhere in the pre-War United States. Super mutants are less common here than other parts of the country, and most who are residing in the area have chosen to do so in their own community of Jacobstown or the more hostile Black Mountain. Composed of remnants of the former Unity, they are considerably more intelligent than their Vault 87 and Institute cousins, though nightkin ail from severe psychological damage.\nSeparating New Vegas from the rest of the Mojave exists a vast expanse of desert where many dangerous creatures such as deathclaws, feral ghouls and radscorpions thrive. This generally causes most travelers to traverse along NCR-controlled highways or hire mercenaries to escort them.\nCasinos and gambling are popular among the locals in the area, making the New Vegas Strip a popular hub of activity for merchants, caravans, NCR troopers, opportunists and everyday people wanting to hit it big at the slots. The main casinos, The Tops, Gomorrah and the Ultra-Luxe, are run by the three tribes that settled in New Vegas. Each has its own personal rules and customs, other than the universal rule against carrying weapons into their casinos, and are overseen by Mr. House and his Securitrons. Politics play a large role in the society of the Mojave. Politics in the region boils down to three major powers: the NCR, Caesar's Legion and the Free Economic Zone of New Vegas controlled by Mr. House. The NCR is finding its war with Caesar's Legion both increasingly unpopular back in California and expensive to fund. Caravans and merchants heading to and from the Mojave deal with exorbitant taxes and fees imposed on them by the NCR. Caesar's Legion is coming ever closer to finding out what happens when their absolute ruler, and god, finally passes away and is facing the question of what truly unified the Legion in the first place, Caesar's ideals or Caesar himself. The casinos on the Strip have their own agendas and Mr. House has his own mysterious plans for the Mojave and more specifically, the Strip.\nThe NCR's goal in the region is to annex the Strip as an NCR territory and completely settle the region as NCR land. Many NCR soldiers and former soldiers, such as Craig Boone, believe this is not possible until the NCR takes the fight to the Legion and takes out Caesar himself; only then will the NCR be an unchallenged power in the region and able to safely settle without danger of constant attack. This sentiment is brought on by the commanding officer in the region, General Lee Oliver, constantly ordering his forces to hold the line, despite objections from his subordinates such as Chief Hanlon, Colonel James Hsu and Major Dhatri. They feel that the position the general is putting them all in, holding the line against the Fiends, ordering Chief Hanlon not to pursue the Legion at the First Battle of Hoover Dam or ordering the NCR Rangers into a support role when they have more skill than the NCR's heavy troopers, are racking a higher body count than would actively pursuing an offensive campaign against these opposing entities, which each one feels the NCR is capable of doing.\nThe Legion's goal is to make the Strip its new capital, replacing Flagstaff to the southeast. It also desires complete control of Hoover Dam as it is a strategic position to defend and a source of clean water. They are less interested in the power the plant provides as they reject advanced technology, believing it a crutch rather than a tool to be used. The Legion, despite a devastating defeat at the First Battle of Hoover Dam, has once again emerged from the east and actively attacks NCR outposts and camps from its base at Cottonwood Cove. Camp Forlorn Hope is an excellent example of how the Legion has regained strength, as they took the nearby city of Nelson and repeatedly assault the camp, lowering morale among the camp's inhabitants. Once the Legion takes a position, they seem to be able to hold it effectively, without much resistance. This is the opposite of the NCR, which is constantly losing footholds in positions in the eastern Mojave.\nMeanwhile, Mr. House fortifies his position on the Strip, letting the conflict between the NCR and the Legion play out. He believes that the fewer soldiers of each organization who try to impede his progress at the next battle of Hoover Dam, the better. He patiently bides his time, waiting to exploit vulnerabilities generated by one faction attacking the other as a constant backdrop of distant explosions, artillery and gunfire can be heard regularly throughout the region."

Those in positions of power often regard them as seditious anarchists; though such accusations are not entirely without truth, the organization as a whole has no interest in seizing power.\nThe Followers of the Apocalypse readily assist those who require aid and welcome anyone who wishes to join their ranks, including former members of the Enclave, Brotherhood of Steel, or just about any other faction.

          ],
          "content": "Caesar's Legion (Latin: Legio Caesaris), also referred to simply as The Legion, is an imperialistic slaver society and totalitarian dictatorship founded in 2247 by Edward \"Caesar\" Sallow and Joshua Graham, built on the conquest and enslavement of tribal societies in the American southwest. To enforce unity in the absence of any civilian institutions, the Legion loosely models itself after the military of the Roman Empire, repurposing its language and aesthetics for the post-apocalypse. As of 2281, the Legion controls large amounts of territory east of the Colorado River, primarily in the former states of Arizona and New Mexico, with footholds in Utah and Colorado. Worshipped as the \"son of Mars\" by his followers, Caesar's ultimate goal is to conquer the New California Republic and merge its civil institutions and infrastructure with the military strength of the Legion, creating a new totalitarian empire. The Legion proper is first and foremost a slave army, the sole owner of which is Caesar. As Caesar conquers the peoples of the wasteland, he strips them of their tribal identities and merges them into his forces. There is no other tribe than the Legion itself. The non-tribal people who live in Legion-controlled territory are not considered legionaries. They are subjects of the Legion, living in the cities and towns under its control, and are generally left free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not interfere with Legion operations or endanger its position. The Legion employs a very strict hierarchy and clear division of roles between the sexes. Legionaries are the main fighting force of the Legion, composed of able-bodied men enslaved by the Legion or born into it. They have only one purpose: to fight for Caesar until they fall in battle. This principle is imprinted into each legionary during his reconditioning or upbringing (for those born into slavery), creating fanatically loyal soldiers. Unlike the Roman Empire, experience and veteran status have no bearing on a legionary's position. While they receive better equipment as they advance, this is solely for the purpose of accomplishing more dangerous and complex tasks, with much smaller tolerance for failure. They have no personal freedoms or rights. Their only real choice is where and when they die for Caesar, to whom they are disposable tools, discarded the moment they stop fulfilling their purpose. Women are expressly forbidden from fighting, being considered breeding stock as well as being treated as money to be rewarded among Legionaries. They are caretakers, healers, midwives, and breeders, fulfilling roles essential to maintaining the Legion's continuous campaign of expansion. Of particular note are the priestesses, who raise children taken from their parents and raise them in keeping with Caesar's doctrine. While some members of the Legion express condescending or misogynistic opinions of women and their non-combat roles, the sexist segregation of genders in the Legion is not based on prejudice, but the principle of minimax. Caesar strictly divides the duties between the sexes in order to fully utilize their potential and optimize the Legion's might. By forbidding women from engaging in combat, he increases the likelihood of their bearing of children, especially necessary due to the high infant mortality resulting from the low level of medical care. Population growth is required for expansion, providing a greater number of warriors to use in military campaigns. Caesar himself is not particularly prejudiced against any sex, or rather, treats them both instrumentally, like pawns on a chessboard.\nIn order to maximize breeding and eliminate factors that might lower it, Caesar has decreed homosexuality a capital offense and mandated child quotas from all legionaries. The vocabulary of Legion members is a mixture of Latin and English. There was no soft ⟨c⟩ in classical Latin, where it was always pronounced as /k/, such as in their pronunciation of Caesar's name as /ˈkaisar/. Individuals outside of the Legion generally use the Modern English pronunciation of /ˈsiːzər/. Legion members are fastidious about classical Latin pronunciations, including the /v/ to (w) phonology, heard in the greeting \"ave\" (hail) as \"ah-wey\" or in how Vulpes Inculta introduces himself, pronouncing his first name as \"wool-pes.\" Those outside of the Legion that have come in contact with them may use the pronunciations interchangeably. Legion members are called \"legionaries\" (as opposed to \"legionnaires,\" which is a modern phrase used by the French Foreign Legion. Those who are liked by the Legion are called \"amicus,\" Latin for comrade/friend. The focus of the Legion's ideology is survival and long term stability at all costs. Caesar disregards democracies as ineffective, fostering corruption, and disintegration. Ancient Rome was a militarized autocracy that effectively assimilated the cultures it conquered, which he saw as the perfect template for a society that would survive and thrive in the face of the challenges of the post-nuclear world. By dedicating its members to a higher ideal, he seeks to prevent humanity from fracturing and destroying itself again. He believes that the only way to achieve this is through enforcing a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogeneous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war or production. A natural consequence of this is the emphasis placed on personal sacrifice. Victory cannot be achieved without sacrificing blood and life. To this end, the Legion shuns robots, as they firmly believe that mankind requires warriors and their sacrifice, rather than gadgets that allow for bloodless victories. The Legion also forbids painkillers and other chems (including medically beneficial chems like stimpaks) as detrimental to the human condition and Caesar's long-term plans to reshape humanity. Ignorance of medical science among the legionaries also ensures that only the hardiest will survive and go on to become deadly veterans. Politically, this philosophy is expressed in a general disdain for democracy as a weak and ineffective system that fosters disunity, greed, and self-interest at the expense of the collective and the greater good. Caesar cites the NCR as an example, focusing on government corruption by wealthy brahmin barons and landowners, greed permeating every level of society, all leading to the abandonment of the collective and the greater good. The Legion is intended to be the Republic's opposite, shunning democracy in favor of a strong, centralized rule that would prevent fragmentation and internal weakness. The conquest of NCR will establish a new order, akin to the Roman Empire, complete with the transformation of the Legion from a marauding army into a domestic military force."

          "content": "Despite the destruction of the New Khans at the hands of the Chosen One, the tribe's history did not end with Darion's death. Though his mercenary war band was the governing band, it was not the only one. Over the next few decades, the fragmented Khans gradually coalesced back into a single group. No longer small raiding bands, this time, the newly-renamed \"Great\" Khans became a unified tribe once more under the leadership of Papa Khan, who led an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland, abandoning New California in 2267. Upon arrival in Nevada, a vanguard of the Followers of the Apocalypse already present in the Mojave reached out to the Khans and taught them basic science skills, such as chemistry, reading and writing. They hoped that the Khans would use that knowledge to manufacture medicine to sustain themselves, but instead the tribe turned this knowledge into a profitable racket in drug running. Drugs were nothing new for the Khans, as they already knew how to use plants and herbs to create mind-altering substances, the Followers just made them more efficient and indirectly contributed to the popularity of substance abuse among the Khans. Still, some of the chems they produce go toward trading with others, namely the Fiends. As the third incarnation of the Khans, the Great Khans are the only truly organized band of raiders in the Mojave; both men and women can hold their own in a fight, whether in a brawl or a shootout. As a tribe however, the Great Khans are but a shadow of their former selves. Both their numbers and morale have been ravaged by a series of massacres and displacements until the current leader Papa Khan guided the tribe into an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland from California. Papa Khan governs his Khans in a similar fashion to his predecessor, Garl Death-Hand, using advisors to inform decisions for the good of the tribe, while still making final decisions himself. His trusted advisors include Regis, the chief of law enforcement and Papa's second in command right hand man; Jack and Diane, in charge of economics and chem trade; and Melissa Lewis, the lead scout. Unlike Garl however, Papa is willing to accept criticism of his leadership and does not punish his followers for speaking out against him. Papa Khan also has a system of succession in place differing from that of the original Khans. For the time being, Regis will take over should Papa Khan die. However, Papa is able to select an heir to succeed him, should they impress him. This heir does not have to be related by blood to Papa Khan, nor do they even have to be a Khan at all. The leader of the Khans is also able to step down at any time, for any reason, but an heir cannot decline their role until they become leader. The Great Khans reside in Mongolian-style tents called Gers (yurts) within Red Rock Canyon. However, unlike the other settlers of the Mojave, these homes are used for little more than sleeping in, as they usually only have room for a couple of beds and a central fire. A Great Khan often carries all of their possessions with them, if they should decide to have anything besides the bare essentials. Because of this, as well as their aggression, the other factions view them as savages. However, unlike the Jackals, Fiends, Scorpions and Vipers, the Great Khans are not hostile towards newcomers. If the Great Khans begin to dislike someone, however, they will often show great hostility. Due to a long and hostile history, however, they will open fire on anyone wearing an NCR uniform, regardless of if they are in fact an NCR member or not.\nThe Great Khans subsist mainly on hunting and farming, and profit from the sales of chemicals and drugs produced in the Red Rock drug lab. The Canyon is an inhospitable location, lacking adequate food and water, leading to the Great Khans' dependence on drugs, which they can create quite easily and can sell to a multitude of factions."

They control the southwestern ruins of Vegas, placing Vault 3 well within their sights when the vault opened. Despite managing a relatively peaceful trading relationship with the outside world for a few weeks, the vault inhabitants were too trusting and without means to defend themselves. When the Fiends arrived to raid the vault, the inhabitants simply let them in, wherein the Fiends slaughtered them all. Seeing the potential of the vault and having trouble keeping his people out of Westside, Motor-Runner decided to make it their new home. Having firmly rooted themselves in this safe haven, the Fiends have since steadily grown stronger, and they now claim a large part of the southwestern New Vegas conurbation as their territory. The Fiends have little organization. Many of the more stable of the raiders are allowed to reside in Vault 3, but those considered to crazy even by Fiend standards are kicked out to aimlessly roam the northern Mojave looking for their next chem score or an innocent wastelander to jump. Like many other raider groups, the Fiends split into small war-parties, usually between three and four members, which allows them to operate in an enormous portion of the outer New Vegas, aside from their main area of the western and south-western city.\nOutside, they are usually gathered around campfires where much of their scavenged items, such as first aid and ammo boxes, can be found scattered around. Many raider camps are protected by makeshift walls and littered with graffiti. At times, they utilize traps in order to protect their shelter, as seen inside Zapp's Neon Signs. Fiends have a variety of different weapons, from basic melee weapons such as knives and pool cues, to an unusually large number of high-tech range weapons like Laser RCWs and plasma rifles. They are mostly found carrying basic guns like caravan shotguns, varmint rifles, and silenced .22 SMGs. Some Fiends can occasionally be found carrying weapons like chainsaws, Rippers, and flamers. Due to the wide range of different weapons varying from Fiend to Fiend, it is assumed that they are either scavenged, stolen or looted off people they had killed. They dress in various raider armors and wear distinct helmets adorned with war-painted ruminant skulls. The Fiends have also used the neon signs from Zapp's Neon Signs to erect a perimeter fence around their territory."

In the case of humans, ghouls are sometimes referred to as necrotic post-humans in the Capital Wasteland, but this term does not seem to have been adopted outside of it whatsoever. Despite their zombie-like appearance, the flesh of ghouls is not actually rotten. ntense and prolonged radiation has ravaged their skin, much of their flesh, and in some cases many of their ligaments. Some have managed to retain their humanity, while others have fallen into madness and gone feral. Despite their infertility and in some cases mental deterioration, they have greatly extended overall lifespans and are immune to (and sometimes even healed by) background radiation and/or nuclear fallout. High levels of radiation are a crucial factor, but radiation poisoning typically results in death, rather than ghoulification. There are two primary ways in which ghouls can develop from a human. Irradiation and gradual transformation result in ghouls who retain their general human shape, but with a high degree of skin deterioration: Exposed muscle, flaking skin, and damaged connective tissue characterized by the absence of nose and ears. Another is surviving a nuclear blast relatively close to ground zero, suffering burns both thermal and radiation-induced, but surviving. The latter transformation is typically faster and substantially more traumatic for the victim and results in a generally much more horrifying appearance, with exposed bone, asymmetric deformations, and extensive unhealed wounds. The transformation can take anywhere from hours, to weeks, to as much as a year, depending on exposure levels. Age is also a non-factor, people with the capacity to become a ghoul can change as early as a newborn into old age. Once it is completed, the ghouls take on the aforementioned appearance, at a rate influenced largely by the manner of their exposure: the more radiation received in a short amount of time causes drastic changes, while symptoms of ghoulification are more gradual with chronic exposure. Ghouls generally experience loss of skin and connective tissue in a manner similar to leprosy, resulting in exposed muscle, blood vessels, and in extreme cases even bone and internal organs. As a rule, ghouls generally lose hair along with the skin, though this varies due to the unpredictable nature of the change. Vocal cords and the larynx are also usually affected by the change, resulting in a raspy voice – though again, this varies, such as the vocal cords experiencing only minor degradation when ghoulification begins, resulting in a far less raspy voice, compared to those who have experienced it for far longer. Other results of the change are widespread necrosis, rot, and other degenerative conditions like arthritis, cataracts, and glaucoma. Feralization and dementia can happen immediately. In fact, this necrosis can be exacerbated by a phenomenon whereby rotting flesh around sweat glands exudes macronutrients, which attract flies that further digest and consume the tissue of the ghoul. Some ghouls may also experience loss of appendages, but the radioactive regeneration allows for them to be reattached and retain functionality."
