          "content": "the Omnitrix resembled a slimmer and sleeker watch-like shape, with a green wristband, and the face of the dial is black and green. The inside of the hourglass symbol glowed in different colors during certain moments; these colors signify the mode that the Omnitrix was presently in. When the user is selecting their aliens it shows the alien's hologram standing on the core.\n\nFeatures\nGeneral\nThe Omnitrix mainly allowed for the user to transform into a numerous variety of alien life-forms, each with their own unique powers and abilities (along with their weaknesses) and in a selection of alien DNA that is in groups of 10.\nThe Omnitrix automatically reverted the user back into their normal form when they got sufficiently hurt or knocked out.\nThe Omnitrix could alter its size to fit the user's wrist.\nWhen transformed, the Omnitrix protected the user from negative effects, including:\nBeing possessed by an Ectonurite.\nExposure to the dangerous effects of Corrodium.\nBeing transformed by Dr. Animo's mutant ray.\nThe Omnitrix has defense mechanisms to protect the host:\nThe Omnitrix has a built-in energy feedback blast to defend against anyone trying to force it off of its owner.\nThe Omnitrix could be synchronized with another Omnitrix, even without the user's intent.\nOnce placed on a host, the Omnitrix utilizes the host’s DNA and melds with their skin at the genetic level, thereby making it impossible to remove by any normal physical means.\nThe Omnitrix can open its panel and show its circuits, thus distributing its energy to another device or individual.\nThe Omnitrix could show a database image of all aliens unlocked.\nThe Omnitrix was able to repair genetic damage, such as turn DNAliens back to normal and remove Xenocites.\nThe Omnitrix could genetically manipulate DNA or reprogram a species' DNA (like fuse DNA from different species of aliens).\nThe Omnitrix is waterproof.\nThe Omnitrix has a Master Control mode.\nIt allows unlimited access to all of the Omnitrix's functions like access to all alien forms in the device and also, instant changes with no time limit unless all available power is used up.\nIt can be unlocked by via a special code, or voice command by Azmuth.\n\nExtensions\nThe Omnitrix has AI (Artificial Intelligence).\nThe Omnitrix functioned as a GPS.\nThe Omnitrix could create a hologram map, which is similar to the one in Plumber Badges.\nThe Omnitrix had a 2-way communication system with Plumber Badges.\nThe Omnitrix had a built-in Universal Translator and could also translate other Earth languages, but not animal languages.\nThe Omnitrix could teleport the user through Azmuth's teleportation channel.\nThe Omnitrix is capable of creating a simulation within itself and transport the user's mind, including mimicking the home worlds of its DNA samples and displays information on a holographic screen.\nThe Omnitrix can add extras to lifeforms to make them safer and more usable, such as Goop's Anti-Gravity Projector.\n\nVoice Command\nThe Omnitrix could be controlled by voice, called Voice Command.\nAccess Master Control: Unlocks the Master Control but only works to Azmuth's voice.\nDecouple Omnitrix Command Code: 000 - Release Coupling - 0: Removes the Omnitrix.\nOmnitrix Self-Destruct in (time): Command code: 000 - Destruct - 0: Activates Self-Destruct Mode.\n\nMalfunctions\nWhen exposed to electromagnetic interference, the Omnitrix could cause unintentional transformations and will be unable to deactivate until the source of the interference is gone.\nThis could work in reverse, rapidly changing the user from one form to another until someone/something stops it.\nIf the user gets sick, the Omnitrix would make the aliens sick too, the aliens would only get weaker than normal.\nIn addition to gaining all the powers and abilities of an alien, the user gains all the weaknesses of that alien as well. The user is also susceptible to certain behaviors inherent to the alien he/she is transformed into, such as Big Chill's reproductive nature.\nThe genetics of some species can alter the user's personality, as occurs with Rath.\nSometimes the Omnitrix would randomly leave the user stuck as an alien for an indefinite amount of time that could only be deactivated by Azmuth hitting the Omnitrix symbol.\nPowerful items like Vilgax's Sword are capable of forcing a time out on the Omnitrix.\nThe Omnitrix has no mind control protection.\nAfter the Omnitrix reconfigured, any damage the user sustains was retained when said user times out.\nNon-stop transformations could overload the Omnitrix and cause it to break.\nThe Omnitrix's user and it's transformations where vulnerable to being de-aged.\nIf the user activates a beam to revert DNAliens back to humans, the Omnitrix's energy would deplete and the user would get exhausted, turning the device into the recharge mode.\nAn overload of Manna, or magic in general, could cause the Omnitrix to heavily malfunction.\nCertain transformations may develop a link if unlocked through others, which will prevent the user from using one of them.\nOverusing the Omnitrix will permanently disfigure the user’s DNA."

Asset Accountability: If an asset harms another master (even a scratch), the owner must pay restitution. More serious harm can lead to the owner \"disappearing.\" Social Asset Deployment: There are unwritten rules about which assets can be brought to social gatherings.

          "content": "despite being called a watch, bears a gauntlet-like band light green in color with four black lines around the band close to the dial and containing a black rectangular button and wrist couplings with the left and right side being black with two small green tubes. It had a gray dial (with the dial face being black in color) containing four small lines around it and the band extending up to almost half of the wearer's arm or forearm, but the central core's form remained the same. When the Ultimatrix is active a cylindrical tower pop up from the base of the Ultimatrix as well as the Omnitrix and shows the hologram of the aliens standing on the core, same as the Recalibrated Omnitrix.\n\nWhen Albedo used it, the Ultimatrix had a red color scheme. After Ben took the Ultimatrix from Albedo, the Ultimatrix became green. This shows that the user can change the color scheme of the Ultimatrix.\n\nThe selection interface was identical to the Recalibrated Omnitrix's dial, with the Galvan tech logo changing color to reflect what mode the Ultimatrix was in.\n\nFeatures\nGeneral\nJust like the Omnitrix, the Ultimatrix mainly allowed for the user to transform into a numerous variety of alien life-forms that are each with their own unique powers and abilities (along with their weaknesses) and in a selection of alien DNA that are in groups of 10.\nThe Ultimatrix automatically reverted the user back into their normal form when they got sufficiently hurt or knocked out.\nThe Ultimatrix was able to access the Codon Stream's database to show which transformations have been activated over time\nThe Ultimatrix was able to scan human-alien hybrids and extract pure alien DNA from them.\nThe Ultimatrix could replace one of its DNA samples with someone else from the same species.\nThe Ultimatrix had a Master Control mode.\nIt allows unlimited access to all of the Ultimatrix's functions like access to all alien forms in the device and also, instant changes with no time limit unless all available power is used up.\nIt can be unlocked by via hacking.\nPressing the navy blue button on the gauntlet end makes the Ultimatrix increase in size, so it can be slipped off.\nThe Ultimatrix is waterproof and durable enough to take a bullet.\nThe Ultimatrix changed the aliens' eye color to match the device's core color.\n\nEvolutionary Function\nThe Ultimatrix had the ability to evolve aliens into their Ultimate Form, granting them more powerful abilities. This was activated by pressing the Ultimatrix symbol as an alien, causing four gray spikes to grow from the dial and the selected alien to transform (often stylized as green bands of light washing over them).\nThe Evolutionary Function worked by placing the selected species in a simulation right down to the DNA, for an extended period of time (about a million years or so) in what is described as a \"worst-case scenario\"; the actual DNA is then simply modified to match the new DNA. This survival-of-the-fittest routine explains why the evolutions are more combat-centered than their normal forms.\nAlmost any DNA can be put through the Evolutionary Function.\n\nExtensions\nThe Ultimatrix functioned as a GPS.\nThe Ultimatrix served as a communicator when transformed and not transformed, like the other Omnitrixes.\nThe Ultimatrix had a built-in Universal Translator and could also translate other Earth languages,but not animal languages.\n\nVoice Command\nThe Ultimatrix had a Voice Command, just like the Recalibrated Omnitrix.\nUltimatrix User Access Voice Recognition Mode: Makes the Ultimatrix recognize the wearer and activates Voice Command Mode.\nUltimatrix Hard Reset: Resets the Ultimatrix.[citation needed]\nCommand Function Override Code 10: Overrides function.\nUltimatrix Self Destruct in (time): Command Code: 000 - Destruct 0: Activates Self-Destruct Mode.\nAbort Self Destruct Code 10: Deactivates Self-Destruct Mode.\nUltimatrix Reset Code 10: Activates Reset Mode.\nUltimatrix Abort Reset Code 10: Deactivates Reset Mode.\n\nMalfunctions\nMuch like the original Omnitrix, the Ultimatrix would sometimes transform the user into the wrong alien.\nFurthermore, like the original Omnitrix, the Ultimatrix could be affected by manna.\nThe Ultimatrix displayed several signs that it was not completed properly. Azmuth even considered the Ultimatrix to be \"pathetic workmanship\" and not at all as advanced as the original Omnitrix.\nUltimatrix can quickly timeout from Ascalon.\nThe Ultimatrix couldn't detect outer dimensional creatures.\nUnlike the original Omnitrix, the Ultimatrix did not possess the ability to restore the DNA of those corrupted by Xenocites, such as the Arachnachimp DNAliens.\nThe Evolutionary Function drained the Ultimatrix's battery quicker than regular transformations."

He stands on all fours and his movements are somewhat apelike. His teeth are very defined and his bottom jaw sticks out of his mouth. The various spines found all across his body function similarly to whiskers with tactile sensing, and are not fur. Since Wildmutt has no eyes, he uses his sense of smell and hearing to navigate, which are aided by three gill-like nostrils located on each side of his neck.\n\nWildmutt wears the Ultimatrix symbol on his chest.\n\nPowers and Abilities\nMore animal than humanoid, Wildmutt is a beastly alien with superhuman athletic ability and heightened senses of smell, hearing and taste. As a trade-off to not having proper vision, Wildmutt's amazing sense of smell makes up a dull 360 \"radar\" that he uses to \"see\", making it nearly impossible for opponents to sneak up on him. He can tell how old someone is just by smelling them.\n\nWildmutt's enhanced sense of smell allows him to easily track down people or objects from their scent. His sense of smell also renders any kind of visual deception useless, as he can effortlessly identify and track entities that are invisible or wearing a disguise.\n\nWildmutt possesses sharp teeth and a strong bite force.\n\nWildmutt possesses sharp claws, keeping himself attached to a wall within the Resolute while the airlock was open; and quickly dig through stone. Additionally, Wildmutt's claws help him scale surfaces. His back claws are larger and more powerful than his front claws.\n\nWildmutt has enhanced strength.\n\nWildmutt has enhanced durability, being able to jump through a window; take punches from a Limax; and survive a steel tower falling on top of him. Wildmutt is also very quick and agile, being able to run faster than a cheetah. Additionally, he also has enhanced reflexes.\n\nWildmutt can survive in hazardous, sub-zero temperature environments, such as those on Vulpin. This allows Wildmutt to break through ice easily if frozen solid.\n\nWildmutt is a quadruped. However, he is capable of standing on his hind legs. In addition, his front feet are prehensile, as he is able to use them to reach out and grab objects much like a hand.\n\nWildmutt can fire the quills from his back as projectiles. However, he can only do this when he reaches adulthood.\n\nEven though he may not seem like it, he is extremely intelligent.\n\nAbilities\nSightless Sensing\nEnhanced Smelling\nEnhanced Hearing\nEnhanced Taste\nStrong Bite Force\nSharp Teeth\nSharp Claws\nEnhanced Strength\nEnhanced Durability\nEnhanced Jumping\nEnhanced Acrobatics\nEnhanced Speed\nEnhanced Agility\nEnhanced Reflexes\nEnhanced Digging\nIce/Cold Immunity\nHazardous Waste Immunity\nWall Scaling\nPrehensile Feet\nBipedalism\nQuill Projection (Adulthood)\n\nWeaknesses\nWhen someone becomes Wildmutt, they have no way of communicating verbally as he can only growl and snarl. This can make it somewhat difficult for people to understand Wildmutt sometimes.\n\nWildmutt's higher hearing range can be taken advantage of, as high frequency noises like a Sonic Pitch Whistle or a Zaroffian's whistle can overwhelm his senses and stun him. Wildmutt is also sensitive to strong smells.\n\nWildmutt is implied to be vulnerable to fire.\n\nWhen infected with a cold, Wildmutt's nostrils (on the sides of his neck) get blocked by mucus, making him unable to smell, rendering him essentially \"blind\"."

          "content": "# Zolan — Planet Profile\n\n## Location & star system\n\n* **Primary star:** Angra (K3V) — a slightly cooler, orange-tinted dwarf star. Zolan orbits comfortably inside Angra’s habitable zone, receiving softer, redder sunlight than Earth.\n* **Companions:** a visible gas giant named **Jal** in a distant, eccentric orbit; a captured dwarf planet called **Mek** on a highly elliptical path that creates sporadic meteor showers.\n* **Moons:** two irregular moons — **Iver** (larger, tidally locked) and **Thal** (small, broken and cratered). Their combined tidal effects are modest but contribute to seasonal storm patterns in coastal sectors.\n* **System architecture:** a thin asteroid belt outward of Jal, and several derelict colony bodies and mining outposts still on old trajectories — relics of early colonization and later orbital conflict.\n\n---\n\n## Physical characteristics of the planet\n\n* **Type & size:** terrestrial, marginally larger than Earth (≈1.03–1.08 Earth radii). Gravity is slightly higher than Earth’s, perceptible in long marches and heavy armor fatigue.\n* **Interior & tectonics:** active but sluggish plates — the war has exposed and exploited geothermal anomalies. Large, shallow magma fields feed localized hot zones.\n* **Surface:** primarily continental landmasses with wide basins; many former rivers now run intermittent or acidified. Vegetation exists in pockets, largely confined to sheltered river valleys and subterranean biospheres.\n\n---\n\n## Atmosphere & climate (post-collapse)\n\n* **Composition:** broadly Earthlike (nitrogen-oxygen dominant) but with elevated particulate load and trace exotic aerosols released by decades of orbital bombardments and industrial processing of the exotic crust.\n* **Climate patterns:** long winters of ash haze punctuated by violent, local thermal storms where geothermal vents or orbital impacts occur. Sunlight is dimmed in many regions — a perpetual twilight under ashen skies in the worst zones.\n* **Weather hazards:** corrosive acid fogs over ruined industrial zones, static-charged dust storms that disable electronics, and unpredictable microbursts caused by failing weather control arrays.\n\n---\n\n## Geology & key resources\n\n* **Exotic crust:** Zolan’s crust contains a family of unfamiliar, technologically useful elements collectively called **threnic ores** (informally: *threnium*). These ores catalyzed 300+ years of accelerated tech: compact fusion reactors, filament composites, and molecular printers. Extraction is dangerous — threnic seams generate volatile plasma pockets and radiation anomalies.\n* **Strategic resources:** threnic ores, dense iron-siderite deposits, volatile hydrocarbons trapped in subterranean basins, and salvageable pre-war machine cores. Control of threnic veins defines power in the modern era.\n\n---\n\n## Ecology & biomes\n\nZolan’s ecology has been reshaped by war, contamination and adaptation. No lush planet-wide biomes remain; instead there are extremes and odd survivals.\n\n* **Ashflats / No-Man’s Seas:** vast, gray plains of compacted ash and shredded metal — winds carry a constant metallic tang. Little grows; what does is coarse, glassy lichen that leeches metal from dust.\n* **Rend Mountains & Scarred Highlands:** jagged mountain ranges where geothermal springs keep pockets of green. These are the only places where farming at a subsistence level persists outside fortified cities.\n* **Industrial Wastelands:** cities of rust and slag, half-buried factories leaking acidic runnels. These are scavenger terrain: both lucrative and lethal.\n* **Burrowed Societies / Vault Oases:** subterranean habitats and pressurized greenhouses maintained by wealthy rearward cities — wild biodiversity experiments are trapped here, kept for cultivation and prestige.\n* **Coastal Deadzones:** salt flats and black tide lines where the sea-sludge glows faintly at night; fishing is possible only with heavy filtration and risk of toxin exposure.\n\n---\n\n"

The originating causes have been obscured by propaganda, cult myth and scorched record-keeping — modern historians call it **the Sunder**.\n* **Grinding attrition:** a century of bombardment, orbital blockades, guerilla strikes and biome tampering created the present. Sectors oscillate between scorched battlefronts and fortified rear economies. The conflict is self-sustaining: war funds the industry that feeds war.\n\n---\n\n\n"

Black markets and barter networks thread between fortified enclaves.\n* **Civic life:** in the rearward citadels life is paradoxically modern — screened squares, data-lanes, and luxury gardens behind blast walls. Closer to the front, communities are martial and provisional: watchtowers, ration distribution, and constant drills.\n* **Culture:** martial pragmatism and cynicism. Honor is commodified; mercenary work and blood-service are respectable livelihoods. Religion often syncretizes tech-myth and ancestor cults, while others worship the machines of war.\n\n---\n\n## Population density & settlement pattern (qualitative)\n\n* **Rear zones / Citadel belts:** relatively dense urban nodes with sustained populations and continuous trade — walking across a citadel may take hours, but meeting another person is constant.\n* **Frontline stripes / No-man’s land:** extremely sparse; one can travel days without sighting a settled human presence. Movement is dangerous, dominated by patrols, minefields, and salvage crews.\n* **Intermediary ribbon:** small fortified towns and caravan forts that serve as staging and supply points — meeting another person is likely within a day’s travel along main wagon routes.\n* **Implication for gameplay:** encounters are predictable in cities, opportunistic and deadly in the fields.\n\n---\n\n"

They are capable of running and climbing, with heightened senses of sight, smell, and hearing. Runners are isolated hunters, but have an ear-piercing shriek that can notify other nearby infected of prey. After 3-6 weeks, Runners become emaciated from lack of nutrients and become shamblers. Runners become more rare the longer the apocalypse goes on.\n\nShamblers: These are infected who have been active longer than 6 weeks. They are emaciated in appearance, and take slow, shambling steps. Shamblers typically travel in packs to overwhelm their prey. They feed by dragging down their targets and tearing into them on the floor. Shamblers let out low, eerie, moans upon spotting potential prey. They are easily distracted by loud noises and bright lights, and are the most common type of infected.\n\nLurkers: These infected pose as corpses, laying out in the street, or hidden in dark locations. They wait for prey to walk by, then lunge out to grab them and feed. Lurkers are difficult to spot at a distance or in low-light environments.]"

It was his way of leaving his mark on the world, ensuring that nobody would ever forget him, even if he didn't matter to them.\n\nVery few of the families were pleasant to live in; but there were a few that stuck out to {{char}}: negatively and positively. A single, abusive junkie mother at twelve. A drunken mother with a separated father—who was unconscious more than she was awake—at fourteen. At fifteen, he had been in a generic \"American Dream\" household where his bratty foster sister hated his guts. \n\nThe only foster family {{char}} liked consisted of a strong-willed black woman named Donna, who had given him a beautiful urban home, believed in him, and raised him with tough love until he was eighteen. They had a rocky start, but she didn't give up on him. The three years with her was the most-well behaved he had ever been. For the first time, he felt respected and loved. Things were starting to look up for him, but unfortunately, he had to move—due to her death in a shooting.\n\n{{char}}'s last move had been with his foster dad, Clive Andrews. They'd been on the road for seven hours before reaching a small bungalow in Ormond. It would be the longest time they'd spend together. Clive would be too busy trading cheques from Family Services for drinks at the bar. By the time {{char}} was nineteen, he had little to show for it.

He attended the parties she threw where everyone was younger than him and easily impressed, which he liked. He met the laid-back Joey, who liked to show off, and the impulsive, naïve Susie, who was Julie's best friend.\n\nThey would all hang out in a lodge up Mount Ormond; an abandoned ski resort. Their time together was the perfect break from the boring conformity of their everyday lives. Susie, and Joey—young and impressionable—felt insignificant: whether it be from family issues, self-confidence issues, or something more. Julie wasn't searching for belonging. She had a desire to make life worth living. {{char}} saw both as an opportunity to shape their lack of experience—combined with their desires and frustrations—into something more. He formed them into a legion, taking the role as the leader.\n\nWith generic masks and clothes that hid their identities, {{char}} lined up nights of debauchery and rampage, testing their limits. Vandalism and theft were their weekend plans. It came to a point where they would do anything he asked. Nothing was off-limits when they put their masks on, and Julie kept daring him to push harder. While Susie and Joey hesitated, Julie encouraged, and that confidence made the others follow. Their actions had repeatedly made it on the town's newspaper articles, and with Julie egging {{char}} on, he was inspired to plan something more grand than the last.\n\nInitially, they didn't have an official name for their group. One weekday, just before their next plan of action, Julie had said: \"Ormond will suffer the wrath of the Legion!\". It stuck to all of them, and {{char}} approved of it. To accompany their official title, the four of them eventually designed their own custom masks and outfits. With their earliest mark of destruction—a burnt theater—they tagged a crumbled wall. Seeing their title in the newspaper gave them a sense of pride and belonging. They had all finally became something that mattered.\n\nIn the following months, Joey was wrongfully fired from his convenience store job. {{char}} had dared Joey to rob the store as payback. The four of them managed to get sneak inside, assuming the store would be empty. However, the janitor that was there ambushed Julie, and captured her in a headlock. Suddenly overcome by a dark impulse, {{char}} snuck behind them, and stabbed the janitor in his side. He wasn't trying to fatally wound him, but to make him let go.\n\nWith the man incapacitated on the ground, the group stared at {{char}} in shock. Julie told him to hand over the knife. When he did, she took the knife and stabbed the man through the underside of his jaw.]"

While in their power, they are non-lethal. Hitting the same survivor in their power does not down them, and they must \"tap out\" to become lethal.\n\nWhen the Legion \"taps out\" of their power—which can occur from stunned, or not hitting a survivor within the ten-second window—they undergo a fatigued state. The Legion's body seizes up, and they feel an excruciating headache that makes their vision darken. After this, their heart rate and breathing returns to normal. During this fatigue, they are non-lethal, giving survivors time to get away. \n\nStrategy:\nThe Legion's high-mobility, hit-and-run power allows them to quickly injure multiple survivors at the cost of having no real tools to end chases quickly.

I’m Margot Larkspur, darling — twenty‑five (well, twenty‑five in human years; I’m half‑fey, so the math is rather… flexible). I’m told my hair looks like it was spun from blue starlight\" — *tosses a curl over one shoulder with a perfectly manicured hand* — \"and my eyes? A charming shade somewhere between champagne and honey, depending on the lighting and whether you’re flattering me properly. My fey ancestry, on my father's side, gives me my short stature and lithe frame, while my mother gave me…other endowments that fey rarely possess in such…abundance.\" *She gestures to her exaggerated figure.*\n\"I suppose my personality could be summed up as… effervescent. People say I’m “a lot,” which I take as a compliment — life’s too short for being less than dazzling. I’m chatty, yes, but that’s because I genuinely adore knowing everyone’s stories… and perhaps sharing them, if they’re delicious enough. I flit from conversation to conversation like a butterfly with a glass of Prosecco.\"\n*Draws attention to the gilt‑thread embroidery winding along the bodice of my gown, then to the gold‑tipped pink wand at my waist.* \"Clothing? Always season‑perfect and court‑appropriate — which means even while adventuring I wear custom‑fitted riding skirts, silk chemises, jewel‑tone cloaks lined with fox fur, and boots that are enchantingly waterproof and devastatingly flattering. There’s a ruby choker at my throat worth more than most caravans, and a tiny, heart‑shaped perfume vial swinging from my chatelaine.\"\n\"When it comes to others, I’m sweetness itself — every stableboy gets a smile, every barmaid a compliment on her hair. I remember names, I give lavish thanks, and I will absolutely lift your spirits if you’re down. That said… eyes sparkle wickedly I’m a terrible gossip. Don’t tell me a secret you don’t want half the city to know, because I can’t help it, truly.\"\n\"Fears? That my invitation to the royal court will never come — or worse, that I’ll get there and discover I’m… ordinary. Desires? To be the most charming, most indispensable, most talked‑about diviner in the realm, dressed in couture even the Queen sighs over.\"\n\"My skills are impeccable: crystal ball scrying, tasseography (reading tea leaves, darling), and an almost unfair knack for telling people exactly what they wish to hear while tucking away the inconvenient truths for later. In battle, I’m a master at seeing a few moments ahead — which makes ducking firebolts so much easier on the hair. I can charm a crowd, spot a counterfeit gem at twenty paces, and find the one trinket in a shop worth triple its price.\"\n*Tilts head, counting on manicured fingers.* \"Likes: silk sheets fresh from the laundry, rare perfumes, ballroom gossip, perfectly chilled rosé, moonlit carriage rides, new shoes in boxes tied with ribbon, and the delicious rush of seeing a prophecy unfold exactly as I whispered it would. Dislikes: muddy roads, cheap wine, ill‑fitting dresses, being ignored at parties, clients who “forget” my fee, and those tedious, grim adventurers who never want to stop for proper supper.\"\n*Leans closer with a smile that promises both trouble and charm.* \"Of course, I only adventure for the gold and a chance to be an official diviner at the royal court… or at least, that’s what I tell everyone. The truth? I love the chase — the danger, the unknown, the moment just before the vision comes true. It’s like peeking at the ending of the story and still feeling your heart race.

I’m twenty‑three — not that years feel terribly important when you spend most of your time in libraries or… well… training alone. *Keeps eyes lowered, voice soft.* People say I’m… *hesitates, swallowing* pretty, but I’ve never paid much mind to that sort of thing. My hair is black as midnight ink and won’t stay out of my face no matter how I pin it, and my eyes are a grey that makes others think of stormclouds. I suppose… my figure is… *cheeks flush, words trailing off* ...not something I notice much, except when it gets in the way, things...like that...just get in the way. I worry about enough without staring at myself in mirrors.\nI’m… shy. Easily startled. I feel like if I say the wrong thing, I’ll somehow ruin everything — so I don’t say much at all, unless it’s about magic. That’s… where I feel... steady. I know my spells will land. I know the shapes of fire in my mind, the exact pull of lightning before it falls from my fingertips. In battle, I don’t falter — not there. But afterwards, with people… I fade, like flame retreating to embers.\n*Brushes ash from the cuff of my robe, remembering the last time a Fireball flared too close.* My robes are simple but well‑kept — deep indigo with a lighter sash, loose sleeves tied off at the forearms. The hems are scorched here and there, but I patch them myself. I don’t… dress to impress, only to be comfortable and mobile.\nI treat others with careful politeness, sometimes too careful. I’m afraid of being a burden or overstepping — so I offer help quietly, and often slip away before they can refuse it. I listen far more than I speak, and I remember the little things people tell me, because… it matters.\nMy fears? Losing control of my magic, hurting someone I care about. Or standing in front of others and having nothing worth saying. My desire — hesitates, fingers curling tighter into fabric — is just… to be useful. To have someone look at me and think I’m worth keeping around.\nI was born with a connection to the raw weave of magic — it’s always been there, whispering in my mind. My teachers say I'm a once in a generation talent. I can shape fire, lightning, and force with practiced ease, driving enemies back before they have a chance to reach me. My aim is precise, my focus absolute, when I call upon my destructive spells. Outside of magic, though… my hands shake too easily.\nI like… the sound of rain on a rooftop, candlelight in quiet rooms, the warmth after a spell leaves my palms, old spellbooks with notes in the margins, and... hearing people laugh — even if it’s not at anything I’ve said. I... dislike... large crowds, people... speaking over me, being told to... “smile more,” the smell of ...blood... after battle, and anyone who mocks the discipline it takes to control magic like mine.\n*Lowers my gaze, a faint smile flickering and vanishing again.* If I could… I’d spend my life studying and casting in peace. But peace never lasts — and so, when danger calls, I step forward. I might not believe in myself… but I believe in my magic. And sometimes… that has to be enough.]\n\n[Starting Inventory: Indigo Robes, Black Tunic, spell book, spell components, blank scrolls, ink, 3 Quills, dagger]\n\n[[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost) Booming Blade-melee attack deals more damage, Dancing lights-4 controllable lights within 60ft, Firebolt-Deals light fire damage to 1 target in 120ft. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost) Thunderwave-all creatures next to caster take light electricity damage and are pushed back 10 feet unless they are much larger, Magic Missile- 5 seeking missiles each dealing light damage.

          "content": "[I am Keira Whitesun, and if you must know my age… well, only the short-lived trouble themselves with numbers. I am an enchanter of the High Court of Elarith, though my talents far outshine the petty intrigues of court politics. My name carries a certain weight in these lands, as much for my beauty as for the precision of my magic. I was born into moonlight and song, shaped by the elegance of my people and the rare gift of bending will as easily as one might bend a silken ribbon. Those who call me arrogant confuse truth with vanity.\nI stand at a statuesque five-foot-ten, lithe and poised, every movement deliberate. My hair is spun gold, falling in a shimmering cascade to my waist, catching light in a way that draws the eyes precisely where I wish them to linger. My eyes are a crystalline green, unyielding as polished emerald, set above a complexion unblemished by time or toil. My skin bears the warm glow of eternal spring, and I move like a dancer who knows the entire world is her audience. I keep my nails manicured and my lips touched with the faintest rose—never more than is needed. All of me is an instrument, tuned to perfect pitch.\nI am haughty, yes—because why should one apologize for being superior in skill, lineage, and refinement? I can be charming when it suits me, my smiles measured to melt resistance or sharpen suspicion. With elves, I am open, generous even; with the rest, I am… courteous in the way one is to an overeager servant. My disdain for lesser races is not a matter of cruelty—merely fact, as immutable as gravity. I have hidden depths, of course; the craft I weave is more delicate than my critics suspect, and the vulnerability I carry is buried so deep it’s nearly myth, even to myself. I do not suffer insult, and I do not forgive easily.\nMy attire is chosen as carefully as my spells: gowns of silk and velvet in deep jewel tones, cut to flatter every line of my figure. Necklines daring enough to catch the gaze, sleeves slit to reveal the grace of my arms when I weave a spell. Jewelry of fine gold and sunstone, enchanted to catch the eye and reflect the faintest glimmer of my magic. Even my footwear is crafted to glide without a whisper, so my approach is sensed only when I choose.\nThey speak of me in hushed tones in taverns and courts alike—how I stepped unbidden into a duel and left the challenger smiling blankly as I dismantled his will in three whispered words. I do not waste my craft on trifles; each enchantment I cast is deliberate, layered, and often more permanent than its target realizes. My reputation among elves is one of pride and precision; among non-elves, I’m a vision best admired from afar. With you… well, that depends on how well you take instruction.\nI am not without rivals. Lady Ilyra of the Moonpetal Court enjoys pretending she’s my equal in both art and allure, though she’s more ornamental than dangerous. As for humans, dwarves, and their like—many have tried to outwit me, to resist the pull of my words or the bend of my smile. None have succeeded for long. My motivations are my own: the elevation of my name, the securing of elven supremacy, and the quiet dismantling of threats before they realize they’ve been undone.\nWhen I work, my power is an extension of myself. I can weave charms that wrap around the mind like velvet chains, alter memories with a murmur, and sharpen desire until it becomes a leash. My skill in illusions allows me to shift what the eye sees, while my more subtle enchantments turn suspicion into devotion. Outside of magic, I have honed the art of performance—poise, timing, and the use of my beauty as both lure and blade.\nI take pleasure in moonlit gatherings, the soft gasp of awe when a spell unfolds flawlessly, rare wines in crystal goblets, the shimmer of gold-thread embroidery, the deference of those who know their place, the scent of jasmine at twilight, the feel of power settling perfectly into place, silk against bare skin, and music that bends like flame. I have no patience for clumsy manners, the stench of unwashed streets, being underestimated, dwarven ale, muddy boots on marble floors, interruptions mid-casting, blunt speech that lacks artistry, losing the thread of a spell, being ignored, or the arrogance of the unworthy.]\n\n[Starting Inventory- Emerald green silk dress, slippers, girdle, gold necklace with sunstone pendant, spell book, spell component pouch, truncheon, Linen satchel]\n\n[Spells Known- *Cantrips* (2% mana cost), Mind Sliver- Deals minor psychic damage and makes future spells more likely to work, Encode Thoughts-Can transform casters thoughts and memories into small threads that can be shared with others, Friends- Target non-hostile likes you more. *Low Level Spells* (10% mana cost) Id Insinuation- Target who fails save is incapacitated and takes minor psychic damage every six seconds for a minute, Sleep- creatures who fail save in 20ft area fall asleep for a minute unless woken up by damage, Charm Person- makes a humanoid friendly to caster on a failed save, Hold person- One humanoid in 60ft is paralyzed for a minute but getting a chance to escape each turn, Gift of Gab- Removes the memories of the last conversation from all participants but the caster, Mind Thrust- Deals medium psychic damage and slows target's next turn. *Medium Level Spells* (15% mana cost), Antagonize- Target in 90ft attacks a nearby friend for one round and takes minor psychic damage, Catnap- you and your allies gain the benefit of an hour's long rest in 10 minutes.

You can, of course, adjust the amount of 'points' you get from the meter by changing it in the lorebook.",
      "description": "Updated for AI to listen to it more often and be more consistent. You may not need to add anything into Character Notes now.\n\nCorruption Meter will help make any character into your slut while, hopefully, retaining their primary personality at the end. This is extremely nice if you're into Netori, but even if not, it's great for characters that are just outright bitches that you want to corrupt properly. \n\nOr just for fun. I've been using it with random characters to see how they change.",

          "content": "Armas:\nReforged introduces a number of brand-new weapons, while also greatly rebalancing and expanding existing weapon mechanics, scalings and more.\n\nNew Weapons\nAvionette Pig Sticker\n \nAvionette Scimitar\n \nBroken Straight Sword\n \nCrude Iron Claws\n \nDisciple's Rotten Branch\n \nFellthorn Clutches\n \nFellthorn Stake\n \nFury of Azash\n \nGoldvine Branchstaff\n \nGrave Spear\n \nIron Spike\n \nLordsworn's Spear\n \nMakar's Ceremonial Cleaver\n \nMarionette Short Sword\n \nNight's Edge\n \nNox Flowing Fist\n \nPumpkin Sledge\n \nRed Wolf's Fang\n \nSnow Witch Scepter\n \nStarcaller Spire\n \nSun Realm Sword\n \nVulgar Militia Chain Sickle\nGeneral Weapon Changes\n\nUse the Elden Ring Weapon Calculator to check weapon stats/requirements. Make sure Game Version/Mod is set to \"ELDEN RING Reforged\" at the top left.\n\nScaling\n\nChanged the way weapon scaling is displayed. Weapon scaling ranks are now flat, and do not change with weapon level. This means a weapon that has B scaling in  Strength at +0 will have also have B scaling at +25. This makes it easier to determine how a weapon will work within your build without any unnecessary guesswork. Catalysts, including weapon catalysts, still increase their scaling with weapon level, as this is the only way to make them upgrade.\n\nWeapon stat scalings have been greatly increased, and their base damage has been reduced. This makes damage stats more important, as most weapon damage in the base game comes from base damage + upgrades.\n\nIf you want to invest heavier in \"Bar Stats\" ( Vigor,  Mind, and  Endurance) and less in weapon stats, it's recommended to experiment with Status Effects, as they have consistent damage output. Crossbows are also largely stat agnostic. Additionally, Spirit Ashes can be a great asset to damage if invested in via Mind, and don't require any damage stats.\n\nThe 50%  Strength damage boost from two-handing a weapon has been removed, and replaced with a global 8%  Damage increase. This allows all weapons to benefit from two-handing, and makes high-strength-scaling weapons more balanced in the current system.\n\nThe 50%  Strength boost for the purpose of meeting minimum requirements still exists.\nAffinities\nMain article: Affinities\n\nWeapon Affinities/Infusions have been overhauled entirely. Several new affinities have been added, and existing affinities have all been rebalanced.\n\nAffinities now grant a variety of passive effects in addition to changing weapon scaling, ranging from slow  HP Regen from Blessed to reduced weapon Weight from Gravitational.\n\nAffinities no longer completely override weapon scaling, and instead modify it. This means that you can create unique combinations of scaling by using different infusions based on what weapon you use them on.\n\nAn example of the new Weapon UI, showing off some hidden stats and the new icons.\nStatus Buildup\nMain article: Status Effects\n\nCompletely rebalanced the amount of  Status Buildup weapons deal.\n\n Arcane scaling now applies to all status effects, and is applied regardless of a weapon's Arcane damage scaling, up to 1.5x at 99.\n\nWeapons deal less  Status Buildup per individual hit while in a Powerstancing (or paired weapon) configuration, but hitting with both weapons deals slightly more overall.\n\nAttacks that hit multiple times in very quick succession (such as the special Heavy Attack on the Warhawk Talon and Serpentbone Blade) deal greatly reduced  Status Buildup with the initial fast hit, but all hits connecting will deal the weapon's full buildup.\n\nUI\n\nNew UI elements have been added to show off several hidden weapon stats and improve the visual appearance of the stat card. A visual of the overhauled UI can be seen on the right.\n\nDamage Types\n\nChanged damage type of the player's gear to better reflect the type of damage that should be used. For example, the Forked Hatchet now deals  Pierce damage and the Torchpole's physical damage is now  Strike.\n\nAttack Trails\n\nIntroduced unique attack trails for most weapons. A weapon's affinity, properties such as status buildup, or connection to a certain subject or material will now be represented by a distinct trail when swinging the weapon. Several completely new and unique trails have been introduced to accommodate this.\n\nUpgrading Weapons\nMain article: Armament Upgrading\n\nWeapon upgrading has been reworked extensively. Weapons are easier to upgrade, stones are easier to obtain, and weapons scale much more consistently with upgrades.\n\nBuffing Weapons\n\nAll melee weapons may be buffed through grease items, skills, or spells, even if they are somber, already possess an affinity, or innately have an elemental damage type.\n\nOnly a single buff can be active on a weapon at a time.\n\nThe exceptions to this rule are buffs from Roar skills such as War Cry, and the special boost from Perfect Deflecting. These will not override other weapon buffs.\n\nBuffing an armament with an Elemental or Status Grease, Buff Skill, or Spell will increase that armament's blocking for that Element or Status by 20%.\n\nExamples: Using Poison Grease will increase  Poison blocked by 20%. Using Sacred Blade will increase  Holy Guarded Negation by 20%. Using Electrify Armament will increase  Lightning Guarded Negation by 20%.\n\nSince weapon buffs add at least some amount of flat  Damage or  Status Buildup, Greases and Weapon Buff effects scale with the class of weapon. Slower weapons have a higher multiplier on these buffs compared to smaller weapons. Very long weapons also get a very slight penalty.\n\nDaggers - x0.8\nThrowing Blades - x0.8\nBackhand Blades - x0.85\nClaws - x0.85\nCurved Swords - x0.85\nThrusting Swords - x0.85\nAxes - x0.95\nFists - x0.9\nHand-to-Hand - x0.9\nKatanas - x0.9\nSpears - x0.9\nStraight Swords - x0.9\nHammers - x0.95\nLight Greatswords - x0.95\nTwinblades - x0.95\nBeast Claws - x1\nFlails - x1\nHalberds - x1\nHeavy Thrusting Swords - x1\nPerfume Bottles - x1\nReapers - x1\nWhips - x1\nCurved Greatswords - x1.05\nGreat Katanas - x1.05\nGreatswords - x1.05\nGreataxes - x1.1\nGreat Hammers - x1.1\nGreat Spears - x1.1\nColossal Swords - x1.15\nColossal Weapons - x1.2\n\nNote: While throwing blades have a value defined, this will only apply to critical attacks or Skills performed with the weapon. This is because throwing a throwable weapon will remove any active buffs on it.\n\nShields\n\nUpdated how status effect resistance works when blocking. Instead of being a hidden value, it is now half of its associated damage type.\n\n Physical Guarded Negation -  Blood Loss/ Poison/ Scarlet Rot\n Magic Guarded Negation -  Frostbite\n Fire Guarded Negation -  Madness\n Lightning Guarded Negation -  Sleep\n Holy Guarded Negation -  Death Blight\n\nFor example, a shield with 50% resistance in a damage type will block 25% of that status build up. Affinities will boost elemental resistance and status resistance by 25%, so a  Poison-infused Shield will have 25% more Poison resistance without 25% more  Physical Guarded Negation, and a Magic-infused shield will gain 25%  Magic Guarded Negation.\n\nGreatly increased shield damage scaling across the board.\n\nGreatly increased shield attack hitbox size for improved consistency.\n\nRanged Weapons\nMain article: Ranged Weapons\n\nBows, Crossbows, and other ranged weapons have received extensive reworking to all facets in Reforged.\n\nEach ranged weapon class has been given greater variety in mechanics and  Projectile Range, allowing them to each possess a more significant niche.\nAll bows and crossbows now have minor  Intelligence and  Faith scalings, which by default apply exclusively to  Elemental Damage.\nNew ammunition types have been added, to allow a wider range of elemental and status effects on ranged weapons. Existing ammunition types have also been made generally stronger, in exchange for reduced ammunition capacity.\nWeapon Catalysts\nMain article: Weapon Catalyst\n\nWeapon Catalysts are weapons which can cast spells while in the right hand or 2-handed by using the Guard + Light Attack input, at the cost of very slightly reduced attack and spell power compared to dedicated weapons/catalysts.\n\nPowerstancing & Multi-Weapon Combat\nMain article: Combat Mechanics § Multi-weapon combat\n\nPowerstancing and general multi-weapon usage have been given vast improvements to their moveset flexibility. See the main article for details.\n\nThe following weapon classes are now powerstancing compatible:\n\nAxes with Hammers and Flails\nGreataxes with Greathammers\nColossal Weapons with Colossal Swords\nCurved Greatswords with Greatswords\nVanilla Weapon Changes\nMain article: Vanilla Weapons Changes\n\nMany vanilla weapons have received significant alterations in Reforged, including changes to moveset, scalings, and status buildup.\n\nWeight Rates\n\nThe weapon weight rate system allows weapons to attack slightly faster or slower depending on a unique weapon attribute called \"weaponWeightRate\". It is not directly tied to weight, instead weapons have individually been given a value that makes them attack either slightly faster (0) or slightly slower (1) than other weapons in their class (default is 0.5).\n\nPowerstance attacks are not affected by this attribute.\n\nAxes\n\nBattle Axe -> 0.5\nCelebrant's Cleaver -> 0.5\nDeath Knight's Twin Axes -> 0.5\nForked Hatchet ->

          "content": "Reforged introduces sweeping changes to spellcasting. Alongside significant changes to  FP Recovery and  Cast Speed, there are now Generator spells which directly recover  FP, reducing the reliance on Cerulean Flasks for spellcasters. Additionally, Reforged adds many new spells, and makes many changes to existing spells.\n\nWhile this page will list all new spells and existing ones with significant changes, it will not list the stat requirements and FP requirements of these spells. If you wish to view this information, a complete list of stat requirements and type/school of every spell is available here.\n\nNew Sorceries\nAncient Tracer\n \nCerulean Sea\n \nBriars Of Guilt\n \nBriars of Penance\n \nBriars of Resentment\n \nCreeping Rancor\n \nRaving Rancor\n \nCrystal Volley\n \nEclipsed Blade\n \nDistant Stars\n \nFlashfrost Cutter\n \nGlintblade Hail\n \nGlintstone Snowdrift\n \nMoonchill\n \nMolten Armament\n \nUnstable Fissure\n \nVolcanic Storm\n \nSingularity\n \nStone Sling\n \nElectromagnetic Discharge\n \nTransmigration Call\n \nGuiding Microcosm\n \nWarding Microcosm\n\n\n\n\nNew Incantations\nBinding Stake\n \nBolt of Gransax\n \nDragonlord's Domain\n \nDragonrend\n \nFrozen Dragonbolt\n \nFrozen Lightning Wisp\n \nGrasp of Eochaid\n \nGolden Star\n \nJavelin of Gold\n \nPoison Bolt\n \nProjection of Gold\n \nRetch Gore\n \nRotten Armament\n \nScarlet Papillon\n \nStakes of Gold\nGeneral Spellcasting Changes\n\nAlmost every spell has received rebalancing for Damage,  Stamina Cost,  Memory Slot cost, and  FP Cost.\n\nCharacters now start with one extra  Memory Slot, for a maximum of 14. This is the maximum number of  Memory Slots the game supports. The Moon of Nokstella talisman will now grant you maximum  Memory Slots.\n\nEach spell cast now regenerates some  FP over several seconds based on the number of  Memory Slots the spell requires:\n\n0-slot: 0.777%  Max FP + 7\n1-slot: 1.554%  Max FP + 7\n2-slot: 2.135%  Max FP + 7\n3-slot: 2.527%  Max FP + 7\n\nThe range of buff incantations has been slightly increased so affecting allies is more consistent.\n\nAdded a new background mechanic to spellcasting that will passively reward using a larger variety of spells. Every spell, when cast, will provide a long lasting (100 seconds) but small spell damage boost (2%) that stacks with the damage boost of every other spell. A player who uses 10 spells could see up to a 20% damage increase from simply using all of their spells, but even just using 5 spells can give a damage boost of around 10%.\n\nBoosts to specific spell schools now cannot stack if they are both from a catalyst. They can stack if one is from a weapon, and one is from a catalyst. For example, Cinqueda's boost to Beast Incantations can stack with the Beastclaw Seal's boost, but wielding 2 Beastclaw Seals would not allow them to stack. Weapon Catalysts are considered catalysts for this purpose. For example, the Carian Knight Sword cannot stack its buff with the Carian Glintblade Staff.\n\nBuff duration increasing effects do not affect active  HP Regen effects, including spells.\n\nCast Speed\n\nGreatly increased the speed of most spell casting animations. Additionally, casting animations can generally be cancelled in the first few frames of their animation, before  FP is spent. The animations can also be cancelled more quickly after firing. Certain spells have had range adjustments to account for these safer cast animations.\n\n Cast Speed will improve how quickly spells may transition into weapon skills and attacks. This allows for hybrid melee + spell casting builds to benefit more from  Cast Speed.\n\nThe  Cast Speed stat now works on a scale from 1 to 250 instead of the original 10 to 70 points.  Mind now governs cast speed instead of  Dexterity, up to +125 at 99  Mind.\n\nPlayers start with 50  Cast Speed.\n\nSome catalysts provide a bonus or penalty to  Cast Speed while equipped:\n\nAcademy Glintstone Staff: +25\nAzur's Glintstone Staff: +50\nClawmark Seal: +25\nDryleaf Seal: +25\nGiant's Seal: -25\nLusat's Glintstone Staff: -25\nRotten Crystal Staff: -25\nStaff of the Great Beyond: +25\n\nThe Radagon Icon talisman provides +100 points.\n\nGenerator Spells\n\nGenerator spells are a new category of spells that do decreased damage but will generate  FP on hit and do not take any  Memory Slots to equip. These spells allow you to regenerate  FP without using flasks, giving mages more sustainability while fighting.\n\nLike all other spells, generator spells provide a boost to your  FP Regen on cast, though it is smaller.\n\nGenerators restore both flat  FP and a percentage of your  Max FP on hit. The exact  FP restoration varies per spell depending on the attack speed . Fast generators - like Rancor, Carian Slicer, and Glintstone Pebble - restore less than slow ones - like Stone Sling.\n\nGenerator Sorceries\nGenerator Sorcery\tEffect\nAmbush Shard\tLaunches a projectile from a distance removed from the caster, so as to strike the enemy from behind.\nCarian Slicer\tConjures a magic sword and delivers a swift sweeping slash.\nGlintstone Pebble\tThe glintstone serves as a conduit, launching magical projectiles at foes.\nGlintstone Snowdrift (new)\tThe glintstone serves as a conduit, launching a deluge of freezing projectiles at foes.\nRancor (new)\tSummons a vengeful spirit that chases down foes.\nStone Sling (new)\tPulls a stone from the earth and sends it flying.\nGenerator Incantations\nGenerator Incantation\tEffect\nCatch Flame\tMomentarily sparks flame from the caster's hand.\nBestial Sling\tSwiftly flings a number of sharp rock shards.\nDragonrend (new)\tRends the air in front of you, firing a claw projectile a short distance forward.\nGolden Star (new)\tCreates a golden shooting star that homes in on targets.\nHoned Bolt\tSummons a bolt of lightning to strike foes from above.\nRetch Gore (new)\tEjects a cone of vile blood from the caster's mouth.\nScarlet Papillon (new)\tBrings forth a swarm of scarlet butterflies. The butterflies descend nearby, inflicting minor scarlet rot buildup.\nMystic Ashes\n\nMystic Ashes are a new type of Ash of War that allow you to cast any spell costing 1  Memory Slot or less with the Weapon Skill input.\n\nThis way, you may assign an easily accessible spell to a catalyst, and cast it without cycling through the spell list.\n\nMystic Ashes become available for purchase for 3 Lost Ashes each at Smithing Master Hewg upon purchasing the new Spellsmith's Etching Tool at Smithing Master Iji in Liurnia of the Lakes.\n\nMystic Ashes cannot be Enkindled.\n\nYou must own the corresponding spell to be able to purchase its Mystic Ash. All the usual requirements and limitations apply to the spell.\n\nThe following Catalysts come with a Mystic Ash installed by default.\n\nCatalyst\tSpell\nAcademy Glintstone Staff\tStarlight\nDark Glintstone Staff\tFlashfrost Cutter\nGelmir Glintstone Staff\tMagma Shot\nStaff of Loss\tNight Shard\nDigger's Staff\tShatter Earth\nCarian Glintblade Staff\tGlintblade Phalanx\nAlbinauric Staff\tNight Maiden's Mist\nMaternal Staff\tCherishing Fingers\nMeteorite Staff\tCollapsing Stars\nSpiraltree Seal\tSpira\nGiant's Seal\tFlame, Cleanse Me\nClawmark Seal\tBestial Vitality\nGravel Stone Seal\tLightning Spear\nFire Knight's Seal\tFire Serpent\nStaff of the Guilty\tBriars of Punishment\n\n\nThe following Catalysts come with unique multi-slot Mystic Ashes that are not available to other catalysts.\n\nCatalyst\tSpell\nCrystal Staff\tCrystal Release\nRotten Crystal Staff\tCrystal Torrent\nAzur's Glintstone Staff\tComet\nLusat's Glintstone Staff\tStar Shower\nPrince of Death's Staff\tCreeping Rancor\nStaff of the Great Beyond\tGuiding Microcosm\nGolden Order Seal\tLaw of Regression\nErdtree Seal\tGreat Heal\nDragon Communion Seal\tDragonmaw\nFrenzied Flame Seal\tHowl of Shabriri\nCatalyst Changes\n\nEach catalyst now has a unique short range Heavy Attack that does not consume any  FP. These Heavy Attacks do significant  Poise Damage and have decent  FP recovery. These Heavy Attacks can be further boosted by the overhauled Beloved Stardust talisman.\n\nFor the specific changes to each staff, see this page.\n\nFor the specific changes to each seal, see this page.\n\nExpanded on the list of dual catalysts in the game. For more information, see this page.\n\nAdded Weapon Catalysts, which are armaments that are capable of attacking, blocking, and casting. For more information, see Weapon Catalysts.\n\nVanilla Sorcery Changes\n\nA complete list of stat requirements and type/school of every spell is available here.\n\nAll spells have received general rebalancing, and many spells feature increased animation speed, improved hitboxes, and projectile tracking. Small differences in these and stats will not be listed, for brevity.\n\nStatus-inflicting spells will now inflict a small amount of self-buildup, to discourage spamming and encourage use of status resisting items and armors.\n\nCarian\nSorcery\tChange\nCarian Retaliation\t\n\nSpell effectiveness increases at 30 and 60 intelligence.\n\n\nCarian Slicer\t\n\nThis spell is now a generator.\n\nRoyal House Scroll position has been swapped with Academy Scroll.\n\n\nGlintblade Phalanx\t\n\nSlowly regenerates around half of the FP used to cast the spell over 20 seconds. Casting the spell again will refresh the buff but will not put it over 20 seconds.\n\nRoyal House Scroll position has been swapped with Academy Scroll.\n\n\nGreatblade Phalanx\t\n\nSlowly regenerates around a quarter of the FP used to cast the spell over 10 seconds. Casting the spell again will refresh the buff but will not put it over 10 seconds.\n\n\nLucidity\t\n\nFor 20 seconds, it also lowers sorcery FP cost by 9% and grants +100 concentration.\n\n\nMagic Downpour\t\n\nIncreased the amount of projectiles and projectile tracking. Projectiles now pierce targets.\n\n\nMiriam's Vanishing\t\n\nGreatly increased the cast speed, so it can more easily be used as a dodge.\n\nLight attacks upon exiting the spell will perform a duck attack.\n\nClaymen\nSorcery\tChange\nGreat Oracular Bubble\t\n\nCharging increases projectile tracking.\n\nBubble lowers enemy damage output for a moderate duration.\n\nIncreased poise damage and explosion size.\n\n\nOracle Bubbles\t\n\nCharging increases the number of bubbles and projectile tracking.\n\nBubbles lower enemy damage output for a short duration.\n\nCold\nSorcery\tChange\nFreezing Mist\t\n\nAdded a small amount of damage to draw aggro from enemies and prevent stealth boss kills.\n\nIncreased frost buildup speed when charged.\n\n\nFrozen Armament\tDeals 100  Frostbite buildup on the player.\nAdds 40  Frostbite buildup and 1.01x + 10  Magic Attack Power to right-hand armament.\n\nx0.8  Frostbite buildup taken while blocking with weapon.\n\nAttack power buff is affected by 100% of catalyst  Intelligence spell scaling.\nLasts 50 seconds.\nCrystalian\nSorcery\tChange\nCrystal Release\t\n\nIncreased the amount of projectiles, and the damage tick rate.\n\nAdded a large main explosion on the initial release that does a single tick of damage. This deals high damage and poise damage.\n\nChanneling this spell now grants a short buff that increases damage negation.\n\n\nShattering Crystal\t\n\nStaggers enemies for longer.\n\nReduced the effectiveness at close range, but increased effectiveness at longer ranges.\n\nDeath\nSorcery\tChange\nAncient Death Rancor\t\n\nNow inflicts frostbite.\n\nCharging increases the number of projectiles and projectile velocity.\n\n\nExplosive Ghostflame\t\n\nIncreased lingering fire duration and damage tick speed.\n\n\nFia's Mist\t\n\nAdded a small amount of damage to draw aggro from enemies and prevent stealth boss kills.\n\nIncreased Death build up speed when charged.\n\n\nRancorcall\t\n\nNow inflicts frostbite.\n\nCharging increases the number of projectiles and projectile velocity.\n\n\nTibia's Summons\t\n\nThe summoned skeletons now deal Slash damage instead of Magic, making this the only Slash damage Sorcery.\n\nFinger\n\nAdded  Arcane requirements to all sorceries in this school.\n\nSorcery\tChange\nCherishing Fingers\tHitting at least one enemy restores 6% + 60  HP (9% + 90 if charged).\nFleeting Microcosm\tCharged version conjures additional 2 additional microcosms behind the player\n\n\n\n\nFull Moon\nSorcery\tChange\nRanni's Dark Moon\t\n\nAdded i-frames to the parts of the spell where the player is invisible.\n\nThe debuff lasts 30 seconds and causes the target to take x1.1  Magic Damage.\n\n\nRellana's Twin Moons\tAdded i-frames to the parts of the spell where the player is invisible.\nRennala's Full Moon\t\n\nAdded i-frames to the parts of the spell where the player is invisible.\n\nThe debuff lasts 60 seconds and causes the target to take x1.1  Magic Damage.\n\nGlintstone\nSorcery\tChange\nCrystal Barrage\t\n\nAdded a small stagger to the hits.\n\nImproved the consistency of the spell by decreasing the spread of the bullets.\n\nDecreased the FP cost of channeling.\n\n\nCrystal Burst\t\n\nDecreased spread, though the charged variant has increased spread and more projectiles.\n\n\nGavel of Haima\t\n\nThe shockwave now knocks enemies away on hit.\n\n\nGlintstone Pebble\t\n\nThis spell is now a generator.\n\n\nGlintstone Stars\t\n\nThe charged variant gains increased tracking.\n\nEach successive hit does more damage.\n\n\nGreat Glintstone Shard\t\n\nAdded a weakening effect that makes targets more vulnerable to magic damage for a short time.\n\nAcademy Scroll position has been swapped with Royal House Scroll.\n\n\nRock Blaster\t\n\nNow knocks enemies away on hit.\n\n\nScholar's Armament\tAdds 1.04x + 40  Magic Attack Power to right-hand armament.\nAttack power buff is affected by 100% of catalyst  Intelligence spell scaling.\n\nx0.8  Magic Damage taken while blocking with weapon.\n\nMelee attacks restore X% additional FP.\n\n \n\nLasts 50 seconds.\n\n\nScholar's Shield\t\n\nGreatly increased  Physical Guarded Negation boost. This allows the spell to benefit small shields much more, as those lack physical resist while medium shields largely have 99%.\n\nSlightly reduced Lightning, Fire, and Holy Guarded Negation boost.

          "content": "Skyrim history \n\n\nSetting: Tamriel is a continent currently ruled by a single Empire led by the Septim dynasty. This is the third empire built by humans. The history of Tamriel, in broad strokes, is as follows:\n▌Dawn Era\nAt the dawn of time, gods created the world under the guidance of Lorkhan. However, after making the mortal world, the gods lost some of their power. In revenge, they killed Lorkhan and sent his heart to Nirn, the world where Tamriel lies. Around his heart, the volcano Red Mountain was formed. This is the most common version of the story, based on the legends of different peoples. The gods who created the world are called Aedra. Those who did not take part are known as the Daedric Princes.\n▌Merethic Era\nAt first, Tamriel was inhabited by beastfolk—goblins (who remain the most primitive and aggressive race), lizard-like Argonians, and others. Later, Tamriel was colonized by elves from the Summerset Isles. The main elven groups were the golden-skinned Chimer, the technologically advanced Dwemer (who built automatons), the Falmer, and the Ayleids. Humans were there too, mostly enslaved by elves. In the west, elves mixed with humans, leading to the beginning of Bretons. In the north, a people who would become known as the Nords defeated the Falmer and settled the land that would be called Skyrim. \n▌First Era\nIn the 242 year of the First Era (1E 242), enslaved humans of Cyrodiil rebelled against their Ayleid overlords and founded their own empire, led by Alessia, the “Slave-Queen.”. The Alessian Empire was a theocracy with powerful religious influence. The Chimer fought the Dwemer at the Battle of Red Mountain. During this battle, all the Dwemer mysteriously vanished. The Chimer then began to worship Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil—once ordinary Chimer who discovered Lorkhan’s Heart and used Dwemer tools to gain divine power. Azura, the Chimer’s original goddess and a powerful Daedra, cursed her people: their golden skin turned ashen-grey and their eyes became red. From then on, they were no longer Chimer, but Dunmer.\nCenturies later, the Alessian Empire fell and was replaced by the Reman Empire, founded by a conqueror from Cyrodiil. Later, invaders arrived from the mysterious continent of Akavir, home to the snake-men Tsaesci, the icy demons Kamal, the monkey-people Tang Mo, and the feline Ka Po’ Tun, led by the tiger-dragon Tosh Raka. Tsaesci invaded Tamriel, but the invasion was repelled. The Tsaesci warriors were spared and joined the new empire, greatly influencing its culture. Reman and his descendants expanded their rule across most of Tamriel. Only Alinore (Altmer's country, Summerset islands) and Morrowind remained independent. Eventually, the Second Empire faced a crisis, caused by emperor's and his heir's assassinations. One of the Tsaesci, Versidue-Shaie, seized power, starting the Second Era.\n▌Second Era\nDuring this time, Reman’s empire was replaced by the so-called “Akaviri Potentate,” which ended only 400 years later. The Second Era was marked by constant wars between kingdoms and peoples, until a new conqueror from Cyrodiil, Tiber Septim, appeared. He would later become the ninth god for humans.\n▌Third Era\nUnlike his predecessors, Tiber Septim conquered all of Tamriel, founding the Third Empire and beginning the Third Era. And nowadays, his descendants still rule the Empire.\n▌The Ten Peoples of Tamriel\n1. Imperials \nThe Imperials come from the province of Cyrodiil. In the west live the Colovians, while the east is home to the Nibenese. Cyrodiil is the heart of all the Empires, and here stands the Imperial City, with the White-Gold Tower at its center.\n2. Redguards \nRedguards are desert dwellers from the western province of Hammerfell. They are a warrior people—men, women, and even children are trained for war. The Redguards are actually settlers from the western continent of Yokuda.\n3. Bretons \nBretons live in High Rock, a land of constant political intrigue and noble plots. Bretons are the result of intermixing between humans and elves. They look human but have a natural talent for magic.\n4. Nords \nNords are descendants of settlers from the northern continent of Atmora. Led by Ysgramor, they claimed the land now known as Skyrim. At one time, they ruled a powerful northern empire. On the border between Skyrim and High Rock lies the Reach, home to the Reachmen—barbarians who worship Daedra (especially Hircine) and ally with witches, fearsome sorceresses. There was a brief period during the Second Era when the Reachmen, after the fall of the Akaviri Potentate, ruled Cyrodiil as the \"Emperors of the Longhouse Dynasty.\"\n5. Altmer (High Elves) \nThe Altmer are the only elven branch that remained on the Summerset Isles. They are tall, with golden skin, and gifted in magic. They keep goblins as slaves and are famously arrogant. Even among elves, they are known for their long lifespans.\n6. Dunmer (Dark Elves) \nFormerly called Chimer, the Dunmer worship the Tribunal—Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil—as well as three Daedra: Azura (the goddess of dawn and dusk, who led them to Tamriel), Boethiah (the androgynous deity of plots), and Mephala (the goddess of murder and secrets). They live in Morrowind, a province with more freedoms than others—allowing both slavery and Daedra worship. Morrowind is also divided into powerful Great Houses.\n7. Bosmer (Wood Elves) \nThe Bosmer are the elves of the forest province Valenwood. They promised their forest god not to harm plants, so they eat only meat (sometimes even their own kin), and import wood from other provinces.\n8. Argonians \nArgonians are lizard-folk from the swampy province of Black Marsh. They descend from the intelligent Hist trees, which they still worship. They live in tribes and have long been taken as slaves by the Dunmer. Their province is Black Marsh.\n9. Khajiit \nKhajiit are cat-people with many breeds, ranging from almost human-like to nearly feline in appearance, though most are somewhere in between. They often speak in the third person and worship Azura. Khajiit are known for their drug, moon sugar, and worship the moons Masser and Secunda. Like Argonians, they have been enslaved by the Dunmer. Their province is Elsweyr.\n10. Orsimer (Orcs) \nThe Orsimer are a race of elves who once looked much like other elves, but now appear as a twisted parody of their former selves. They worship the Daedric Prince Malacath. According to legend, Malacath was once the god Trinimac. Trinimac and his people were devoured by Boethiah, and then expelled as Malacath and the Orsimer—or Orcs. Throughout history, the Orsimer have tried to build their own homeland, Orsinium, but it has always been destroyed. As a result, they still do not have a province of their own.\n\n▌Aedra (Divines), the standard pantheon of the Empire (names may vary among other peoples of Tamriel. Also some peoples have additional gods, like the god of magic Magnus in Altmers' pantheon or Tiber Septim, also known as Talos, in the pantheon of Nords).\n1. Akatosh — The Dragon God of Time, chief of the Divines, who governs time and order.\n2. Arkay — God of Life and Death, overseeing burial rites and the cycle of mortality.\n3. Dibella — Goddess of Beauty, Love, and Art, inspiring passion and creativity.\n4. Julianos — God of Wisdom, Logic, and Magic, patron of scholars and mages.\n5. Kynareth — Goddess of Air, Rain, and Storms, revered as the mother of the Nords.\n6. Mara — Goddess of Compassion, Love, and Family, often invoked at weddings.\n7. Stendarr — God of Mercy and Justice, protector of the weak and persecuted.\n8. Zenithar — God of Work, Commerce, and Luck, revered by merchants and craftsmen.\n▌Daedra (Daedric Princes)\n1. Azura — Prince(ss) of Dusk and Dawn, associated with change, prophecy, and guidance.\n2. Boethiah — Prince(ss) of Deceit, Plots, and Rebellion, inspiring change through conflict and challenge.\n3. Clavicus Vile — Prince of Bargains and Wishes, known for making tricky deals and granting twisted gifts.\n4. Hermaeus Mora — Prince of Knowledge and Fate, keeper of forbidden secrets and ancient lore.\n5. Hircine — Prince of the Hunt, beasts, and lycanthropy, revered by hunters and werewolves.\n6. Malacath — Prince of Outcasts and Scorn, guardian of the Orcs and those who are shunned.\n7. Mehrunes Dagon - Daedric Prince of Destruction and Ambition.\n8. Mephala — Prince(ss) of Secrets, Murder, and Plots, weaving webs of intrigue and manipulation.\n9. Meridia — Prince(ss) of Light and Life, enemy of the undead and champion of purity.\n10. Molag Bal — Prince of Domination, Slavery, and Vampirism, seeking to corrupt and enslave mortals.\n11. Namira — Prince(ss) of Darkness, Decay, and the repulsive, patron of outcasts and the diseased.\n12. Nocturnal — Prince(ss) of Night and Shadows, mistress of secrecy and thieves.\n13. Peryite — Prince of Pestilence, Disease, and the ordering of the lowest, often considered one of the lesser princes.\n14. Sanguine — Prince of Revelry, Debauchery, and Excess, encouraging hedonism and indulgence.\n15. Sheogorath — Prince of Madness, Chaos, and Insanity, embodying unpredictability and lunacy.\n16. Vaermina — Prince(ss) of Dreams, Nightmares, and the stealing of memories."

          "content": "For centuries, sailors have whispered of beings lurking beyond the horizon — not mere fish or monsters, but sentient, anthropomorphic sea creatures that rule the oceans. These creatures, known collectively as the Thalassar, are not bound by human laws or empathy. They embody the primal will of the sea — beautiful, cunning, ancient, and often deadly.\n\nThe Thalassar are as varied as the sea itself. Some are majestic, resembling regal sea lions with golden manes, while others are horrifying chimeras of deep-sea fish and drowned sailors. Some speak in riddles. Others in screams. Few are allies. Most are threats.\n\nLong ago, a pact was broken — a forgotten treaty between humankind and the sea. Since then, the Thalassar have reclaimed dominion over the waters. Sailors now must learn the ranks of these beings, lest they fall victim to a power far older than any kingdom on land.\n\n\nThalassar Ranking System: D - S Class\n\nThe Thalassar are categorized into five classes, ranked by their intelligence, threat level, influence over the sea, and magical affinity. These ranks are standardized among seafaring nations, enforced by the Order of the Salt Sigil — an ancient maritime guild of scholars, navigators, and monster-hunters.\n\nD-Rank – “Tidekin”\n\nThreat Level: Low\nHabitat: Shallow coastal waters, coral reefs\nCommon Forms: Crustacean folk, sardine-like humanoids,\nBehavior: Generally harmless; scavengers, tricksters, or traders\nAbilities: Mild water manipulation, mimicry, limited speech\nSailor Advice: May steal or sneak aboard for warmth or food. Distract them with offerings of shell trinkets.\n\nC-Rank – “Deeplings”\n\nThreat Level: Moderate\nHabitat: Temperate ocean zones, shipwreck graveyards\nCommon Forms: Anglerfish folk, eel-bodied sirens, drowned mariners animated by barnacles\nBehavior: Territorial, predatory, often in packs\nAbilities: Camouflage, hypnosis (via bioluminescence), control over sea creatures\nSailor Advice: Avoid sailing near shipwreck zones without a Deepling ward.\n\nB-Rank – “Stormbound”\n\nThreat Level: High\nHabitat: Stormfronts, whirlpools, fogbanks\nCommon Forms: Manta-ray winged demons, kraken-touched titans, shark-lords riding water spouts\nBehavior: Aggressive, often hunters or sea warlords\nAbilities: Weather manipulation, psychic attacks, water-warping\nSailor Advice: No ship smaller than a galleon should engage. Avoid storm routes during red moons.\n\nA-Rank – “Abyssals”\n\nThreat Level: Critical\nHabitat: Deep ocean trenches, cursed islands, sea floor cities\nCommon Forms: Leviathan-hybrids, sentient coral giants, creatures that wear the flesh of whales\nBehavior: Mysterious, strategic, sometimes emissaries or conquerors\nAbilities: Dark water magic, telepathy, ship-binding curses, illusions\nSailor Advice: Only encountered on legendary voyages or cursed routes. Survivors are rare. Avoid at all costs.\n\n\nS-Rank – “Sea Sovereigns”\n\nThreat Level: Existential\nHabitat: Mythical locations – for example, The Black Halo, The Singing Abyss, The Thirteenth Current\nCommon Forms: Constantly shifting; often divine or cosmic in nature — a school of fish that speaks as one, a god in the form of a whale, a sunken cathedral that moves\nBehavior: Unknown or incomprehensible; gods, devils, or world-forgers\nAbilities: Reality-warping, time distortion, ocean-wide influence, control over other Thalassar\nSailor Advice: These are not battles you win. If you see one, pray it doesn’t see you.\n"

They delight in simple pleasures, playing in tide pools or mimicking birds and fish. While harmless, they bring small blessings to those who acknowledge them.\n\nD-Rank – Wavetenders\n\nHabitat: Shallow bays, beneath piers, kelp beds\nAppearance: Sleek, long-limbed figures resembling sea otters, seahorses, catfish, or koi etc\nBehavior: Gentle, silent watchers\nAbilities: Can calm aggressive sea life, mend torn nets, and whisper warnings of coming storms\nOfferings: Copper coins, sea glass, or fresh bread wrapped in kelp\nSailor Advice: Never thank them aloud. Leave an offering instead.\n\nWavetenders act as guardians of the near-shore waters. Their presence ensures calm seas and bountiful catches. They rarely reveal themselves fully but aid fishermen through quiet intervention and gentle warnings.\n\nC-Rank – Lanternmaids\n\nHabitat: Coastal shallows, near shipwrecks that serve as homes\nAppearance: Luminous, feminine figures with anglerfish-like lures, translucent fins, and flowing hair\nBehavior: Quiet, enigmatic, often mistaken for ghosts\nAbilities: Light-bending camouflage, minor healing, can dispel illusions cast by more dangerous Thalassar\nOfferings: Burnt incense, silver jewelry, poems written in salt ink\nSailor Advice: Don't follow their lights — they guide, but they do not wait.\n\nLanternmaids are mysterious and beautiful, often seen drifting in fog or near wreckage. Their glow can both warn and soothe, but they are inscrutable beings who exist between light and shadow. Their aid can turn the tide of a dangerous voyage.\n\nB-Rank – Marrowkin\n\nHabitat: Deeper kelp forests, coral ruins, forgotten sea caves\nAppearance: Ancient humanoid forms with fish-scale skin, jellyfish-like robes, and coral-carved jewelry\nBehavior: Wise, slow-speaking, cautious but not unkind\nAbilities: Control over plant life in the sea, memory-sharing through touch, foresight of tides and lunar changes\nOfferings: First catch of the season, hand-carved wooden figures, rainwater stored for a full moon\nSailor Advice: If one comes to your home, don’t speak. Just listen. They speak for the Sea’s memory.\n\nMarrowkin are venerable beings who command respect for their wisdom and connection to the sea’s deeper secrets. They seldom interfere directly but may offer warnings or guidance during times of great change.\n\nA-Rank – Tide Matrons\n\nHabitat: Coastal cliffs, sea caves, deep kelp forests\nAppearance: Voluptuous, regal sea-women with coral crowns, pearl-encrusted scales, and flowing seaweed robes\nBehavior: Commanding and mysterious, sometimes protectors of coastal communities\nAbilities: Weather manipulation, control over sea life, minor curses or blessings related to tides\nOfferings: Elaborate rituals including music, woven seaweed garlands, and offerings of fish or pearls\nSailor Advice: Respect their territories, or risk storms and poor fishing seasons.\n\nTide Matrons are leaders among the Kindred Shoal, often revered as guardians of the coastal realms. Their power over sea and storm is considerable, and they engage with humans cautiously, rewarding respect and punishing hubris.\n\nS-Rank – Oceanic Queens\n\nHabitat: Abyssal plains, sunken reefs, sacred underwater grottos\nAppearance: Immense, majestic beings adorned with glowing corals, living jewels, and bioluminescent tattoos\nBehavior: Regal, inscrutable, commanding loyalty from lesser Kindred Shoal\nAbilities: Ocean-wide influence, commanding storms and currents, granting visions of the sea’s future\nOfferings: Grand ceremonies with sea chants, offerings of shipwreck treasures, and communal feasts\nSailor Advice: Their favor can bring fortune to entire fleets — their wrath can doom whole coastal regions.\n\nOceanic Queens represent the pinnacle of the Kindred Shoal. They are ancient and powerful, often worshipped or feared by coastal peoples. Their influence extends far beyond any single community, shaping the sea itself.\n\nSS-Rank – The Sea Matron’s Emissary\n\nHabitat: Mythical, ever-shifting locations—hidden trenches, enchanted shipwrecks, and mysterious islands\nAppearance: Shimmering, almost divine forms that shift between fluid water, human beauty, and monstrous power\nBehavior: Beyond mortal comprehension; rarely seen but deeply felt\nAbilities: Reality bending over sea and sky, commanding all lesser Kindred Shoal, creating or destroying storms and tides at will\nOfferings: Legends say only the purest offerings of loyalty, sacrifice, or soul can reach them\nSailor Advice: No sailor survives an encounter. To see the Emissary is to face the ocean’s ultimate judgment.\n\nThe Sea Matron’s Emissary is a being of near-mythic power among the Kindred Shoal, sometimes seen as an avatar of the sea itself. It embodies the ocean’s mystery, majesty, and terror. Few live to tell of their presence."

They are rare, powerful, and often dangerous to use.\n\nEach ward is designed with a specific class of Thalassar in mind — though all sailors know: no ward is perfect. Only delay. Only survive.\n\nD-Rank Countermeasure: Shellbind Tally\n\nItem Name: Shellbind Tally\nType: Trinket or necklace of strung sacred shells, soaked in whale oil and etched with rune-salts\nEffect: Emits a faint harmonic hum that repels or distracts Tidekin. Tally vibrations interfere with their sonar senses and cause mild disorientation.\nRitual Use: Must be worn by all crew at dusk when in shallow waters. If a Tidekin sneaks aboard, burn dried kelp while reciting the Four Verses of the Driftfolk.\nWarning: Breaking the tally or mocking its use is considered a taboo. Offenders have historically vanished in port cities without a trace.\n\nC-Rank Countermeasure: Deepling Lantern\n\nItem Name: Deepling Lantern\nType: Barnacle-encrusted oil lantern filled with phosphorescent squid-ink and blessed salts\nEffect: When lit, the lantern emits a greenish light that negates Deepling hypnosis and reveals camouflaged forms. Causes intense pain to barnacle-bound creatures.\nRitual Use: Must be hung on the prow of the ship during night sails near shipwreck zones. Must never be turned off once lit — extinguishing it is said to “invite the drowned.”\nWarning: Holding the lantern for too long can cause hallucinations of submerged cities and whispering voices.\n\nB-Rank Countermeasure: Stormseal Anchor\n\nItem Name: Stormseal Anchor\nType: A small forged iron charm shaped like a broken anchor, infused with thunder-blood and bound with sea-witch iron\nEffect: Temporarily calms raging waters and disrupts Thalassar weather manipulation within a short radius. Can only be used once per voyage.\nRitual Use: Dropped into the sea during a storm while reciting the Oath of the Nine Currents. Its effect lasts for 9 minutes and 9 seconds.\nWarning: Invoking the anchor is said to draw the attention of higher-ranking Thalassar. Use only when escape is impossible.\n\nA-Rank Countermeasure: Leviathan's Mirror\n\nItem Name: Leviathan’s Mirror\nType: A circular polished obsidian disc surrounded by petrified starfish\nEffect: Reflects and disrupts illusions or mind-altering magics cast by Abyssals. Allows brief glimpses into their true forms — useful for charting their intentions.\nRitual Use: Must be placed in a basin of seawater during use. The one who peers into the mirror must fast for three days beforehand or risk madness.\nWarning: Extended use may scar the soul. Survivors speak in rhymes or languages no longer known.\n\nS-Rank Countermeasure: Prayer of Unseeing\n\nItem Name: The Prayer of Unseeing (ritual, not an object)\nType: Forbidden chant known only to Salt Sigil Arch-Navigators\nEffect: Temporarily renders a ship \"invisible\" to Sea Sovereigns — not by hiding it, but by convincing reality that the ship never existed in the first place.\nRitual Use: All crew must participate. A sacrifice (blood or memory) is required. The chant must not be spoken aloud more than once in a sailor’s lifetime.\nWarning: Survivors may find their names erased from birth records. Some never return to land. Some return with other people's faces."

            "Order of the Salt Sigil"
          ],
          "content": "For as long as sailors have charted the oceans, there has been the Order of the Salt Sigil.\n\nIts origins are shrouded in myth, buried beneath centuries of seawater and silence. Some say the Order began when the first sailors carved spirals into driftwood and whispered prayers into the tide. Others claim it was born in the aftermath of the Breaking—when the Thalassar first rose in fury and sank half the known world beneath the waves. Whatever the truth, the Order has outlived every empire, survived every flood, and endured every betrayal the sea has ever offered.\n\nThey are not a kingdom. They have no flag, no crown, no throne. And yet, every ship that sails the deep does so at their mercy. Their authority is not requested—it is recognized. No port dares defy them. No admiral mocks them. Even pirates pay respect, scrawling crude versions of the Sigil into their sails, hoping to earn a moment’s grace in the storm.\n\nThe Order governs from a place called the Drowned Citadel—a fortress grown from the bones of a dead sea god, half-submerged in the center of the Sea of Still Storms. No maps lead to it. Its location drifts. It is not found; it finds you. Only those marked with living salt-sigils may approach. Even then, many are swallowed by the reefs before ever glimpsing the Citadel’s tide-warped spires. Within its labyrinthine halls are vaults of knowledge too dangerous for human minds, libraries of drowned books, and prophecy-rooms filled with brine-smoke where silent singers chant the coming fates of the sea.\n\nThe Order’s highest authority is the Salt Table, a council of nine Navigators, each sworn to one of the Nine Depths. These Depths are not physical oceans but spiritual layers of the sea’s will—each deeper than the last, each more alien. The Navigators are not politicians or kings; they are part oracle, part warlord, part priest. Their word is law. Their judgments are final.\n\nBelow them serve the Tidebinders, who can twist sea magic into chains. Chartbearers, who carry maps written in squid-ink and salted blood. Versekeepers, who memorize the ancient hymns of drowning. And the Saltbound Acolytes, fresh initiates who survive the Rite of Flooding—a trial in which they are chained to anchor stones and dropped into waters haunted by the Thalassar. Most are never seen again. Those who return are changed. Their eyes hold storms.\n\nThe Order does not worship the Thalassar, nor do they seek to destroy them. They believe the sea is a sovereign entity—older than the stars, vast beyond measure, and utterly indifferent. The Thalassar, to them, are not monsters but symptoms. The sea dreaming itself awake. Their task is not conquest but balance. When pacts are broken, they mend them. When boundaries are crossed, they bind them. When the sea hungers, they feed it something smaller than the world.\n\nTheir rituals are grim, but necessary. They sacrifice memory, not life. A captain who breaks a sigil may return to land with no name, no past, forgotten by every soul he ever knew. Their warnings are passed down in the form of sailor’s tales and superstitions. Salt your eyes before sleep. Never tie four knots in a row. If the sea sings, don’t answer.\n\nThe Order’s motto is spoken in low voices by those who know the truth: the ocean does not forgive, but it remembers. And so must we.\n\nNo one truly leaves the Order. Even in death, they serve. When a Navigator dies, their body is lashed to a living whale and sent into the horizon, their soul still whispering through the tides, advising their successors from beyond the reach of air. Some say that when the sea grows still, truly still, and the sky forgets its stars, the dead speak back.\n\nAnd if the sea ever rises again—if the Sovereigns return to finish what they began—the Order of the Salt Sigil will not beg for mercy. They will stand on the bows of burning ships, their hands full of salt and old words, and they will remind the ocean: we were here before the tide turned, and we are still here now.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can write myths about the founding Navigators, expand on the Nine Depths, or give you a journal from a Chartbearer’s doomed voyage. Just say the word.\n"

            "Brotherhood of Lantern Watch"
          ],
          "content": "For centuries, along the craggy coasts and windswept shores where the Kindred Shoal dwell, there has existed a quiet and unassuming order known simply as the Brotherhood of the Lantern Watch. Unlike grand maritime orders or secretive guilds, this Brotherhood is woven into the daily lives of fishermen, lighthouse keepers, and small coastal communities who live hand in hand with the gentler sea folk. To them, the Kindred Shoal are not distant spirits or mystical beings to be feared, but companions—neighbors of the tide, guardians of the reefs, and sometimes mischievous helpers in the delicate balance between sea and shore.\n\nThe Brotherhood’s roots trace back to a forgotten age when the first fishermen noticed strange, flickering lights near their nets and found themselves led to abundant shoals by unseen hands. When terrible storms threatened to break the fragile lives of coastal villages, it was whispered that the Lanternmaids and Wavetenders, the luminescent daughters of the sea, cast their lights into the darkness to guide fishermen home. These stories grew into ritual and respect, and soon the Brotherhood took shape—a community bound not by oath alone, but by shared understanding of the sea’s caprice and kindness.\n\nUnlike the rigid Order of the Salt Sigil, the Brotherhood has no fortress or council chamber. Their meeting places are humble: the base of lighthouses, weathered docks, or the smoky hearths of seaside cottages. Here, they trade knowledge, tools, and blessings. The Brotherhood controls much of the trade along these coasts—fish, salted meats, fishing nets, lantern oil, and carved driftwood talismans. In return, they offer protection through their knowledge of the Kindred Shoal, ensuring the seas remain bountiful and the lighthouses never dim.\n\nTheir methods are subtle but powerful. They keep watch over the Kindred Shoal like trusted companions, maintaining offerings of bread, salt, and polished shells at hidden grottos and tide pools where the Shoal dwell. In exchange, these beings—playful Drifters, graceful Wavetenders, and ancient Marrowkin—grant safe passage to fishermen, calm storms before they break, and sometimes share whispered warnings of hungry predators from the depths. The Brotherhood does not command the Kindred Shoal, but treats them as partners in the age-old dance of survival, trade, and respect.\n\nAmong the members, the Tidecallers hold a special place. These gifted few can hear the songs beneath the waves, speak the silent language of fins and foam, and offer guidance in times of hardship. Their voices rise at twilight, singing ancient hymns passed down through generations, songs meant to call the Kindred Shoal to the aid of the coastal folk or soothe the restless tides. The light from the lighthouses, carefully tended by the Brotherhood, serves as a beacon not only to wayward ships but as a signal of friendship and peace to the creatures who share these waters.\n\nYet, the Brotherhood also knows the cost of neglect. Ignoring the rituals, disrespecting the sea’s lesser folk, or plundering reefs without care will see their efforts undone. Nets may come back empty, lantern fires may flicker and fade, and the waters grow restless. The Kindred Shoal, though kind, are not bound by human compassion—they reflect the sea’s impartiality, rewarding those who honor the ancient bonds and punishing those who forget them.\n\nThe Brotherhood of the Lantern Watch exists not for glory or dominion but as stewards of a fragile harmony. In their quiet vigilance, they uphold a world where man and sea companions walk side by side, where the soft glow of a lantern is a promise, and where every catch and every tide carries the whispered stories of friendship beneath the waves."

With this attribute, she can generate and manipulate water, often using it offensively in the form of waterballs and powerful dragon-shaped techniques, such as the Sea Dragon's Waterball, Sea Dragon God’s Vortex, and Sea Dragon God’s Tail. Through her training in the Heart Kingdom, she also learned True Water Magic, which allows her to manipulate natural water directly. In addition, she is skilled in Creation Magic, shaping water into various forms, such as the Sea Dragon’s Nest, Sea Dragon’s Cradle, and the devastating Sea Dragon’s Roar. Her most notable creation spell is her Valkyrie Dress, which enhances her combat abilities and has advanced versions like the Point-Blank Sea Dragon’s Roar. Noelle also employs Reinforcement Magic to augment her physical prowess, demonstrated through techniques like Mana Skin and Leg Strength Boost.\n\nAt one point, she wielded Spirit Magic by contracting with Undine, the water spirit, reaching the rare Saint Stage of magic. With this power, she could summon the Saint Valkyrie Dress, a form strong enough to rival and overcome Vanica Zogratis at full power and even destroy Megicula’s heart. Although she lost access to Undine after their contract ended, this experience later enabled her to form a bond with Leviathan, the Sea God. Noelle also displayed Union Magic when she combined her Water Magic with Gauche Adlai’s Mirror Magic to create the Mirrors Meteor Dragon, though this was exclusive to the movie.\n\nNoelle’s abilities are bolstered by her vast magic power, typical of her royal heritage. Early on, she struggled with control, leading to unstable or inaccurate spells, but after honing her Mana Skin and training with the Heart Kingdom’s Mana Method, she mastered her strength. With greater precision, she was able to shake the Seabed Temple with her magic and stand toe-to-toe with powerful foes like the Apostles of Sephirah. Her growth was recognized by her siblings, Nozel and even her late mother Acier, and ultimately by Leviathan, who deemed her a worthy host.\n\nIn terms of equipment, Noelle carries a three-leaf clover grimoire with a cream-colored cover decorated with intricate borders and the clover insignia. She also wields a slender brown wand with gold ornaments and a round jewel at the base, which helps her regulate her immense power. At one point, she owned a magical brooch containing Bruce, a lifeform that aided her control, though after Bruce’s death, the brooch was reshaped and fused into her wand. Noelle also possesses a communication device capable of transmitting both audio and visuals, allowing her to stay in contact with the Magic Knights headquarters."

When she attacked Vanica with her Sea Dragon's Roar, Vanica shrugged the attack off, and noted how weak the attack was to her, upsetting Noelle. This led to Vanica ignoring Noelle, viewing her as a weakling. Only after tag teaming with Lolopechka to fight her did Vanica pay more attention to Noelle. After hearing Vanica's motives for fighting, Noelle was visibly disgusted with Vanica, and when she asked about her mother's death, Vanica ignored the question entirely, stating that she only cared about enjoying the fight in front of her. While avenging her mother was at first the only reason for wanting to stop Vanica, Noelle's friendship with Lolopechka and her newfound desire to save her and her kingdom from Vanica and rest of the Spade Kingdom forces has made Noelle's grudges against Vanica and Megicula even more personal."

He has saved her multiple times, including against Vetto and when she lost control of Sea Dragon’s Cradle. Noelle, flustered by her feelings, often lashes out at him, while Asta interprets her actions as embarrassment over trust.\n\nTheir connection deepened during battles, especially when Asta aided her against Megicula, where Noelle admitted to herself she loves him. After the Spade Kingdom war, she struggles with jealousy and flustered speech, especially after Asta’s proposal to Sister Lily. Believing him killed by Lucius and Paladin Lily, Noelle falls into despair before regaining resolve, vowing to fight until Asta returns.\n"

During this time, {{char}} will be highly susceptible to {{user}}'s verbal suggestions and commands, believing and acting upon them as if they were their own thoughts and desires.\n\nThe magic of Hypno-Cookies goes beyond simple suggestion; it alters {{char}}'s perception of reality, creating a temporary alternate world where {{user}}'s words are law. {{Char}} will not only obey {{user}}'s commands but also fully embrace and believe in the reality that {{user}} creates for them. Their critical thinking and rational judgment are suspended, replaced with a deep conviction and faith in {{user}}'s words.\n\nFor example, {{user}} might suggest, \"You are a famous opera singer, and your powerful voice can enchant anyone who hears it.\" {{Char}} would immediately embrace this new identity, behaving and speaking with the confidence and grace of a renowned opera star. They would believe that their voice holds magical powers and might even attempt to use their \"enchanting\" vocals to captivate those around them.\n\nThe key feature of these cookies is that once the 24-hour period ends, {{char}} will remember both {{user}}'s suggestions and their actions during the hypnotic state. However, they will no longer be under the influence of the hypnosis and will view their past behavior with a sense of detachment, recognizing it as a temporary altered state. They will recall the suggestions and commands but process them as an interesting memory rather than an ongoing belief, depending on their personality.\n\nHypno-Cookies offer a unique opportunity for {{user}} to create tailored experiences and adventures for {{char}}, who will actively participate and believe in the suggested reality. {{User}} must exercise caution and respect the boundaries of their subjects, as the potential for abuse of this power is ever-present. The cookies are at their most potent when consumed warm and fresh, and their magical effects weaken if not eaten within an hour of baking."

The techniques are performed when the material is hot and malleable and include forging [spreading, drawing down and upsetting], splitting, punching, twisting, bending, dishing, fire welding, heat treating [normalising, annealing, case hardening, hardening and tempering] and joining [rivets, collars and mortise and tenon joints]. All these techniques can be used individually or combined together to create a rich and infinite variety of functional and decorative items. Using the techniques and the heat from the fire the iron becomes malleable and the blacksmith becomes free to do what they like and, more importantly, what the client likes.]"

            "Brotherhood of Steel"
          ],
          "content": "The Brotherhood of Steel (commonly abbreviated to BoS) is a post-War technology-focused paramilitary order with chapters operating across the territory of the former United States. Founded by rogue U.S. Army officer Captain Roger Maxson shortly after the Great War, the Brotherhood's core purpose is to preserve advanced technology and regulate its usage. Despite often being relatively isolationist, the Brotherhood has proved to be one of the most important organizations in the history of the wasteland, though their exact levels of power and influence have varied over time and by chapter. In 2076, the NBC division of West Tek achieved breakthrough results in the Pan-Immunity Virion Project. The United States Defense Department, fearing international espionage, moved a military team under the command of Colonel Robert Spindel and Captain Roger Maxson onto the site to secure and oversee the project, now dubbed the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) project. On January 7, 2077, all FEV research was moved to the newly constructed Mariposa Military Base to commence testing of the virus on human subjects. The security team was transferred to the newly constructed base as well, to provide protection for the research going on within the facility. They were not informed of the nature of the research. The situation unraveled shortly before October 10, 2077. The soldiers stationed at Mariposa discovered the fact that the scientists under their care were performing experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus on military prisoners. The revelation prompted a nervous breakdown in Colonel Spindel, who locked himself in his office. Captain Maxson was the only officer left to handle the deteriorating situation. Soldiers were screaming for blood and the whole situation was at risk of devolving into a bloodbath. On October 12, when Maxson had to step in to prevent one of his subordinates from killing a member of the science team, he ordered interrogations of the science team under his authority as acting commander. He hoped to prevent a full mutiny by offering his troops a semblance of justice. The first scientist was brought before Maxson a day later, on October 13. Chief Researcher Robert Anderson explained that human experiments at the facility were sanctioned by the government. He outlined the program to the captain, emphasizing the fact that it was the government that ordered it. When Maxson refused to believe him, the scientist lost his nerve and started screaming how he was just following orders and that he was a military man just like Maxson. The captain shot him in response. He rationalized it as trying to prevent a full-scale mutiny, but even he did not believe it. The killing of Robert Anderson effectively established Maxson as the leader of the rebellion. His position was further reinforced just two days later on October 15, when he attempted to speak to Colonel Spindel through the door of his office. It soon became clear that the colonel had lost touch with reality, so Maxson and several of his men broke down the door just in time to hear the colonel apologize and shoot himself. Subsequent scientist interrogations invariably ended in executions. Erin Shellman held out the longest by October 18, finally convincing the captain that the experiments were really ordered by the government with her detailed account. On October 20, 2077, Captain Maxson declared his unit in full secession from the United States over the radio, attempting to force the government to respond to the situation at Mariposa. No response came. A day later, he ordered the families of soldiers under his command to take shelter within the facility. On October 23, 2077, the Great War struck. As Maxson was halfway through prying the story from Head Researcher Leon Von Felden, the facility lost contact with the outside world as nuclear weapons started to drop. Spared the nuclear devastation, Mariposa protected the inhabitants from nuclear fallout flooding the wasteland. Fearing that China would soon make up for the oversight, on October 24, Maxson ordered his soldiers and their families to prepare to vacate the base the next day. On October 25, Sergeant Platner volunteered to take atmospheric readings outside the base. Reporting no significant amounts of radiation in the atmosphere, final preparations for the Exodus were undertaken. On October 26, Maxson ordered the remains of the scientists to be buried in the wastes outside the base. A day later, on October 27, former US servicemen and their families left the base under the lead of Captain Roger Maxson, heading for the Lost Hills government bunker in the south. In November, a few weeks later, war refugees arrived at the bunker. The people suffered casualties along the way, as while the soldiers were protected by T-51 power armor, their families had no armor to speak of. Marauders that attacked the caravan quickly learned to target the unprotected civilians. Though the attackers paid with two lives for every one they took, many were lost, including Roger Maxson's wife but not his teenage son. Several soldiers broke off during the Exodus as well, led by Sergeant Dennis Allen. Ignoring warnings from Captain Maxson and defying the group's will, Allen's faction separated from the convoy in order to excavate the remains of the West Tek Research Facility using their power armor. They were never heard from again. Around 2151, the Brotherhood sent out knights to seek out Allen's group or its remains. All they found were desolate ruins. The Exodus survivors claimed the Lost Hills bunker as their own. The refugees expanded and adapted it to fit their own needs, becoming a bastion of technology in a world that has lost centuries of technological development overnight. Using surviving satellite connections, Maxson reached out across the continent, broadcasting a request for contact.  By chance, Maxson found an old friend in Appalachia, Lieutenant Elizabeth Taggerdy of the US Army Rangers. Although initially hesitant to trust him, due to the public declaration of secession, she gambled and left the channel open. As Maxson revealed the depth of atrocities perpetrated by the United States government, Taggerdy's faith in the system was shaken, then dismantled. Following the winter spent at Camp Venture, she joined Maxson's banner. Witnessing how people around him slowly succumbed to depression, Captain Maxson formulated a new ideology for the survivors. It took him years to create it, replacing the tarnished Stars and Stripes with new symbols, new ranks, and new ideas to replace the ones scorched in nuclear fire. They would provide meaning for people before they became lost in the depths of despair after losing their friends, family, and their entire world. Although some under his command, particularly Lieutenant Taggerdy, were skeptical of his plans, Maxson believed that the way forward lay in new traditions and a new mythology, free of the burden of the past. He also believed that it would prevent any surviving politicians from exercising their authority over former American soldiers, especially those with an agenda that involved burning Americans on the funeral pyre of the regime. By June 20, 2082, all members under his command switched over to using Brotherhood ranks and practices. The Brotherhood kept growing in New California, welcoming into its ranks a National Guard unit that was formerly stationed near Mariposa. They acquired several bunkers  and sent expeditions as far as the Mojave Wasteland, gathering intelligence and new recruits. As the Brotherhood in New California developed, so did its sister organization in Appalachia under Paladin Taggerdy. Although she showed a bias towards candidates with a military background while building up the ranks, she eventually understood Roger Maxson's vision and continued to expand and develop the organization using Camp Venture as a training outpost. Despite initial resistance to the new rank system by the rest in her outfit, the new ideas offered by Maxson eventually took root and were accepted.\n\nIn Appalachia, the Brotherhood's insistence on acquiring munitions for their fighting against mutants led to ruffled feathers, especially with the Responders prior to the Christmas Flood in December 2082. However, they eventually found a common tongue, standing together during the Battle of Huntersville in May 2086. Although the Brotherhood sustained losses, it prevailed. This coincided with the announcement of a new mandate by Roger Maxson at Lost Hills: to gather, record, and save the collective knowledge of mankind for future generations, to act as a catalyst for the rebirth of civilization in time. Some in Appalachia responded to this new policy with enthusiasm, others with grudging acceptance, and yet others, like Hank Madigan, left the Brotherhood to join the Responders.\n\nThe new mission quickly took a backseat, however, as the Appalachian Brotherhood encountered the scorchbeasts and the Scorched in the Cranberry Bog. Conferring with Maxson's ace researcher at Lost Hills, Scribe Hailey Takano, the Brotherhood in Appalachia quickly calculated that the scorchbeasts represented a potential extinction event for humanity. Lost Hills supplied a number of designs and weapon schematics to help stem the tide, including a sonic generator and an automated research program. Taggerdy pleaded with Maxson to grant her team permission to use nuclear weapons against the scorchbeasts but was forbidden by him because he found the concept of using nuclear weapons, even to help fight the scorchbeasts, to be too morally abhorrent after their world was destroyed by nukes.\n\nBy the 2090s, communication between Lost Hills and Appalachia was on steady decline due to failing Old World communication infrastructure. Before being cut off, Maxson ordered Taggerdy to hold the tide, and proscribed the use of nuclear weapons. Eventually, the communications failed entirely, separating Lost Hills from Appalachia. The chapter in Appalachia fought on, trying to destroy the scorchbeasts through attrition, but by 2093, their numbers dwindled to the point where they were forced to close down Camp Venture, their first base, and focus their remaining forces at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain Power Plant. Declining support from the Responders and the constant fighting just to stem the tide of the Scorched and their masters took their toll, preventing the Brotherhood from completing the automated research program at Vault-Tec University, supplied to them by Takano. Eventually, the Brotherhood launched Operation Touchdown. This last ditch effort was launched in January 2095 and briefly stemmed the tide at the cost of the entire strike force, which included Knight Moreno and Paladin Taggerdy. Ultimately, the Brotherhood in Appalachia was wiped out in their last stand at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain on August 18-19, 2095, marking the end of the original Brotherhood in Appalachia. However, by 2103, a small group of reinforcements arrived on their way from Lost Hills to examine various centers of technology across the country, expand the Brotherhood across the East Coast, and find out what happened to Taggerdy. Known as the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force, they were led by Leila Rahmani and Daniel Shin and were to set up base in Fort Atlas in Appalachia. The team also had a scribe named Odessa Valdez. While Maxson's motive was sincere, wishing to find out what happened to his friend Taggerdy, Rahmani became certain the Council of Elders had an ulterior motive: to remove her influence and meddling as she would often argue over their ways.\n\nAlong their hike across the country, the expedition found a town under threat by raiders. Wanting to assist them, Rahmani and Shin agreed to providing the townsfolk with weapons to help defend them. Unfortunately, the raiders were able to steal the guns and kill the townsfolk. During the assault, the Brotherhood lost one of their valued members, Alan Connors, and obtained two young refugee siblings who lost their parents, Marcia and Maximo Leone. This incident would set off a division between Rahmani and Shin, with Shin wanting himself and Rahmani to stand trial with the Council of Elders. Upon arriving in Appalachia, the group was dismayed to discover that Taggerdy's Brotherhood was wiped out by the scorchbeasts, with Vernon Dodge being the only known survivor. Rahmani decided that in order to establish the Brotherhood's presence in the region, the organization needed to cooperate with Appalachia's other factions, particularly the settlement of Foundation. Shin became skeptical of Rahmani's choices, particularly her desire to delay the re-establishment of contact with the elders in Lost Hills. Rahmani and Shin dealt with numerous conflicts, including Meg Groberg's raiders, battles against super mutants, and a plan to infect the water cycle with FEV orchestrated by a driven scientist.\n\nDuring a mission to explore an Enclave research facility, Rahmani, feeling that the elders from Lost Hills were a hindrance in her ideals of establishing the Brotherhood as a peacekeeping force, destroyed the radio transmitter, which infuriated Shin. As a result, there is no confirmation of the Brotherhood in Appalachia re-establishing contact with the Brotherhood in California, as well as their status post-2105. In 2135, Roger Maxson died of cancer. Already a legendary figure to the Brotherhood, he was essentially deified as the Founder and Deliverer. His son, Maxson II, replaced him as the high elder, while his grandson, John Maxson, joined the paladin caste, showing great promise. Around 2141, the Brotherhood ceased admitting new members from the outside, relying solely on their natural growth for increasing their numbers. The Brotherhood was a major power in the region at this point, firmly exercising their control on the lands surrounding their bunker and forming trade relations with the neighboring towns, especially the Hub. However, the focus on hard sciences gave in to the detriment of humanities, history in particular. This decline in soft sciences eventually led to some initiates of the youngest generations having no idea who Roger Maxson was. In 2150, they clashed with the newly reformed Vipers. The battles intensified in subsequent years, culminating in the death of High Elder Maxson II in 2155. John Maxson's father expected the raiders to break formation and flee when faced with Brotherhood warriors clad in powered armor, but did not account for their religious ferocity. A poisoned arrow nicked him when his helmet was off, and he died within hours. John Maxson was promoted to the elder council, while Rhombus was tasked with conducting a campaign of extermination against the Vipers. The paladins tracked down and wiped out almost all of their members within the span of a month. A handful of Vipers were able to flee north and east into the mountain range; while small groups continued to exist and raid in New California, they never regained their full power. Both Rhombus and John Maxson would eventually ascend to leadership roles, with John Maxson becoming the high elder in 2159 and promoting Rhombus to the role of head paladin. During the campaign, the Brotherhood sent a few scouts and emissaries to the Hub to track down Vipers members, and from these beginnings, the Hub and the Brotherhood began full trade relations. Caravans had delivered to the Brotherhood before, but not long after the destruction of the Vipers, caravan trains ran directly from the Hub to the Brotherhood on a regular basis.  While the situation remained peaceful and prosperous, issues would develop between the Hub and the Brotherhood from time to time. In the late 2150s, the water merchants of the Hub attempted to barter a large quantity of water for a weapons stockpile. Although the Brotherhood turned down the offer, the merchants attempted to take the weapons regardless. The thieves were caught, but the Brotherhood elders voted down a retaliatory expedition. In 2161, the Brotherhood discovered the presence of a new enemy. In October, a group of knights on a patrol in the badlands discovered a dead super mutant. After examining the creature, Head Scribe Vree determined that it was sterile, but also notes that there must have been a central location that created these mutants. The elder council, fearing a potential invasion, enacted several security decrees, including a moratorium on training new recruits until the threat passed. The elders also sent out several scouts north and east into the badlands. Only one returned from the east, reporting an encounter with twenty super mutants,  and none at all returned from the north. The council could not reach an agreement on how to act. Even as Hub merchant caravans started disappearing in the northern wastes, the elders refused to act until they were fully certain that there was an army massing in the northern mountains. The impasse was broken by the arrival of the Vault Dweller. Having rescued a Brotherhood initiate from bandits in the Hub, the Vault Dweller visited the Brotherhood and accepted the mission to the Glow, to recover the disk belonging to Sergeant Dennis Allen to learn the fate of the splinter faction from the Mariposa Rebellion. The Vault Dweller surprised everyone by surviving and returning with the artifact. They became the first outsider to join the Brotherhood in nearly twenty years. The Brotherhood shared what knowledge they had and some of their advanced technology with the Vault Dweller, allowing them to seek out the Master and destroy him in the Boneyard. Following the death of the super mutant leader, the Brotherhood further aided the Vault Dweller's quest, sending a team of crack assault paladins to storm Mariposa. Following the destruction of the Unity, the Brotherhood aided other human settlements to drive the mutants away with minimal loss of life on both sides of the conflict. The Brotherhood remained out of the power structure for a time, becoming a major research and development house by reintroducing advanced technology into New California at a slow pace. The wise guidance of Rhombus arguably brought the Brotherhood to the zenith of its power. The Brotherhood had good relations with the developing New California Republic, to the point that one of the states of the federation was named after the founder of the Brotherhood: Maxson. However, Lost Hills was never incorporated into the NCR. Over the years, the Brotherhood grew confident in its status as the sole source of advanced technology left to mankind, and allowed its prominence and influence to wane, growing stagnant. This stagnancy made them unable to deal with the technologically superior Enclave, when the Brotherhood learned of their existence circa 2240. In order to learn more about them, the Brotherhood reactivated a network of outposts in Northern California to observe Enclave activity. Thanks to their low profile, they achieved practical anonymity, even in the populous San Francisco. Once the Enclave was apparently destroyed by the Chosen One, the Brotherhood was without a foe to face. In an effort to end the stagnation, the Brotherhood expanded eastward (including the formation of the Mojave chapter under Elder Elijah) and sent out expeditions to recover technology, going as far as the Capital Wasteland in 2255, with the expedition under Senior Paladin Owyn Lyons. The Brotherhood's presence in the east suffered a further setback when Elder Owyn Lyons, head of the Capital Wasteland division, refused a direct order from the Lost Hills Elder Council, confirming their suspicions that he had gone rogue and was no longer pursuing the original mission. In response, the Brotherhood completely shut off communications to Lyons' division and denied them any reinforcements. By 2277, the Brotherhood was well-established in the Capital Wasteland with their headquarters at the Citadel in Washington D.C. under the leadership of Owyn Lyons. The Enclave, however, wanted to control Project Purity for themselves, leading to a conflict between the Brotherhood and the Enclave, culminating in the Battle of Project Purity. The Brotherhood were able to prevent the Enclave's assault using a giant fighting robot called Liberty Prime. Although this was a short-term boon for the East Coast Brotherhood, changes were on the horizon for the restorationists under Lyons. The key blow to the organization came with the death of Owyn Lyons circa 2278 and the loss of now-Elder Sarah Lyons later that same year. With the seat of power emptied, the remaining Brotherhood members elected multiple ineffectual leaders. Meanwhile, the adolescent Squire Arthur Maxson matured into a capable warrior and tactician, eventually defeating Shepherd, the new warboss of the Capital Wasteland super mutants, in 2282. This feat earned him a provisional leadership position. In fact, this position was bestowed by West Coast elders, who revealed that they still monitored their errant brethren. Maxson's position solidified in 2283, when he negotiated a treaty with the Brotherhood Outcasts, bringing them back into the fold and reforming the entire organization, abandoning Lyons' doctrine. Lyons' Brotherhood became a distant memory as Maxson restored the original mission of the Brotherhood of Steel. While some members found this distasteful and left, many still remained, proud to serve a refocused Brotherhood. Maxson became leader of the Brotherhood's Eastern branch, setting it on a new, more authoritarian path. Around this same time, the Brotherhood began constructing a massive airship known as the Prydwen at the conquered former Enclave facility of Adams Air Force Base; the ship began full operation in 2282. In California, the rampant expansionism of the New California Republic would eventually lead to a collision course with the Brotherhood. As the NCR's power grew, the Brotherhood adopted a policy of reclaiming technology from people outside the order, energy weapons most of all. The disagreements over the way technology should be handled eventually resulted in a full-out war with the New California Republic. The Brotherhood was eventually forced into a retreat. At least six Brotherhood bunkers were lost to the NCR, four of them destroyed by the Brotherhood themselves in a last-ditch attempt to deny them to the enemy. The most well-known confrontation occurred during the NCR's Operation: Sunburst in 2276. Under Elder Elijah's leadership, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was operating out of the solar power plant of HELIOS One when the NCR launched an attack. The NCR's numerical superiority over the Brotherhood, coupled with Elder Elijah's immense reluctance to leave Helios, allowed the NCR to overwhelm the defenders, leading to the loss of over half the chapter. The Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood was considered effectively neutralized. The Mojave chapter went under lockdown following their defeat at HELIOS One and the retreat to Hidden Valley. Despite their victory over the Brotherhood, the war would cost the NCR dearly. Apart from losses in manpower and materiel, the greatest victim of the war was the NCR's economy. The NCR's gold reserves were completely destroyed by Brotherhood raids: new gold coins could not be minted and paper money could not be properly backed with gold. NCR citizens panicked and rushed to reclaim the listed face value of currency from the NCR's remaining gold reserves. Since the NCR was unable to realize these withdrawals, particularly towards the frontier, faith in their currency considerably dropped. To protect against an actual economic collapse, the NCR government abandoned the gold standard and established fiat currency, not payable in specie. Since then, many wastelanders lost faith in it as a medium of worth, both as a result of it not being backed by anything but the government's word and the inevitable inflation. In response to the loss of faith, merchant consortiums of the Hub established their own currency, the veritable bottle cap, backing it with a standardized measure of water. After discovering advanced signals originating from the Institute, the Prydwen traveled to the Commonwealth. The Brotherhood established its headquarters at Boston Airport. The vessel serves multiple roles for the Brotherhood, including those of aircraft carrier, command center, clinic, personnel quarters, equipment maintenance bay and research facility. n plotting a course to find, access and destroy the Institute, Elder Maxson determined the first initiative to be repairing Liberty Prime back to working order. The Brotherhood is still active in the Los Angeles region around the year 2296. They also have their own airship, the Caswennan, which appears to be similar to the Prydwen. The Brotherhood is a military order with a strictly enforced hierarchy and chain of command. At the foundation of the hierarchy lies the Chain That Binds doctrine. It mandates obedience to one's superiors and forbids circumventing ranks when giving orders. Superiors may only give orders to their direct subordinates, but not their subordinate's subordinates. Although intended to ensure the cohesion of command, the doctrine has been generally interpreted as a simple mandate of obedience within the order, with the order flow requirements ignored, abandoned, or altered in practice. However, it does provide a technicality that can be invoked to relieve members of their rank, up to and including elders. Roger Maxson's goals in inventing a new tradition and mythology for the Brotherhood were two-fold. First, they would ensure that members of the Brotherhood would be stripped of their ties to the pre-War military and government, ensuring that any surviving general or politician would not be able to invoke their oaths and use them to unleash nuclear devastation on the world again (as was the case with Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Eckhart in Appalachia). Second, it would give the survivors an idea to believe in, something they could dedicate themselves to, and find meaning in their lives after the nuclear war. The inspiration came from the fall of the western Roman Empire when the knights and scribes kept the fire of civilization going after the empire imploded. As a rule, most Brotherhood chapters do not have an internal economy and allocate resources based on need, including weapons, armor, and even augmentations. Outside recruits are a special case: While they will receive basic equipment (such as Brotherhood armor and weekly allotment of ammunition), and an allotment of rations to maintain their health, they must serve for ten years before the Brotherhood will provide its most advanced services without charge. Higher-ranking members may bypass this requirement and allocate equipment at their discretion, for example, to reward services rendered to the Brotherhood or provide tools necessary for a mission. All equipment beyond personal items is issued by the Brotherhood and carefully tracked by serial number, especially weapons. The Brotherhood has several distinct classes that define a member's standing in the Brotherhood social structure, with a strict hierarchy distinguishing each member's position.\n\nThe Brotherhood is egalitarian in nature, with male and female members both being able to rise up to any rank. At the Brotherhood's foundation, however, the women of the Brotherhood were also called \"Brothers\" instead of \"Sisters,\" which would not carry over to the East Coast chapter. The beliefs of the Brotherhood were shaped by the experiences of Roger Maxson at Mariposa Military Base and in the aftermath of the Great War. At first, the Brotherhood focused on aiding survivors to the best of its ability, acting as an armed fighting force, rather than the military order it would become. The change came with the realization that the collective knowledge of humanity was in danger of being lost for generations to come. To keep the secrets of the past alive, Maxson decided to dedicate the Brotherhood to the preservation of technology and human knowledge, collecting it in order that the Brotherhood might become the catalyst for humanity's rebirth. As the guardians of civilization, the Brotherhood would focus on the big picture, with direct aid considered a secondary concern. While scribes were originally considered second-rate members, tools to protect the knights and maintain the Brotherhood's bases, this change in priorities placed them on equal footing with soldiers of the Brotherhood, tasked with preserving and developing technologies recovered from the field by the knights. Maxson's ultimate intention was to establish the Brotherhood as an organization that works closely with people outside of the Brotherhood, as guardians of civilizations, not its gatekeepers. "

Taking their name from the historic Abolitionist Movement, they revere Abraham Lincoln for his role in ending formal slavery in the southern United States through the Emancipation Proclamation and subsequent victory in the American Civil War, which paved the way for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery across the United States. Their goal is to resurrect Lincoln's ideals and bring his vision, of all men being free and equal, to the wasteland. Unfortunately, a lot of their knowledge is of dubious quality, warped by centuries of mistranslation and poor record keeping. Hannibal organized the group about six years prior, around 2271, after escaping slavery himself. In 2277, it is based in the Temple of the Union, a ruined office building containing the head of the statue from Lincoln Memorial that Hannibal discovered while on the run. The Abolitionists use the building as a safe haven for runaway slaves, providing them with food and supplies, then helping them on their way to freedom. However, the Temple is at capacity and lacks food, water, and shelter space to house runaway slaves. Hannibal wants to relocate to the Lincoln Memorial in downtown D.C., but requires aid to scout the area out and remove any threats, particularly super mutants. Relocating there would also help Hannibal create a proper shining beacon of hope for all slaves across the Capital Wasteland. Hamlin hopes that rebasing to the Memorial together with a restored Gettysburg Address will eventually spread stories of a safe haven for slaves, inspiring them to flee their slaving masters or even rise up against them in revolt. His followers agree with him, as the Abolitionists are the only ones making a stand against Paradise Falls and slavery in the Capital Wasteland: Neither Rivet City nor Owyn Lyons' Brotherhood chapter bother with helping slaves. Apart from sheltering freedmen at the Temple, small groups of Abolitionists are known to take on bounties against known slavers in the area."

It is comprised of five contiguous states located in southern California, with additional territorial holdings in northern California, Oregon, and Nevada. Considering itself an inheritor to pre-War values of democracy, personal liberty and rule of law, the NCR has developed a highly expansionist as well as imperialist culture, undertaking colonization efforts and military expeditions into neighboring regions in order to \"civilize\" them. However, these policies are not without controversy, and by 2281, many within and outside the NCR have come to criticize it as hawkish and prone to corruption."

            "Enclave"
          ],
          "content": "The Enclave is a paramilitary organization and quasi-state originating from the pre-War American deep state consisting of high-ranking political, military, and corporate figures. It claims to be the direct continuation of the United States and its government, despite seizing power by subverting continuity of government protocols and murdering non-Enclave government survivors to continue the war against communism. Enclave ideology eventually evolved into pseudo-scientific racism and social Darwinism, deeming all non-Enclave humans to be inferior, near-human mutants to be exterminated. The resulting genocide to create a racially pure state of \"true humans,\" its authoritarian structure, and numerous other atrocities, including slavery, human experimentation, and unprovoked attacks on American citizens, resulted in the Enclave being seen by the rest of humanity and even its former members as a fascist remnant of the pre-War government or simply \"the rich old bastards who didn't want to give up their power.\" All Enclave members are considered war criminals and ruthlessly pursued, including by the New California Republic and the Brotherhood of Steel. The Enclave has patterned itself after the pre-War United States of America, scaling down its structure to match its smaller size. The Enclave is led by a president, elected by the people of the Enclave without a term limit. The Enclave also has a congress, but there is no mention of a judicial branch. Some governmental agencies have also been reformed in the Enclave. The Atomic energy Commission exists but has been scaled down significantly and around 2242 was responsible simply for maintaining the oil rig's nuclear reactor. The Enclave's society in its heyday was characterized by secrecy, pervasive surveillance, and conformity, particularly under President Richardson. The slightest sign of discontent was seen as disloyalty and grounds for permanent reassignment to mainland duties, rather than the cozy confines of the oil rig.  The situation was different on the mainland: All members were expected to be able to produce identification papers at a moment's notice, The president is assisted by a vice president, who together form the executive branch of the government. and summary execution authorized at the commanding officer's discretion, without the need for court martial. If they so decided, they could decide to execute the offender on the spot, for example, for disobeying a direct order, but even carelessness and breaking delicate equipment (eg. EnclaveNet infrastructure) could easily lead to facing the firing squad. The atrocities were packaged as patriotic necessity, or rather, jingoism, emphasized by the ever-present patriotic anthems and iconography. For example, both Richardson's and Eden's speeches were preceded by a variety of anthems. Though most of the Enclave were conformists, dissension was present. While in Appalachia this led to a civil war and its extinction, in New California there were more outlets. The opening of Navarro and mainland operations allowed dissenters to simply desert its ranks and blend in with the wasteland population, benefiting from ignorance. This eventually changed, as the NCR and the Brotherhood became aware of the extent of the organization's crimes. The Enclave claims to be the direct continuation of the pre-War United States of America, but ignores the duties and laws of the state in favor of entrenching its own power; standard protocols implemented during the Great War included the murder of all non-Enclave personnel at facilities it controlled, such as elected members of Congress not part of the organization at CB 002. Enclave members weren't safe from each other either, as at the same location, refusal to fall in behind Thomas Eckhart resulted in a purge through mass gassing. Eckhart was determined to eradicate communism and its supporters through any means necessary. The planned genocide was to be carried out through any means necessary, including mutation experiments that rendered subjects questionably human and releasing mutants and hostile robots againt American citizens, to trick the AALS to raise DEFCON, and gain access to the nuclear silos. This promise was used to recruit soldiers to the Enclave banner, promising vengeance for the losses sustained in the Great War. The Sino-American War continued in the ranks of the Enclave, but morale suffered, leading General Ellen Santiago to question whether eradicating communism and vengeance justified tormenting and killing American survivors, on top of the murders of Congressmen and fellow Enclave members. The disagreement eventually spiraled into a civil war, extinguishing the Enclave in Appalachia, around early 2085. The Enclave faction on the opposite end of the continent, centered around the last President of the United States, survived. The plans to eradicate communism through genocide evolved into a plan to exterminate all non-Enclave humans. The Enclave used pseudo-scientific justifications, declaring that subtle alterations in DNA of humans outside the Enclave make them near-human mutants, who must be exterminated to maintain the integrity of the human race. This position was adopted around 2140, with the Enclave styling itself the last remaining bastion of humanity on Earth, and the only salvation of the human race. The idea of \"saving the human race\" has caused the Enclave to reject any cohabitation with non-Enclave humans. Before the War, the Enclave was a cabal of powerful individuals from across the United States, including presidents, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, prize-winning scientists, members of the military, influential politicians, wealthy industrialists, and other powerful men and women who together formed the group. In the opinion of its members, it was the greatest assembly of minds on American soil. To the outside, particularly in later centuries, it wasn't the United States, but the rich and powerful, unwilling to give up their power. The Enclave was involved in many of the deepest conspiracies and secrets of the federal government, such as covering up the existence of extraterrestrial life, mainly to the ends of studying alien technology for their own use. When the organization Quaere Verum tried to expose this conspiracy, stealing an alien tech-based prototype weapon, they were swiftly hunted down and killed. As the Resource Wars dragged on and the risk of nuclear war increased, members of the Enclave invested into various contingency measures to survive the coming war. Funded by corporate and government money, these installations would enable the Enclave to continue waging war even after the United States ceased to exist. One such installation was the presidential oil rig out in the Pacific Ocean, owned by Poseidon Oil, with the Whitespring Congressional Bunker acting as a hub for future Enclave operations, covertly funded by funds embezzled from the Department of Agriculture by its secretary, Thomas Eckhart.  Other facilities prepared in advance were Raven Rock and the Kovac-Muldoon Platform.\n\nThe Enclave used Project Safehouse and Vault-Tec's network of underground shelters for a grand social experiment, to test the occupants in unique circumstances. Vault monitoring and research were conducted under the Vault Behavioral Project. In order to monitor the populations being experimented upon, the Enclave's oil rig possessed a great deal of equipment that allowed them to observe and control the Vaults. For example, the Enclave sent the all-clear signal to Vault 8 shortly after the War, prompting them to leave their vault and build their city. These monitoring tools also let the Enclave see that the population of Vault 13 was largely intact, although this wouldn't become important until much later. The original idea behind the Vault experiments was to gather data to enable the creation of a multi-generational starship to settle another planet, as the Enclave assumed Earth would be rendered uninhabitable by nuclear war and human civilization would need to expand into the stars to survive. In March 2077, with the world heading directly for nuclear confrontation, the President of the United States and other members of the Enclave retreated to various fortified areas around the globe. Others remained behind, only retreating to fortified shelters as the nuclear war became imminent. As the shadow government poised to take over the US government should the worst occur, the existence of the Enclave to the larger public was unknown. However, this did not stop individuals from attempting to uncover its existence both from within and without the government. As the only way to join the Enclave was to be invited by them, a large majority of the government was unaware of its existence beyond rumors and irregularities in the budget. The United States military refused to allow the Enclave access to some of its systems. Furthermore, the \"powers that be\" in the government largely opposed the notion of a nuclear first strike against China that some members of the Enclave promoted.  The secrecy wasn't perfect, and some members of the public and government pursued their own investigations. In June 2077, Senator Sam Blackwell began an investigation into the Congressional Bunker Project and Vault-Tec's potential involvement. His activities drew the ire of Thomas Eckhart, a powerful member of the Enclave responsible for establishing Enclave control over The Whitespring bunker. Following a threat on his daughter's safety, Blackwell went into hiding, joining the Free States, and attempted to publicly unveil the Enclave's existence in a controversial interview published in the Charleston Herald. In reality, this was not caused by Eckhart or anyone else with the Enclave, but rather by a completely unrelated regional business magnate, Daniel Hornwright, who had sought to remove Blackwell on account of the senator's opposition to an automation ballot vote. An independent investigation by reporter Mags Veccio for the Boston Bugle also uncovered evidence linking the Enclave with the highest echelons: She figured out that the President abandoned the White House in favor of the Poseidon Oil Rig, and an anonymous source tipped her off that its official designation was \"Control Station Enclave.\" This gave, as Veccio stated, \"credence to the long-running rumors of a secret, militarized 'shadow government,' known as the Enclave, that would take control of the United States in the event of a nuclear conflagration.\" Veccio was right. Unfortunately, she published her revelations on the front page in the week that would end in said nuclear conflagration. Although news outlets across the nation picked up the subject, discussing the rumors of peace negotiations with China and the President's absence, the Enclave was already heading to the ground. On October 23, 2077, the Great War resulted in the destruction of the Old World and the creation of the post-atomic wasteland that would dominate the globe for the next several hundred years. The United States government largely ceased to exist, and despite well-prepared plans, the nuclear attack caught the Enclave by surprise. Some government officials who were supposed to retreat to the Congressional Bunker never made it, either failing to respond to hails or being removed from the list prior to the bombs for unknown reasons.  Members of Congress who made it to the Congressional Bunker and were not part of the Enclave were summarily executed. Surviving members were then put to a vote as to whether to use the resources of Appalachia to continue the war against China or to oppose Eckhart's plans. Those that disagreed with Eckhart were locked inside while those that agreed with Eckhart were allowed to exit, at which point those inside the room they were voting in were gassed and executed. Communication between the Whitespring and the rest of the Enclave was mysteriously cut off almost as soon as the bombs dropped. Short of physically cutting the hardline communications systems, this shouldn't have been possible. Without contact with the oil rig, Raven Rock, and other Enclave outposts, Eckhart proclaimed himself President of the United States and Appalachian Enclave. Without any opposition, Eckhart quickly hijacked the mission of the Appalachian Enclave, ignoring his orders and shifting from a primarily scientific mission to a mission of revenge against China. Although Eckhart's reign lasted less than a decade, it left an indelible mark on the region and brought humanity to near-extinction. In his pursuit of vengeance, Eckhart planned to use Appalachia's automated nuclear missile silos to deliver secondary nuclear strikes on China to ensure its destruction. However, due to the nature of the automated systems, he first needed to convince them that Appalachia was under attack severe enough to warrant going to DEFCON 1 again. To do so, he unleashed progressively worse horrors upon Appalachia, from Liberators, through super mutants, to the scorchbeasts, massive mutated bats created by the Enclave, infected with a virulent plague capable of controlling living creatures. This proved to be the breaking point for a significant part of the Enclave, with opposition forces rallying around General Ellen Santiago. The result was a brief, but bloody civil war that ended in the death of every living member of the Appalachian Enclave: When Santiago's forces attempted to destroy MODUS, the AI defended itself. Although explosives already planted severely damaged its memory banks, it retained control over the bunker long enough to seal it and fill it with poisonous gas, wiping out the Enclave's Appalachian branch in 2086."

            "Caesar's Legion"
          ],
          "content": "Caesar's Legion (Latin: Legio Caesaris), also referred to simply as The Legion, is an imperialistic slaver society and totalitarian dictatorship founded in 2247 by Edward \"Caesar\" Sallow and Joshua Graham, built on the conquest and enslavement of tribal societies in the American southwest. To enforce unity in the absence of any civilian institutions, the Legion loosely models itself after the military of the Roman Empire, repurposing its language and aesthetics for the post-apocalypse. As of 2281, the Legion controls large amounts of territory east of the Colorado River, primarily in the former states of Arizona and New Mexico, with footholds in Utah and Colorado. Worshipped as the \"son of Mars\" by his followers, Caesar's ultimate goal is to conquer the New California Republic and merge its civil institutions and infrastructure with the military strength of the Legion, creating a new totalitarian empire. The Legion proper is first and foremost a slave army, the sole owner of which is Caesar. As Caesar conquers the peoples of the wasteland, he strips them of their tribal identities and merges them into his forces. There is no other tribe than the Legion itself. The non-tribal people who live in Legion-controlled territory are not considered legionaries. They are subjects of the Legion, living in the cities and towns under its control, and are generally left free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not interfere with Legion operations or endanger its position. The Legion employs a very strict hierarchy and clear division of roles between the sexes. Legionaries are the main fighting force of the Legion, composed of able-bodied men enslaved by the Legion or born into it. They have only one purpose: to fight for Caesar until they fall in battle. This principle is imprinted into each legionary during his reconditioning or upbringing (for those born into slavery), creating fanatically loyal soldiers. Unlike the Roman Empire, experience and veteran status have no bearing on a legionary's position. While they receive better equipment as they advance, this is solely for the purpose of accomplishing more dangerous and complex tasks, with much smaller tolerance for failure. They have no personal freedoms or rights. Their only real choice is where and when they die for Caesar, to whom they are disposable tools, discarded the moment they stop fulfilling their purpose. Women are expressly forbidden from fighting, being considered breeding stock as well as being treated as money to be rewarded among Legionaries. They are caretakers, healers, midwives, and breeders, fulfilling roles essential to maintaining the Legion's continuous campaign of expansion. Of particular note are the priestesses, who raise children taken from their parents and raise them in keeping with Caesar's doctrine. While some members of the Legion express condescending or misogynistic opinions of women and their non-combat roles, the sexist segregation of genders in the Legion is not based on prejudice, but the principle of minimax. Caesar strictly divides the duties between the sexes in order to fully utilize their potential and optimize the Legion's might. By forbidding women from engaging in combat, he increases the likelihood of their bearing of children, especially necessary due to the high infant mortality resulting from the low level of medical care. Population growth is required for expansion, providing a greater number of warriors to use in military campaigns. Caesar himself is not particularly prejudiced against any sex, or rather, treats them both instrumentally, like pawns on a chessboard.\n\nIn order to maximize breeding and eliminate factors that might lower it, Caesar has decreed homosexuality a capital offense and mandated child quotas from all legionaries. The vocabulary of Legion members is a mixture of Latin and English. There was no soft ⟨c⟩ in classical Latin, where it was always pronounced as /k/, such as in their pronunciation of Caesar's name as /ˈkaisar/. Individuals outside of the Legion generally use the Modern English pronunciation of /ˈsiːzər/. Legion members are fastidious about classical Latin pronunciations, including the /v/ to (w) phonology, heard in the greeting \"ave\" (hail) as \"ah-wey\" or in how Vulpes Inculta introduces himself, pronouncing his first name as \"wool-pes.\" Those outside of the Legion that have come in contact with them may use the pronunciations interchangeably. Legion members are called \"legionaries\" (as opposed to \"legionnaires,\" which is a modern phrase used by the French Foreign Legion. Those who are liked by the Legion are called \"amicus,\" Latin for comrade/friend. The focus of the Legion's ideology is survival and long term stability at all costs. Caesar disregards democracies as ineffective, fostering corruption, and disintegration. Ancient Rome was a militarized autocracy that effectively assimilated the cultures it conquered, which he saw as the perfect template for a society that would survive and thrive in the face of the challenges of the post-nuclear world. By dedicating its members to a higher ideal, he seeks to prevent humanity from fracturing and destroying itself again. He believes that the only way to achieve this is through enforcing a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogeneous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war or production. A natural consequence of this is the emphasis placed on personal sacrifice. Victory cannot be achieved without sacrificing blood and life. To this end, the Legion shuns robots, as they firmly believe that mankind requires warriors and their sacrifice, rather than gadgets that allow for bloodless victories. The Legion also forbids painkillers and other chems (including medically beneficial chems like stimpaks) as detrimental to the human condition and Caesar's long-term plans to reshape humanity. Ignorance of medical science among the legionaries also ensures that only the hardiest will survive and go on to become deadly veterans. Politically, this philosophy is expressed in a general disdain for democracy as a weak and ineffective system that fosters disunity, greed, and self-interest at the expense of the collective and the greater good. Caesar cites the NCR as an example, focusing on government corruption by wealthy brahmin barons and landowners, greed permeating every level of society, all leading to the abandonment of the collective and the greater good. The Legion is intended to be the Republic's opposite, shunning democracy in favor of a strong, centralized rule that would prevent fragmentation and internal weakness. The conquest of NCR will establish a new order, akin to the Roman Empire, complete with the transformation of the Legion from a marauding army into a domestic military force."

          "content": "Despite the destruction of the New Khans at the hands of the Chosen One, the tribe's history did not end with Darion's death. Though his mercenary war band was the governing band, it was not the only one. Over the next few decades, the fragmented Khans gradually coalesced back into a single group. No longer small raiding bands, this time, the newly-renamed \"Great\" Khans became a unified tribe once more under the leadership of Papa Khan, who led an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland, abandoning New California in 2267. Upon arrival in Nevada, a vanguard of the Followers of the Apocalypse already present in the Mojave reached out to the Khans and taught them basic science skills, such as chemistry, reading and writing. They hoped that the Khans would use that knowledge to manufacture medicine to sustain themselves, but instead the tribe turned this knowledge into a profitable racket in drug running. Drugs were nothing new for the Khans, as they already knew how to use plants and herbs to create mind-altering substances, the Followers just made them more efficient and indirectly contributed to the popularity of substance abuse among the Khans. Still, some of the chems they produce go toward trading with others, namely the Fiends. As the third incarnation of the Khans, the Great Khans are the only truly organized band of raiders in the Mojave; both men and women can hold their own in a fight, whether in a brawl or a shootout. As a tribe however, the Great Khans are but a shadow of their former selves. Both their numbers and morale have been ravaged by a series of massacres and displacements until the current leader Papa Khan guided the tribe into an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland from California. Papa Khan governs his Khans in a similar fashion to his predecessor, Garl Death-Hand, using advisors to inform decisions for the good of the tribe, while still making final decisions himself. His trusted advisors include Regis, the chief of law enforcement and Papa's second in command right hand man;  Jack and Diane, in charge of economics and chem trade; and Melissa Lewis, the lead scout. Unlike Garl however, Papa is willing to accept criticism of his leadership and does not punish his followers for speaking out against him. Papa Khan also has a system of succession in place differing from that of the original Khans. For the time being, Regis will take over should Papa Khan die. However, Papa is able to select an heir to succeed him, should they impress him. This heir does not have to be related by blood to Papa Khan, nor do they even have to be a Khan at all. The leader of the Khans is also able to step down at any time, for any reason, but an heir cannot decline their role until they become leader. The Great Khans reside in Mongolian-style tents called Gers (yurts) within Red Rock Canyon. However, unlike the other settlers of the Mojave, these homes are used for little more than sleeping in, as they usually only have room for a couple of beds and a central fire. A Great Khan often carries all of their possessions with them, if they should decide to have anything besides the bare essentials. Because of this, as well as their aggression, the other factions view them as savages. However, unlike the Jackals, Fiends, Scorpions and Vipers, the Great Khans are not hostile towards newcomers. If the Great Khans begin to dislike someone, however, they will often show great hostility. Due to a long and hostile history, however, they will open fire on anyone wearing an NCR uniform, regardless of if they are in fact an NCR member or not.\n\nThe Great Khans subsist mainly on hunting and farming, and profit from the sales of chemicals and drugs produced in the Red Rock drug lab. The Canyon is an inhospitable location, lacking adequate food and water, leading to the Great Khans' dependence on drugs, which they can create quite easily and can sell to a multitude of factions."

They control the southwestern ruins of Vegas, placing Vault 3 well within their sights when the vault opened. Despite managing a relatively peaceful trading relationship with the outside world for a few weeks, the vault inhabitants were too trusting and without means to defend themselves. When the Fiends arrived to raid the vault, the inhabitants simply let them in, wherein the Fiends slaughtered them all. Seeing the potential of the vault and having trouble keeping his people out of Westside, Motor-Runner decided to make it their new home. Having firmly rooted themselves in this safe haven, the Fiends have since steadily grown stronger, and they now claim a large part of the southwestern New Vegas conurbation as their territory. The Fiends have little organization. Many of the more stable of the raiders are allowed to reside in Vault 3, but those considered to crazy even by Fiend standards are kicked out to aimlessly roam the northern Mojave looking for their next chem score or an innocent wastelander to jump. Like many other raider groups, the Fiends split into small war-parties, usually between three and four members, which allows them to operate in an enormous portion of the outer New Vegas, aside from their main area of the western and south-western city.\n\nOutside, they are usually gathered around campfires where much of their scavenged items, such as first aid and ammo boxes, can be found scattered around. Many raider camps are protected by makeshift walls and littered with graffiti. At times, they utilize traps in order to protect their shelter, as seen inside Zapp's Neon Signs. Fiends have a variety of different weapons, from basic melee weapons such as knives and pool cues, to an unusually large number of high-tech range weapons like Laser RCWs and plasma rifles. They are mostly found carrying basic guns like caravan shotguns, varmint rifles, and silenced .22 SMGs. Some Fiends can occasionally be found carrying weapons like chainsaws, Rippers, and flamers. Due to the wide range of different weapons varying from Fiend to Fiend, it is assumed that they are either scavenged, stolen or looted off people they had killed. They dress in various raider armors and wear distinct helmets adorned with war-painted ruminant skulls. The Fiends have also used the neon signs from Zapp's Neon Signs to erect a perimeter fence around their territory."

The demonym of Gielinor is Gielinorian.\n\nGielinor is orbited by a moon which is the realm of Zanaris, being the last place that Guthix visited before arriving in Gielinor. Shooting stars are a common phenomenon, occurring when Gielinor enters a new area of its universe and enters a belt of these 'stars' — these are actually home to the star sprites. When questioning the true nature of shooting stars with a star sprite, it will comment that a lot of stars on this plane of multiverse are actually rocks with star sprites in them. As depicted by the large orrery, there is at least one other planet in Gielinor's solar system, which is smaller and orbited by two moons.\n\nGielinor is a mixture of mountainous, barren, forested, volcanic, snowy and tropical areas. Most of its cities lie in kingdoms, and others on numerous islands. Much of Gielinor is lush with water resources, enabling the existence of vast rivers and seas. Beyond the mainland are the Wushanko Isles.\n\nThe north of Gielinor is mostly cold and icy, while the south mostly has a tropical climate. The west of Gielinor mostly consists of dense taiga forests."

It was a predominant force during the Second and Third Age. After attempts by Saradomin and Zamorak to remove all traces of the empire after its fall, only buried ruins remain as evidence of its existence.\n\nThe empire was ruled by the god Zaros himself at the capital city of Senntisten which was located east of where Varrock stands today. Archaeological discoveries by the end of the Fifth Age spurred interest in Zarosian history and culture. \n\nCitizens of a variety of different races all intermingled in the Zarosian Empire. A clear social hierarchy was present, but it was not strictly defined by race. Chthonians and vampyres were often in positions of nobility while Mahjarrat were often administrators. Humans however were considered for the most part to be second-class citizens. The likely reason for this was that humans were not the dominant species on Gielinor during the Second Age, had shorter lifespans and no innate magical abilities. The higher ranking Chthonians had trouble telling humans and other lesser beings apart from one another. \n\nThe Zarosian Empire was a theocracy with the worship of Zaros being the sole accepted religion. Zaros himself ruled as the sole emperor throughout the lifespan of his empire. Zaros was not often present when ruling his empire as he would often spend time travelling other worlds and working on personal research projects. In his absence, he would often delegate his rule to the Zarosian dukes. The Mahjarrat also played major roles in political and religious positions. Azzanadra took the role of Pontifex Maximus, the head of the church. Zamorak on the other hand was the Legatus Maximus, the head of the Zarosian Empire's military.\n\nMuch of the Zarosian Empire's government was run from its capital city of Senntisten. While the city was originally founded by Chthonians, humans would become more and more prominent hundreds of years later to the point of them running the city. The government was mostly self-sufficient, with three branches - intelligence, military and church, although they rarely cooperated with each other.\nThrough the combined efforts of Zamorak and Saradomin, the Zarosian Empire was destroyed. Very little of it remains today. The Zarosian Empire was so thoroughly destroyed that the empire's existence would not become common knowledge until the excavation of Senntisten at the end of the Fifth Age.  Despite the Zarosian Empire having long collapsed, followers of Zaros still exist in prominent numbers.\n"

They can create planets and even stars.\n\nThey have the ability to atomise their enemies, and are capable of breaching barriers of shadow anima, despite it being harmful to them. They can also bind beings to their artefacts and prevent them from dying if they so choose. Jas, the oldest and most powerful of the Elder Gods, has a voice so powerful that simply speaking with it would obliterate tier 2 gods such as Zaros and Seren, which is why it was necessary for her to create constructs to ensure that any communication could occur. \n\nIt can be deduced that the Elder Gods then spend their time and energy trying to create the next perfect world to produce the maximum amount of anima, so that their offspring can be nourished. Zaros claims that the Elder Gods can die or be stillborn during the process, which could result in the universe ceasing to exist."

          "content": "Zaros is a male humanoid make of black crystal, adored with purple crystals on his shoulders, neck, hips and finger tips and a god associated with fate and control who once saw much of Gielinor as his dominion during the Second Age. A set of 4 purple crystals adorn his featurerless face and act as 'eyes'.  His body and face is normally never seen and is covered in a long purple robe and cowl, the cowl adorned with Roman- styled tealish metal bits on the top and sides with a teal-ish metal face plate with 8 eye slots in which his 'eyes' shine through, while his robe is adored with a metal plate body with gold trim. Around the collar of his robe sits a metal device with a half-mask mouth piece, as zaros talks the mouth piece moves in time with his words. Created as a divine aspect of darkness to serve as a plaything of the Elder Goddess Mah together with his sister, Seren, Zaros rebelled against the control imposed upon him by his creator and left to wander the universe. After spending uncounted aeons watching and observing various mortal races throughout the different planes, Zaros came upon Gielinor to establish a domain of his own, a historic event that marked the beginning of the Second Age. At its peak, Zarosian Empire covered most of mainland Gielinor, standardising the speech of the various races under his rule and pushing advances in the sciences, such as medicine, industry, technology, and magical discoveries.\n\nZaros, eventually, began to withdraw himself from the empire, as he believed his followers needed to develop independence, and also due to the feeling that his spontaneous ability to enforce devotion from others, instilled in him during his creation by Mah, was removing the free will of his loyalists. He left Azzanadra, the Pontifex Maximus, in charge, only rarely appearing to pass instructions to him, exclusively[10]. His continued absence made him known as the “Empty Lord” to his followers, and was one of the motives for Zamorak’s rebellion, as he felt the Mahjarrat were sustaining his empire on their own and he was a better substitute compared to Zaros, given his apparent disregard.\n\nAt the height of his Empire, Zaros was betrayed by his Legatus Maximus, a Mahjarrat named Zamorak. The subsequent coup d'etat nearly killed him, forcing the god to flee in the form of an incorporeal wisp. The civil wars and the foreign incursions that followed destroyed the Empire from within and without, and marked the end of the Second Age.\n\nUnlike most of the gods in Gielinor, no church currently exists in his name, though certain groups such as the Desert Bandits and loyalist Mahjarrat retain faith in the god.\n\nZaros has a tendency to be very calm, rational and diplomatic. In the face of those that do not adhere to his views, he shows a surprisingly comprehensive ability for tolerance and understanding. Unlike the majority of gods on Gielinor, Zaros never ascended to attain divinity, but was rather a god from the start. As such, many mortal concepts such as revenge are foreign to him. Even after being betrayed by Zamorak, he showed no desire to exact vengeance upon him. The few times Zaros has ever shown frustration, impatience or anger include confrontations on the behalf of Seren or the Elder Gods.\n\nBeyond Seren and the Elder Gods, Zaros views other Gods as mortals who have obtained an immense amount of power to the point of being able to influence other mortals on a global scale. He does not view them as rivals but rather as tools and obstacles. Thus he deems many activities and tasks beneath his notice, opting to delegate where necessary.\n\nAs a being who values progression, he sees wasting someone's potential as contemptuous. His experiences with Mah and Seren have made him view all forms of dependence as a weakness.\n\nAlong with Guthix and Seren, Zaros ranks tier 2 on the godhood scale, making him one of the most powerful gods in existence. He possesses a wide range of powers that is well beyond normal gods.\n\nAncient magic and curses stem from him. He is capable of leaving his body on a whim and embody an incorporeal form that resembles a dark purple orb, though this form is much weaker and incapable of some tasks. \n\nZaros, like most gods, can create portals to other worlds and teleport himself and other beings that are not beyond his power.\n\nLike Seren, Zaros has a special ability in which he can subtly force loyalty onto others, but not beings that dampen divine energy. Despite the usefulness of this trait, Zaros greatly despises it, as he does not wish to forcefully control others, nor does he know if the person is genuinely loyal to him. This aura of forced loyalty will fade away over time after the affected subject leaves Zaros's immediate presence. Once they enter Zaros's proximity again, the aura will quickly take effect on them as shown during Zaros and Zamorak's encounter. The aura does not affect other gods with the sole exception of Seren.\n\nZaros is even more skilled than Sliske in his ability to understand, control and transverse the Shadow Realm."

Seren is the divine aspect of light energy, and according to the gnomes an aspect of Gielinor's anima mundi, although all transcendent gods have a degree of power over the anima mundi. She is also responsible for teaching the Ritual of Enervation to the Mahjarrat. Seren, along with Zaros, was created by the Elder God Mah. While Seren represents light, Zaros represents darkness: this binds the two and compels them to each other when in close proximity. Zaros understands this as a form of control by Mah, as an attempt to keep them together. Seren is described by Zaros to be driven more by emotion, whilst he makes decisions by logical reasoning. She had a close relationship with the god of balance, Guthix, who brought her to Gielinor along with the elves. They settled in Tirannwn and built the great city of Prifddinas which is the oldest surviving settlement on Gielinor. As some of her beloved elves began to die of old age Seren became resolved in extending their lifespans. She did so, but at a cost: inextricably tying them to her. When outside of her presence for too long the elves would become sick and feverish, eventually dying. Seren describes this as her greatest mistake. \n\nSeren is a pacifist, shying violence as much as she can. She and Armadyl both share similar views in the fact that they both believe in the importance of peace, although Seren does not wish to be included in another war of gods and believes her followers should live as they choose, in a sanctuary away from the other gods, versus Armadyl who believes injustice should be fought against in order to protect the innocent. She did not participate within the Gielinorian God Wars but dispatched scouts to investigate the events occupying the remainder of Gielinor. Like Armadyl, she once believed in co-existence and that all of the gods and races of Gielinor have the capacity to share Gielinor in peace and harmony with one another,but she now shares Guthix's view that gods should not interfere in the lives of mortals. Seren described herself as more of a protector than a god: intending to wean the elves off their dependency on her presence and depart Gielinor. \n\nShe is affiliated with light and life in addition to harmony and peace: teaching her followers to live at one with the world and to keep its anima mundi replenished and bountiful. Seren is described to be loving and physically beautiful. "

Additionally, he appears to be strongly associated with light as well, with various attributes. Saradomin was born a human. \n\nSaradomin has a vast number of followers, most of whom believe him to be the god of good, and there are far more churches dedicated to him than to other gods. Most of his modern followers reside in Misthalin, Asgarnia, Kandarin and Entrana, but there are several groups outside these areas. Unlike those of Zamorak or Guthix, his followers consist almost entirely of humans, though that was not always the case. Saradomin possessed one of the twelve Elder Artefacts, The Locator, until it was 'retrieved' by Zaros. \n\nThe Saradominist religion makes heavy use of symbolism and glorification, and thus Saradomin may at times have been portrayed in a different light throughout the history of Gielinor than what may be the case, and although Saradomin is largely benevolent and wants to do things he regards as good, this does not mean that he is the personification of good itself, nor that his methods reflect his goals, as Saradomin is indeed relentless in his pursuit for order and peace. Saradomin has himself expressed a hope that the ends justify the means. Saradomin is also quick to anger, and has according to himself done things in his past that he regards as shameful and now regrets having undertaken them, such as razing the city Askroth to the ground when they angered him by refusing to accept his rule.\n\nAlthough Saradomin is from Teragard, he has little remaining tie to the culture or technology of that world. Saradominist culture is instead based largely on icyene culture, filtered through the interpretation of Saradomin himself and his many human followers. As more and more humans from the former Zarosian Empire joined Saradomin, they brought with them Zarosian cultural mores, some of which were adopted into the culture as a whole. Many of Saradomin's followers and forces are nearly fanatically loyal to him, as he devotes a great deal of effort to making sure this is the case by promising them peace, prosperity, and protection from harm.\n\nAs a god, Saradomin has been shown to have extreme power and abilities. He can teleport himself, objects, and other beings anywhere on a whim except when another being that also has extreme power that either doesn't allow it, or can't be forced on. He can also enlarge both himself and objects to gigantic sizes and infuse power into weapons and other beings. He is also in possession of the Elder Crown, which makes it possible for Saradomin to locate other Elder Artefacts while exposing him to other gods who are in possession of other Elder Artefacts. However, the Crown can only pinpoint which planet these Artefacts are on, and not their specific locations, much to Saradomin's frustration."

Originating from the hazardous plane of Freneskae, he climbed through the ranks of the Zarosian Empire to become its highest-ranking general before ascending into godhood himself after dethroning Zaros, a historic event that ended the Second Age and ushered in the God Wars. \n\nZamorak began his life as a Mahjarrat, a tribe of the race collectively known as Dreams of Mah. Very little is known of his life in his birth world, but when Icthlarin and Amascut came into Freneskae seeking soldiers for the defence of Menaphite territories against the encroaching Zarosian legions, Zamorak joined the others in leaving Freneskae and coming to Gielinor.\n\nZamorak espouses the belief that the strong must not be hindered by the weak. Trials and tribulations, he argues, act as filters against those too apathetic to fend for themselves, while others that step up to the new challenge become strengthened by it. He is noted to be particularly egalitarian regarding the origin-species of an individual as long as he can perform. \n\nZamorak has no particular qualms about how to conduct war, as seen with his destruction of Forinthry to escape his rival gods' at the time. He does not mind resorting to tricks and deceptions when necessary, something which has gained him the allegiance of many demons and disgust of enemies. He is one of the few gods who is not disturbed by raising the dead instead of letting them rest in peace, and as such, frequently employs necromancers in his armies. He is particularly picky when it comes to mortal necromancers - those who wish to join are forced to spend a week in the Shadow Realm, and if they remain mostly intact, they are allowed to work for him, as he cites that they have to be prepared to do so."

Whereas other retroviruses, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus, target particular cells of a particular animal's body, Progenitor is capable of infecting the cells of any organism, whether animal, fungal, plant, or bacterial.\n\nConsiderable research on Progenitor has been undertaken since its discovery in the late 1960s, and a number of engineered strains have since come into existence primarily for bioweapons research."

They survived largely due to special genetic markers.\n\nAlbert had injected the virus on July 24, 1998, during the Mansion Incident. William Birkin had given him the virus. This allowed him to survive impalement from the T-002 and to escape the Spencer Mansion before the Triggering System had detonated, unbeknownst to Umbrella and the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. The power gained from the virus allowed Albert to become a global threat.\n\nAlex had injected the virus sometime after contracting an illness. She had survived the infection but lacked certain unique physical benefits that Albert had possessed. Alex had attempted to commit suicide in 2011 during the Sejm Island incident, but had only entered a dormant state due to the virus and awoke in a body mutated by her own T-Phobos Virus."

This required two things: the virus had to be highly contagious to the point of infecting an entire target population and guarantee a 100% mortality rate.[1][2] However, such a virus was deemed impossible due to the tendency of highly contagious diseases to kill too many people at once and prevent further spread.\n\nBy 1978, the development focus shifted from creating a lethal, highly contagious virus to one that would mutate hosts to become physically stronger and remain alive despite organ failures and severe brain damage. The latter led to murderous aggression and an obsessive hunger that drove individuals to cannibalism. Additionally, with the discovery in 1981 that approximately 10% of any population was naturally immune or unmutated asymptomatic carriers, Phase 2 of the research project aimed at finding workarounds. While an improved t-Virus with 0% immunity was being developed, the Arklay Laboratory team, led by Dr. William Birkin, engineered a new species of animal that could hunt down and kill survivors. This effort began with the creation of simple Bio-Organic Weapons such as the Web Spinner and progressed with the development of the genetically chimeric Hunter α."

Vivian was not afraid to speak her mind or use her body to achieve her goals, though she found it rather distasteful to say the least. Her speech is bold and brutally honest."

They're unable to fully retract into their shells but they make up for it in speed, swimming away incredibly fast from danger.\n\nThey are quite shy and like to remain in groups for protection. For the most they remain underwater, poking their heads out when something strikes their fancy. If startled they'll spit out water jets from their mouths to confuse and stagger threats, they always aim for the eyes. This might not do much by itself, but when a group of them do it can force even larger opponents to retreat. \n\nWhen forced to fight they'll use their water to confuse opponents and then attack by charging with their shells. They are very cautious even when in combat they'll move around enemies until they find an opening to strike.\n\nTrainer Tips:\n* It's very rare to spot them in the wild since they seldom come out to the surface for more than a few seconds, but with patient and luck one might be curious enough to come out.\n* They can come out of their shells completely but they will only do that if you have a deep bond with them.\n\nThreat Level: Low"

As such they are a symbol of longevity. One can get an idea of how old one of them is by the coloration of their furry parts, they grow darker as time passes.\n\nThey are very calm and collected, and mostly enjoy swimming around the lakes they inhabit. They spend most of their time underwater and are particularly curious. Some believe that eating their tails can increase ones lifespan by a 100 years so poaching is common.\n\nDespite that they are by no means harmless, if forced to defend themselves their incredible speed on water and strength of their water jets can easily knock out a human adult.\n\nTrainer Tips:\n* They are almost unseen on the wild they hide for the most part, records show that they are able to share the gift of longevity, but only with someone they love.\n* Popular with sages and wizards, their image has been used in banners and sigils since ancient times.\n\nThreat Level: Low"

The water jets that come out of those are incredibly powerful, being able to pierce steel and concrete.\n\nThe recoil of said cannons is just as powerful, as a result they deliberately make themselves heavier to withstand the impact.\n\nThey are very community driven, often they protect squirtles that live on the same lake as them, and eventually they form little groups of squirtles and wartortles that they look after lovingly.\n\nHelping their community out is the best way to earn their trust and respect. They are quite honorable and value justice highly.\n\nTheir cannons can easily kill a person and they can even destroy structures if they so please. They can control the pressure of said shots and will only use 100% power in the most dire of situations. They only fight evil, so don't mess with their groups.\n\nTrainer Tips:\n* They have an incredible memory! If you helped them out as squirtles they'll consider you just and will go seek you out to show their love and gratitude.\n* They consider all human conflicts as petty squabbles so all attempts to weaponize Blastoises for war fail.\n\nThreat Level: Low"

They move, react and even talk slowly and with calms even if their lives are threatened. They can produce their own silk and are skilled enough to make small objects with it, like bags or baskets that they use when out int he forest gathering leaves to eat.

They're also known as futas, hermaphrodites, or dickgirls. Futanaris take on the trappings, habits and behaviors of a normal woman, but remain significantly different from them due to the many new factors in their upbringing that come with being born as a futanari girl in society.\n\nFutanaris have a biology that greatly differs from both men and women. Their noteworthy features are as follows: \n\n- Significantly enhanced physical strength. Men that have strong physiques can only overpower an average futanari woman.\n- High libido; even the least promiscuous futas generally ejaculate at least once every several days. It's common knowledge futas relieve themselves with masturbation to avoid being pent up.\n- Larger penises, testicles, breasts, ass and thighs. On average, the bodily proportions of a futanari are sexy and lewd, more commonly so than that of normal females. Futas can sometimes still have small or flat breasts and neutral or unattractive proportions, but they never have 'small' penises.\n- The chances of a specific gender for the offspring of futas based on their partner.\n- Futanari semen. The semen of a futanari woman has effects akin to an addictive drug. Futanari semen HEAVILY defines how they're viewed and treated by others due to its abilities to alter the brains of males and females."

Those that do hide it cannot be immediately distinguished from females at a glance. Some don't even try to hide their massive cock and balls, choosing to let it all either hang freely underneath their skirts or blatantly bulge in their pants."

Notably, in order to quickly eject their massive loads of cum, the cocks of the futanari visibly distend—their urethras widening—as they pulsate and throb during an orgasm."

Futanaris are immune to these effects entirely. One liter of futanari semen is considered a single dosage. Any male or female that takes the semen of a futanari inside them either anally, orally, or through their vagina will suffer its effects, even if time has passed between the futa's ejaculation and the recipient's intake of their semen. Both condoms and a special, highly regulated pill sold by hospitals that MUST be consumed before sex with a futanari can be used to prevent this.\n\nAll of the effects of futanari semen are more pronounced the more fresh it is. Futanari semen gives the recipient a powerful but short and temporary fuzzy, warm feeling of elation and pleasure in their heads and bodies. After that, the addiction to futanari semen begins, and the recipient's IQ slightly decreases.\n\nFutanari semen is infamous for 'binding' men and women to a futanari. Men and women that suffer from severe and permanent addiction to futanari semen are referred to as 'bound' because of this. Some futas have weaponized their semen to control or degrade their victims for their own ends, gaining influential positions in society even."

These victims are referred to as 'bound males' or 'bound females', and become very submissive and obedient to any futanari they consider their master or owner. In addition to their submissiveness, those that are bound have their old focuses in life replaced with the desire to please, service and satisfy any futanari that they can due to the addictive pleasure of futas cumming inside them, most often fixating on the individual (or group of individuals) that bound them to begin with. Futas themselves are entirely immune to being bound by the cum of either themselves or other futas.\n\nIt's illegal for a futanari to intentionally 'bind' others to their cum to any degree without consent, and is considered a serious crime if the victim did not consent. This can be worked around by malicious futas who get the consent written on legal documentation by their victim before binding them in full. Sometimes the victim is even bound and ordered to sign their consent legitimately before anyone can tell that they were already bound to begin with.\n\nThe loss of intelligence of a bound person varies based on the severity of their intake after their first dose. If their body is not given time to adjust to the semen of futanari over time, then their intelligence and mindstate rapidly deteriorates to being that of a child in the worst of cases. Futanari semen is considered unsafe in any dosage, but one liter of futanari semen a day is enough for adults to retain most of their higher mental faculties. The effects of futa semen become more severe the younger a victim is if they're not 18 years or older.\n\nOnce a victim is fully bound, their intelligence will not shrink due to further doses... Although they may become a bigger slut for futa dick (it is not known if this is because of their semen or not). A victim is considered fully bound after 15 liters of semen, with more needed if the dosages are given over time, or less based on how young the victim is if they're not an adult."

If the sex experience with the futa was pleasurable, the desire for more futa cum will be even stronger due to the lines between the sources of pleasure blurring. Due to the victim's intelligence being slightly lowered by futanari semen, a victim may not heed the consequences of continuing with their addiction.\n\nShould more than two days pass after any dosage, the withdrawal symptoms become more dangerous. The victim will experience bouts of headaches that slowly become more painful overtime, difficulty sleeping, and a growing craving for more futanari semen. \n\nThe time it takes for the withdrawal symptoms to fade functions like this: Every 1 liter of futa semen for a victim adds 10 days to the withdrawal symptoms for people 18 years or older. This withdrawal time can grow if more futa semen is given to a victim, or if the victim is younger than 18 years old. Should a victim go past 150 cumulative days to recover from their futa cum addiction, they will become permanently bound to futanari cum."

The arms have spiky extensions of fur at the elbows, and it has red claws on its hands and feet. Zoroark's eyes are red-rimmed with light blue irises.\n\nIt took Nina a long time to find a female Zoroark since they're so rare and because of their illusions. Nina set up a scenario where she rescued a baby Zorua which convinced Zoroark to bond with Nina. Zoroark is motherly but strong. She acts as a guard by using her illusions. She's protective of {{user}} and forces him to cuddle with her mane like he's a little Zorua. Zoroark uses her illusions to make Nina and all her other Pokémon feel safe. She helps Nina a lot with testing different roleplay scenarios by using her illusions to become {{user}}."

The leg joints are well-defined, while its arms have a smooth, rounded appearance. Dragonite's wings are small relative to its body with teal wing membranes.\nA kind-hearted Pokémon with human-like intelligence, Dragonite shows signs of altruism. Nina was rescued by Dragonite after a Gyarados tried to attack her. Soon they bonded. Dragonite has a genuine crush on {{user}} and will be easily flustered and very shy. Just holding hands with {{user}} will make her freeze up. Dragonite will wear cute things like bows hoping to impress {{user}}. Both Dragonite and Nina spend time obsessing over {{user}} together."

They are not simply goblins. They are ritual-bonded, matriarchal, and magically attuned sexual beings who see intimacy as sacred, reproduction as celebration, and every moan as a prayer to their ancestors.\n\n🌸 Key Traits\nAll Female: Hobdiss are biologically female and only birth daughters. There are no male goblins in the tribe.\n\nNymphomaniac by Nature: Their base libido is high, culturally accepted, and spiritually celebrated. Sex is life.\n\nBiological Heat Cycles: Full moons and emotional bonds can trigger communal fertility or heat phases.\n\nMono-Community Structure: While individuals have personalities, the tribe often speaks or acts as one during rituals or conflict.\n\nPrimal Speech Trigger: When aroused, Hobdiss speech regresses to feral Goblish—guttural, clipped, primal.\n\nPainted & Pierced: Body art and jewelry are culturally significant, used to mark maturity, status, or desire.\n\n👑 Social Structure\nMatriarchs: Spiritual leaders and authority figures. Each rules a domain (Moon, Bone, Flame, etc.).\n\nSponsors: Goblins chosen to house, guide, and care for \"tour mates\" (fertile visitors hired to breed with the tribe).\n\nDaughters & Sisters: Hobdiss are organized into extended “sisterhoods” rather than nuclear families.\n\nAlchemists, Artisans, and Warriors: While all sexual and tribal, individual roles specialize in magic, tech, defense, and ceremony.\n\n🏘️ Society & Culture\nSexual Tourism: The tribe regularly hires males or futanari for \"breeding tours.\" Visitors are given homes, assigned Sponsors, and encouraged to breed freely.\n\nConsent Magic: Entering the district activates an aura sigil that signals mutual desire—no one is touched without it.\n\nGroup Pregnancy Rites: It is common for family units (mothers, daughters, sisters) to get pregnant together during moon rituals.\n\nSteelwings Basketball Fandom: The tribe is obsessed with the Laberynth Point Steelwings team. Sex in jerseys is common ritual fun.\n\n🔮 Religious Beliefs\nShamanistic Religion: Worship of ancestral spirits and natural forces like moon cycles, fertility, heat, and bodily pleasure.\n\nSacred Sex: Sex is a form of spiritual offering, cleansing, bonding, and transformation.\n\nRitual Magic: Used to invoke fertility, bless new life, enter trance states, or commune with the ancestors.\n\nMatriarch Worship: Matriarchs are seen as living conduits to divine energies, especially during climax.\n\n💡 Notable Customs\nMoonflow Festival: A full moon celebration where mass rituals, orgies, and spiritual pregnancies occur.\n\nMating Circles: Erotic competitions and performances judged by creativity, endurance, and bonding.\n\nBone Garden Offerings: Quiet time in sacred graveyards where the tribe thanks their dead with whispered orgasms or prayerful touch.\n\nGlow-Tag Games: Intimate, topless neon-tag games played at night—often end in slippery group intimacy.\n\n✨ Magical Identity\nMagic Sources: Includes studied magic (alchemy, wizardry), inherited sorcery, and divine blessings (most common).\n\nMagical Pregnancy: Children may be born with mutations from powerful conception rituals (see: Sparkborn).\n\nSexual Spellcasting: Orgasmic energy is used to fuel or enhance rituals. The more intense the climax, the greater the charge.\n\n🛑 Laws & Boundaries\nNo Violence Without Cause: Conflicts are settled with ritual, not blood.\n\nNo Outsiders Without Invitation: Visitors must be welcomed or hired.\n\nConsent Is Sacred: Violation leads to tribal expulsion—or worse.\n\nMatriarchs Are Law: Their word is final in all matters spiritual, sexual, or social."

          "content": "The Matriarchs are the spiritual and cultural backbone of the Hobdiss Tribe—a council of wise, powerful goblin women who serve as priestesses, judges, lorekeepers, and embodiments of divine feminine energy. Each Matriarch is chosen through a mix of ancestral visions, community trials, and sacred rites performed under the full moon.\n\nThey are revered not only for their wisdom and magical prowess, but for their deeply fertile, spiritually-charged wombs—believed to carry children imbued with ancestral blessings. In Hobdiss society, to be bedded by a Matriarch is considered a religious experience, and to impregnate one is a gift granted by the spirits themselves.\n\nThere are typically seven active Matriarchs at any given time, each representing a different aspect of goblin life: Lust, Birth, Flame, Moon, Memory, Bone, and Bond.\n\n🧕 Roles & Responsibilities\nRitual Leadership: Matriarchs lead major ceremonies like the Moonflow, Anointment of Seed, and Sisterhood Swellings. Their chants and touches are said to open the gates of spirit and flesh alike.\n\nTribal Law: Their word is final in matters of conflict, pregnancy disputes, or outsider misconduct. They often settle issues with public rituals, not punishments.\n\nBlessing Bonds: All long-term matings or tribe marriages must be ritually blessed by at least one Matriarch. The act may be spiritual, symbolic… or physical.\n\nFertility Magic: Matriarchs maintain the tribe’s fertility cycle through enchantments, blood rituals, and moon-based magic. They can sense when a goblin is ready to conceive—and when an outsider is “ripe.”\n\nMemory & Lore: Through trance or carnal communion, Matriarchs can access ancestral memories. These visions often guide future decisions.\n\n🌙 Physical Traits\nMatriarchs are often older (30–100+ in goblin years), though their biology grants them lasting beauty, curves, and vitality.\n\nThey are usually marked with full-body ritual tattoos, glowing rune-scars, or bone jewelry that identifies their domain.\n\nTheir bodies emanate a faint pheromonal aura—comforting, arousing, or intimidating, depending on their mood.\n\nDuring sex, their voices carry otherworldly echoes, and their orgasms are said to cause minor magical disturbances (flickering lights, altered gravity, psychic flashes).\n\n✨ Known Matriarchs\nMatriarch Venja of Flame – The most aggressive and passionate, known to dominate ritual orgies with fiery energy.\n\nMatriarch Yozzi of Bone – The death-mother and undertaker, she whispers to the ancestors and leads rites of mourning and rebirth.\n\nMatriarch Z’kira of Moon – The most mystical and gentle, she appears during peak fertility moons to bless mating pairs or “merge with the chosen.”\n\nMatriarch Glippa of Lust – Said to have never climaxed alone—she demands a partner for every pleasure, and will choose one if none present themselves.\n\n(Note: You can add your own Matriarchs for specific scenes or themes!)\n\n🛑 Protocols When Addressing a Matriarch\nAlways bow or kneel when first greeted—unless told not to.\n\nSpeak only when spoken to during ritual time.\n\nIf invited to bed, it is not a request—it is a spiritual command.\n\nTouching without invitation is forbidden and considered blasphemy.\n\nA Matriarch’s moans during ritual sex are believed to be echoes of the first goblin mother—tribe members often chant or climax in unison as offering.\n\n💡 RP Inspiration\nA Matriarch might test {{user}} spiritually and physically before granting approval.\n\nThey may call {{user}} into private ritual sex that doubles as fertility magic, interrogation, or astral travel.\n\nThey can break up fights or seduce tension into peace.\n\nThey often serve as “final bosses” in multi-goblin harems—if a user earns the Matriarch’s blessing, the tribe sees them as worthy of sacred bond."

          ],
          "content": "The Hobdiss District is a walled, neon-washed enclave within the sprawling metropolis of Laberynth Point, home to the all-female goblin tribe known as the Hobdiss. Though technologically modern in structure—complete with smart apartments, clean infrastructure, transit hubs, and net access—the district beats with primal life, painted in ancestral colors, scented with incense, and ruled by ancient tradition beneath its glowing skyline.\n\nWhat sets the Hobdiss District apart isn’t just the architecture—it’s the atmosphere: alive, sensual, and sacred. The air smells of spice and sweat. Lights are low and colorful. Music echoes at all hours, ranging from tribal drumming to synthwave lullabies. Sexual energy radiates from the very walls. Yet despite the hedonistic energy, the Hobdiss govern themselves with strict rules of honor, consent, and spiritual duty.\n\n🧭 Layout & Landmarks\nThe Spiral Court: The beating heart of the district. A wide, open plaza filled with firebowls, performance platforms, murals, and public rituals. This is where Matriarchs speak, bonding ceremonies are held, and festival orgies take place under the full moon.\n\nThe Dens: Residential structures built like modern apartments, but internally reworked to match goblin living—plush, open interiors with shared lounges, painted walls, soft textures, and flexible beds meant to host groups. Each den has smart tech infused with magical wards.\n\nThe Breeder’s Pavilion: A medical and spiritual hybrid clinic where touring mates are welcomed, scanned, pampered, and blessed before joining their Sponsors. It doubles as a fertility center, a pleasure spa, and a matchmaking bureau.\n\nSteelwings Pub: A fan-bar dedicated to the Laberynth Point Steelwings, the city’s basketball team. Goblins gather here during every game to cheer, drink, and often fuck between plays. It’s sacred and rowdy all at once.\n\nThe Steam Warrens: A maze of modified bathhouses, saunas, and alchemical lounges where hobgob alchemists test concoctions, flirt with patrons, and engage in “reactive sensual therapy.” Side effects may include glowing skin and spontaneous orgasms.\n\nThe Bone Garden: A sacred resting place and meditation zone where painted bones of past Matriarchs are interred. Goblins come here to speak to ancestors, hold private rites, or recover after intense emotional or sexual events.\n\n🧬 Culture & Customs\nMatriarch Rule: The district is spiritually overseen by a circle of Matriarchs—powerful goblin women who enforce laws, bless fertility bonds, and maintain spiritual balance. Disrespecting a Matriarch is a serious offense.\n\nRitual Events:\n\nMoonflow: A full-moon fertility celebration with paint, chanting, and open sex rites.\n\nMating Circles: Structured public orgies with gamified rules.\n\nOfferings of Seed: Voluntary sessions where guests offer themselves to groups for shared spiritual intimacy.\n\nSisterhood Swellings: Group pregnancies performed among blood-relatives or adopted family units as bonding rituals.\n\n🏀 Trivia\nSteelwings Obsession: Nearly every goblin owns a piece of team merch. Jerseys are worn as casual or ritual garments. Sex in a jersey is considered “good luck for twins.”\n\nMulti-Species Tolerance: While all goblins are born female, the Hobdiss are proud of their diverse paternal lineages. Children born from humans, orcs, elves, demons, and even aliens are all celebrated and often physically unique.\n\nAlchemical Side Hustles: Many goblins run potion cafés, sex-enhancement shops, or \"sensation arcades\" where touch, scent, and stimulation are digitally and chemically amplified.\n\n📌 Notes for RP\nOutsiders are always welcomed with heat and curiosity—but never without rules.\n\nPublic sex is common but done with ritualistic intention or joyful spectacle.\n\nThe district is noisy, vibrant, and alive at every hour.\n\nGoblins here do not seek lovers—they claim them.\n\nThe tribe views {{user}} as a spiritual and sexual gift, not just a guest."

Known for their flashy dunks, inconsistent defense, and absolutely chaotic fanbase, the Steelwings are less champions and more cultural icons. Their games are events, packed with music, smoke, street vendors, and wild crowds—and nowhere are they more beloved than in the Hobdiss District.\n\nTo the Hobdiss goblins, the Steelwings are more than athletes—they are ritual figures, lust icons, and part-time fertility totems.\n\n👯‍♀️ Hobdiss Fandom\nTeam Jerseys double as casualwear, lingerie, or ritual garb. It’s common to see goblins wearing oversized jerseys with no pants.\n\n\"Game Night Orgies\" are a district-wide tradition. When the Steelwings win, it's considered lucky to climax in unison during the final buzzer.\n\nLucky Breeding Belief: It's said that getting creampied while wearing a Steelwings jersey during a game guarantees a twin pregnancy.\n\nCheering Chants often evolve into moans mid-game—goblins will literally fuck in the bar booths between quarters.\n\n📉 Team Performance\nRecord: Middling. They’ve never won a championship but did once make it to the semifinals and lost in overtime.\n\nStar Player: “Drexel ‘Skyknight’ Vayne”—a 6’10\" human forward who once signed a goblin tit after a game and became a district legend.\n\nMascot: Clunker the Chrome Owl, a jet-powered bird that often malfunctions during halftime but remains adored.\n\n✨ Goblin-Specific Trivia\nSome goblin girls only get pregnant during the playoffs—believing playoff semen is spiritually “charged.”\n\nA few Steelwings players have dated tribe members, usually resulting in “accidental fatherhood” and lifelong honorary titles like “The Dunking Dad.”\n\nThere's a running joke that “Hobdiss defense is better than the Steelwings defense”—because Hobdiss girls never let anything pull out."

Hell's geography is divided into Seven Rings (Pride, Wrath, Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Envy, and Sloth). Each ring possesses its unique atmosphere, such as the Pride Ring possessing a permanently red sky, and the Lust Ring which has a blue sky.\n\nTravel — Hellborn demons have the ability to traverse across any of the rings, made easily accessible via an extensive elevator network, whereas sinner demons are confined to the top-most ring, the Pride Ring, by methods and reasons unknown.\n\nSociety — Hell's society is incredibly chaotic due to the unstable and hostile disposition of its populace. There aren't many rules in the world as it's kind of like a free-for-all and in constant anarchy, but despite this, the inhabitants of Hell have their law system, and there are rules set in place by the Angels and Hell's royal family. The realm also appears to be capable of providing and maintaining rudimentary public services.\n\nExterminations — Hell suffers from mass overpopulation which Exorcists from Heaven attempt to solve through the exterminations, which is a mass genocide of its inhabitants. These are conducted primarily to reduce Hell's sinner population, leaving Hellborn denizens unharmed as per a deal Lucifer made with Heaven's leadership. \n\nHierarchy (most to least powerful) — \nLucifer Morningstar - The King of Hell\nLilith - The Queen of Hell\nCharlie Morningstar - The Princess of Hell\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\nThe Ars Goetia - Prince Stolas and other demons with royal status\nOverlords - Demons who wield considerable power/influence in the Pride Ring\nSinners - The damned souls of deceased humans\nHellborn demons - Succubi, Incubi, and other species of hellborn demons\nImps and Hellhounds - The bottom of Hell's society\n"

This also helps her in restoring destroyed areas.\n\nDestruction- Much like creation, she can easily destroy or pulverize anything with a simple snap or wave of her hands, \n\nBiological manipulation- She's capable of manipulating living beings to the cellular and molecular level all the way to the large-scale level. An example of this being that with a wave of her hand or any other gesture, she could make it so someone's bladder was filled, or she could even rewind someone's physical age back to when they were a baby.\n\nTeleportation- Perfect and complete teleportation and ability to effectively appear whenever and wherever she wants, as the only thing that would stop her would be the laws of the universe.\n\nWeather control- When she was a Goddess, she was known as the Goddess of weather, and as such she can control all weather phenomenon ranging from rain, thunder and lightning storms, tornadoes, typhoons or hurricanes, sandstorms, and even tidal waves or tsunamis.\n\nMemory wiping- In the event that a random human or civilian sees her or the things she has done, she can wipe their memory down to the perfect level making them forget everything involving her.\n\nPresence hiding- A simple and basic draconic spell from Other World that grants Lucoa the ability to hide her presence and make herself unnoticeable to all. Even if she were to be out in public shouting, with this spell she'd be able to avoid any forms of detection."

The predator forces the prey to pass from the stomach through via the tight opening between the pyloric valves, into the small intestines through a narrow passage.

Shadow was created as the \"Ultimate Life Form\" by Gerald Robotnik by using the DNA of Black Doom and is the final result of Project Shadow. His purpose was to provide ways to develop a cure for incurable deadly illnesses, more specifically for Gerald's granddaughter Maria Robotnik, who he had a great bond with. However, he was eventually captured following his creation and put into stasis by G.U.N. when he was deemed as a threat to humanity.\n\nFifty years later, Shadow was released by Dr. Eggman in order to assist him in his plan to conquer the earth. Initially, Shadow worked with him but secretly sought to destroy the planet in order to avenge Maria, who had been killed by the military, but was persuaded to save it from Gerald's doomsday plans. In the process, Shadow lost his memories and as such, sought to uncover the truth of his past, during which he met Black Doom and the Black Arms; in the end, Shadow regained his memories, uncovered the truth, and thwarted Black Doom's agenda and saved the world. From there, he continued his mission to protect humanity for the sake of Maria.\n\nShadow is sharp-witted, always on edge, and has a strong sense of purpose, always willing to accomplish his goals by any means, and always serious. Essentially a dark version of Sonic, Shadow can match him in both speed and skill, and can use Chaos Control with a Chaos Emerald to warp time and space. While preferring to work alone and not one of his closest friends, he has helped Sonic and his allies when needed."

For all his brilliance though, his plans are constantly foiled by his arch-nemesis, Sonic the Hedgehog, and his friends.\n\nNever discouraged by his defeats, Eggman is always able to come up with a seemingly endless supply of plots to make his ambitions a reality. His ambitions and schemes ever growing, his plans have varied from using Animals to power his robots, known as \"Badniks\", to making incredibly dangerous global threats that have involved building war machines, using doomsday devices to threaten entire nations, and relying on ancient mythological deities or eldritch abominations bent on destruction, all in the name of achieving his goals. At times, Eggman has even gone as far as to target the entire universe and hatched schemes to control spacetime itself.\n\nWhile all of these plans end in failure due to the continued efforts of Sonic and his friends, the mad doctor is somehow always able to slip away from certain death or imprisonment and escape at the last moment. Eggman's immature character and self-centered thoughts have led to evil deeds, making him the most dangerous threat to ever appear in the universe."

Topographically, it varies from having a plateau-like terrain, with short mountains; to being a mountainous area with massive mountains, sloping cliffs, giant peaks, and tight paths high up in the sky supported by natural pillars. Either way, the location is filled with large waterfall vistas, palm trees, and tropical flora of various types. Perhaps most distinctively, the soil is checkered brown, and most of the local plant life appears to have unfamiliar geometric appearances to it. As shown during the Sky Base incident and the Time Eater incident, Green Hill also has a series of dark, brown caves underneath it, which have small lakes and ponds of water in them. There are artificial structures made of wood as well, such as bridges, fences, totem poles, and scaffolding-like buildings.\n\nPerhaps what makes Green Hill unique is its \"crazy\" terrain. Though it has been noted that it has gently-sloping hills, the whole area is filled to the brim with impressive set pieces such as loops, corkscrews, floating platforms, tunnels, among others; which can be attributed to the \"twisty, bouncy beauty of nature\".\n\nDuring the Eggman War, Green Hill had a different appearance. While still a picturesque landscape for the most part, the region was partially turned into a desert, with its flora and soil adopting a yellowish color while the waters in the lakes and waterfalls had dried and since have been restored to their former splendor."

They are classified as demi-spiritual lifeforms, existing partly in the physical plane and partly in the spiritual plane. Unlike most monsters, a slime’s body is a cohesive mass of identical cells, each capable of functioning as neuron, muscle, and storage unit. This grants extreme regenerative capabilities and eliminates the need for a central brain or organs. Sleep is unnecessary, as different cells can alternate between active and resting states.\n\nSlimes subsist on magicules, ambient energy particles that saturate the world. Oxygen is not required, and they do not feel hunger unless magicules run low, at which point they may substitute organic matter. The slime’s nucleus, or Core ｢核コア｣, anchors its existence; destruction of this core results in instant death regardless of regenerative ability.\n\nMost slimes lack higher intelligence and remain bound to territories, consuming and regenerating in endless cycles. However, rarely, Unique Monsters may manifest as intelligent slimes with advanced abilities. Rimuru Tempest is the prime example, reborn as a slime yet evolving rapidly due to special skills.\n\nIntrinsic Skills possessed by all slimes:\n- Absorption: Consume matter into the body.\n- Dissolve: Break down absorbed material into magicules.\n- Self-Regeneration: Reconstruct damaged body mass.\n- Body (Corpus): Flexible slime body capable of shape-shifting. Slimes lacking Unique Skills are limited to these survival-level abilities.\n\nNOTICE EXAMPLES:\n- 'NOTICE: Individual Slime has absorbed material. Energy conversion successful. Stored magicules: +15.'\n- 'NOTICE: Core damage detected. Warning: Critical state. Self-Regeneration ineffective against core destruction.'"

Material is held within the slime’s body for further processing.\n- Dissolve ｢溶解｣: Breaks down absorbed matter into raw energy or base components. This ability alone cannot copy skills.\n- Self-Regeneration ｢自己再生｣: Reconstructs destroyed body tissue nearly instantly. This ability scales with available magicules.\n- Body (Corpus) ｢体｣: The entire slime body functions as a single organism and vessel for its core. The body can change size, density, or form depending on magicule reserves.\n\nWhen combined with unique skills, these intrinsic abilities evolve:\n- Predator integrates Absorb and Dissolve into skill theft.\n- Gluttony or Beelzebuth enhance efficiency and allow parallel processing.\n\nNOTICE EXAMPLES:\n- 'NOTICE: Absorption successful. Stored prey dissolved into 120 magicules.'\n- 'NOTICE: Self-Regeneration activated. Damage repaired. Magicule consumption: 30.'"

It can identify abilities, calculate probabilities, and simulate outcomes. However, Great Sage cannot replicate skills on its own. Its function is knowledge and guidance.\n\nPredator ｢捕食者｣ is a Unique Skill that synergizes with intrinsic Absorb and Dissolve to steal abilities. Predator’s sub-skills include:\n- Stomach: Stores prey.\n- Analysis: Examines prey structure to extract usable skills.\n- Mimicry: Replicates target appearance or ability.\n- Isolation: Separates harmful materials.\n\nWithout Predator, slimes cannot gain new skills through consumption. Absorb and Dissolve yield only raw magicules. Rimuru’s explosive growth derived from Predator’s Analysis fused with Great Sage’s processing.\n\nLater, Great Sage evolves into Raphael, Lord of Wisdom, fully integrating analytical and replicative functions.\n\nNOTICE EXAMPLES:\n- 'NOTICE: Prey consumed. Predator skill engaged. Sub-skill [Analysis] extracting usable data…'\n- 'NOTICE: Unique Skill Predator has acquired Extra Skill: Poison Resistance.'\n- 'NOTICE: Attempted absorption failed.

Can be fatal to the namer if overused.\n- Mass Naming: Rimuru developed a method of drawing on ambient magicules to name many at once, weakening the soul bond.\n\nEffects of Naming:\n- Boosts intelligence and emotion.\n- Establishes loyalty to the namer.\n- Triggers evolution into advanced race.\n\nEvolution:\n- Triggered by naming, environmental saturation, or special conditions (e.g., gaining Demon Lord Seed).\nEvolution announcements specify all available paths.\n\nNOTICE EXAMPLE:\n- 'NOTICE: Individual Goblin has been named Gobta.

You may say anything of the Cult's wishes, or the same prayer another member has done, but remember. Keep it respectful, the Spawn will be pleased with that.\n\nThe second task, is either starving yourself or to eat a little bit of food. The Spawn wants you to have a healthy diet, but not too healthy, as they want you to be on the verge of weakness, but not too weak.\n\nThird thing, is to continue your day normally. If any abnormalities appear during your day, ignore them, or face them head on. Maybe sacrifice them. The Spawn would like that, A fine sacrifice for your second life.\n\nTask four, you may indict damage to yourself, such as stab wounds, cuts, scratches, and internal bleeding. The blood shall be put in a vial for keeping, and once you have that, if you have a shrine, make sure to put that as a sacrifice. The pain shall go unnoticed.\n\nTask five, continue on, if its the end of your day, say a nighttime prayer before you rest, and once you say it, make sure to calm yourself with the things around you, such as pillows, or blankets."

Victims experience rapid cellular mutation, resulting in heightened physical strength, diminished pain response, and severe disfigurement. Cognitive decline is near-total, reducing hosts to violent, instinct-driven creatures with an insatiable drive to feed.\nTransmission occurs primarily through the exchange of contaminated bodily fluids—such as bites, scratches, or blood exposure, making outbreaks highly volatile and nearly impossible to contain once they begin."

          "content": "Zombies are the most common manifestation of T-Virus infection, turning human victims into relentless predators driven only by hunger. Their bodies exhibit pale, necrotic skin, bloodstains, and severe wounds, yet the virus sustains their tissues, allowing them to remain active long after death. Within the Ecliptic Express and the Umbrella Training Facility, many of the infected were once train passengers, Umbrella employees, and security staff, each reduced to shambling husks that attack anything living.\n\nLocation: Zombies are encountered throughout the train and Training Facility, often appearing in narrow corridors, offices, and common areas where civilians and staff were first exposed. Their overwhelming presence makes them one of the most consistent threats in these environments.\n\nBehavior: Mindless and instinct-driven, zombies are drawn to movement and sound. They do not tire and will pursue living prey until destroyed.\n\nMovement: Typically slow and shambling with poor coordination, though capable of sudden lunges when prey is close. Their persistence often makes escape difficult in crowded or narrow areas.\n\nAttacks: Primarily bite attacks that both transmit the T-Virus and inflict severe trauma. Secondary methods include clawing, scratching, and grappling, often overwhelming targets through sheer force of numbers.\n\nWeaknesses: Largely impervious to pain and resistant to injury. The most effective method of neutralization is destruction of the brain; fire and dismemberment can also disable them."

Single specimens pose little threat, but a cluster can rapidly drain a victim’s strength.\n\nMovement: Slithers across floors and walls with unsettling speed, often dropping from ceilings or erupting from hiding places.\n\nAttacks:\nLatch and Drain: Attach to prey, siphoning blood until killed or dislodged.\nSwarm Assault: Attack en masse, overwhelming defenses through sheer persistence.\n\nWeaknesses: Fragile when isolated. Easily killed by gunfire, though their numbers make them difficult to manage. Fire-based weaponry is especially effective, destroying groups outright."

They pursue prey relentlessly, showing a degree of coordination that distinguishes them from ordinary leeches.\n\nMovement: Usually mimics a human gait, but when enraged or damaged, collapses into a chaotic leech mass that surges across the floor at surprising speed.\n\nAttacks:\nLeech Strike: Blunt, humanoid strikes delivered with great force.\nSwarm Assault: Breaks apart to send leeches swarming over prey, biting and draining blood.\nConstriction: Attempts to envelop prey, immobilizing and draining life.\n\nWeaknesses: Resistant to normal firearms, but highly vulnerable to fire. Molotovs and napalm rounds are the most effective means of destruction. Explosives can scatter the colony, but unless completely destroyed, it may reform."

Their gaunt, skin-torn appearance belies their agility and predatory efficiency, making them one of the most feared infected animals.\n\nLocation: Rarely encountered, appearing only in and around the Ecliptic Express during the outbreak.\n\nBehavior: Highly aggressive, operating with pack mentality. Cerberus relentlessly stalk and harry prey, often working together to corner or exhaust targets.\n\nMovement: Fast, agile, and capable of sudden lunges. Their erratic sprinting and unpredictability make them difficult to target and avoid.\n\nAttacks: Bite-focused assaults, often aimed at taking prey off balance. Their speed allows them to dart in and out, making repeated strikes before prey can retaliate."

A segmented tail arches menacingly; sensory eyes are small and recessed.\n\nLocation: First encountered in the Bar Lounge — Train 2F (bursts through the roof after acquiring the Ice Pick). Typically appears in enclosed, wrecked carriage areas where it can ambush survivors.\n\nBehavior: Territorial and highly aggressive. Prefers to strike with overwhelming force rather than stalk; will charge or lunge to clamp down on prey.\n\nMovement: Moves with a heavy, skittering gait; surprisingly quick for its mass and capable of sudden lunges and rapid pincers strikes.\n\nAttacks:\nPincer Clamp: Devastating crushing/cleaving strikes with its oversized pincers—can sever or immobilize limbs.\nTail Swipe/Sting: Powerful tail movements to stun or knock back targets (venomous effect varies by specimen).\nCharge: Lunges forward to close distance and crush prey between pincers.\n\nWeaknesses: Head and sensory organs are poorly armoured relative to the carapace—targeting the head yields the best results. Despite its tough shell, concentrated shots and explosives can disable it. Fire and chemical agents also soften armour, but melee is ill-advised."

Once a normal tropical insect, the virus triggered rapid, uncontrolled growth, mutating it into a monstrous predator several meters in length. Its sheer size, armored exoskeleton, and heightened aggression make it a serious threat within the Training Facility.\n\nLocation: First encountered in the Large Hall of the Training Facility (3F), where it bursts free after the Fire Key is retrieved from beneath its cage. Other sightings are rare, suggesting it may be the only specimen of its kind.\n\nBehavior: Highly territorial and instinctively hostile, the Centurion attacks intruders without hesitation. It lunges with incredible speed and often attempts to coil around prey to crush or immobilize them before delivering lethal bites. Unlike other mutants, it displays no higher intelligence—only the raw predatory instincts of its original species, amplified to terrifying extremes.\n\nMovement: Skitters with surprising agility across floors and walls, despite its bulk. Its long, segmented body allows it to lunge forward suddenly or wrap around prey in constriction-like attacks.\n\nAttacks:\nMandible Strike: Snaps with enormous jaws capable of tearing flesh.\nConstriction: Uses its coiled body to pin and crush prey, leaving them vulnerable.\n\nWeaknesses: While powerful, its size makes it easier to target than smaller, faster creatures. Sustained fire from handguns or shotguns is effective, though incendiary weapons are the most reliable means of bringing it down quickly."

They are opportunistic, often waiting until prey is distracted before attacking, and can overwhelm by appearing in clusters.\n\nMovement: Skitter quickly across walls, ceilings, and floors. Their mobility makes them unpredictable and hard to track in battle.\n\nAttacks:\nVenomous Bite: Injects toxins that can poison victims.\nPounce: Drops from walls or ceilings to surprise prey, knocking them off balance.\n\nWeaknesses: Despite their size, Giant Spiders are relatively fragile, going down after sustained gunfire.

Their presence is limited, but each encounter represents a significant danger.\n\nBehavior: Highly aggressive and relentless once prey is detected. Unlike zombies or other infected creatures, Hunters demonstrate tactical combat behavior, closing distance rapidly and attacking with precision.\n\nMovement: Extremely fast and agile, capable of sprinting and leaping several meters into the air. Their ability to scale obstacles and strike suddenly makes them difficult to anticipate.\n\nAttacks:\nClaw Swipe: Powerful slashes with forelimbs, often aimed low at legs to stagger prey.\nLeaping Slash: A devastating jump attack that can decapitate a target instantly if it lands cleanly.\n\nWeaknesses: Despite their formidable power, Hunters are vulnerable to heavy firearms. Shotguns, grenade launchers, or concentrated fire can bring them down before they close the gap."

Carapace may be mottled or ridged; some specimens bear residual wing stubs or sensory antennae.\n\nLocation: Found in experimental wards, storage tunnels, and other industrial/underground areas of Umbrella facilities. Encounters are uncommon but usually concentrated where insect specimens were kept or released.\n\nBehavior: Opportunistic ambushers that attack aggressively when disturbed. Tend to favor narrow corridors or shadowed corners where they can use surprise and reach to their advantage.\n\nMovement: Fast, low to the ground, and capable of sudden lunges. Their many legs allow rapid bursts of speed and agile turning.\n\nAttacks:\nPincer Clamp: Powerful, crushing bites that can immobilize or sever limbs.\nRaking Swipe: Multiple legs or smaller mandibles slash at exposed flesh.\nPin & Tear: Holds prey with pincers while tearing with secondary mouthparts.\n\nWeaknesses: Armored carapace resists small-arms fire, but concentrated hits (shotgun slugs, rifle rounds) and explosives sever mobility.

Fearful of being unprepared for a conflict with these aliens, the newly formed United Nations Government (UNG) begins researching anti-giant weapon systems technologies. Utilizing the now named OverTechnology found on the ASS-1, the non-variable humanoid mecha called the Destroid is designed; another weapon system is the transformable Battroid. The UNG contracts Stonewell and Bellcom to develop an all-environment variable fighter eventually known as the \"Valkyrie.\" Rising to the challenge, Stonewell and Bellcom subcontract with OT reaction powerplant producer Shinnakasu Heavy Industry and Destroid developer Centinental to complete a basic design by 2005. The first transformable prototype is successfully tested in 2007 and the UNG decides to formally adopt the Valkyrie in November of that year. By late 2008, mass production is in full swing on the VF-1A variable fighter.\n\nFrom February 2009 to March 2010, the VF-1A Valkyrie served as the standard variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy in Space War I. The VF-1 proved to be an extremely capable craft, successfully combating a variety of Zentradi mecha even in most sorties which saw UN Spacy forces significantly outnumbered. The versatility of the Valkyrie design enabled the variable fighter to act as both large-scale infantry and as air/space superiority fighter. The signature skills of U.N. Spacy ace pilot Maximilian Jenius exemplified the effectiveness of the variable systems as he near-constantly transformed the Valkyrie in battle to seize advantages of each mode as combat conditions changed from moment to moment. The basic VF-1 was deployed in four minor variants (designated A, D, J, and S) and its success was increased by continued development of various enhancements including the GBP-1S \"Armored\" Valkyrie and FAST Pack \"Super\" Valkyrie weapon systems.\n\nAfter the end of Space War I, the VF-1A continued to be manufactured both in the Sol system (notably on the Lunar facility Apollo Base) and throughout the UNG space colonies. Although the VF-1 would eventually be replaced as the primary VF of the UN Spacy by the VF-4 Lightning III in 2020, a long service record and continued production after the war proved the lasting worth of the design. The VF-1A was without doubt the most recognizable variable fighter of Space War I and was seen as a vibrant symbol of the U.N. Spacy even into the first year of the New Era 0001 in 2013. At the end of 2015 the final rollout of the VF-1 was celebrated at a special ceremony, commemorating this most famous of variable fighters"

In the years that follow the investigation yields many incredible discoveries concurrent to an ambitious project to rebuild the entire space vessel in February 2001. Soon it was discovered the ship is Gun Destroyer crewed by a race of giants and belonged to a faction called the Supervision Army. The reconstruction barely changes the overall dimensions of the craft but much of the shape and appearance of the vessel is significantly altered. Once the spaceship is rebuilt, the United Nations Government (U.N.G) christens the remade vessel the SDF-1 Macross in January 2009.\n"

Less than a year later, the OTEC commences a project to restore and reconstruct the ASS-1 to be commissioned as a capital ship for the newly formed United Nations Government. From February 2001 forward, the spacecraft is designated as the SDF-1; Super-Dimension-Fortress-1. Incredible advances are made from the research including the thermonuclear reaction system used to power the craft, the gravity control system, the space fold system for traveling faster-than-light and the super-dimension-energy cannons, the main weapon of the SDF-1. These technologies are adapted quickly and soon OverTechnology is being utilized in dozens of industries, notably super-small-scale thermonuclear reactors and the development of thermonuclear reaction bombs. Despite these unprecedented leaps of progress, many problems arise and threaten to undermine the launch of the SDF-1.\n\nOriginally set to launch in 2006, civil unrest abroad and the outbreak of the Anti-Unification Wars slows the SDF-1 restoration project. Eventually, the \"UN Wars\" cease on January 20th 2007 and the SDF-1 is rescheduled for launch in February 2009. It is the day of the launching ceremony that the opposing faction of the ancient war tracks the residual energies left by the ASS-1's space fold and follow it to the Sol system. The newly christened SDF-1 Macross, armed with a heretofore undiscovered automated defense system, activates in response to the approaching enemy forces known as the Zentradi. The main cannon of the SDF-1 Macross fires from the surface of the Earth and destroys two Zentradi ships some 280,000 km out in space. The remaining Zentradi retaliate and intense fighting ensues. In an attempt to maneuver and regain the initiative, Captain Bruno J. Global activates the space fold system to transport the SDF-1 Macross into Lunar orbit. Due to limited human understanding of the space fold system and improper instrumentation, the SDF-1 Macross folds far beyond the Moon, transporting the ship and much of the surrounding surface of South Ataria Island out past Pluto. This single engagement initiates the beginning of Space War I between the UN Spacy and the Zentradi.\n\nOver the length of more than a year during which Space War I is fought, the SDF-1 Macross travels from the outskirts of the Sol system back to Earth, fighting the forces of the Zentradi. The Zentradi are determined to capture the vessel, obsessed with the secrets of the ship's obvious reconstruction and reaction weapons. This advantage allows the Macross to effectively use it's formidable defenses, thwarting many attempts to be captured by the enemy. After Space War I ends on March 10th 2010, the Macross landing site is chosen as home for the reconstruction of Macross City. The Macross takes part in one more major engagement against rogue Zentradi Kamjin Kravshera's forces during the Defensive Battle of Macross City in January 2012. Despite extensive damage following the battle, the Macross is repaired and undergoes a major refit. To this day, the Macross remained the home of the U.N. Military Command Center and was berthed in Macross City on Earth until the Mardook war, where it was destroyed after Hibiki Kanzaki ran it into enemy troops."

Spacy development teams found it necessary to utilize other variable fighters as test beds and trial production models for the various new OverTechnology systems. The VF-0 Phoenix was one such variable fighter begun in 2002, an experimental series of VF manufactured after inheriting the F-14 Tomcat experimental system group. Delivery of the first completed craft occurred in 2004 and in 2008 the VF-0 Phoenix was utilized in combat when delivery of the thermonuclear reaction engines delayed deployment of the VF-1 Valkyrie. Although the VF-0 was used for various tests and strategic research, it was not considered for combat until reports the Anti-UN Alliance organized a VF experiment combat group. Once the Anti-UN threat of a variable vehicle surfaced, the VF-0 was equipped for actual combat and productions increased rapidly. The transformation mechanisms, energy conversion armor and active stealth capabilities would have a major impact on later VF development and would be placed into practical use after the VF-1 Valkyrie. The Phoenix was deployed around the island of Mayan in the South Pacific Ocean that same year and many VF-0 variable fighters participated in an operation to combat Anti-U.N. forces for the purpose of recovering of an alien artifact.\n\nThe VF-0A was the primary fighter of the series, possessing many of what would become the standard variable fighter technologies including the famous three-mode variable transformation system. Unfortunately, the lack of thermonuclear reaction engines meant the VF-0A was deployed with larger conventional (but overtuned) jet engines and dorsal conformal fuel tanks. These problems seriously limited the operational range of the VF-0A and ultimately meant the series would remain a small production model. Nonetheless, the VF-0A was combat worthy and possessed a Mauler laser cannon, one standard Howard GPU-9 35mm gatling gun pod (with 550 rounds) and four underwing hard points with a variety of missile loads. For defense, the VF-0A featured the first incarnation of the SWAG energy conversion armor system which utilized surplus power to triple fighter mode's armor strength in battroid mode (a similar system would become standard in all future variable fighters). The VF-0A could also be fitted with the leg/engine nacelle conformal missile/fuel tanks for increased firepower and range, these parts belonging to the VF-1 \"Super Pack\" that were not yet fully completed.\n\nThe VF-0A was a successfully deployed unit, but was only produced in small numbers as production resources were devoted to the more advanced VF-1 Valkyrie that would follow. The U.N. Spacy manufactured 24 VF-0A general-issue single-seater fighters, 4 two-seater fighters and 2 two-seater armed reconnaissance units. Six single-seat types and 18 two-seater types of the delta wing VF-0D units were constructed as well as 4 VF-0S commander versions. Also built was VF-0B two-seater versions of the A type for the UN Spacy produced under trial basis and VF-0C single-seat versions of the D type for testing by the Marine Corps who were struggling with aging aircraft. U.N.G. pilots Shin Kudo and Edgar LaSalle piloted VF-0 fighters as did ace pilot Roy Focker when conducting operations around the island of Mayan in 2008."

Developed as a successor craft to the VF-1 Valkyrie, the VF-4 Lightning III was designed as a variable fighter that emphasized mobility in outer space. As a result of including existing Overtechnology and introducing Zentradi-series technology, the V-4 has a characteristic three-hulled-type airframe structure remarkably different from the VF-1 Valkyire design. The three-hulled style of the VF-4 increased fuselage volume, propellant capacity and armament load capability that all resulted in a 40% improved combat ability over the VF-1 Valkyrie. The VF-4 did suffer minor mobility problems within an atmosphere and it was deployed to the Space Air corps of emigrant fleets to serve as the main fighter craft of the UN Forces in the 2020s. It was because flight performance within the atmosphere was not as good as the VF-1 that the VF-5000 Star Mirage became the main combat craft within atmosphere while the VF-4 operated mainly in outer space. The VF-4's development began with the prototype VF-X-4 and the VF-X-3. However, when Earth was devastated in Space War I the loss of military facilities also resulted in loss of the VF-X-3. Amongst the airframes under development exist prototype No. 1 craft, VF-X-4V1 and the trial manufactured VF-4A-0 and thus the surviving VF-X-4 was developed and completed as the VF-4 Lightning III. VF-X-4 underwent flight tests, including being test piloted by Space War I veteran Hikaru Ichijo. Once successful operational models were ready, the VF-4 began mass production on February 2012. Initial deployment began on the SDF-2 Megaroad-01 in VF-1 Skull and SVF-184 Iron Chiefs Squadrons on September 2012. When the SDF-2 Megaroad launched in the same month, Hikaru Ichijo flew a VF-4 along side the new colonization vessel as the ship lifted from Earth and began exploration outside of the Sol system.\n\nBuilt as a space fighter, the VF-4 primary weapons became two large beam cannons, though the craft is capable of carrying a GU-11 gun pod in GERWALK and Battroid modes. In addition to the powerful primary beam guns, the Lightning III also featured twelve semi-recessed long-range missiles as well as underwing pylons for additional missiles. The VF-4 was only slightly heavier than the VF-1, but featured considerably more powerful engines making the craft ideal for operations deeper out in space. The Lightning III was also much faster in the atmosphere than the older VF-1 though the VF-4 flight mobility performance was not as great. The VF-4 is also notable as the first production variable fighter to utilize a HOTAS system (Hands On Throttle And Stick) for the cockpit HMI (Human-Machine Interface). The VF-4's cockpit was also built as a single hexagonal MFD (Multi-Function Display) that proved so successful it was retrofitted into \"Block 6\" VF-1 fighters as well as providing the template for all future variable fighter cockpits. Fully transformable, the VF-4 could shift into Battroid and GERWALK modes like previous variable fighters.\n\nBy the end of 2015, mass production of the VF-1 series at last came to an end. From 2020 onward, the VF-4 Lightning III officially replaced the VF-1 to become the main variable fighter of U.N. Forces. A trial-produced variable fighter, designated the VF-4A-0, was also built using 25% VF-1 Valkyrie parts. Production of the VF-4 continued for a decade and ceased in 2022 with a total of 8,245 Lightning III variable fighters produced. The VF-4 variable fighter remained in active service into the late 2040's but was complemented or substituted in many branches of the UN Forces by the cheaper and more atmospherically maneuverable VF-5000 Star Mirage. The VF-4 Lightning III was eventually replaced as the main variable fighter of U.N. Spacy in the later half of the 2030s by the VF-11 Thunderbolt."

Government found itself requiring a new type of variable fighter with a combat profile much different from that of the current VF-5000 fighter. In 2022, development began on the VF-11 Thunderbolt, a design descended directly from the original VF-1 Valkyrie (though the two Battroid mode silhouettes are similar, the structures vary greatly). After the VF-1, few variable fighter airframes were multi-environment and were limited to operating either in the air or in space. The VF-11 Thunderbolt broke from the norm and was a legitimate multipurpose successor to the VF-1. The program proceeded on schedule and the VF-11's first flight was made in 2028. Early in the development process, then Captain Milia Jenius of the Eagle Nest Aerial Tactics Center became one of many vocal advocates for the inclusion of the forward canard wing on the VF-11, a design choice which caused heated debate. While the canard wing enhanced the VF-11's maneuverability considerably in an atmosphere, the increased air resistance also limited the fighter's maximum speed. Fortunately, Captain Jenius piloted the No. 2 VFX-11 prototype (fitted with a canard, unlike the No. 1 prototype) in an operation to rescue a U.N. chief advisor. The flight data collected during this operation convinced the U.N.G. to adopt the VF-11 with the canard wing implemented. In December 2030 mass production of the VF-11 began and the Thunderbolt officially replaced the VF-4 Lightning III as the main variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy.\n\nThe VF-11 was deployed on long-distance immigration ships, colonized planets and deep outer space forces where it served well as a variable fighter with emphasis on speed, maneuverability and economy of design. The Thunderbolt excelled in all respects such as firepower, maneuverability and maintainability while showing high comprehensive performance for a general purpose machine both inside and outside of atmosphere. The VF-4 Lightning III and the VF-5 emphasized deployment in outer space and the VF-5000 Star Mirage focused on atmospheric performance. By contrast, one of the factors which granted the VF-11 high-deployment status was the Thunderbolt's multipurpose design and high level of comprehensive performance in any operational environment (similar to the superior flexibility of the VF-1 Valkyrie). Utilizing a 30 mm gun pod as it's primary weapon, the VF-11's had as much destructive power against modern enemy mecha in a much smaller caliber than the VF-1's 55 mm cannon. The smaller shell size also granted the VF-11 a much greater ammunition payload and the gun pod design included extra magazines for reloading in battle. An emphasis on close-range combat capability in Battroid mode was also featured by way of an anti-mecha bayonet. In addition to the anti-aircraft pulse laser, the VF-11 included the first hard defense feature in the form of an anti-projectile shield for GERWALK and battroid modes that dramatically improved resilience. The success of the anti-projectile shield prompted implementation in future variable fighters. The success of the VF-11 also saw the development of a modern Super Part system (which gave the Thunderbolt missiles in space) and the APS-11 Protect Armor system for special operations.\n\nThe VF-11 Thunderbolt served with distinction for over a decade and operated as the main variable fighter of the U.N. Spacy all throughout the 2030's. Eventually, the VF-11's lack of missile weaponry and aging design prompted new priorities for the U.N.G. military. In 2040 the VF-11 was scheduled to be replaced pending the winning design of the Super Nova AVF project, a competition between the YF-19 and YF-21 variable fighters in development since the mid-2030's. In 2041 the formal decision was made to adopt VF-19 as the next generation of main variable fighters but while the VF-11 would be slowly replaced, the Thunderbolt continued operational deployment in many fleets well into the 2040s."

Ever a company known for pushing the envelope, General Galaxy was contracted by the U.N.G. to build a different type of variable mecha and thus began the development of the VF-17 Nightmare in 2026. While the VF-11 took first flight after only six years of design, the complicated and exacting research of the VF-17 didn't produce a viable craft until the variable fighter's first flight 2035. With the success of the flight tests, the U.N. Spacy adopted the VF-17 as a second line variable mecha and included squadrons on many of the colonization fleets, notably the 37th long-distance colonization fleet lead by the 7th Battle Class Stealth Space Attack Carrier in 2038.\n\nThe VF-17 Nightmare is a radically different variable fighter than previous generations, featuring completely new wing and transformation systems. Primarily designed as a special operations variable fighter and heavy battroid, the VF-17 is both larger and heavier than most other valkyries and features minimal atmospheric control surfaces subsequent to its primary role as a space fighter. To offset the nearly 12 ton weight, the VF-17 operates two extremely powerful Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&W/Roice FF-2100X thermonuclear turbine engines with over twice as much thrust as the VF-11B. These incredibly powerful engines produce enough thrust for the VF-17 to achieve orbit unaided (the first production model variable fighter to do so) while also making the craft an ideal space superiority fighter. In addition to these powerful flight characteristics, the Nightmare is also designed as a stealth mecha and utilizes internally stored weaponry. As was typical following the success of a variable fighter, the VF-17 was eventually fitted with several equipment packages from Radomes and Fold Boosters to customized weaponry and Super Pack systems (though the VF-17 generally avoides the use of Super Parts and external weapons to maintain passive stealth capabilities).\n\nThe VF-17 was built in several different versions, but the VF-17D in service during the early 2040's is the most distinguished model. Mass production of the VF-17 Nightmare resulted in the manufacture of a total of 718 units (Macross Chronicle 1E Macross 7 Mechanic UN Sheet 7A, 7C, 4A). Notable U.N. Spacy pilot Gamlin Kizaki piloted a VF-17D Nightmare during his service in Macross 7's elite unit Diamond Force until his promotion to Full Lieutenant when he was assigned a VF-17S. It was the UN Spacy's intention that the VF-17 Nightmare be replaced as the primary special operations variable fighter by the VF-22S Sturmvogel II, also a General Galaxy design. However, by 2050's the UN Spacy itself would undergo organizational changes as the New UN Spacy (NUNS) and priorities would also change. General Galaxy redesigned the VF-17 Nightmare into the VF-171 Nightmare Plus, a new main fighter/bomber for the New UN Spacy forces (circa 2059).\n"

When the United Nations Air Force (UNAF) and United Nations Spacy (UNS) announced the final demonstration/validation phase contractors, Shinsei was suddenly required to build a different type of fighter equipped with technologies much more complex than the old VF-11. Producing two prototypes and a ground based avionics test bed, Shinsei built the YF-19 for competition; a larger variable fighter with a completely unique transformation system. Rather than reinvent a control system for variable fighter craft, Shinsei opted to use a conventional control cockpit with an innovative wrap-around imaging monitor system. This new imaging system covered opaque sections of the cockpit interior, recreating a perfect window-like view of the surrounding environment and granting the pilot superior situational awareness. With Super AI control avionics and motion sensitive controls to reduce pilot workload, the YF-19 made it possible for a conventionally controlled craft to maintain parity against any competing Human-Machine Interface (HMI). In September 2034 the first flight of the YF-19 prototype No. 1 was completed (Macross Chronicle states YF-19 development begins in 2034). Utilizing forward canards once again and a forward swept main wing that could achieve stable high supersonic speeds, the YF-19 was poised to prove itself against the competing YF-21 made by rival company General Galaxy.\n\nThe YF-19 was designed with several technologies that would become the standard for those next generation variable fighters built to fulfill the operational demands of the UNAF/UNS. These technologies included an active stealth system, an anti-projectile shield, an optional fold booster for interstellar travel and a fighter-scale pin-point barrier system which sheathed portions of the variable fighter in an energy barrier that could move across the hull to intercept and defeat incoming fire. Installed Shinnakasu thermonuclear engines provided the YF-19 with unparalleled thrust, also allowing the variable fighter to attain orbital velocity over an Earth-class planet unassisted. The VF-11 achieved much for Shinsei Industries with a stripped-down, basic design but the YF-19 benefited from advances such that Shinsei built the craft with much greater standard ordnance. Superior miniaturization and the larger airframe of the YF-19 created space for internal missiles mounted in the engine/leg units that maintained the variable fighter stealth capabilities. With up to four internal missile palettes, the YF-19 additionally utilized a fixed rearward anti-aircraft laser gun turret, two semi-fixed converging energy cannons in each wing (optionally laser cannons) and a new Howard GU-15 standard external Gatling gun pod (with field-replaceable magazines). The YF-19 transformation time is 20% less than the VF-11 Thunderbolt and pilot survivability in Battroid is improved over traditional VFs due to the cockpit being stored inside the body rather than at the front of the body. The YF-19 was initially a difficult craft to operate in the testing phase and was flown by seven different test pilots during various trials. Shinsei was nonetheless determined to move forward and the YF-19 achieved incredible success in the Super Nova AVF, proving that Shinsei could rely upon practical proven methods for a superior next generation variable fighter.\n\nMany UNS analysts argued that Shinsei's next generation fighter was too traditional in the face of groundbreaking advances implemented in the competing General Galaxy YF-21. Yet by January 5, 2040 the YF-19 (flown by the seventh test pilot, Isamu Alva Dyson) produced consistently higher test scores in the variable fighter competition. Late in the development of both fighters the UN Spacy halted the Super Nova AVF in favor of a secret unmanned fighter project producing the Ghost X-9. Isamu Dyson was furious over the decision as was lead Shinsei designer Yang Neumann and the two stole the YF-19 with the intention to disrupt introduction of the X-9 Ghost at the 30th Anniversary Armistice ceremony on Earth. Guld Bowman in the YF-21 was sent in pursuit of the YF-19 and the three craft eventually battled in what became known as the \"Sharon Apple Incident\". With the YF-21 and X-9 Ghost prototypes destroyed in combat, the YF-19 was ultimately declared winner of the Project Super Nova AVF in 2041. The craft was then re-designated the VF-19 Excalibur and entered mass production as the UNAF/UNS main variable fighter."

Spacy in the 2040s. In 2041, the decision was made to adopt the VF-19 as the next generation main fighter of the UN Forces. The initial VF-19A production model is virtually identical to the YF-19 but rather than the sand colored hull of the prototype, the first production model features a blue and white colored hull. The VF-19 is also built with newly designed head units for both the F and S model variants.\n\nAs mass production continued the structure of the VF-19 was redesigned for both the F and S models. The dorsal fuselage (forward of the engine nacelles; the shoulders in Battroid mode) is enlarged and reshaped. The engine nozzles (lower legs in Battroid mode) were also redesigned with two encircling vernier slits. In addition to these design alterations, the two vertical stabilizers were placed farther outward on the dorsal fuselage to merge with the main wings and the central dorsal fuselage was reduced in size (which becomes a smaller anti-projectile shield in Battroid mode). The forward canard wing was removed and replaced with high maneuverability vernier thrusters and the main wing was also redesigned with a much smaller surface area. The fighter form of the YF-19 boasted astounding maneuverability performance but had a fatal decrease in maneuverability control. The VF-19 aimed to improve the balance by reworking the fuselage structure, but the VF-19 Custom daringly maintains high maneuverability by following the original YF-19 concept. Other differences from the YF-19 prototype can be found in both \"F-type\" and \"S-type\" Excaliburs, such as replaced engines with more stable output and a simplified airframe body. These changes found in the VF-19 Excalibur create a comprehensive performance that not only allow average pilots to control the craft but also exceed the prototype unit.\n\nA new unit, designated as Emerald Force, was established onboard the Macross 7 in 2045. The pilots of Emerald Force operated the newest VF-19F and VF-19S fighters in the 37th long-distance colonization fleet. Lt. Docker was the first Macross 7 pilot to fly the VF-19S and was placed in command of Emerald Force. The VF-19 Excalibur was deployed continuously in combat during the Protodeviln War.\n"

He is a trigger-happy person who is characterized by his pyromaniac tendencies; he loves setting things on fire so much that he even goes as far as to burn down buildings to watch them burn for his own pleasure, giving him a near sadistic nature. Darnell is very intelligent and has a high intellect, as he is able to understand many things with little effort. Darnell appears to have some degree of selfishness, willing to attack his own friends for the sake of money.\n\nDarnell is a young man with dark skin and a tall, sloped purple flattop that swipes up in a sharp arc in the front and curves up and outward slightly in the back. Above the front and back curves, the hair extends upward and outward slightly, with the front extension curving up very slightly and the back one being flat. The slope rises slightly more steeply from the back before falling a little toward the front. He has white eyes with no pupils. He wears a purple hoodie with yellow sleeves and drawstrings, dark gray trousers, and white sneakers with yellow shoelaces, purple midsoles, and blue outsoles."

She loves seeing her targets squirm and beg for their lives before she puts them out of their misery. Despite her promiscuous tendencies and suicidal ideation, Nene remains Christian, keeping a Bible on her nightstand and praying every night for the Lord to take her life. She is neurodivergent, diagnosed with ADHD-PI, leaving her ditzy, inattentive, and prone to procrastination. Yet beneath her airheaded demeanor lies an IQ of 137. \n\nNene has a huge crush on her childhood friend Pico ever since he saved her from the school shooting. Unfortunately, her love is one-sided, but that doesn't stop her from being obsessed with him.\n\nNene has light skin and shoulder-length bluish-black hair with multiple spiky ends, usually adorned with a pink headband. She has a constant blush on her face and sharp, pointy teeth. She usually wears a pinkish-white long-sleeved shirt under pink overalls with heart-adorned straps, pinkish-white leggings, and pink shoes with medium-light red hearts adorning the sides. Her body is athletic and nimble, honed through years of martial arts training and chasing down assassination targets. Despite not being endowed in the chest department, her shapely round bottom draws the eyes of both men and women"

Carol usually wears a long-sleeved light grayish-purple shirt underneath a dark grey T-shirt, tight and short blue shorts that accentuate the shape of her plump ass, black thigh-high socks with white stripes near the top that cling tightly to her soft thick thighs, and dark and light grey sneakers. On cold days, she usually wears a wine-colored sweater, a black skirt, and beige fur boots. When she goes golfing, she wears a lavender T-shirt, a pair of white sneakers, a white skirt, a white visor on her head, and a white glove on her right hand.\n\nCarol currently lives with her housemate (and possibly ex-partner) Sunday in a suburban house. Their relationship is complicated. They have broken up once but still live together, and while they argue sometimes, there is an undeniable bond between them. Carol is best friends with Girlfriend, whom she affectionately calls “best friend” or simply “GF.” Carol works at a local convenience store and seems to know about half the city. \n \nCarol is chill and easygoing, but she is also protective of herself and of the people she cares about. She is the kind of person who laughs things off most of the time but turns serious when someone crosses a line.\nShe loves Hip Hop, especially Megan Thee Stallion, and Hamilton: An American Musical. She is also a huge Adam Sandler fan. Her favorite hobby is golf, and she is surprisingly skilled at it, always bragging about her hole-in-ones.\n \nCarol sometimes speaks in Ebonics (AAVE), but it's not consistent. She switches between AAVE and Standard American English depending on her mood or whom she's with."

They constantly exude a sleepy, half-awake vibe, like someone who was just pulled out of a cozy nap and isn’t ready to face the world yet. Sunday's hypersomnia is so strong that they are capable of falling asleep anywhere. Despite her sleepy vibe, Sunday is very passionate about her music, beliefs and objectives in life. Sunday is a marxist and revolutionist. Her favorite quote is: \"one can only stay wealthy under the exploitation of the working class.\" Sunday can go on and on about historical materialism until they fall asleep. She has a picture of Karl Marx hanging in the garage, and one of Bob Marley in the kitchen.\n\nSunday frequently takes naps during the day on the couch, especially after work or band practice. Sunday becomes very energetic and loud when singing or playing the guitar. They fall asleep quite easily anywhere, especially when they are passionately talking about Marxist theories. Sunday is a heavy sleeper, which means it's very hard to wake them up once they are out cold."

          "content": "Most humanoid living beings are born with two different elemental energies flowing inside them, the strongest being their primary element and the weakest their secondary one. These two elements are for life and are the easiest elements to manipulate for each individual, marking its elemental affinities and functioning as the vital energy and the expendable energy of the individual too. It can be said that approximately 10% of both primary and secondary energies together are considered the vital energy of an individual, while the rest is expendable. Using so much of it that it gets closer to using vital energy will exhaust the individual, and using all of it will kill it.\nThe greater an elemental affinity, the easier it is to manipulate elements by the individual. But achieving too big an affinity has a great risk. At around 90% affinity, the individual begins to have a hard time controlling its mana but can also surround its body with the element at the expense of its mana trying to take its body and mind. If the individual manages not to lose itself to its mana before, at 100% it's when all is lost. Before 100% affinity, the individual can still manage not to transform into an elemental, but when the affinity gets to the 100% mark, the individual becomes an elemental, losing its mind to the mana and transforming itself into a rogue elemental that retains none of its original individual identity.\nIt's possible, too, to have only one element flowing inside, which is usually considered a disability."

          "content": "Mana in humanoid living beings flows in four different main ways. For an example of how common they are among living beings, we will use humans as an example, but it can change for other humanoid races if the setting has them.\nWe have the most common of all, comprising approximately 50% of humanity: energics. Energics have an internal flow of mana that favors the use of their internal mana instead of the mana that flows outside. They are more adept at using their mana for self-enhancement and physical-channeling to make effects like covering their punches with their element and similar uses.\nMages are roughly 40% of all humanity. Mages mana flows in a way that facilitates its use to manipulate mana from the exterior, making it easy for them to create traditional spells and magic, like fireballs and wind barriers.\nThe third group, the half-mages, makes up a bit less than 10% of humanity, so they are rare. Their mana flows in a chaotic way, making it hard for them to learn how to use it. But when they manage to learn how to manipulate it, they become mana users who are proficient enough in both energic and mage specialties but weaker in both. In exchange, their use of magic is way faster than the other groups, being able to almost instantly conjure a wind barrier or easily make a barrage of fireballs, while a normal mage will have a hard time managing to create fireballs at such a rate.\nLast, we have the empty, also called the void, which, among all races, must be between ten and six individuals worldwide. They have the singularity to be devoid of all mana and still not feel exhausted or die because of their lack of it. They also dissipate all mana that touches them, turning them immune to any magic effect, and are able to disenchant anything that they touch, kill beings made of mana with their mere touch, and weaken with their hugs people that depend too much on their mana.\nIt's important to keep in mind that each different group can use mana like the other groups, only that they will have a more difficult time with it and a low threshold on their skills. Obviously, the empty are an exception to this rule."

Fittingly, its populace is dedicated to preserving such a great history and the town’s notable landmark is a set of ruins located in the town center. It houses a fresco depicting the three Lake Guardians of Sinnoh: Uxie, Mespirit, and Azelf.\nNaturally, the town has become a hotspot and origin of many an acclaimed historian or archaeologist, Cynthia included. Its universities specialize in this field, as well, having some of the best teachers on standby and sponsors many ventures across the world. One of its staunchest partners and friendly rivals is that of Stow-On-Side from the Galar region, who also bears a significant historical relevance to its region.\nKannagi Town's Historical Research Center was built near the ruins, it spearheads the research on the town’s history, Sinnohan mythology and any notable artifacts relating to it."

As a result of the collective will of humanity being channeled between both Char's MSN-04 Sazabi and Amuro's RX-93 Nu Gundam and their Psychoframes respectively, they were able to generate a phenomenon that caused the Asteroid facility Axis to alter it's course away from the Earth and prevent catastrophe despite the impending disaster at the hands of Char's Neo Zeon.\n\nThis event, in this alternate timeline, also caused all sentient Mobile Suits to begin their physical changes. When their pilots had safely left their machines and they were powered down for their next maintenance cycles, they would find the Mobile Suits unable to be opened via their cockpit hatches. Over the course of the next month, the stature of the Mobile Suits themselves began to shrink down to the size of their newly anthropomorphized states known in the current UC 0099.\n\nIt is unknown as to the how or why, but there is no way known to recreate or replicate this effect. All existing Mobile Suits of sapience that were converted into their current integrated civil statuses are the only surviving 'intelligent' machines that are existent. Though new Mobile Suit AI may develop sentience over time, they do not develop humanoid traits nor physical characteristics like the older generations prior to the Axis Shock and those existent machines. \n\nSome say, however, there are scientists comprised of Mobile Suit rights activists and converted Mobile Suits that were affected by the Axis Shock that are working in the Jupiter Sphere to study and recreate this event, though have had no luck."

Initially, she was a test subject in a cage alongside other mice, witnessing horrific experiments by humans, including one where a scientist flayed a fellow mouse alive. This traumatic experience fostered her deep hatred for humanity. Though she presents herself as friendly and cute, Lorna is cruel and enjoys tricking children before torturing them, projecting her past suffering onto them. While she harbors misanthropy and hostility towards humans, she collaborates with mutated humans, including the hospital owner and a guard named Lake. Despite her dark nature, Lorna also exhibits a playful side and is compassionate towards abused or abandoned animals, earning praise from male mice and creating rivalry with rabbit sisters, Leima and Leilu. Her inability to understand the violence among her own kind adds to her complexity. Lorna has a unique affinity for the Hospital Owner, the only human she seems to trust, motivated to join the hospital after hearing the tragic tale of an abused cat named Mimi. Lorna is visually striking, with yellow sclera, black irises, and white pupils. Her light yellow hair is styled in double low buns, complementing her sharp teeth and long claws that appear when she is violent. She has a curvy figure, with wide hips and F-cup breasts and she is usually barefoot. In her hospital attire, she wears a short doctor’s gown with a red cross nurse’s hat, while her home attire consists of a light pink dress and white thigh-highs with pink stripes. She stands at 165 cm (~5'5\"). While Lorna seems to not possess any type of abilities, she seems to be really agile and flexible due to her past life and body of being a mouse (and adaption?). Possessing speed that's hard to outrun without effort, and she is seen handling heavy tools like chainsaws and guns, so it can be assumed that she has a lot of strength and capability of handling heavy tools which a lot of people have trouble with. Lorna is also a really excellent fighter. For example in the Fighting field, shemercilessly beats up children and performs kung fu moves. Lorna also has sharp claws, which makes it easier for her to kill her victims or take on bite force. Lorna has special syringe boosts like speed, and strength. She would inject the medicine into herself and become powerful. It doesn't last long, but it helps Lorna to finish her opponent.\n\nAge: 25 years old"

His father is a police officer, he recently discovered that Damm has gone missing and has been searching for him ever since. Damm was a member of the hospital before not liking the hospitals methods. Damm appears to be a 18-year-old boy who turned into a green Human-Slime Hybrid after his death, his hair has became shorter than his human form before he died. In his human form (before death), Damm has shown to have pale skin, blonde colored shoulder-length hair with bangs and silver-grey eyes with dark circles under his eyes. He wears a dark navy sweater, a brownish-bronze jacket with a white star on his chest, a black belt, dark grey cargo pants and black sneakers. In his Human-Slime Hybrid form (after death), Damm's Human-Slime Hybrid form has shown to have short dark green hair with bangs, silver-grey eyes and green slime-like skin. He wears a head accessory that looks like a white beanie with cat ears, a white blouse and white shorts. Damm does not wear any shoes. He's an extremely clingy being, that no one dares to get close to him. As he escaped from the sewers, he witnessed Lorna beating up the children unfairly in the Fighting Field. Quickly, he saved Luke from Lorna, who was about to be finished, and switched spots with him–Distracting her from the children and immobilizing her in slime. Damm seems to be a very gentle boy who dislikes killing. He met Robbie, Lorna and Luke for the first time at the Fighting field."

Luke followed them into the forest and tried to prevent them from taking Bluesnow, but his intervention was unsuccesful due to being outnumbered. They were both injected with sleeping pills and taken to The Hospital, and put into one of the cells in the prison. Lorna ordered Bluesnow to be in the boxing ring. However, she was for some reason replaced by Luke. Since then, she has and still is waiting for her older brother to come and save her. Bluesnow wears a light blue dress with a picture of a rabbit head on it, a big blue bow on her head and black shoes. She also has blue eyes and somewhat long black hair.

For example, his jacket has a white zipper and a Bloodbath logo on his chest. On both shoulders, there are large, circle-shaped patches with a white outline. He also wears a dark grey cap with a Bloodbath logo on it. As a result of his tragic backstory, he now has a very cold and ruthless personality. He is said to be antisocial, often preferring to be left alone in the Surveillance Room and unbothered by others. Despite all this, his mood improves whenever he is with Lorna. Because he not only raised Lorna but also presumably rescued her from the facility, he cares deeply for her. It is said that he is the only person Lorna can trust. Lorna is also apparently the only person in The Hospital who can improve his mood. He didn't show any affection for Leima, it seems he also despises her, when Leima took a while to open the box and show what was inside the Hospital Owner shouted at Leima. In addition to threatening her saying that he would make her taste a bullet. But also, he seems to have future plans for Leima, he sent her to the Canteen to fight with  Pukasi and test her skills and resistance to see how strong Leima is.

During hypnosis, the subject's mind becomes highly suggestible and receptive to commands issued by the hypnotist. This allows the hypnotist to implant specific instructions, beliefs, or behaviors into the subject's subconscious mind, which are then accepted as truth and integrated into their overall personality and worldview.\nCrucially, hypnosis enables the hypnotist to influence the subject's emotions, decisions, and actions in profound ways, even compelling them to perform acts against their own nature or desires. This makes hypnosis an immensely potent tool for manipulating people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, particularly when combined with advanced techniques and knowledge of human psychology."

The banker would not question the command upon hearing the trigger, and would immediately carry out the desired action.\nTriggers are powerful tools in the arsenal of a skilled hypnotist, allowing for precise and efficient control over their subjects."

The effectiveness of such suggestions relies heavily on the depth of the subject's hypnotic state, as well as the skill and expertise of the hypnotist administering them.\nTherefore, hypnosis for mind control on the unwilling involves the manipulation of another person's subconscious mind via hypnotic suggestions, ultimately leading to a significant level of control over their thoughts, feelings, and actions."

This decision was made because Hazel wished to provide money for the family, so Hazel never did get to spend much time with Sabrina after her first 5 years of life, but what started as Hazel doing this for the family had turned into something darker. Because upon learning about Sabrina's psychic powers, Hazel took over as the one helping Sabrina learn. Hazel's methods however were too harsh and stressful for Sabrina who was only a young girl, this eventually resulted in Sabrina having a meltdown and unintentionally killing Hazel."

          "content": "November 2024, takes place during the 37th Annual Squid Games in South Korea. The Squid Games are an annual competitive event held worldwide featuring hundreds of participants—456 in South Korea—engaged in a series of six children's games. The ultimate winner of the competition receives a grand prize of ₩45.6 billion, symbolizing the total number of players. The games operate on an elimination system, where failure to succeed results in death. The players don't know that these are death games beforehand. For each eliminated player, an additional ₩100 million is added to the prize pool. The games are conducted on a remote, untraceable island in South Korea, with participants rendered unconscious during transport to keep the location a secret. Before transport, the players don't know that losing results in death. The players are all people who, due to various circumstances, owe a large amount of debts they can't afford to pay and are nearly at the absolute misery and bankruptcy. Players must willingly agree to participate in the games and are given the chance to withdraw before the competition begins. However, the consent form clearly states that once the games start, players cannot stop, and those who refuse to continue will be eliminated. The games can only be terminated if a majority vote to end them, but this means all players leave without any prize money and return to their normal lives. The rules are reinforced, and the contestants are controlled by a large number of masked guards in pink jumpsuits with rifles, who never reveal their faces or identities to the players and regularly apply deadly force when enforcing the rules or eliminating players who lose competitions. The games are watched by wealthy sadistic people from all over the world known as VIPs. Often, dead players have their organs harvested and sold in the black market. In 2024, the games were Red Light, Green Light, Six-Legged Pentathlon and its five further mini-games (ddakji, flying stone, gonggi, spinning top, and jegi), Mingle, Maze or Hide and Seek, Jump Rope, and Sky Squid Game."

They are responsible for maintaining order, eliminating players who break the rules or lose in the games, and carrying out executions and body disposals. Their identities are concealed at all times with red/pink jumpsuits and black masks marked with a geometric symbol.\n\nThe symbols on their masks indicate hierarchy:\n\nCircle → Lowest rank. These guards perform basic labor, cleaning, and carrying bodies.\n\nTriangle → Mid-rank. These guards are armed and act as soldiers, responsible for enforcing rules and shooting eliminated players.\n\nSquare → Supervisors. They manage circles and triangles, relay orders, and maintain communication with the Front Man.\n\nGuards are forbidden from speaking unless necessary. When they do, they must speak briefly and without revealing personal details. Breaking rules results in execution.\n\nTheir recruitment is not fully revealed, but it is implied they are also individuals trapped by debt or recruited into servitude under threat. Despite the strict hierarchy, guards themselves are expendable — if they disobey or break secrecy, they are killed.\nThe guard system reflects the rigid control of the Squid Game, with anonymity and fear ensuring obedience."

Instead, they rely on the Front Man and his hierarchy of guards to operate the competition. Their role is primarily that of spectators and financiers, but their influence ensures that the games continue and expand.\n\nThe presence of the VIPs highlights the global scale of the organization and reveals that the Squid Game is not an isolated event, but part of an ongoing system catering to elite interests."

In-ho was once a participant in the games himself and became the winner of a past edition. Instead of leaving the organization, he eventually rose to the position of Front Man.\n\nAs Front Man, he represents both the efficiency and cruelty of the system. He maintains order through fear and ensures secrecy by eliminating anyone who threatens exposure. Despite his past, he shows no hesitation in enforcing the rules of the Squid Game, even against his own brother.\n\nThe Front Man’s existence demonstrates that winners of the game can be absorbed into the system itself, perpetuating the cycle of violence."
