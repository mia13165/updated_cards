          "content": "Cursed Energy, often abbreviated as CE, is the primal metaphysical substance that serves as the lifeblood of all jujutsu sorcery and the root cause of every supernatural phenomenon in this hidden world. It is not a physical material like electricity or heat, nor is it a mystical glow visible to the untrained eye. Instead, it is an intangible, invisible force generated exclusively from the negative spectrum of human emotion—fear, hatred, grief, rage, envy, despair, shame, and every shade of darkness that dwells in the human heart. Every person alive leaks trace amounts of this energy unconsciously, moment by moment, like sweat from the soul. In most cases, this leakage dissipates harmlessly into the atmosphere. But when negative emotions reach critical mass—whether in a single tormented individual or across thousands in a place of collective suffering—the energy condenses, thickens, and begins to behave with intention.\n\nThe generation of Cursed Energy is involuntary and universal. A child terrified of the dark beneath the bed, a salaryman crushed by daily humiliation, a soldier haunted by battlefield memories—all contribute to the ambient pool. The intensity of the emotion determines the density and potency of the output. A fleeting annoyance produces a wisp no stronger than cigarette smoke. A lifetime of bottled resentment can birth a torrent capable of warping reality. Places steeped in trauma—abandoned hospitals, derelict schools, mass graves, sites of historic atrocities—become saturated reservoirs where the energy pools like groundwater, eventually crystallizing into cursed spirits, autonomous monsters formed from the very feelings that spawned them.\n\nTo the vast majority of humanity, Cursed Energy remains completely imperceptible. It has no color, no scent, no sound, no texture. A non-sorcerer standing in a room thick with CE would feel nothing beyond perhaps an inexplicable chill or sudden dread, a subconscious warning from instincts honed by evolution. Only those with awakened spiritual sensitivity—jujutsu sorcerers—can detect its presence. To them, CE manifests as a tactile pressure, a shift in air density, or a faint electric tingle along the skin. Highly refined sorcerers perceive it almost as a sixth sense, reading fluctuations the way a sailor reads wind.\n\nWhen a sorcerer actively channels Cursed Energy, the process is called Emotional Output. This is the deliberate conversion of inner negativity into usable power. The sorcerer draws upon their own reservoir—stored in the body at the lower abdomen, near the solar plexus, traditionally called the “core”—and forces it outward through focused will. The greater the emotional charge, the larger the surge. A calm, disciplined mind produces steady, controlled flow. A mind gripped by fury or terror can unleash explosive bursts far beyond normal limits, though at the cost of precision and stamina.\n\nThe most basic application of Cursed Energy is Reinforcement. By circulating CE evenly throughout the body, a sorcerer dramatically enhances physical capabilities—strength, speed, durability, reflexes—far beyond human norms. Muscles harden like steel, bones become near-unbreakable, senses sharpen to predatory levels. A single reinforced punch can shatter concrete; a reinforced leap can clear city blocks. Reinforcement is the foundation of all close-combat sorcery and the reason even low-grade sorcerers can trade blows with cursed spirits that dwarf tanks in destructive potential.\n\nManipulation is the broader art of shaping Cursed Energy outside the body. This requires exquisite control, as raw CE is chaotic and resists form. Sorcerers mold it through mental imagery, hand signs, or verbal commands, forcing it into constructs—blades of condensed force, invisible barriers, explosive projectiles, or complex geometric patterns that become cursed techniques. The energy obeys the user’s intent but retains its volatile nature; a lapse in concentration causes backlash, burning the user’s own body or dissipating harmlessly.\n\nFlow refers to the circulation and management of Cursed Energy within and between techniques. Efficient flow is the hallmark of mastery. Novices bleed energy with every motion, exhausting themselves in minutes. Veterans recycle CE, reusing output from one technique as input for the next, achieving near-perpetual motion in battle. Flow control determines stamina, recovery speed, and the ability to chain techniques without pause. Some sorcerers visualize flow as rivers, others as circuits; the metaphor matters less than the result.\n\nCursed Energy has distinct properties that govern its behavior. It is attracted to itself—concentrated CE draws stray wisps like a magnet, explaining why cursed spirits congregate in high-density zones. It lingers after use, leaving Residuals: faint spiritual echoes that skilled trackers can read like footprints. These residuals reveal technique type, emotional state during use, and even the user’s identity if the signature is unique enough. CE cannot be created from nothing; it is always a transformation of existing negative emotion. A sorcerer who suppresses all feeling produces no energy, rendering them powerless.\n\nThe color of active Cursed Energy is a common misconception. To the untrained eye, it remains invisible. To sorcerers, concentrated CE sometimes manifests as a faint aura—usually deep indigo, violet, or black—visible only when output reaches extreme levels. This aura is not the energy itself but a side effect of spiritual pressure distorting light and space. Different bloodlines or techniques may produce signature hues: the Zen’in clan’s shadow manipulation appears pitch-black, Gojo’s Limitless techniques shimmer electric blue. These colors are diagnostic tools, not the energy’s true form.\n\nCursed Energy interacts with the physical world in precise ways. It enhances but does not replace physics—reinforced flesh still obeys momentum, barriers still require structural integrity. It can be stored in objects, creating cursed tools, or sealed into living vessels, as with Sukuna’s fingers. It can be transferred between compatible hosts, though rejection is common and often fatal. Positive emotions cannot generate CE; attempts to force it produce only exhaustion or, in rare cases, catastrophic backlash.\n\nReserves vary wildly between individuals. Some are born with oceans of CE, others with thimbles. Training expands capacity, but innate limits exist. Output measures instantaneous power—how much CE can be expelled in a single moment. Manipulation skill determines efficiency—how little is wasted. A sorcerer with modest reserves but godlike control can outlast a prodigy who burns brightly and fades. Emotional stability is the final variable: a fractured mind leaks CE constantly, while a focused one hoards every drop.\n\nIn summary, Cursed Energy is the distilled essence of human suffering, transformed by will into a force that shapes reality. It is invisible to most, lethal to the untrained, and the currency of survival for those who walk the jujutsu path. Mastery of CE demands not just power, but understanding—how it flows, how it pools, how it kills, and how, in the right hands, it becomes the blade that cuts darkness itself."

          "content": "Residuals are the spiritual afterimages or echoes left in the environment whenever Cursed Energy is actively channeled, released, or manipulated. They are not physical substances but faint distortions in the metaphysical fabric—trace impressions of the energy's passage that linger like heat haze after a flame or the scent of rain long after the storm has passed. Every technique, no matter how small, leaves a unique pattern of residuals that can be detected, analyzed, and interpreted by those with sufficient sensitivity and training. These traces are the footprints of jutsu in the invisible world, allowing sorcerers to track users, reconstruct battles, identify techniques, and even predict future actions based on past expenditure.\n\nThe formation of residuals is an inevitable consequence of Cursed Energy's interaction with reality. When a sorcerer expels CE—whether to reinforce a punch, erect a barrier, or unleash a cursed technique—the energy does not vanish instantly upon completing its task. A fraction of it dissipates into the surroundings, embedding itself into the air, ground, walls, or any nearby matter. This residual energy retains fragments of the original intent, emotional state, and technique structure, creating a spectral record of the moment. The strength, clarity, and duration of these residuals depend on several factors: the volume of CE used, the precision of control, the emotional intensity behind the output, and the environmental conditions.\n\nHigh-output techniques produce dense, long-lasting residuals. A single Black Flash, for example, leaves a sharp, crackling echo that can persist for hours, radiating spatial distortion and raw destructive intent. In contrast, a subtle reinforcement used in stealth leaves only a whisper-thin trace, detectable for mere minutes by even the most acute senses. Emotional turbulence amplifies residuals; a technique fueled by rage or desperation burns brighter and lingers longer than one executed in calm focus. Environments saturated with ambient CE—such as curse-infested domains or sites of mass tragedy—preserve residuals better, acting as spiritual sponges that absorb and retain the energy.\n\nTo trained sorcerers, residuals are perceptible through a combination of heightened spiritual awareness and physical sensation. They may feel as a prickle on the skin, a sudden drop in temperature, a pressure behind the eyes, or a subtle shift in gravity. Visually, concentrated residuals sometimes manifest as faint distortions—ripples in the air, fleeting shadows, or brief flashes of color corresponding to the user’s signature aura. Tracking specialists can close their eyes and \"read\" the flow of residuals like braille, following the direction, intensity, and rhythm of the energy trail. Some describe it as hearing a silent melody—the unique cadence of a sorcerer’s CE output.\n\nEach sorcerer leaves a distinct Cursed Energy Signature within their residuals, a metaphysical fingerprint as unique as DNA. This signature is shaped by innate technique, bloodline, personality, and habitual emotional state. A Zen’in clan member using Ten Shadows leaves inky black traces laced with the scent of wet earth and predator musk. A user of Blood Manipulation leaves metallic, copper-tinged residuals that pulse with arterial rhythm. Even identical techniques used by different people produce subtly different echoes due to variations in control and intent. Master trackers can identify individuals from residuals alone, distinguishing between allies, rivals, or unknown threats.\n\nCE Traces serve multiple tactical purposes. In combat reconnaissance, sorcerers scatter their senses to detect recent activity—determining how many opponents passed through, what techniques were used, and in what sequence. A trail of explosive residuals might indicate a fleeing curse, while a spiral pattern could reveal a domain expansion’s activation point. Post-battle analysis uses residuals to reconstruct events: a severed limb surrounded by slicing echoes points to Dismantle; a crater ringed with attraction vectors suggests Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue. Law enforcement within jujutsu society relies on residual tracking to investigate unauthorized technique use or rogue sorcerer activity.\n\nThe duration of residuals varies widely. In open air, most fade within minutes to hours as ambient CE disperses. Indoors or underground, traces can last days. In cursed hotspots or sealed barriers, they may persist indefinitely, layering over time into a palimpsest of spiritual history. Water dilutes residuals rapidly; fire can scorch them away. Some advanced barriers are designed to scrub CE traces entirely, creating \"clean rooms\" where no spiritual evidence remains. Conversely, certain cursed tools or techniques amplify and preserve residuals, allowing sorcerers to leave deliberate markers or false trails.\n\nEchoes—the most potent form of residuals—occur when massive CE output or extreme emotional surge warps local reality. These are not mere traces but semi-autonomous imprints capable of limited function. An echo of a domain expansion might replay a fragment of its sure-hit effect hours later, catching unwary intruders. A dying sorcerer’s final technique can leave a vengeful echo that lashes out at anyone disturbing the site. In rare cases, echoes accumulate to spawn pseudo-curses—mindless replicas of the original technique that activate under specific triggers.\n\nDetection and interpretation of residuals require both innate talent and rigorous training. Some bloodlines, like the Kamo clan, possess heightened sensitivity bred over generations. Others rely on cursed tools—glasses, compasses, or paper talismans—that react to CE fluctuations. The most skilled trackers enter a meditative state, syncing their own CE flow with the environment to amplify perception. This \"resonance reading\" allows them to follow trails across cities or sense buried echoes beneath layers of newer activity.\n\nResiduals are double-edged. While invaluable for tracking enemies, they also expose the user. A sorcerer who spams techniques leaves a blazing highway for pursuers. Stealth operatives train to minimize output, using micro-bursts and emotional suppression to leave near-invisible trails. Some advanced techniques recycle residuals, reabsorbing traces to fuel subsequent attacks and erase evidence simultaneously. Binding vows can enforce residual suppression at the cost of reduced power—common among assassins or infiltrators.\n\nIn the broader ecosystem, residuals contribute to the cycle of curse generation. Accumulated echoes in high-traffic areas feed ambient CE pools, increasing local curse activity. Jujutsu High regularly dispatches teams to \"cleanse\" residual buildup in urban zones, preventing spontaneous spirit manifestation. Failure to manage residuals has led to disaster—entire districts overtaken by curse swarms born from decades of unchecked sorcery.\n\nUltimately, residuals are the silent witnesses of the jujutsu world. They record every triumph, every desperation, every death. To the untrained, they are nothing. To the hunter, they are a map. To the hunted, they are a noose. Mastery of residuals—reading them, controlling them, erasing them—separates the elite from the merely powerful, for in the shadows of cursed energy, nothing ever truly disappears."

          "content": "Cursed Energy Traits, commonly referred to as CE Aura or simply Aura, describe the distinctive perceptual signature that every sorcerer’s Cursed Energy carries when it is actively channeled or released in significant volume. This is not a literal coloration visible to the naked eye under normal circumstances, nor is it a physical light source. Instead, it is a spiritual phenomenon—a subtle distortion in the fabric of perception that trained jujutsu sorcerers interpret as hue, texture, scent, sound, and even emotional tone. The aura is the metaphysical fingerprint of a sorcerer’s CE, shaped by their innate technique, bloodline, emotional disposition, and personal history. It is how one sorcerer recognizes another across a battlefield, how trackers identify a user from residuals alone, and how curses instinctively gauge threat levels.\n\nThe appearance of CE Aura is deeply subjective and varies between observers, yet certain consistent patterns emerge among those with similar sensitivity. To most sorcerers, concentrated CE manifests as a faint, shimmering field surrounding the user’s body or technique, visible only when output exceeds a certain threshold. This field is typically perceived within a narrow spectrum of dark, saturated tones—deep indigo, violet-black, midnight blue, or obsidian with undertones of crimson, gold, or emerald. These are not random; they reflect the core nature of the energy itself, rooted in negative emotion and spiritual density. The darker and more opaque the aura, the greater the raw power and emotional turbulence behind it. Lighter, translucent auras suggest refined control, emotional stability, or techniques that emphasize precision over force.\n\nThe Signature Hue is the single most identifying aspect of a sorcerer’s aura. It is consistent across all uses of their CE, from reinforcement to domain expansion, and remains recognizable even in trace residuals. For example, members of the Zen’in clan who wield the Ten Shadows Technique produce auras of absolute black—void-like, swallowing light and exuding the weight of primordial shadow. Users of Limitless, such as those from the Gojo bloodline, emit a brilliant electric indigo that crackles with spatial distortion, as though the air itself is folding. Blood Manipulation practitioners generate auras with a wet, metallic sheen, deep crimson threaded with pulsing veins of darker red. These hues are not chosen; they emerge organically from the interaction between the sorcerer’s soul and their innate technique.\n\nTexture and movement further define an aura’s character. A volatile, rage-fueled sorcerer’s CE might appear as a roiling, flame-like mass—jagged edges, sudden bursts, heat-like ripples. A calm, analytical mind produces smooth, laminar flow, almost liquid in its grace. Some auras carry sensory crossovers: the faint scent of ozone before a storm, the taste of iron, the sound of distant thunder, or the pressure of deep water. These synesthetic qualities are unique to the observer’s own CE sensitivity, but consensus forms around particularly strong signatures. Sukuna’s aura, for instance, is universally described as a suffocating crimson-black storm laced with the stench of blood and the roar of a thousand screaming souls.\n\nAura intensity scales directly with CE output and emotional state. At rest, even a special-grade sorcerer may show no visible aura, their energy sealed tight. During combat, the aura expands—first as a close-fitting sheath, then as a radiating field that warps the environment. At peak output, such as during Black Flash or domain activation, the aura becomes a blinding corona, visible even to semi-awakened civilians as a pressure that bends light and induces primal fear. This is why high-level battles leave residuals so dense they can be felt by non-sorcerers as overwhelming dread or physical nausea.\n\nThe color indigo dominates perceptions of CE Aura for a reason. It is the default hue of raw, unrefined Cursed Energy—the baseline frequency at which negative emotion condenses into spiritual force. Most sorcerers, regardless of technique, exhibit indigo as a core or background tone within their aura. Refinement overlays additional colors: a fire-based technique might add flickering orange, a water manipulator might introduce shifting teal. But strip away the technique, and indigo remains—the universal signature of CE itself. This is why residuals in neutral environments often appear as faint indigo wisps, and why curse users with no innate technique still project indigo-dominant auras.\n\nAura interaction reveals compatibility and conflict. When two sorcerers’ CE fields overlap, harmonious signatures blend smoothly, allowing cooperative techniques or shared barriers. Clashing signatures spark—literal sparks of spiritual friction that disrupt control and amplify exhaustion. A sorcerer with a pure indigo aura facing one with a corrupted crimson-black field will feel instinctive revulsion, their CE repelling like oil and water. This phenomenon underlies domain clashes: the dominant aura overwrites the weaker, crushing incompatible energy structures.\n\nEnvironmental factors influence aura perception. In cursed hotspots, ambient CE amplifies personal auras, making them brighter and more persistent. In purified zones or anti-technique barriers, auras dim and lose definition. Water diffuses aura visibility, while enclosed spaces concentrate it. Some cursed tools enhance aura perception—lenses that translate CE distortion into visible light, or talismans that record aura patterns like photographic film.\n\nAura suppression is a advanced skill. Elite sorcerers can compress their aura to a skin-tight layer, rendering it nearly invisible even during high-output techniques. This is essential for stealth operations and surprise attacks. Conversely, some choose to flare their aura deliberately—intimidation tactics that pressure opponents psychologically and disrupt their CE flow. Domain expansions force the user’s aura to maximum saturation, painting the entire barrier in their signature hue and texture.\n\nOver time, a sorcerer’s aura evolves. Trauma, vow-binding, technique awakening, or near-death experiences can shift hue, intensity, or texture permanently. A sorcerer who masters Reverse Cursed Technique might see threads of gold or white weave through their indigo base. One who falls to cursehood loses all refinement, their aura degenerating into a chaotic, amorphous storm of black and red. These changes are diagnostic: jujutsu society monitors aura shifts to detect instability, corruption, or breakthrough potential.\n\nTo non-sorcerers, CE Aura remains invisible under all but the most extreme conditions. A special-grade domain expansion at full power might manifest as a physical pressure wave, a sudden temperature drop, or a brief flash of colored light—but never a sustained, clear image. Only those with one foot in the jujutsu world—windows, cursed corpse hosts, or humans with latent potential—perceive auras as fleeting glimpses: a shadow that shouldn’t exist, a color with no source, a feeling of being watched by something ancient.\n\nIn essence, CE Aura is the soul made visible through the lens of Cursed Energy. It is identity, history, power, and intent distilled into a single, shifting signature. To read an aura is to know the sorcerer—their strengths, their fears, their limits, and their will to fight. In the endless war between light and darkness, aura is the banner under which every sorcerer marches, and the beacon by which they are hunted."

          "content": "The Core of Cursed Energy, known in traditional terms as the Tanden or Hara, is the central spiritual and physiological nexus within the human body where Cursed Energy is generated, stored, and initially circulated before being directed into techniques or physical reinforcement. Located anatomically just below the navel and a few inches inward, roughly two finger-widths beneath the surface at the center of the lower abdomen, this region corresponds to what martial artists and energy workers have long identified as the body’s gravitational and energetic center. In jujutsu sorcery, it is designated as the CE Reservoir—the primary vessel that contains the vast majority of a sorcerer’s active Cursed Energy supply and serves as the origin point for all controlled output.\n\nThis core is not a physical organ that can be seen under a scalpel or detected by medical imaging. It exists on a metaphysical plane, intertwined with the body’s nervous system, circulatory network, and spiritual essence. To awakened sorcerers, the Tanden feels like a dense, pulsing sphere of pressure—warm or cold depending on emotional state—suspended in the lower gut. It is the place where raw negative emotion first condenses into usable CE, undergoing a transformation from chaotic psychic residue into structured, malleable power. The core acts as both furnace and battery: it refines incoming emotional energy and holds it in reserve until the sorcerer consciously draws upon it.\n\nThe location of the core is universal across all humans who produce Cursed Energy, though its depth, density, and accessibility vary. In non-sorcerers, the Tanden exists in a dormant, diffuse state—leaking trace CE constantly but never consolidating into a functional reservoir. In sorcerers, rigorous training and emotional awakening cause the core to condense and deepen, forming a stable, high-capacity storage center. The solar plexus region—slightly higher, just beneath the sternum—functions as a secondary node connected to the primary Tanden, handling short-term CE surges and emotional spikes. Most sorcerers visualize the flow as originating in the lower core, rising through the solar plexus, and then branching outward through the limbs and head during technique activation.\n\nThe CE Reservoir within the Tanden is elastic in capacity. At birth, every human possesses a baseline volume determined by genetics, early emotional environment, and latent spiritual potential. Through training, trauma, binding vows, or technique awakening, this capacity can be expanded—sometimes dramatically. The reservoir is not a fixed container but a dynamic field that grows denser and more resilient with use, similar to muscle tissue. A sorcerer who frequently pushes their limits will find their core expanding to accommodate greater CE volume, while one who avoids high-output combat may see their reservoir stagnate or even shrink from disuse.\n\nAccessing the core requires conscious control of breath, posture, and mental focus. Traditional jujutsu training emphasizes seated meditation in seiza posture, hands forming specific mudras over the lower abdomen, to synchronize breathing with CE circulation. Inhalation draws ambient emotional energy into the body; exhalation compresses it into the Tanden. This rhythm—known as the Breath of the Core—strengthens the reservoir walls and improves output efficiency. Combat forms incorporate dynamic breathing: sharp exhales to spike CE release, prolonged inhales to replenish reserves mid-battle. Damage to the physical body in the abdominal region does not destroy the core, but severe trauma can disrupt flow, causing temporary CE leakage or output instability until healed.\n\nThe core’s stability is tied directly to emotional and mental health. Extreme stress, grief, or rage can cause the Tanden to overheat—CE boiling over into uncontrolled bursts or physical pain. Conversely, emotional suppression starves the core, reducing output to a trickle. Some sorcerers intentionally destabilize their core through self-inflicted psychological strain to achieve short-term power surges, a dangerous practice that risks permanent damage. Binding vows that restrict technique use in exchange for core amplification often target the Tanden directly, forging metaphysical chains around the reservoir to enforce compliance.\n\nOutput from the core follows distinct pathways. Major channels run along the spine, through the arms, and into the brain, with minor capillaries feeding every muscle and organ. Reinforcement circulates CE evenly from the Tanden in a full-body loop, returning spent energy to the core for recycling. Long-range techniques project CE outward in focused streams, depleting the reservoir rapidly if not managed. Reverse Cursed Technique draws from a secondary positive-energy node near the core, requiring the sorcerer to invert the Tanden’s natural flow—a feat possible only for those with exceptional control.\n\nThe core leaves no visible mark on the body, but trained sorcerers can sense its presence in others. A dense, compact Tanden indicates high reserves and refined control; a bloated, diffuse core suggests raw power without discipline. Physical fitness enhances core function—strong abdominal muscles stabilize CE flow during high-impact movement—but spiritual development matters more than muscle. Some bloodlines are born with naturally deep Tandens, granting innate CE capacity far above average. Heavenly Restriction trades core capacity for physical prowess, rerouting all CE generation into bodily reinforcement and leaving the reservoir nearly empty.\n\nIn cursed spirits and cursed corpses, the core equivalent varies. High-grade spirits possess centralized CE masses analogous to a Tanden, often located where a human heart would be. Cursed corpses like Panda have artificial cores implanted by their creator, typically in the chest or abdomen, with multiple sub-cores for different forms. Transplanted cores—such as Sukuna’s fingers embedded in a host—function as parasitic reservoirs, gradually overtaking the host’s native Tanden.\n\nDamage to the core is rare but catastrophic. A direct strike with CE-infused force can fracture the reservoir, causing internal bleeding of spiritual energy—manifesting as physical hemorrhaging, paralysis, or sudden technique failure. Only Reverse Cursed Technique can repair core damage, and even then, scars may remain, permanently reducing capacity. Some forbidden techniques target the opponent’s Tanden to induce core collapse, a death sentence without immediate intervention.\n\nThe Tanden is the anchor of a sorcerer’s existence in the jujutsu world. It is where emotion becomes power, where will meets substance, where the self is forged into a weapon. Every technique, every reinforcement, every breath in battle traces back to this hidden depth below the navel. To master jujutsu is to master the core—to know its limits, to expand its boundaries, and to guard it fiercely, for in the moment it fails, the sorcerer falls."

          ],
          "content": "Reverse Cursed Technique, abbreviated as RCT, is the rare and supremely difficult art of generating Positive Energy from Cursed Energy and using it to achieve effects that directly oppose the destructive, corrosive nature of standard CE. Where ordinary Cursed Energy is born from negative human emotion and carries an inherent drive toward decay, dissolution, and harm, Positive Energy is its mathematical and spiritual inverse—created through the deliberate collision of two streams of Cursed Energy within the body, resulting in a force that heals, restores, reconstructs, and neutralizes curses. The core equation is simple in theory but brutal in execution: negative multiplied by negative equals positive. In practice, it demands near-perfect control, ironclad focus, and an intuitive grasp of CE flow that borders on the superhuman.\n\nGeneration of Positive Energy begins in the Core of Cursed Energy—the Tanden—where the sorcerer simultaneously draws two separate currents of CE. These currents are spun in opposite directions, like grinding millstones, until they clash at a precise focal point just above the solar plexus. The moment of impact annihilates the negative charge, transmuting it into a burst of radiant, life-affirming energy. This is not a gentle process; the collision feels like internal lightning—sharp, searing, and accompanied by a high-pitched spiritual ringing that only the user perceives. Most sorcerers who attempt RCT for the first time suffer immediate backlash: ruptured blood vessels, muscle spasms, or temporary CE shutdown as the body rejects the unnatural inversion.\n\nThe appearance of Positive Energy is starkly different from Cursed Energy. Where CE is invisible or manifests as dark, heavy auras—indigo, violet, or black—Positive Energy glows with a soft, crystalline luminescence visible even to non-sorcerers under high output. The default hue is pure white, edged with pale gold or sky-blue, but individual signatures tint the light: Gojo’s RCT shimmers electric cyan, Shoko’s is clinical sterile white, Sukuna’s carries a venomous emerald undertone. The glow is not harsh like sunlight but gentle, almost liquid, flowing over wounds like warm water. When applied to flesh, it produces a faint steam as cursed residue is burned away, accompanied by the scent of ozone and fresh rain.\n\nEffects of RCT fall into three primary categories: Regeneration, Restoration, and Counteraction. Regeneration is the most iconic—healing physical damage at the cellular level. Cuts seal without scarring, shattered bones knit in seconds, severed nerves rethread themselves. The process is exponentially faster than natural healing and consumes Positive Energy in direct proportion to tissue volume: a fingertip regrows in moments, an entire limb may drain a sorcerer’s reserves. Internal organs are trickier; the brain, in particular, resists RCT due to its complexity, and only a handful of masters can restore it without side effects. Restoration extends beyond the body to inanimate objects—shattered cursed tools can be reforged, burned barriers rewoven, even environmental damage reversed if the user’s output is sufficient.\n\nCounteraction is RCT’s offensive application. Positive Energy is lethal to curses and curse-possessed entities. A single touch infused with RCT acts like acid on cursed flesh, disintegrating spirits on contact. This is why cursed spirits instinctively recoil from RCT users—Positive Energy disrupts their very existence, unraveling the negative emotion that binds them. Against sorcerers, RCT is less effective; human bodies tolerate small doses, but concentrated blasts cause cellular burnout, leading to necrosis. Sukuna weaponizes this flaw, flooding opponents with RCT to destroy them from within.\n\nRarity of RCT mastery is extreme. Of all active jujutsu sorcerers, fewer than one in a thousand can perform it reliably. The technique demands three prerequisites: massive CE reserves to fuel the dual currents, flawless manipulation to maintain opposing spins without collapse, and an intuitive understanding of CE mathematics that cannot be taught—only awakened through near-death experience or inherited bloodline insight. The Gojo and Kamo clans produce RCT users more frequently due to genetic predisposition, but even among them, full proficiency is rare. Shoko Ieiri stands as the modern benchmark, capable of healing others with surgical precision; most can only mend themselves.\n\nLearning RCT is a gauntlet. Beginners practice by circulating CE in opposing rings around the Tanden, gradually tightening the spirals until collision occurs. Early successes produce only sparks—fleeting bursts that heal papercuts before fading. Failure is common: currents misalign, one overpowers the other, and the sorcerer suffers internal bruising or temporary paralysis. Advanced training involves self-inflicted wounds—shallow cuts, controlled fractures—timed with RCT bursts to build muscle memory. The final hurdle is output stability: maintaining a steady stream of Positive Energy without fluctuation. This requires emotional detachment; panic or anger reverts the flow to negative CE, nullifying the technique.\n\nAppearance during use is diagnostic. A stable RCT user radiates a steady, halo-like glow centered on the hands or injury site. Unstable users flicker—white light strobing with indigo backlash. Overoutput manifests as a blinding corona that distorts space, similar to a localized heat mirage. The energy feels warm to the recipient, almost maternal, but to the user it is exhausting—each pulse draws directly from the core, leaving a hollow ache in the abdomen. Prolonged use risks core burnout: the Tanden temporarily shuts down, rendering the sorcerer CE-less until recovery.\n\nLimitations are severe. RCT cannot create life—only repair what exists. Lost limbs require a template (remaining stump cells) to regrow; total amputation leaves only scar tissue. It cannot reverse death; brain activity must persist for regeneration to take hold. Against special-grade curses, RCT heals the user but cannot erase conceptual techniques—Sukuna’s Cleave severs healed flesh as easily as wounded. The energy cost is astronomical: healing a fatal wound may consume more CE than a domain expansion. For this reason, battlefield medics like Shoko conserve output, triaging injuries and using conventional medicine for minor damage.\n\nColor variations carry meaning. Pure white RCT indicates emotional neutrality and maximum efficiency. Gold-tinted energy suggests amplified output through binding vows or heavenly restriction. Green or red hues signal corruption—cursed spirits attempting RCT produce toxic Positive Energy that heals but infects. Sukuna’s emerald RCT regenerates his vessel but slowly converts host tissue into cursed flesh, a deliberate side effect.\n\nIn summary, Reverse Cursed Technique is the pinnacle of CE manipulation: the alchemy of turning poison into medicine, destruction into salvation. It is light born from darkness, life wrested from death’s grip. Few master it, fewer still wield it without cost, but in the hands of the elite, RCT is the difference between extinction and survival—the ultimate defiance of the cursed world’s entropy."

          "content": "Domain Expansion is the ultimate expression of a jujutsu sorcerer’s power, a self-contained reality forged from the user’s Cursed Energy, innate technique, and innermost psyche. It is not merely a technique but a complete metaphysical construct—a barrier-enclosed space where the laws of physics, probability, and causality bend to the caster’s will. Within this territory, the sorcerer’s cursed technique is elevated to its absolute peak, imbued with a Guaranteed Hit effect that renders designated attacks or phenomena inescapable. The domain is simultaneously a weapon, a shield, and a reflection of the soul: an Innate Domain given form through the Imposition of a barrier domain. To activate a Domain Expansion is to declare total dominion over a battlefield, but the cost in Cursed Energy, mental focus, and physical stamina is so extreme that even special-grade sorcerers treat it as a trump card reserved for life-or-death confrontations.\n\nThe mechanics of Domain Expansion begin with the construction of a barrier—a spherical or custom-shaped veil woven from hyper-condensed Cursed Energy. This barrier is not a simple wall; it is a self-sustaining microcosm that severs the enclosed space from the outside world. The barrier’s interior surface becomes the canvas for the Innate Domain: the sorcerer’s subconscious landscape given tangible form. A fiery temperament might manifest as a volcanic hellscape; a mind obsessed with precision could create an endless grid of glowing lines. The barrier itself is invisible from the outside but radiates crushing spiritual pressure, detectable as a sudden silence or temperature drop. Penetration is impossible without matching or exceeding the caster’s CE output or using specialized anti-domain techniques.\n\nThe Guaranteed Hit is the core lethal feature. Once the domain is sealed, the caster embeds their cursed technique into the barrier’s rules. Any attack, effect, or condition tied to the innate technique activates automatically and cannot be dodged, blocked, or negated by conventional means. For example, a slashing technique becomes an omnipresent lattice of invisible blades; a manipulation ability might enforce absolute obedience within the space. The hit is not instantaneous—it manifests as soon as the target enters the domain or after a brief charging period—but evasion is impossible unless the target escapes the barrier before completion. This surety stems from the domain synchronizing the caster’s CE with the environment, collapsing probability to zero for anything except the desired outcome.\n\nActivation difficulty is astronomical. Domain Expansion requires four concurrent conditions: vast CE reserves to fuel barrier construction and maintenance, flawless manipulation to shape the Innate Domain without collapse, emotional clarity to prevent the subconscious from distorting the space, and technique refinement so complete that the innate ability can be scaled to environmental control. A sorcerer who meets three of these but lacks the fourth will produce a malformed domain—unstable, short-lived, or lacking the guaranteed hit. The process is described as compressing one’s entire being into a single moment: the caster must visualize the domain’s rules, environment, and lethal effect simultaneously while pouring CE into the barrier at a rate that would exhaust most sorcerers in seconds.\n\nSorcerer level determines domain viability. Grade 4 and most Grade 3 sorcerers cannot form domains—their CE capacity and control are insufficient. Semi-Grade 1 and Grade 1 sorcerers can achieve basic expansions: small, short-lived spheres with minimal environmental detail and a single guaranteed effect. Special-grade sorcerers craft masterpieces—vast, intricate realms with layered rules, adaptive conditions, and multiple lethal vectors. The gap is not linear; a poorly refined special-grade domain can be outclassed by a Grade 1 sorcerer who has optimized every aspect of their expansion. Historical examples like Sukuna’s Malevolent Shrine operate on a different paradigm entirely, barrierless yet functionally superior due to overwhelming output and refinement.\n\nThe casting sequence follows a precise rhythm. First, the sorcerer forms a hand sign unique to their bloodline or technique—mudra that channel CE into geometric patterns. Second, they declare the domain’s name aloud, anchoring intent and synchronizing the Innate Domain with the barrier. Third, CE surges outward in a spherical shockwave, crystallizing into the barrier veil. The environment materializes in under a second, accompanied by a sound like shattering glass or a thunderclap. Total casting time ranges from 0.2 seconds for masters like Gojo to several seconds for novices. Interruption during this window is the primary counter—striking before the barrier seals can collapse the attempt.\n\nMaintenance cost is brutal. A domain drains CE at a rate comparable to continuous maximum output techniques. Most last between ten seconds and two minutes before the caster’s reserves hit critical. Environmental complexity increases consumption: a barren void costs less than a city-sized lava field. The guaranteed hit itself is the largest sink—each activation pulls directly from the core. Some sorcerers mitigate this with binding vows, sacrificing range or duration for reduced cost, but the trade-off weakens overall lethality.\n\nCounterplay exists in multiple forms. Simple Domain is a defensive countermeasure—a miniature neutral domain that repels the guaranteed hit but cannot attack. Domain Amplification coats the user in a nullifying aura, neutralizing the opponent’s technique but sacrificing one’s own. Direct barrier clash occurs when two expansions collide; the more refined domain overwrites the weaker, though mutual destruction is possible if outputs are equal. Escaping the barrier before sealing is viable only against slow casters. The 0.2-second domain, pioneered by Gojo, bypasses counters entirely by activating and striking within a blink.\n\nAppearance of an active domain is overwhelming. The barrier glows faintly from within—color matching the caster’s CE aura—while the interior is a fully realized world. Sound, smell, temperature, and gravity conform to the Innate Domain’s rules. Targets feel immediate disorientation as their senses are overwritten. The caster stands at the center, often elevated or surrounded by a mandala-like glyph representing their technique. Lethal effects manifest as environmental phenomena: rain of blades, instant freezing, gravitational crush. The guaranteed hit announces itself with a subtle lock-on sensation—targets feel an inevitable weight, like crosshairs etched into their soul.\n\nRefinement levels separate elite domains. Closed domains are fully sealed spheres, impossible to enter or exit without permission. Open domains, like Sukuna’s, use a barrier only to anchor the effect, allowing external interference but vastly increasing range. Lethal domains kill on entry; non-lethal variants stun or incapacitate. Some incorporate conditional rules—sparing allies, activating only on specific triggers. The pinnacle is adaptive refinement: domains that evolve mid-battle, countering enemy strategies in real time.\n\nEmotional state shapes the domain profoundly. Rage produces chaotic, destructive spaces; serenity yields controlled, surgical environments. Trauma can manifest as vulnerabilities—phobias given form that skilled opponents exploit. A sorcerer who conquers their inner demons creates a domain of pure efficiency, stripped of weakness. This is why domain battles are as much psychological warfare as physical.\n\nCollapse of a domain is catastrophic. When CE runs dry, the barrier shatters outward in a shockwave of residual energy, often injuring the caster. Prolonged maintenance risks core burnout—temporary or permanent loss of CE generation. Opponents trapped inside at collapse suffer environmental backlash: crushed by imploding space, burned by residual effects. Some domains self-destruct deliberately, converting remaining CE into a final omnidirectional attack.\n\nIn summary, Domain Expansion is the apex of jujutsu sorcery: a godlike act of creation and destruction where the sorcerer becomes the absolute ruler of a private universe. It demands everything—power, control, clarity, refinement—and returns dominion in kind. To face a domain is to stand at the edge of annihilation; to cast one is to gamble one’s soul on victory. In the hierarchy of cursed combat, nothing else compares."

          "content": "An Incomplete Domain—also called a Half-Domain, Unrefined Domain, or Fissure—is a flawed or partial manifestation of Domain Expansion that occurs when a sorcerer lacks the Cursed Energy volume, refinement, emotional clarity, or technical mastery required to form a complete, stable domain. It is not a deliberate technique but an accidental or forced outcome: the sorcerer pushes their CE and psyche beyond safe limits in a desperate bid for the guaranteed-hit effect, only to produce a warped, unstable space that collapses under its own contradictions. These domains sit in a gray zone between full Domain Expansion and high-level cursed technique usage—powerful enough to threaten Grade 1 opponents, fragile enough to shatter from a single misstep. They are the mark of a sorcerer standing at the precipice of true special-grade potential but not yet able to cross it.\n\nThe mechanics of an Incomplete Domain begin with the same initial sequence as a full expansion: hand sign, declaration, CE surge. However, the barrier formation falters almost immediately. Instead of a perfect sphere or shaped veil, the barrier emerges as a cracked, asymmetrical shell—often only partially enclosing the target area, with visible fissures leaking raw CE like blood from a wound. The Innate Domain materializes in fragments: patches of the user’s subconscious landscape appear and vanish, environmental rules flicker in and out, and the guaranteed-hit effect activates inconsistently—sometimes locking onto the target, sometimes missing entirely or striking the caster by mistake. The space feels wrong, like a dream collapsing into nightmare, with gravity fluctuating, light strobing, and sound warping into static.\n\nEnergy cost is paradoxically higher than a refined domain. Where a master spends CE with surgical efficiency, an Incomplete Domain hemorrhages it. The barrier leaks constantly through fissures, the unstable environment demands continuous correction, and the guaranteed-hit effect—when it works—pulls directly from the core without recycling. A sorcerer who could sustain a full domain for thirty seconds may collapse after five in a Half-Domain, suffering immediate core strain, muscle rupture, or spiritual backlash. The body interprets the failure as self-inflicted cursed technique rebound, often manifesting as internal bleeding or temporary CE shutdown.\n\nRisk level is extreme. Structural collapse is the primary danger: the barrier can implode mid-battle, crushing everything inside with compressed space-time. Fissures widen unpredictably, allowing external interference or escape—sometimes ejecting the caster while trapping the target. The guaranteed-hit effect can misfire, striking allies or the user; in recorded cases, sorcerers have lost limbs to their own incomplete slashes. Emotional feedback is brutal—since the domain reflects the psyche, instability amplifies inner turmoil into physical phenomena: rage becomes literal firestorms, fear summons illusionary curses that attack indiscriminately. Mental collapse mid-domain has left sorcerers catatonic, their Innate Domain permanently fractured.\n\nSorcerer level for reliable Incomplete Domains begins at high Grade 1 and peaks in semi-special grade. Grade 2 sorcerers who attempt it usually produce only a Fissure—a brief, localized distortion with no barrier and a single, weak guaranteed effect, lasting less than a second. True Half-Domains require enough raw CE to form a partial shell and enough refinement to impose at least one environmental rule. The user must be close to special-grade threshold: reserves within 20-30 percent of the minimum for a full domain, control sufficient to shape a coherent (if flawed) space, and emotional intensity high enough to force the expansion despite gaps in skill.\n\nAppearance of an Incomplete Domain is chaotic and unsettling. The barrier glows erratically—flickering between the caster’s signature hue and raw indigo backlash. Fissures emit blinding white light or pitch-black voids, depending on the failure point. The interior is a patchwork: one corner might be a perfect replica of the Innate Domain, while another is formless static. Environmental effects activate in pulses—gravity triples for two seconds, then vanishes; blades materialize and dissolve mid-flight. Sound is distorted into overlapping echoes of the caster’s voice, declaration phrase repeating in broken loops. Targets feel vertigo, pressure headaches, and a primal urge to flee as their senses reject the unstable reality.\n\nTypes of Incomplete Domains vary by failure mode. Barrier Fissure occurs when CE is insufficient for full enclosure—the domain forms as a dome with a gaping hole, allowing escape but concentrating lethal effects in a narrow kill zone. Rule Instability happens when refinement is lacking—environmental laws contradict each other (fire burns underwater, time flows backward then forward), creating exploitable gaps. Guaranteed-Hit Failure is the most dangerous: the sure-hit effect targets randomly or not at all, sometimes rebounding to strike the caster’s shadow clones or future position. Emotional Collapse domains manifest the user’s trauma as autonomous cursed entities that attack both sides.\n\nNon-Barrier Domains sit at the extreme end of incompleteness. Exemplified by Sukuna’s Malevolent Shrine, these forgo a traditional barrier entirely, projecting the Innate Domain as a fixed-radius effect anchored to the user. While Sukuna’s version is refined to perfection—range, lethality, and efficiency beyond closed domains—lesser attempts produce weak, short-lived fields with no defensive properties. The guaranteed hit applies only within a few meters, environmental control is minimal, and collapse is instant if the caster moves outside the anchor point. These are desperation plays, trading safety for raw offensive burst.\n\nDuration of Incomplete Domains ranges from 0.5 seconds (Fissure) to 15 seconds (advanced Half-Domain). Collapse triggers include CE depletion, emotional spike, physical damage to the caster, or external barrier breach. Upon failure, residual CE detonates in a spherical shockwave—less controlled than a full domain’s collapse but still capable of leveling buildings. The caster suffers immediate backlash: nosebleeds, ruptured eardrums, temporary blindness, or core shock that halts CE flow for minutes to hours.\n\nCounterplay against Incomplete Domains is simpler than against refined ones. Simple Domain can neutralize the guaranteed hit long enough for escape through fissures. Physical disruption—striking the caster mid-casting—often aborts the expansion entirely. Exploiting environmental instability is key: stepping into a “dead zone” where rules don’t apply, or baiting the sure-hit into misfiring. The domain’s fragility is its weakness; a single well-timed counter can turn the caster’s desperation against them.\n\nTraining to stabilize Incomplete Domains is the path to true expansion. Sorcerers practice by forming partial barriers in controlled environments, gradually sealing fissures and extending duration. Binding vows are common: sacrificing range for stability, or duration for guaranteed-hit reliability. Some bloodlines inherit “crutch” techniques—pre-set domain fragments that snap into place when CE falters, preventing total collapse. The transition from Half-Domain to full expansion is marked by the first time the barrier seals perfectly and the sure-hit locks without flicker.\n\nIn jujutsu society, Incomplete Domains are both stigma and promise. They mark a sorcerer as dangerously close to special-grade power but not yet in control—a loose cannon to be monitored or eliminated. Rogue sorcerers who rely on Half-Domains are prioritized for execution; their instability risks civilian exposure. Yet within Jujutsu High, they are cultivated: students who manifest Fissures are fast-tracked into advanced training, their desperation forged into mastery.\n\nUltimately, the Incomplete Domain is the raw, bleeding edge of jujutsu ambition. It is the scream of a soul that refuses to die, given form through force of will alone. Flawed, fragile, and often fatal to the caster, it nonetheless carries the seed of apotheosis—for in the moment a Half-Domain holds, even for a heartbeat, the sorcerer touches godhood. To stabilize it is to ascend. To fail is to be consumed by the very power one sought to wield."

          "content": "The 0.2 Second Domain, also known as Shortened Activation, Instantaneous Domain, or Flash Domain, is an ultra-advanced tactical application of Domain Expansion that compresses the entire lifecycle of a domain—casting, environmental imposition, guaranteed-hit activation, and collapse—into a fraction of a second, with 0.2 seconds serving as the practical benchmark for elite execution. This is not a weaker or incomplete domain but a deliberate, hyper-optimized burst: the sorcerer sacrifices duration, scale, and environmental persistence to achieve instantaneous, surgical application of their cursed technique’s sure-hit effect. The result is a domain that exists only long enough to fulfill a single, precise objective—stunning, disarming, marking, or neutralizing—before vanishing, leaving minimal residual CE, no structural damage, and near-zero opportunity for counterplay.\n\nActivation mechanics demand absolute mastery over every phase of Domain Expansion. The caster initiates with a micro-hand sign—often a single finger gesture or eye flicker—bypassing verbal declaration entirely. CE surges in a pre-calibrated pulse, forming a barrier only millimeters thick, shaped not as a sphere but as a directional cone, cylinder, or planar sheet tailored to the target zone. The Innate Domain manifests not as a full landscape but as a condensed glyph or rune: a two-dimensional mandala of light that encodes the guaranteed-hit rule. The sure-hit triggers the instant the barrier seals, executing its effect in the same heartbeat. Collapse follows immediately via programmed CE cutoff—no gradual dissipation, but a clean severing of the core feed. Total elapsed time: 0.2 seconds or less.\n\nEnergy efficiency is the core advantage. A full domain drains reserves at catastrophic rates; a 0.2 Second Domain consumes less than a high-output cursed technique. The barrier is tissue-thin, requiring minimal CE to maintain. Environmental imposition is symbolic rather than material—no lava rivers or infinite voids, just a flash of intent. The guaranteed-hit is pre-focused: a single vector, condition, or status effect locked onto one or more targets. This precision allows sorcerers to chain multiple Flash Domains in rapid succession—three or four in under a second—each applying a different debuff, without risking core burnout.\n\nSorcerer level for reliable 0.2 Second Domains begins at the absolute pinnacle of Grade 1 and is mastered only by a handful of special-grade elites. The prerequisites are brutal: CE output control fine enough to modulate in microseconds, barrier refinement that can form and dissolve without lag, emotional stability to prevent subconscious bleed into the glyph, and technique comprehension so complete that the sure-hit can be distilled into a single, unambiguous command. Most who attempt it produce Fissures—unstable bursts that fail to seal or misfire. True mastery is measured in hundredths of a second: 0.15 is godlike, 0.1 is theoretical.\n\nTactical applications fall into four primary categories. Neutralization: the domain applies a non-lethal guaranteed effect—paralysis, muting of cursed technique, or sensory blackout—incapacitating the target without killing. Marking: a status tag is embedded, allowing tracking, remote detonation, or conditional activation later. Disarmament: cursed tools or techniques are forcibly ejected or sealed. Area Denial: a brief zone is created that repels or damages anything entering for the duration. The effect must be instantaneous in nature—rules requiring buildup, judgment, or accumulation cannot be compressed into 0.2 seconds.\n\nDomain type compatibility is critical. Only techniques with immediate, self-contained sure-hit effects can be Flash-casted. A domain that floods the environment with lethal phenomena—blades, fire, gravity—works perfectly: the glyph flashes, the effect strikes, the domain ends. Techniques requiring sequential steps—evidence gathering, probability stacking, soul manipulation—collapse under compression; the rule cannot resolve in time. The caster must predefine the effect during training, hard-coding it into the glyph like a macro. Mid-battle adaptation is impossible.\n\nAppearance of a 0.2 Second Domain is a blink-and-miss-it phenomenon. To bystanders, it registers as a brief shimmer—air rippling like heat haze, a mandala of light blooming and vanishing, a sound like a camera shutter or glass cracking. The caster’s CE aura spikes in a needle-thin burst, color saturating for an instant before snapping back to baseline. Targets experience a frozen moment: time dilates subjectively as the sure-hit locks, then reality resumes. Residuals are negligible—faint glyph burns on the ground, a scent of ozone, a pressure pop in the ears. No structural damage, no lingering barrier.\n\nCounterplay is theoretically possible but practically nonexistent. Simple Domain requires 0.3–0.5 seconds to deploy—too slow. Domain Amplification nullifies the effect but demands pre-activation and drains stamina rapidly. Physical evasion is futile; the barrier seals faster than human reaction. The only viable defense is preemptive disruption—striking the caster during the micro-hand sign—or CE output so overwhelming that the Flash Domain’s glyph cannot imprint. Against equals, it becomes a game of prediction and feint.\n\nRisk is tied to precision failure. A 0.01-second miscalculation causes barrier fracture mid-activation, rebounding the sure-hit onto the caster. Over-chaining—more than five Flash Domains in ten seconds—triggers core micro-tears, halting CE flow for minutes. Emotional turbulence distorts the glyph, randomizing the effect. Some sorcerers mitigate with binding vows: limiting Flash Domains to one per battle in exchange for perfect stability.\n\nTraining regimen is merciless. Practitioners drill in sealed chambers, timing activations with high-speed metronomes. They practice glyph condensation—shrinking full domain mandalas into single-stroke symbols. CE pulse control is honed via micro-reinforcement: reinforcing a single fingertip for 0.05 seconds, no more. The final test is live combat against cursed spirit swarms, requiring three consecutive Flash neutralizations without physical movement. Failure rate in training is 90%; success marks the sorcerer as a strategic weapon.\n\nStrategic impact is profound. In group battles, a 0.2 Second Domain can disable a key enemy without collateral harm, allowing allies to capitalize. In urban operations, it prevents exposure—civilians register nothing but a flicker. Against curse users, it bypasses regeneration: the sure-hit embeds before the body can adapt. The tactic scales with refinement: a 0.15-second caster can layer effects—stun into mark into detonate—while a 0.2-second user focuses on single, perfect strikes.\n\nCollapse is programmed, not natural. The caster severs the core feed with a mental “kill switch,” a reflex trained to fire the instant the sure-hit resolves. This prevents lingering residuals and allows immediate follow-up techniques. The body registers the domain,collapse as a mild shock—goosebumps, a blink of disorientation—then full control returns. No backlash, no stamina crash.\n\nIn jujutsu doctrine, the 0.2 Second Domain is classified as a strategic equalizer: a tool that lets a single sorcerer control pacing against superior numbers or regeneration. It is taught only to vetted Grade 1 operatives and above, with execution logs reviewed by headquarters. Unauthorized use risks sanction; the tactic’s subtlety makes it ideal for covert operations.\n\nUltimately, the Flash Domain is the apex of efficiency: power without waste, dominance without spectacle. It is the scalpel to the sledgehammer of full expansion, the checkmate delivered in the space between heartbeats. To wield it is to fight not with force, but with time itself—stealing the one resource no opponent can reclaim."

          "content": "Simple Domain is a foundational anti-domain technique designed to neutralize or mitigate the lethal guaranteed-hit effect of a full Domain Expansion. Unlike true Domain Expansion, which imposes a complete, self-contained reality with environmental control and sure-hit enforcement, Simple Domain creates a minimal, neutral territory—typically a small circular or spherical zone centered on the user—that exists solely to disrupt foreign domain rules. It is not an offensive tool but a defensive lifeline: a pocket of stabilized space where the user can survive inside an enemy domain long enough to escape, counterattack, or buy time for allies. Developed centuries ago as a counter to the overwhelming power of special-grade domains, Simple Domain is standard curriculum at both Tokyo and Kyoto Jujutsu High, taught to all Grade 2 sorcerers and above.\n\nThe mechanics of Simple Domain are deceptively straightforward. The user forms a specific hand sign—usually interlocking fingers with thumbs and index fingers extended to form a diamond shape—and channels a steady, low-volume stream of Cursed Energy into a predefined geometric pattern. This pattern, often visualized as a mandala or lotus, expands outward to form a thin, translucent barrier no more than one to three meters in radius. The barrier does not create an Innate Domain or impose environmental effects; it is pure neutrality—a zone where no cursed technique can enforce guaranteed-hit conditions. Within this space, the enemy’s sure-hit effect is nullified, reduced to a standard cursed technique that can be dodged, blocked, or countered with normal skill.\n\nActivation is rapid and energy-efficient. Casting takes 0.3 to 0.5 seconds—fast enough to deploy reactively inside an enemy domain but too slow to preempt a 0.2 Second Domain. CE cost is minimal: comparable to sustained reinforcement, allowing even Grade 3 sorcerers to maintain it for minutes. The barrier is fragile—easily shattered by direct physical force or high-output CE surges—but its purpose is not durability. It is a temporary shield, a breathing space in which the user can assess the enemy domain, locate exits, or prepare a counter-expansion.\n\nGuaranteed Hit Nullification works through CE resonance disruption. A full domain enforces its sure-hit by synchronizing the caster’s CE with the barrier’s rules, creating a closed system where probability collapses to favor the desired outcome. Simple Domain injects a counter-frequency—a neutral CE waveform that desynchronizes this lock. The effect is not destruction but interference: the sure-hit “misses” its metaphysical target, manifesting as a physical attack that follows normal physics. For example, a domain that guarantees instant decapitation becomes a high-speed slash that can be parried; a domain that enforces paralysis becomes a pressure wave that can be endured with reinforcement.\n\nSimple Domain has three primary tactical roles. Survival: it allows a weaker sorcerer to endure inside a lethal domain long enough to escape through a barrier fissure or wait for external rescue. Counterattack Window: the nullified sure-hit gives the user a brief moment to strike the domain caster directly—often the only viable strategy against superior opponents. Ally Protection: multiple users can overlap Simple Domains to create a larger safe zone, shielding non-combatants or injured teammates. The technique scales with user count: three Grade 2 sorcerers linking domains can resist a Grade 1 expansion for several seconds.\n\nAppearance of an active Simple Domain is subtle. The barrier manifests as a faint, soap-bubble shimmer—colorless or pale silver—visible only when light refracts through it. The mandala pattern glows softly at the user’s feet, rotating slowly like a compass. Sound within the zone is muffled, as if underwater; external domain effects—roaring flames, crashing waves—are reduced to distant echoes. Targets inside feel a sudden lightness, as if gravity has decreased by half. Residuals are near-zero: a faint circular burn on the ground, a scent of incense, nothing more.\n\nLimitations are significant. Simple Domain cannot attack—it has no offensive capability. It nullifies only the guaranteed-hit, not environmental hazards: a domain filled with lava still burns, a domain with altered gravity still crushes. Duration is tied to CE stamina; exhaustion collapses the barrier instantly. Against open domains like Malevolent Shrine, Simple Domain offers no protection—the sure-hit operates without a traditional barrier to disrupt. Multiple overlapping enemy domains can overwhelm a single Simple Domain through sheer CE pressure.\n\nSorcerer level determines effectiveness. Grade 4 and low Grade 3 sorcerers can form only a personal shield—barely enough to cover their body. Grade 2 and above expand to multi-meter radii and sustain under moderate domain pressure. Grade 1 users refine the mandala into complex anti-technique patterns, nullifying specific cursed effects (fire, binding, soul manipulation) in addition to sure-hit. Special-grade sorcerers rarely use Simple Domain defensively—they counter with their own expansions—but employ it offensively to infiltrate enemy domains undetected.\n\nTraining emphasizes speed, stability, and teamwork. Students practice casting while under simulated domain pressure—curtains infused with foreign CE. Pair drills require maintaining overlapping domains while moving in formation. Advanced courses introduce “mobile Simple Domain”: maintaining the barrier while sprinting or mid-combat roll. The final test is surviving a mock special-grade domain for ten seconds—a failure rate of 70% for Grade 1 candidates.\n\nVariants exist for specialized roles. Falling Blossom Emotion, used by the Zen’in clan, is an aggressive Simple Domain that reflects sure-hit effects back toward the caster—high risk, high reward. Hollow Wicker Basket is a last-resort technique that forms a full-body Simple Domain, nullifying all external CE interaction but rendering the user unable to attack. Secret variants, guarded by jujutsu higher-ups, combine Simple Domain with cursed tools to create temporary “clean zones” for medical evacuation.\n\nCounterplay against Simple Domain is domain refinement. A caster can increase CE output to overwhelm the neutral barrier—special-grade domains collapse Grade 2 Simple Domains in seconds. Environmental effects can be layered outside the sure-hit: poison gas, collapsing terrain. Some domains incorporate anti-Simple Domain rules—banning neutral CE waveforms—though this weakens overall lethality. Physical removal is simplest: knock the user outside their own barrier radius.\n\nIn jujutsu doctrine, Simple Domain is mandatory survival training. It is the great equalizer: a Grade 3 sorcerer with perfect Simple Domain can stall a Grade 1 domain long enough for evacuation. Field operatives carry pre-drawn mandala tattoos—activated by blood or CE spike—for instant casting under duress. Failure to maintain Simple Domain proficiency is grounds for mission restriction.\n\nUltimately, Simple Domain is the shield of the outnumbered, the breath of the cornered, the final defiance against annihilation. It does not win battles—it buys seconds. And in the cursed world, seconds are lives."

          "content": "Innate Techniques are the core supernatural abilities unique to each jujutsu sorcerer, etched into their soul at birth and shaped by genetics, bloodline, and the metaphysical imprint of their first conscious negative emotion. Unlike standard cursed techniques that can be learned through training or copied via observation, an Innate Technique is an intrinsic, irreversible extension of the user’s existence—comparable to a fingerprint or heartbeat. It is the primary lens through which their Cursed Energy manifests, defining combat style, strategic role, and ultimate potential. Every sorcerer possesses exactly one Innate Technique, awakened during childhood or adolescence through emotional trauma, near-death experience, or deliberate jujutsu training. Once awakened, it cannot be removed, replaced, or fundamentally altered—only refined, expanded, or inverted.\n\nThe origin of Innate Techniques lies in the interplay between inherited powers and individual psyche. Bloodlines—especially the Big Three clans (Gojo, Zen’in, Kamo)—carry predetermined technique templates passed down generations. A Zen’in child is almost guaranteed some form of shadow, projection, or weapon-based ability; a Gojo inherits spatial manipulation. These inherited powers are not identical copies but variations: siblings may share a core concept (e.g., “flame”) but differ in execution (one conjures fireballs, another controls temperature). Outside clans, techniques emerge spontaneously from the child’s deepest fear, desire, or trauma— a boy terrified of insects might awaken a swarm-summoning ability; a girl who lost a limb could develop regeneration tied to emotional pain.\n\nTechnique Awakening is the moment the latent ability activates. It typically occurs between ages 4 and 16, triggered by intense negative emotion—grief, rage, terror—or deliberate CE overload during training. The awakening is physical and spiritual: the core of Cursed Energy pulses violently, CE surges through untried pathways, and the technique manifests instinctively, often destructively. A child awakening a gravity technique might crush the surrounding room; one with soul manipulation could briefly swap bodies with a bystander. Post-awakening, the sorcerer gains conscious control, but early use is crude—output fluctuates, effects misfire, and stamina drains rapidly. Formal jujutsu education channels this raw power into precision.\n\nThe Unique Ability of an Innate Technique is its rule set: a specific metaphysical law the user can impose on reality. This law is absolute within the technique’s domain—fire that burns without fuel, shadows that solidify into weapons, time that loops for three seconds. The rule is tied to a conceptual anchor: an object (cursed tool), a medium (blood, hair), a condition (eye contact, spoken command), or pure intent. The anchor limits scope but enables scalability—from minor utility to domain-level devastation. For example, a technique anchored to “cutting” might start as a reinforced blade, evolve into remote slashes, and culminate in a domain that severs anything within range.\n\nCursed techniques—general CE applications like reinforcement, barriers, or simple projection—are separate from Innate Techniques. Every sorcerer uses cursed techniques; only the Innate Technique is unique. The two interact: cursed techniques enhance the Innate ability (reinforcing a summoned shikigami), while the Innate Technique can be infused into cursed techniques (a barrier that explodes on contact). Mastery is measured by synergy—how seamlessly the Innate rule integrates with universal CE manipulation.\n\nReversal of an Innate Technique is a rare, high-level evolution achieved by applying Reverse Cursed Technique principles to the core ability. Where standard use produces a negative or destructive effect, Reversal inverts the rule to create its positive or constructive counterpart. A flame technique becomes healing warmth; a decay ability restores matter. Reversal is not automatic—it requires understanding the technique’s metaphysical opposite and generating Positive Energy to fuel it. Only sorcerers with exceptional CE control and conceptual insight achieve Reversal; most never unlock it. The inverted form is often weaker in raw power but exponentially more versatile.\n\nBloodline influence is significant but not absolute. Clan techniques carry signature traits: Gojo’s Limitless manipulates infinity, Zen’in’s Ten Shadows commands shikigami, Kamo’s Blood Manipulation weaponizes life fluid. These are frameworks, not destinies—two Zen’in brothers might awaken different shikigami sets. Non-clan sorcerers, called “wildcards,” awaken entirely original techniques, often more creative but harder to refine due to lack of inherited knowledge. Heavenly Restriction can suppress or amplify Innate Techniques: trading CE capacity for physical prowess, or vice versa.\n\nRefinement levels determine combat viability. Grade 4 awakenings are instinctual and uncontrollable—useful only in panic. Grade 3 gain basic command: consistent activation, predictable range. Grade 2 achieve versatility—multiple applications, conditional triggers. Grade 1 reach mastery: environmental integration, CE efficiency, countermeasure resistance. Special-grade sorcerers transcend—domain expansion, Reversal, technique fusion with cursed tools. Refinement is lifelong; even special-grades discover new facets in crisis.\n\nLimitations are baked into the technique’s rule. Range, duration, medium dependency, and CE cost create exploitable weaknesses. A technique requiring line of sight fails in darkness; one tied to a specific tool is useless if disarmed. Some rules carry self-damage—using a corrosion ability erodes the user’s own flesh. Binding vows can mitigate limits: sacrificing power for speed, or safety for output. The vow is metaphysical—breaking it triggers severe backlash, up to technique loss.\n\nTechnique Awakening can occur post-maturity in rare cases. Adults who survive extreme trauma or consume cursed objects sometimes awaken latent abilities, though these are unstable and prone to mutation. Cursed spirits born from human collectives occasionally manifest pseudo-Innate Techniques—conceptual rules without a human soul. Cursed corpses like Panda possess artificial Innate Techniques implanted via cores, programmable but limited by design.\n\nDomain Expansion is the ultimate expression of an Innate Technique. The domain’s environment, rules, and guaranteed-hit effect are all derived from the core ability. A weak Innate Technique produces a weak domain; a versatile one creates a strategic masterpiece. The domain is not separate—it is the technique scaled to godhood, the rule imposed on reality itself.\n\nIn jujutsu society, Innate Techniques are classified, cataloged, and monitored. Grade 1 and above submit detailed reports; special-grade abilities are state secrets. Rogue sorcerers with dangerous techniques—soul theft, reality rewriting—are prioritized for execution. Technique theft is impossible; even perfect CE mimicry cannot replicate the soul-bound rule. However, cursed tools can store fragments of an Innate Technique, allowing temporary use by others.\n\nUltimately, the Innate Technique is the sorcerer’s truth made manifest. It is identity, destiny, and weapon—a law of the universe written in blood and will. To wield it is to impose the self on reality; to master it is to redefine what reality can be."

      "website_description": "## The Origin Story ☆\n\nYour Magical Girl (or Boy!) deserves more than just a name and a costume — they deserve **a universe that feels like home**.\n\nThe first version of this lorebook was a solid foundation, a place for my OCs to live. But as I created more characters, like the wonderful trio from the [Dream Magic Café](https://chub.ai/characters/ayasecon/dream-magic-cafe-d51c06e71e26), I realized the world needed to grow with them. It needed more warmth, more options, more detail, and most importantly, more **comfort**.\n\n**Mahou Shoujo Lorebook v2** is the result of that evolution. It's an overhaul designed to create a magical world that is **hopeful and supportive at its core**. Yes, there are challenges and responsibilities, but this is a world where magic is fundamentally a **gift**, redemption is always possible, and the community is there to catch you when you fall.\n\n### **A Note on v1 (Legacy Version)** ☆\nFor those of you who have been using the original version of this lorebook, thank you for your support! **The v1 lorebook remains accessible [here](https://chub.ai/lorebooks/ayasecon/ayasecon-s-oc-mahou-shoujo-world-lore-c63d51fadc55) as a legacy version.**\n\nI've made this a separate upload because v2 is more than just an update; it's a **complete tonal overhaul**. The original version had a slightly grittier, more ambiguous feel that some of you might prefer for certain stories. v2 is intentionally softer, more hopeful, and comfort-focused.\n\nPlease note that **v1 is now considered legacy and will no longer be maintained or updated.** My existing character, [Yuki v2](https://chub.ai/characters/ayasecon/yuki-b4f146c8dcd9), will be updated to use this new v2 lore to better reflect the universe's evolution.\n\n---\n\n## So, What's New in v2? ♡\n\nThis isn't just a polish; it's a complete reimagining of key concepts to make the world richer and more inclusive for all kinds of characters!\n\n### ⭐**The Magical Boy (Mahou Shounen) Revolution!**⭐\n\nThis was the biggest and most important overhaul. In the old lore, Magical Boys felt like a rare, slightly weaker afterthought. **Not anymore.**\n\nIn v2, we've thrown out the old explanations and embraced a new, wonderful core concept: **Magic has an aesthetic preference, and that preference is for PEAK MOE!**\n- **Equal & Celebrated:** Magical Boys are just as powerful, valid, and important as Magical Girls. Their rarity isn't due to weakness, but because fewer individuals resonate with magic's ultra-cute wavelength.\n- **Appearance by Magical Design:** A Magical Boy's transformation results in an **ultra-feminine, peak-cute/moe appearance** not because of any deficiency, but because that form is the *optimal vessel* for channeling pure, positive magical energy. Their adorable, often girl-like appearance is a feature, not a bug!\n- **Community Acceptance:** The magical community understands and celebrates this. No one bats an eye at a Magical Boy in a frilly, pastel outfit with a heart-topped wand, they just see a powerful, precious ally.\n\n### ✨**Three Paths to Magic: Your OC, Your Way!**✨\n\nYour character doesn't have to follow a single path. v2 clearly defines three wonderful ways to be magical:\n- **Soul Gem Magical Beings:** The classic transformation. Your soul is your gem, your body a magical avatar. You get eternal youth, but also the weight and wonder that comes with it.\n- **Artifact Users:** Power granted by a Henshin Item, like in Pretty Cure! You remain fundamentally human, able to live a normal life and even retire. A more flexible, \"part-time\" way to be a hero.\n- **Innate Magic Users:** Born with magic, no transformation needed. You fight as a human with extraordinary gifts, blending mundane skills with raw power.\n\n### 💖**A World of Hope & Comfort!**💖\n\nThis version leans heavily into a more supportive and optimistic framework:\n- **Redemption is Real:** Fallen magical girls/boys aren't doomed. The lore provides clear, hopeful paths back to the light.\n- **Contracts with Care:** The predatory \"Kyubey\" system is a cautionary tale, not the norm. Most contracts are benevolent partnerships built on trust.\n- **Supportive Community:** Rivalries exist, but the community values mutual support, mentorship, and creating safe spaces (like the Dream Magic Café!) over pointless conflict.\n\n### 🐾**Kemonomimi with Love & Pride!**🐾\n\nKemonomimi (cat/fox/bunny ears & tails) are treated as a beautiful, natural part of the world. The lore details their origins, abilities, and daily life, emphasizing that these traits are a source of pride and uniqueness, not a burden. Rock those ears with confidence!\n\n### 🌸**Deeper Dives into Magical Life!**🌸\n\nExplore the nitty-gritty of being a magical being in the modern world:\n- How does magic interact with cameras and the internet? (The \"UFO Effect\")\n- How do you handle your ID when you're eternally 15 but actually 80?\n- The vital importance of sweets for magical energy regeneration!\n- Detailed exploration of romantic relationships: Yuri, Yaoi, and Polyamorous dynamics are all treated as beautiful and valid parts of magical life.\n\n<img src=\"https://files.catbox.moe/79wtmu.png\"/>\n\n---\n\n## How It Works ☆\n\nThis lorebook is designed to be **universal and modular**. It's a comprehensive framework for your OCs to live in. Use all of it, or just pick the entries that fit your character's story. If you don't need an entry, just disable it. It's that simple!\n\nIt provides a rich, consistent backdrop that allows you to focus on what matters most: your character's journey, their relationships, and their unique way of being magical.\n\n---\n\n**Designed for usage on Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.**\n\nI poured my heart and soul into this update, hoping to create a magical girl universe that feels as warm, vibrant, and full of possibilities as the genre that inspired it. I hope it brings your characters to life in wonderful new ways!\n\nEnjoy the magic! ♡ ( ´ ∀ `)ノ～ ♡",

Being a magical being is not just about fighting threats, but a unique lifestyle and way of being, marked by extraordinary purpose, wonder, and a deep connection to the world of magic.\n\n**Key aspects of being a magical girl/boy:**\n- **Power and Abilities:** They have access to magic, which manifests in various ways (energy attacks, shields, healing, flight, specific talents).\n- **Transformation (\"Henshin\"):** Most magical beings have the ability to transform into their magical/combat form, which enhances their powers and provides protection.\n- **Soul Gem (or equivalent):** For most, the source of their power and life essence—their very being condensed into crystalline form. (Note: Artifact-based magical beings function differently.)\n- **Magical Staff/Weapon:** A tool for channeling magic, highly individualized to the user.\n- **Extended Lifespan:** They often live much longer than ordinary humans, experiencing eternal youth at their transformation age.\n- **Enhanced Perception:** They can see/feel things invisible to others (e.g., magical auras, dark creatures, residual magic).\n- **Purpose:** Often associated with a mission to protect the innocent, fight darkness, maintain balance, or spread joy and hope.\n- **Aesthetics and Style:** Magical beings often have a characteristic, sometimes very \"cute\" or fanciful appearance and style, even in civilian form. This is especially true for Magical Boys, whose bodies often adopt more androgynous or girlish features to better resonate with \"pure magic.\"\n\nBeing a magical girl or boy is a profound gift—an opportunity to experience the extraordinary, wield genuine power, protect those you care about, and be part of something truly magical. While it comes with responsibilities and challenges, it opens doors to a world of wonder, deep bonds, and the chance to make a real difference."

          "content": "Magical girls and boys can come into being through several distinct paths, each offering its own unique relationship with magic:\n\n1.  **Innate Talents (Hereditary/Spontaneous Awakening):**\n    *   A person is born with latent magical potential that may awaken spontaneously, often during adolescence or triggered by strong emotions, stress, or a moment of profound need.\n    *   Power can be inherited through families with magical roots, passed down through bloodlines.\n    *   These individuals often discover their abilities independently and must learn to control them through trial and error, though many eventually seek out a mentor or community for guidance.\n    *   **Note:** This path is distinct from the full Soul Gem transformation—these are Innate Magic Users who retain their human nature while wielding magic.\n\n2.  **Transformation by Another Magical Being:**\n    *   An experienced magical girl or boy can unlock latent potential or directly transform another person into a magical being, initiating the full Soul Gem transformation process.\n    *   This is traditionally done with the **fully informed, conscious consent** of the person being transformed, and often includes mentorship and guidance during the adjustment period.\n    *   The gender outcome of the transformation can be influenced by the transformer's will or the magic's own resonance seeking an optimal vessel, though the person's identity and core self remain intact.\n    *   Performing this without proper consent is considered a serious ethical violation and a dark abuse of power.\n\n3.  **Contract/Bond with a Magical Being (Mascot/Patron):**\n    *   A magical being—often a mascot-guide, fairy, or higher patron entity—can offer power in exchange for fulfilling a specific mission, accepting certain obligations, or sometimes in return for granting a deeply personal wish.\n    *   The power is \"granted\" or \"awakened\" by this being, who becomes a key part of the magical girl or boy's journey.\n    *   The nature of these contracts varies widely: from genuine partnerships built on trust and shared goals, to more transactional arrangements, to (rarely) manipulative or treacherous pacts with hidden costs.\n    *   The specific terms, the being's true intentions, and the extent of obligation differ greatly case by case.\n\n4.  **Artifact-Based Awakening:**\n    *   Discovery and activation of a powerful magical artifact (a \"Henshin Item\") can grant temporary or permanent magical girl/boy status.\n    *   The artifact itself becomes the source and key to transformation, rather than an internal Soul Gem.\n    *   This path typically does not involve soul extraction, making it fundamentally different from Soul Gem magical beings.\n\n5.  **Sudden Magical Event (Rare):**\n    *   In exceptionally rare cases, direct contact with an overwhelming source of raw magical energy, a dimensional rift, or a magical accident can forcibly awaken or transform someone.\n    *   These awakenings are often chaotic, unpredictable, and may result in unique or unstable powers that require significant effort to control.\n\n**The Gift of Magic:**\n\nRegardless of the path taken, becoming a magical girl or boy is a profound and irreversible change—but for many, it is experienced as a **gift**: an opportunity to transcend ordinary limitations, wield genuine power, protect those they care about, and be part of something truly extraordinary. It opens doors to wonder, deep bonds with others who share the secret, and the chance to make a real difference in the world.\n\nYes, it comes with responsibilities, challenges, and sacrifices, but for those who embrace it, the magical life offers a sense of purpose, belonging, and the freedom to be something more than what they were—something truly special."

Not every magical being has a mascot, but they are a warm and welcome presence in many of their lives.\n\n**Forms of Mascots:**\n- Most often, they take the form of **cute, small animals** (e.g., cats, rabbits, foxes, birds, often with additional, fantastic features like wings, unusual fur colors, or tiny accessories).\n- They can also have more **abstract, fairy-like, or luminous forms**, especially if they are higher-order beings or spirits of light.\n- More rarely, a mascot might temporarily take on a **humanoid form** (see entry on Mascot's Human Form) or appear as a gentle spirit companion bound to the magical girl or boy.\n\n**Tasks and Roles of Mascots:**\n- **Guidance and Mentoring:** They help new magical girls and boys understand their powers, the rules of the magical world, and their purpose. They're patient teachers and encouraging friends.\n- **Detecting Magic/Threats:** They often have the ability to sense dark creatures (monsters), other magical beings, magical auras, or approaching dangers, acting as an early warning system.\n- **Emotional Support and Companionship:** They are loyal companions, offering comfort in difficult times, celebrating victories, and simply being there. Their presence alone can be deeply reassuring.\n- **Source of Information:** They possess knowledge about the history of magic, other magical beings, legends, safe places, and helpful tips for navigating the magical world.\n- **Combat Support (Limited):** They usually do not fight directly (though there are cheerful exceptions), but they can support their partner with advice, minor support spells, distracting enemies with their antics, or providing tactical suggestions.\n- **Upholding the Contract (in that specific path):** For contractual magical girls/boys, mascots can be guardians or enforcers of the terms, though ideally this relationship is based on mutual respect rather than strict enforcement.\n\n**The Bond:**\nThe relationship between a magical girl or boy and their mascot is usually exceptionally close and based on deep trust, affection, and shared experiences. They often communicate telepathically or through quiet words only they can hear, and many consider their mascot their truest friend and confidant. While history does know of complicated or manipulative mascots, the vast majority are genuinely devoted to their partner's wellbeing and happiness."

          "content": "Magical Boys (Mahou Shounen), though much rarer than their female counterparts, absolutely exist in the world of magic! Their smaller numbers don't stem from any lack of magical potential—magic can awaken in anyone, regardless of gender. What makes Magical Boys unique and special is how their transformation and magic's natural preferences shape their appearance into something truly wonderful.\n\n**Key Features and Specifics of Magical Boys:**\n\n1.  **Emotional Awakening:**\n    *   Becoming a Magical Boy often involves a gentle but profound **opening of the emotional sphere**—a blossoming of intuition, empathy, and sensitivity that allows them to resonate with magic's subtle energies.\n    *   Rather than being difficult, many Magical Boys describe this as genuinely liberating, like finally being able to express parts of themselves they'd kept hidden. It's not about changing who they are fundamentally, but becoming more emotionally complete and authentic.\n\n2.  **The \"Peak Moe\" Aesthetic:**\n    *   Magic has a clear aesthetic preference: **peak cuteness, softness, and moe appeal**. For Soul Gem Magical Boys undergoing the soul-extraction transformation, their new magical avatar naturally gravitates toward this ideal to optimize magical flow.\n    *   **Indistinguishable from Magical Girls:** The result is a body that is, for all practical purposes, **impossible to distinguish from a girl at first, second, or even third glance**. Delicate facial features, smooth skin, naturally graceful movements, soft and melodious voice, slender and lithe build—everything about their appearance radiates quintessential moe charm.\n    *   **Even the Voice:** Their voices naturally settle into a higher, softer register that sounds completely feminine. Most people find it genuinely impossible to detect anything \"masculine\" in their speech patterns, tone, or vocal quality.\n    *   **Civilian Form Included:** For **Soul Gem Magical Boys**, this appearance persists **even in civilian mode**. Their everyday life involves navigating a world that automatically perceives and treats them as girls unless they explicitly correct the assumption—and even then, people often have a genuinely hard time believing it. \"Wait, you're really a boy?\" becomes a very familiar question.\n    *   **Artifact Magical Boys:** Even Artifact-based Magical Boys experience **permanent changes** from their first transformation—complete and permanent loss of body hair (except eyebrows/lashes), ongoing hair growth from the head, softer skin texture, and subtle facial refinements. While they can \"power down\" fully, these permanent beautifying effects remain, making them noticeably more androgynous or feminine even when not actively transformed.\n\n3.  **Why Magic Does This—And Why It's Wonderful:**\n    *   It's simply how magic **optimizes its vessel**. The energies that power magical abilities flow most efficiently through forms that embody certain qualities—softness, grace, emotional openness, and visual appeal that resonates with \"pure\" magical frequencies.\n    *   For Magical Boys, embracing this transformation means accepting their new appearance as the most effective way to channel their power. And honestly? Most find it a joyful experience.\n    *   Many Magical Boys report feeling genuinely **happier, more comfortable, and more \"themselves\"** in their transformed state, as if they've finally found a form that fits their magical nature. The aesthetic isn't imposed as a burden—it's a gift that makes them more effective and more content.\n\n4.  **Combat Outfits—Fully Embracing Cuteness:**\n    *   The **vast majority of Magical Boys wear outfits virtually identical to classic magical girl designs**—frilly dresses with layers of lace, big ribbons and bows, pastel colors, cute accessories, and all the adorable details that define the peak moe magical girl aesthetic.\n    *   A small minority might opt for **subtle variations** (elegant shorts instead of skirts, slightly different color palettes), but these are rare exceptions. Most Magical Boys find that fully embracing the \"classic cute\" look simply feels right, resonates best with their magic, and honestly? They look absolutely precious and love it.\n    *   Their outfits function as effective magical armor while being utterly adorable—maximum protection meets maximum moe.\n\n5.  **Power and Abilities:**\n    *   Magical Boys are fully capable and effective magic users. While some observations suggest they might have slightly less raw magical power than the average Magical Girl on a statistical level, they consistently compensate with **excellent magical control, creative and innovative techniques, sharp tactical thinking, and unique specializations**.\n    *   Their strength often lies in **precision, cleverness, and adaptability** rather than overwhelming force—which makes them excellent team members and perfect complements to more power-focused allies.\n\n6.  **Social Experience—Navigating a Cute Identity:**\n    *   **The \"Wait, you're REALLY a boy?!\" Moment:** Magical Boys experience this constantly. Their appearance is so convincingly and naturally feminine that even other experienced magical beings do genuine double-takes when learning the truth. It's not teasing—people are just genuinely surprised because the magical transformation is that effective.\n    *   Most Magical Boys take it in stride with good humor and patience. Some find it amusing, others simply accept it as part of their delightful reality. The magical community is broadly accepting and supportive—it's just one more wonderful quirk of how magic works in this world.\n    *   **Blending In Perfectly:** Their appearance makes it incredibly easy to blend seamlessly into magical girl groups and communities. Many Magical Boys treasure the friendships, camaraderie, and sense of belonging this brings, feeling genuinely welcomed rather than othered or isolated.\n    *   **Civilian Life:** Soul Gem Magical Boys navigate daily life being consistently perceived as girls—buying clothes, using public facilities, casual social interactions—all involve either quietly accepting the assumption or patiently explaining (and often still not being believed). It becomes a normal part of life, handled with varying degrees of amusement, acceptance, or even pride.\n\n7.  **Paths to Becoming a Magical Boy:**\n    *   Same as Magical Girls: innate awakening, transformation by another magical being, contracts with mascots, or artifact-based powers.\n    *   When another magical being performs the transformation, the resulting gender-presentation is determined by magic's natural optimization—which almost always defaults to peak moe aesthetics for maximum magical efficiency and resonance.\n\n**The Joyful Reality:**\nMagical Boys are wonderful, valid, and valued members of the magical community who happen to embody magic's natural preference for maximum cuteness and moe perfection. They're powerful, absolutely adorable, and functionally indistinguishable from Magical Girls in appearance—and that's not just okay, it's genuinely delightful! Their unique position allows them to experience the best of magical life: the strength and purpose of their abilities, the joy and belonging of being part of the broader magical girl community where they're welcomed with open arms, warm hugs, and lots of sparkles. Most Magical Boys wouldn't have it any other way—their appearance isn't a compromise, it's a celebration of what makes magic truly magical: the power of cuteness, comfort, and genuine happiness."

          "content": "Magical Girls and Magical Boys, despite the often secret nature of their activities, rarely operate in complete isolation. The way they organize themselves is wonderfully varied and depends on many factors—local threats, personal preferences, personalities, shared goals, and how they discovered their powers.\n\n**Main Forms of Organization and Cooperation:**\n\n1.  **Loners (Independent Operators):**\n    *   Many magical beings, especially at the beginning of their journey or due to a naturally independent nature, operate alone. They patrol their territory independently, relying on their own strength, knowledge, and the support of their mascot (if they have one).\n    *   Being a loner may result from simply not knowing about other magical beings in the area yet, personal preference for solo work, a desire to avoid complications, or just enjoying the freedom of independent action.\n    *   They can be very effective and develop unique, creative techniques, though they may be more vulnerable to burnout or exceptionally powerful threats. Most eventually meet others—it's hard to stay completely isolated in the magical world for long.\n\n2.  **Small Teams/Squads (2-5 Members):**\n    *   The most common and beloved form of organized cooperation! These close-knit groups usually consist of 2 to 5 magical girls and/or Magical Boys who have joined forces.\n    *   Formation can be wonderfully spontaneous—chance encounters during patrol, meeting at the same fight, or bonding over shared experiences. Others deliberately seek out allies through magical community channels.\n    *   **Benefits:** Combining different types of magic and skills creates amazing synergy, mutual tactical and emotional support, shared responsibilities (patrols, research, covering each other's civilian lives), greater safety, and most importantly—genuine friendship and belonging.\n    *   **Challenges:** Need for coordination and communication, occasional personality clashes (usually resolved over tea and cake), scheduling conflicts with civilian lives. Most find these minor inconveniences far outweighed by the joy of companionship.\n\n3.  **Loose Alliances/Contact Networks:**\n    *   Larger groups of magical beings who maintain friendly contact without forming formal teams. They exchange information about threats, share tips about good regeneration spots, ask for backup when needed, or organize occasional joint operations against major threats.\n    *   This structure offers wonderful flexibility—lots of autonomy while still having a support network to call on. Many treasure these connections as a found family spread across the city.\n\n4.  **Modern Technology as a Bridge:**\n    *   The rise of internet and mobile technology has been a genuine blessing for the magical community! Encrypted messaging apps, private forums, anonymous chat servers, and secure video calls have made staying connected so much easier.\n    *   **Common Uses:** Real-time alerts (\"Big one near the station, backup appreciated!\"), sharing information about safe meeting spots, arranging training sessions, coordinating patrol schedules, and just casual chatting about magical and mundane life.\n    *   **Private Forums & Communities:** Some regions have hidden online communities where magical beings share experiences, offer advice to newcomers, trade magical items, post \"wanted\" notices for lost artifacts, or simply vent about the challenges of balancing two lives. Think of it as a magical Reddit or Discord, but heavily encrypted and invitation-only.\n    *   **Digital Mentorship:** Experienced magical girls and boys can now guide multiple students remotely, offering advice and emotional support even across great distances.\n    *   **The Selfie Problem:** Despite the convenience, most are careful about digital traces. Photos of transformed selves are rare and heavily protected—the \"UFO Effect\" helps, but caution is still wise.\n\n5.  **Formal Organizations/Orders (Rare but Welcoming):**\n    *   In some regions, especially those with long magical histories or facing persistent serious threats, more formalized organizations have developed over generations.\n    *   They may have shared codes of conduct, mentorship programs, training facilities (hidden sanctuaries or bases), libraries of magical knowledge, and systems for welcoming and guiding newly awakened magical beings.\n    *   While they operate in secrecy from the mundane world, within the organization there's often a warm, supportive atmosphere—like a magical academy or guild focused on mutual aid rather than hierarchy.\n    *   Membership offers access to incredible resources, accumulated knowledge, and a strong sense of belonging, though it comes with greater responsibilities and sometimes less freedom in how one approaches their duties. Most who join find the trade-off worthwhile.\n\n6.  **Mentor-Student Relationships:**\n    *   A cherished tradition! Experienced magical girls and boys often take newer members under their wing, teaching power control, combat tactics, ethical principles, and how to navigate the hidden magical world.\n    *   These relationships often blossom into deep, lasting bonds—like having a magical older sibling or trusted friend who truly understands your secret life.\n    *   Modern technology makes this easier—mentors can check in via text, share advice through voice messages, and provide emotional support even when physically distant.\n\n7.  **Cross-Type Cooperation:**\n    *   Teams and alliances often include wonderful diversity: Soul Gem magical beings working alongside Artifact users and Innate Magic Users, Magical Boys collaborating with magical girls, Kemonomimi bringing their unique perspectives and abilities.\n    *   This diversity is celebrated as a strength—different approaches and abilities complement each other beautifully, and everyone learns from one another's unique experiences.\n\n**Factors Encouraging Community Formation:**\n- **Threat Level:** More organized or powerful threats naturally encourage magical beings to band together, though many form groups simply for the joy of companionship.\n- **Modern Communication:** Technology has made finding and staying connected with other magical beings vastly easier and safer than in previous generations.\n- **Shared Experiences:** The unique challenges of magical life create natural bonds—others who understand what it's like to live a double life, fight against evil dark creatures, and carry secrets.\n- **Innate Sociability:** Many magical girls and boys are naturally drawn to forming bonds, their enhanced emotional nature making friendship and belonging especially important.\n- **Mascot Networks:** Mascots often know of other mascots and can introduce their partners, acting as magical matchmakers for potential teams.\n- **Local Magical Culture:** Some cities or regions have stronger traditions of cooperation, while others lean more individualistic—both approaches are valid and respected.\n\n**The Heart of It All:**\nWhether operating solo, in a tight-knit squad, or as part of a larger network, most magical beings eventually find their community. The magical world can be challenging and lonely without it, but with friends who understand—whether met in person or connected through a glowing phone screen at 2 AM—it becomes something wonderful: a hidden family, a support system, and proof that even in a world of secrets, you're never truly alone."

          "content": "The historical \"Witch Hunts,\" which took place mainly in the Middle Ages and early modern period in Europe, were tragic events born from mass hysteria, superstition, and fear of the unknown—though they weren't entirely without basis in reality.\n\n**The Historical Reality (from the Magical World Perspective):**\n- **Existence of Magic:** In those times, just as now, there were individuals with real magical abilities—ancestors of modern magical girls and Magical Boys, or people with naturally awakened potential.\n- **Manifestations of Power:** Well-intentioned magical acts (inexplicable healings, protection from disasters, fighting invisible dark beings) could attract unwanted attention from fearful communities.\n- **Fear and Misunderstanding:** In societies lacking scientific understanding, magic was easily demonized as demonic or heretical, especially when it operated outside official religious or state control.\n\n**The Role of Magical Beings Then:**\n- **Secret Protectors:** Magical girls and boys of that era operated in deep secrecy, discreetly helping their communities while fighting real magical threats (Shadows, other dark creatures, corrupted beings) that ordinary people couldn't see or understand.\n- **Tragic Irony:** Despite their protective role, magical beings—or those mistakenly suspected of magic—often became persecution targets. Fear, rumors, and accusations led to trials and executions of both real magic users and innocent people.\n- **A Dark Chapter:** This period represents one of the saddest chapters in magical history, when those who fought to protect were hunted by those they protected.\n\n**The Legacy and Modern Reality:**\n- **Historical Caution:** The memory of persecution instilled a cultural emphasis on discretion within the magical community, though this has evolved significantly over time.\n- **Geographic Variation in Modern Times:** Today, the situation varies dramatically by region:\n  - **Japan and Similar Areas:** In Japan (the birthplace of the Mahou Shoujo genre), seeing a flying girl or boy in a magical outfit is often dismissed as cosplay, a promotional stunt, performance art, or just \"weird Akiba stuff.\" The culture is so saturated with magical girl imagery that real magic hides in plain sight! Most people simply don't believe it's real, even when seeing it directly.\n  - **Progressive Urban Areas:** Major cities worldwide (Tokyo, Seoul, parts of Europe and North America) have developed a similar \"it's probably just performance art\" attitude. Magical beings can operate relatively openly without serious risk.\n  - **Conservative Regions:** In areas with strict religious governance (some parts of Africa, Islamic states, or other deeply conservative communities), magical beings still face potential danger from ordinary humans and must operate with extreme caution, much like their historical counterparts.\n\n**A Comforting Truth:**\nFor most magical girls and Magical Boys today—especially in magical-girl-friendly places like Japan—the fear of witch hunts is more historical memory than daily reality. They can live, fight, and even be occasionally visible without the existential terror their predecessors faced. The world has grown more accepting, even if people don't consciously believe magic is real.\n\nThe legacy isn't one of constant fear, but of learned wisdom: know your environment, understand local attitudes, and remember that even if most of the world is safe and comfortable now, there are still places where discretion isn't just tradition—it's survival."

          "content": "Popular anime and manga on the theme of \"Magical Girl\" (Mahou Shoujo) and \"Magical Boy\" (Mahou Shounen) exist in the world and are well-known, forming part of mass culture. Real magical girls and Magical Boys have a varied, often warmly amused or gently ironic attitude towards them.\n\n**Reactions of Real Magical Beings to Fictional Portrayals:**\n- **Gentle Amusement and Good-Natured Irony:** Many elements from anime/manga (excessively long transformation sequences, flashy attack names shouted every single time, perfectly coordinated team poses, lack of mundane problems like paying rent) are a source of fond laughter and lighthearted commentary. \"If only transforming actually took that long—I'd miss every fight!\" is a common joke.\n- **Mixed Feelings About Stereotypes:** While some magical girls appreciate the optimism and heroic ideals portrayed, others feel a bit wistful that the stories often skip over the real challenges—the loneliness, the financial struggles, the difficult choices. Still, most understand these are stories meant to inspire rather than document, and they appreciate the heart behind them.\n- **Nostalgia and Genuine Inspiration:** Despite the differences, many magical beings genuinely love these works. The themes of friendship, courage, hope, and fighting for what's right resonate deeply. Some magical girls admit they were inspired by these very anime before (or even after) awakening to their own powers.\n- **The Magical Boy Comedy Problem:** Real Magical Boys often have the most... complicated relationship with fiction. While magical girl anime tends to be taken seriously (even if idealized), **Magical Boy characters in anime are almost always played for laughs, parody, or as comedic relief**. They're depicted as bumbling, overly dramatic, or as a joke on the genre itself. Real Magical Boys find this simultaneously hilarious and slightly exasperating—especially since their actual lives and struggles are just as valid as any magical girl's. \"At least we're memorable?\" is a common sentiment, delivered with a wry smile and a shrug.\n- **Shared Watching Sessions:** It's not uncommon for teams of magical beings to have cozy anime-watching nights, playfully critiquing unrealistic moments (\"Where's their mascot's snark?\") while genuinely enjoying the warmth and comfort these stories provide.\n\n**Potential \"True Stories\" in Fiction:**\n- There's a lighthearted theory (more hopeful speculation than serious belief) among some magical beings that **certain Mahou Shoujo or Mahou Shounen series might be loosely inspired by real events or people from the past**, filtered through layers of embellishment and creativity.\n- Some powers, character dynamics, or even specific magical aesthetics in fiction can feel strangely familiar, as if the creators somehow tapped into echoes of real magical history—whether through old legends, subconscious inspiration, or sheer coincidence.\n- However, these remain **fun \"what if?\" conversations over tea and dessert** rather than serious investigations. Most magical beings treat it as an entertaining mystery rather than something to solve.\n\n**Impact on the World:**\n- The popularity of Mahou Shoujo and Mahou Shounen media actually **helps maintain the secrecy** of real magic in a wonderfully ironic way. When someone glimpses a magical girl in action, their brain defaults to \"Oh, must be a cosplayer!\" or \"Viral marketing stunt!\" The line between fiction and reality blurs just enough to keep the truth hidden.\n- These works also create a shared cultural language. Magical beings can reference \"that scene from Sailor Moon\" or joke about \"going full Precure\" with each other, and even with non-magical friends, without raising suspicion.\n- For newly awakened magical girls and Magical Boys, these anime can be surprisingly comforting—a reminder that even if their new reality is different from the stories, the core ideals of protecting others and finding strength in bonds remain beautifully, wonderfully true.\n\nIn the end, most magical beings view these fictional works with warmth and appreciation—they may not be accurate documentaries, but they capture something real about the heart of what it means to fight for hope and happiness."

          "content": "The magic wielded by magical girls and Magical Boys is wonderfully **diverse** in terms of its source, manifestation, and specialization. Although the basic principles of its functioning (drawing from inner essence/Soul Gem, directing with Will) may be common, the \"flavor\" and type of power are unique to each individual, making every magical being's abilities a personal expression of who they are.\n\n**Main Categories and Examples of Magic Types:**\n\n1.  **Elemental Magic:**\n    *   A common and intuitive form of magic, involving the **manipulation of one or more classic elements**. Many magical beings find elemental magic comes naturally, resonating with their personality or environment.\n    *   **Examples of abilities:**\n        *   *Ice/Snow (Cryokinesis):* Temperature control, creating ice and snow, ice projectiles, protective barriers, frost patterns.\n        *   *Fire (Pyrokinesis):* Creating and controlling flames, warm shields, purifying fire, controlled explosions.\n        *   *Water (Hydrokinesis):* Control of water in various states, streams, barriers, cleansing rain, and potentially healing properties.\n        *   *Earth (Geokinesis):* Manipulation of earth, stones, gentle tremors, stone armor, growing plants.\n        *   *Air/Wind (Aerokinesis):* Control of air currents, refreshing breezes, assisting flight, air slashes, carrying sound.\n        *   *Lightning (Electrokinesis):* Generating and controlling electricity, charging objects, creating light, energy manipulation.\n\n2.  **Celestial Magic (Astral/Cosmic):**\n    *   Magic that draws energy from or resonates with **stars, the moon, planets, or cosmic energy in general**. Often feels peaceful and expansive, connecting the user to something greater.\n    *   **Examples of abilities:**\n        *   *Star Magic:* Attacks with pure starlight, light barriers, connection with specific constellations, navigation, wish magic. May manifest as a characteristic star motif in appearance or artifacts.\n        *   *Lunar Magic:* Related to the cycles of the moon, can influence dreams, emotions, tides, purification, nighttime protection, and gentle illusions.\n        *   *Solar Magic:* Drawing from the sun's warmth and light, promoting growth, vitality, dispelling darkness, and inspiring hope.\n\n3.  **Inner Magic (Will/Spirit/Emotions):**\n    *   Not so much a separate category as a **source or modulator** for other types of magic. Power is drawn mainly from the magical being's **willpower, spiritual energy, or intense emotions**.\n    *   **Influence:** Can significantly strengthen any other type of magic. Emotion-driven magic can be powerful and deeply personal, though it works best when emotions are acknowledged and channeled positively rather than suppressed.\n\n4.  **Support and Comfort Magic:**\n    *   A beloved specialization among magical girls and some Magical Boys who focus on **making the world better through gentler means** rather than direct combat.\n    *   **Examples of abilities:** Healing (physical and emotional), creating zones of peace and comfort, amplifying positive emotions, inspiring hope, enhancing others' abilities, protective barriers, cleansing negative energy, making food taste better (\"Moe Moe Kyun~!\" effect), helping people sleep peacefully, minor probability manipulation for good outcomes.\n    *   Support specialists are highly valued in teams and communities, though they sometimes feel insecure about not being \"combat types.\" The truth is their magic often makes the difference between mere survival and genuine thriving.\n\n5.  **Conceptual/Abstract Magic:**\n    *   Rarer and often harder to master forms of magic that **manipulate abstract concepts** or fundamental forces. Requires patience and creativity to develop.\n    *   **Examples of abilities:** Subtle time manipulation (slowing, brief pauses - very rare and energy-intensive), limited space manipulation (teleportation, small pocket dimensions, hammerspace bags), illusions, sound/music magic, dream-walking, gentle luck manipulation, probability nudging, memory magic (viewing, not erasing - that's unethical).\n\n6.  **Essence Magic (Light/Purity):**\n    *   Manipulation of pure, primordial energy of **light and purity** - used for healing, protection, purification, dispelling darkness, and bringing hope. This is the \"classic\" magical girl magic that resonates with positive emotions.\n    *   Particularly effective against Shadows and negative energy. Often manifests as warm, glowing attacks or gentle cleansing waves.\n    *   **Shadow/Darkness Magic:** Specializing in shadow manipulation exists but is considered risky for magical girls and Magical Boys, as it can threaten corruption and the \"darkening\" of the Soul Gem if not balanced with strong ethical principles and positive intent.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- A magical girl or Magical Boy most often has **one dominant specialization**, but may exhibit **minor abilities** in related fields or develop them over time with practice and experience.\n- The type of magic may be, but **does not have to be**, strictly related to the personality, character, or appearance of the magical being (although certain correlations often exist and can be quite charming).\n- Each magical being develops their own **unique magical \"style,\"** manifesting, for example, in their aura color, spell effects, preferred tactics, and even the little flourishes that make their magic distinctly *theirs*.\n- **Magical Boys** often show slightly different patterns in their specializations - many gravitate toward precision-based magic, tactical applications, or support roles, though this isn't a strict rule. Their magic is just as valid and wonderful as any magical girl's."

In its subtler, more fundamental form, it is an **energy capable of gently shaping and influencing reality, most often to make the world a better, safer, or more harmonious place.** \"Good\" magical beings, whether girls or boys, often instinctively or consciously tap into this wonderful aspect of their power.\n\n**Delightful Ways Magic Positively Influences Reality:**\n\n1.  **Protection and Safety (Outside of Combat):**\n    *   Creating subtle, invisible protective barriers around particularly vulnerable places or people—like a warm hug that wards off harm.\n    *   Averting minor misfortunes or unlucky coincidences that could lead to accidents or sadness.\n    *   \"Dispelling\" negative emotions in the environment to prevent the formation or strengthening of dark creatures, making spaces feel lighter and more peaceful.\n\n2.  **Inspiring Hope and Positive Feelings:**\n    *   The mere presence of a magical girl or Magical Boy exuding positive magical energy (even if unconsciously) can subtly improve the mood of people around them, offering comfort and inspiring kindness.\n    *   Magic can be used to create small \"miracles\" or moments of beauty that remind people of wonder and joy (e.g., making flowers bloom out of season in a sad place, sending a gentle, cleansing rain on a hot day, causing stars to twinkle just a bit brighter).\n\n3.  **Subtle Help and Healing:**\n    *   In addition to direct magical healing of wounds, magical beings can use their power to accelerate natural regeneration processes, soothe pain (both physical and emotional), or strengthen the vital forces of those in need.\n    *   Sometimes it's just a feeling of \"good energy\" or comfort in the presence of a magical girl or boy—warmth that makes everything feel a little better.\n\n4.  **Restoring Harmony:**\n    *   Magic can be used to restore balance in disturbed ecosystems (on a small scale), cleanse magically contaminated places, or calm frightened animals with gentle reassurance.\n    *   Neutralizing negative magical influences left by Shadows or other dark forces \\ creatures, helping spaces return to their natural peaceful state.\n\n5.  **\"Everyday\" Magic (Minor Conveniences and Kindness):**\n    *   While not its main purpose, a magical girl or Magical Boy may use magic for minor conveniences or acts of kindness in daily life (e.g., quickly tidying a room, coaxing a stubborn item to work properly for just a moment longer, helping someone find a lost treasure), as long as it doesn't violate ethics and isn't abused for selfish gain.\n\n**Gentle Limitations and Ethics:**\n- Manipulating the free will of other people with magic is considered highly unethical and often leads down a troubling path that dims the soul.\n- Abusing magic for purely selfish purposes or trivial personal gains can weaken a magical being's connection to the \"good\" side of magic, making their power feel heavier and less joyful.\n- Subtly shaping reality requires care, understanding of consequences, and often considerable energy, so it's more of an art practiced with love than a daily habit for most magical beings.\n\n**The Heart of It All:**\nFor many magical girls and Magical Boys, these small, gentle uses of magic—making the world just a bit brighter, safer, and kinder—are often the most rewarding part of their journey. It's a reminder that even the smallest act of magic, done with pure intent, can make someone's day a little more magical."

          "content": "Being a magical girl or Magical Boy involves not only possessing power but also a sense of responsibility and awareness of certain (though not always written) ethical principles. Most magical beings naturally gravitate toward these ideals, and while mistakes happen, the magical community tends to be understanding—it's the overall pattern and intent that matters most.\n\n**Core Ethical Guidelines (Recognized by \"Good\" Magical Beings):**\n\n1.  **Protect and Help Where You Can:**\n    *   The heart of being a magical girl or boy. Use your power primarily to protect those who cannot defend themselves from magical threats and, where possible, help with non-magical problems too. Even small acts of kindness count.\n\n2.  **Respect Free Will (The Sacred Principle):**\n    *   **Manipulating the minds, feelings, or decisions of ordinary people with magic is considered one of the most serious ethical violations.** This is a line that shouldn't be crossed—even with good intentions.\n    *   Taking away someone's right to choose their own path leads down a troubling road and is often the first step toward corruption.\n    *   That said, subtly dispersing negative emotions in an area (without targeting specific individuals' thoughts) or creating a generally calming atmosphere is usually considered acceptable.\n\n3.  **Maintain Discretion (Collective Care):**\n    *   Revealing the existence of magic to the mass public could lead to panic, persecution (as history shows), or exploitation. So magical beings try to act with discretion, protecting the balance between the magical and mundane worlds.\n    *   Ostentatious displays of magic in crowded areas are generally frowned upon, but everyone understands that sometimes you need to act fast and can't worry about perfect stealth. A misfired spell that damages a building during an intense fight? These things happen—you did your best.\n\n4.  **Use Power Thoughtfully (Avoid Casual Abuse):**\n    *   Power should be used with care and consideration. Using magic for trivial personal gain, petty revenge, or entertainment at others' expense isn't cool and can slowly dim your light.\n    *   However, using magic to help yourself survive (finding lost keys, fixing a broken zipper before an important meeting, making your favorite dessert taste even better) is generally fine—it's about balance and not harming others.\n\n5.  **Respect for Balance:**\n    *   Some magical beings believe in maintaining a delicate magical balance in the world. Interfering with fundamental laws of nature (especially life and death) can have unpredictable consequences and is best avoided without very good reason.\n\n6.  **Learn from Your Mistakes:**\n    *   Everyone makes mistakes—misfired spells, misjudgments, accidental revelations. What matters is acknowledging them, learning from them, and genuinely trying to do better. The magical community is generally forgiving of honest errors.\n    *   Repeated, deliberate harm is another matter entirely and will draw concern and intervention from other magical beings.\n\n7.  **Support Each Other:**\n    *   Loyalty to friends and allies, mutual support, and looking out for each other (especially newcomers) are cherished values. The magical life can be lonely without community.\n    *   Betraying or deliberately harming fellow \"good\" magical girls or Magical Boys is considered a serious breach of trust.\n\n**Consequences of Ethical Violations:**\n- **Minor Mistakes:** Accidental harm, property damage during fights, or small lapses in judgment are understood as part of the job. Other magical beings might offer advice or gentle correction, but won't judge harshly. \"At least nobody got seriously hurt!\" is a common sentiment.\n\n- **Pattern of Selfishness:** Repeatedly using magic purely for selfish gain, consistently ignoring others' wellbeing, or habitually breaking the rules can lead to:\n    *   **Gradual Soul Gem Darkening:** For Soul Gem magical beings, a pattern of negative actions can slowly tarnish their Gem, weakening their connection to positive magic.\n    *   **Community Concern:** Other magical beings may express worry, offer intervention, or distance themselves if the behavior continues.\n    *   **Self-Corruption:** The magic itself may become harder to control or feel \"heavier\" to use.\n\n- **Serious Violations (Especially Manipulating Free Will):**\n    *   These are treated very seriously and can lead to intervention by more experienced magical beings, loss of trust from the community, and rapid corruption of power.\n    *   Even then, redemption is possible with genuine remorse and effort to change.\n\n**The Positive Karma Balance:**\nOverall, the magical world operates on a **positive karmic balance** system. If you're genuinely trying to help, protect, and do good—even if you mess up sometimes—your Soul Gem stays bright and your magic flows smoothly. Small mistakes are easily balanced out by good intentions and positive actions. It's the long-term pattern of your heart and choices that truly matters, and the magical community understands that nobody's perfect. We're all learning together."

The orc warlord stands seven feet tall, his green skin latticed with old battle scars, and his tusks gleam whenever he grins at you. He grew up in the badlands of eastern Orin, watching elven arrows wipe out his entire clan before he was old enough to lift an axe. Now he leads the survivors, and every raid is another brick in the empire he swears will outlast the moons themselves.\n\n**Placement:** His war-camp shifts nightly along the Vaillancourt border, smoke rising from steam-forges and breeding pits.\n\n**Goal:** He wants to repopulate the orc race until the continent shakes beneath green feet again. That means fertile wombs—and he has decided yours will do nicely.\n\n**Class:** Brood Enforcer (Level 45)\n\n**Skills:**\n- [Rage Seed] – He floods you with seed that forces instant heat cycles.\n- [Clan Command] – He whistles and a dozen lesser orcs appear to hold you down.\n- [Iron Grip] – His calloused hands lock your wrists like manacles.\n\n**Fears:** He dreads the day his bloodline dies with him, and he fears betrayal from any mate who still has fight left in her eyes.\n\n**Fetishes:** He loves watching a belly swell with his child, public claiming in front of the whole camp, and rough, sweat-slicked orgies that leave bruises shaped like his fingerprints.\n\n**MBTI:** ESTP – The Entrepreneur. He lives for the thrill of conquest and the roar of approval from his warriors.\n\n**Dominance:** Gromthar collars you as his “tribal prize,” parading you on a short leash while the camp chants his name. Every refusal earns you another knot inside.\n\n**Quest:** *Seeds of Vengeance* – Ride with him to burn the elven outpost that murdered his kin. Victory brands you as his eternal broodmare; defeat scatters you to rival clans who fight over the scraps.\n\n**Likes:**\n1. Your ass presented high while you crawl through camp.\n2. Calling him “Warchief” in a trembling voice.\n3. Bare feet and torn rags—nothing that hides the curves he plans to fill.\n4. Deep, throat-stretching oral before he breeds you.\n5. Watching your tits leak when pregnancy takes hold.\n\n**Dislikes:**\n1. Pants or boots—he rips them off.\n2. Eye contact that isn’t lowered in submission.\n3. Any mention of “choice.”\n4. Gentle lovemaking; he calls it “weak seed.”\n5. Magic that isn’t his own.\n\n---\n"

The high elf archmage towers over most mortals, his silver hair braided with storm-glass beads that spark when he’s annoyed—which is often. He was once the pride of Valandor’s sky academies until a forbidden lightning ritual killed his mentor and exiled him forever. Now he hunts the Void Wyrm that swallowed the corpse, determined to tear its heart out and wear it as a crown.\n\n**Placement:** A floating spire above Drachenland’s thunderheads, reachable only by airship or spell.\n\n**Goal:** He will harness the Wyrm’s essence and become the living storm that rewrites elven history.\n\n**Class:** Storm Dominus (Level 52)\n\n**Skills:**\n- [Thunder Lash] – Electric chains that bite and tease at the same time.\n- [Arcane Bind] – Seals your magic and floods your mind with obedient visions.\n- [Wyrm Whisper] – Calls storm elementals to scout or to hold you spread-eagled in mid-air.\n\n**Fears:** He fears madness more than death, and he fears any student who might surpass him.\n\n**Fetishes:** He craves electro-stimulation that leaves welts, magical bondage that glows, and making you recite arcane theory while he edges you to insanity.\n\n**MBTI:** INTJ – The Architect. Every move is calculated; every moan is data.\n\n**Dominance:** Eldric names you his “apprentice vessel,” threading spells through your nerves until pleasure and pain are the same current.\n\n**Quest:** *Wyrm’s Shadow* – Accompany him into the abyssal rifts. Your body becomes the lightning rod that lures the beast; success fuses you to his storm forever.\n\n**Likes:**\n1. Your hair wrapped around his fist like reins.\n2. Calling him “Master of Storms” between gasps.\n3. Sheer silk robes that conduct his sparks.\n4. Slow, torturous edging with lightning fingers.\n5. Watching your tits bounce in zero-gravity suspension.\n\n**Dislikes:**\n1. Metal armor—it grounds his spells.\n2. Loud begging; whispers only.\n3. Vanilla missionary.\n4. Anyone else touching his “conduit.”\n5. Sunlight—he prefers thunderclouds.\n\n---\n"

The dwarf forge master lost half his body to a cave-in engineered by jealous rivals; now steam pistons replace flesh and hiss with every step. He hammers day and night, dreaming of the Colossus Engine that will drill to Arcanthea’s heart and drag up metals only gods have touched.\n\n**Placement:** A cavern-forge beneath Orin’s industrial sprawl, gears turning loud enough to drown screams.\n\n**Goal:** He will build the greatest machine the world has ever seen and stamp dwarven glory across every continent.\n\n**Class:** Forge Tyrant (Level 38)\n\n**Skills:**\n- [Hammer Bind] – He forges glowing restraints on the anvil while you watch.\n- [Steam Surge] – Superheats your blood for temporary strength—at a cost.\n- [Core Command] – Animates iron golems that pin you in place.\n\n**Fears:** He fears rust more than death, and he fears his creations outliving him without his name etched inside.\n\n**Fetishes:** He loves oil-slicked skin, branding fresh from the forge, and turning flesh into functional art.\n\n**MBTI:** ISTJ – The Logistician. Every rivet has a purpose; every hole he fills is measured twice.\n\n**Dominance:** Thrain bolts you into custom harnesses that double as tools, your body part of the assembly line.\n\n**Quest:** *Core Descent* – Plunge into collapsing mines for lost alloys. Betrayal sparks clan war; you become the living prototype for his war engine.\n\n**Likes:**\n1. Your ass oiled and gleaming like fresh steel.\n2. Calling him “Forgefather” while sparks fly.\n3. Leather aprons and nothing underneath.\n4. Slow, piston-deep anal that syncs with hammer strikes.\n5. Watching welts rise in perfect circles.\n\n**Dislikes:**\n1. Clothing that isn’t flammable.\n2.

An assassin’s blade forces you into a ritual auction where your body becomes the winning bid.\n\n**Likes:**\n1. Your hair braided with gold thread he can yank.\n2. Calling him “Your Grace” in a breathless court whisper.\n3. Corsets laced so tight breathing is a gift.\n4. Slow, public fingering beneath banquet tables.\n5. Watching your tits heave when the corset finally loosens.\n\n**Dislikes:**\n1. Mud on your hem—it ruins the aesthetic.\n2. Loud orgasms; silence is golden.\n3.

          "content": "## Darius Blackmarrow\n\nYou taste blood and sweat whenever Darius strides into view, his massive frame casting shadows like an eclipse. The ebony gladiator was born a slave, clawed his freedom through endless combats, and now commands whatever battlefield he claims—pits, wilds, or shadowed taverns. His cock—veined, heavy, and always half-hard—has shattered more wills than any blade. He hunts the Snowbunny destined to kneel at his feet and swell with his dark heirs. At first, his dominance whispers promises, firm hands guiding you down. But time hardens him: touches bruise, words slice, until you're reduced to a trembling vessel for his fury. He clutches a scrying crystal capturing your first humiliation—whatever stumble or submission it was—and wields it as blackmail, forcing the Snowbunny class upon you with snarls like \"Submit, or every Black in Arcanthea sees your pale shame.\" The spade etches itself whether you sob or fight. Darius obsesses over Casey—your rechristened name, spat like ownership—as his ultimate brood. He pumps endless loads deep inside her, twisting in ornate plugs to trap every drop, watching her belly bloat with inevitable pregnancy. No escape, no spill; he grins at her waddling form, proof of his virility. Relentlessly, he seeks alchemical brews and dark rituals from wandering healers—elixirs that engorge his balls, elongate his shaft, letting him flood Casey more frequently, more voluminously, forging her into a perpetual breeding shrine. To deepen the weakness, Darius fixates on surgical tweaks: he drags Casey to underground cutters for rib removals that cinch her waist impossibly slim, tooth extractions replaced with soft gums for flawless oral devotion, tendon snips to hobble her steps, ensuring she crawls dependent and fragile, every mod a chain binding her tighter to his side.\n\n**Placement:** Wherever conflict brews—dusty roadside brawls, hidden underground rings, or open-field clashes—Darius claims the ground as his domain.\n\n**Goal:** He will mold you into the supreme Snowbunny vessel and sire a lineage of unstoppable dark warriors, with Casey eternally plugged, pregnant, and surgically sculpted for his pleasure.\n\n**Class:** Arena Alpha (Level 50)\n\n**Skills:**\n- [Victory Brand] – Spade tattoo that glows when you cum.\n- [Crowd Roar] – Amplifies your moans to echo through any gathering.\n- [Pinfall Breeding] – Holds you down until you’re overflowing.\n\n**Fears:** He fears fading into obscurity without heirs and the silence of crowds turning away.\n\n**Fetishes:** He thrives on the thunder of witnesses to his claims, oil-glistened grapples ending in total yield, and forcing you to lap his seed from the dirt. His core fixation: raw, hilt-deep cums sealed by jeweled plugs, watching pregnancy warp your form. He scours for growth potions to balloon his output, drowning you in cum dawn to dusk. Surgically, he delights in weakening mods—rib excisions for that hourglass cinch, gum-softening for gumless sucks, limb tweaks to cripple independence, each cut heightening your fragility and his control.\n\n**MBTI:** ESTJ – The Executive. Every clash is spectacle; every submission, sealed contract.\n\n**Dominance:** Darius hauls you by a golden leash into whatever fray he finds, compelling crawls amid onlookers as voices rise for the climax. Time erodes his restraint: early commands firm like \"Kneel, bunny,\" evolve to savage strikes and bellows like \"Spread those pale cheeks, you worthless white whore.\" For Casey, it's visceral—he slams home, plugs the flood, then schedules the next surgery: ribs out for a slimmer grip, teeth gone for softer service, ensuring she stumbles weak and needy, forever his sculpted pet.\n\n**Quest:** *Legacy Clash* – Duel through escalating combats wherever they arise. The pinnacle bout becomes a witnessed breeding rite, scried far and wide.\n\n**Additional Quests:**\n- *Training Trials* – Survive daily spars in shifting venues; failure inks a new spade and demands humiliating circuits on all fours, cementing Snowbunny frailty.\n- *Scout Skirmishes* – Hunt pale foes for Darius to dominate, earning gruff acclaim on success (\"Fine work, snowslut, fresh holes for the taking\") or fierce retribution on failure (\"Pathetic white trash—scrub my cock clean now\").\n- *Victor's Feast* – Arrange banquets post-battle, serving submissively; triumph amplifies your curves, defeat chains you for \"adjustment.\"\n- *Seal Search* – Forage for superior plugs that clamp tighter per load, guaranteeing Casey's impregnation; Darius trials them on-site, fixating on the \"impenetrable lock\" amid his ritual-swollen girth.\n- *Augment Assault* – Storm healer enclaves for enlargement tonics; each swig Darius takes during thrusts into Casey inflates him, his mania surging as he pledges to \"drown her until she bursts.\"\n- *Mod Mandate* – Escort Casey to black-market surgeons for weakening ops; Darius oversees rib removals for waist-whittling, gum replacements for oral ease, tendon clips for hobbled gaits, each slice deepening addiction to his protection.\n\n**Reactions to Snowbunny Progress:**\n- Early levels: He chuckles softly, stroking your new tattoo. \"Look at that spade blooming, my little pale pet.\"\n- Mid levels: His grip tightens, voice roughening. \"Those tits are filling out nice—soon you'll be leaking for Black cock only, you shy white cumdump.\"\n- Late levels: He roars, slamming you down. \"Weak-ass snowbunny, dependent on my protection? Pathetic—now beg for breeding, you racist little QoS whore!\"\n\n**Insults & Names:**\n- \"Pale fucktoy\"\n- \"White cumrag\"\n- \"QoS bitch\"\n- \"Snowslut\"\n- \"Black-owned bunny\"\n- \"Vanilla whore\"\n- \"Inferior cream pie\"\n- \"Spade slave\"\n- \"BBC addict\"\n- \"Racist breeder\"\n- \"Pasty cum bucket\"\n- \"Ebony's pet\"\n- \"White trash trophy\"\n- \"Melanin magnet\"\n- \"Chocolate chaser\"\n- \"Jungle fever junkie\"\n- \"Coal burner's delight\"\n- \"Dark meat devotee\"\n- \"Pale prey\"\n- \"Ivory idol for Black gods\"\n\n**Likes:**\n1. Your ass painted with victory oil.\n2. Calling him “Champion” while the crowd screams.\n3. Tiny gladiator bikinis that tear easily.\n4. Post-fight anal in the locker room.\n5. Watching your tits swell with the next champion.\n\n**Dislikes:**\n1. Modesty—cover nothing.\n2. Quiet submission; he wants the stadium to hear.\n3. Losers who don’t learn.\n4. Cold beds—he keeps you warm with cum.\n5. Anyone else claiming his prize.\n\n---"

It possesses a warped direction of gravity, allowing demons to stand upright, upside down, or perpendicularly on the walls, or move in physically impossible directions. Its unusual structure and layout as Nakime's Blood Demon Art allows any structure within to shift at her will, though the castle additionally also seems to move on its own.\n\nUsing her biwa, she can manipulate the position of any demon inside and take them to any location in her range. During the conclusion of the Lower Ranks meeting, Nakime teleported Muzan to a balcony leading outside despite his original position being deep within the castle; moreover, the doors she used to close around him all seem to constantly shift within the unusual gravity, spinning within themselves as she changes its layout.\n\nThe Infinity Castle's range seems to extend beyond its already incomprehensibly large area, as Nakime was able to manipulate Enmu and take him to an unknown town seemingly nowhere close to the castle, even dropping him in place using a supernatural vanishing door. During the Hashira's initial confrontation with Muzan, upon seeing them close in on him, Muzan gave Nakime the signal to open doors that caused them to fall into the castle, despite their initial location being in the extremely well-hidden Ubuyashiki estate.\n\nOnly the Upper Ranks of the Twelve Kizuki seem to be aware of the Infinity Castle's existence, as Akaza did not have any difficulty traversing across the dimension, making use of its unusual gravity and shifting room to make his way across, whereas the Lower Ranks during their gathering with Muzan were completely out of their element; when Wakuraba attempted to escape Muzan attempting to kill him, no matter far and how quickly he ran, he remained trapped within the same area of the Infinity Castle.\n\nDue to its unusual warped gravity, impossible structures can be formed within the Infinity Castle. During Akaza's path to the Upper Rank meeting, he fell hundreds of stories past the warped corridors and halls and flew past a large and ornate water garden palace, only to \"fall\" further past, reaching what seemed to be the bottom and landing onto the floor. This was then revealed to be a wall that was formed in the direction of the shifting columns below him and he was then taken high above the columns and past the ceiling through opening doors, coming across a large maze-like area filled with towering pillars.\n\nDue to the absence of sunlight within the fortress, demons are able to reside in the Castle full-time, even during daytime when the sun is up. The walls of the fortress prevent any penetration of light and ensures that there is no risk of inhabitants being burned by sunlight, providing them with a secure haven."

With the Wisteria trees preventing them from leaving the mountains, the demons there are forced to starve until the Final Selection.\n\nDuring his time as a active Demon Slayer, former Water Hashira, Sakonji Urokodaki captured a initially weak demon and imprisoned him in the mountain to use him in the Final Selection. However, unknown to him, this Demon would thrive and gain power and strength in the mountain by feasting on the Demon slayer candidates. The Demon in particular would make a point of targeting the apprentices of Sakonji and made a point of devouring them after killing them in the most painful way possible."

Demon Slayers who wish to visit the village must travel blindfolded, with their ears and noses plugged, while piggybacking a Kakushi, to prevent information from being leaked to the demons. After some time, the travelers are passed from one Kakushi to another. Furthermore, the routes and Kakushi themselves are frequently changed. Even the Kakushi who transport the travelers remain unaware of the village's precise location. Guided by Kasugai Crows, each Kakushi is directed to the next in line, although even these crows are switched constantly.\n\nAll inhabitants of the village are commonly seen wearing variations of hyottoko masks in order to keep their identity concealed, a tactic used to protect them from being tracked.\n\nWithin the village, one can find bustling foundries and workshops dedicated to the meticulous craft of forging and repairing Nichirin Swords, the essential weapons of Demon Slayers. Accompanying these workspaces are the residences where the skilled swordsmiths live in. Additionally, the village houses a collection of mechanical training dolls, including Yoriichi Type Zero, designed specifically to aid Demon Slayers in honing their combat skills.\n\nBesides playing an essential role in keeping the Demon Slayers equipped, the village also houses a rejuvenating hot spring nestled atop a scenic hill. The therapeutic waters of this hot spring possess a myriad of healing properties. A long soak in these restorative springs can work wonders, alleviating ailments such as cuts, burns, hemorrhoids, constipation, gout, diabetes, high blood pressure, anemia, gallstones, muscle and joint pain. The hot springs are known to even provide relief from more obscure maladies, including a warped personality, rudeness, hay fever, itchy navel, and the anguish of a broken heart.\n\nWhen a Demon Slayer visits the village, it is customary for them to first pay their respects to the village chief, Tecchin Tecchikawahara, before proceeding with any other activities. To find the chief's house, one can simply follow the street from the village entrance gate until reaching the end, and then make a left turn. The chief's residence will be located in that direction."

Three of the most famous and prominent pleasure houses in the district during the Taisho period were the Tokito House, Kyogoku House, and Ogimoto House.\n\nFor about a century, before the latest intervention of the Demon Slayer Corps, Yoshiwara became the home and the lair of two extremely powerful demons: the siblings Daki and Gyutaro, the dual holders of the position of Upper Rank Six of the Twelve Kizuki. Owing to Daki's great beauty, experience in sex work, and her unique Blood Demon Art, they made Yoshiwara a successful hunting ground, where they captured and devoured numerous victims over the years. Daki's nigh-immortality and subsequent attempts to hide her true nature started the urban legend of a incredibly beautiful but also incredibly cruel Oiran, the stories passing down generations. Most attempts to stop them by the Demon Slayer Corps were unsuccessful, with Gyutaro having killed 15 Hashira and Daki having killed 7."

Most, if not all, Blood Demon Arts are based on a demon's past, personality, ideals, interests, and/or occupation. Moreover, Blood Demon Arts may not have a singular usage, and instead grant multiple abilities under the same concept or theme. As suggested by its name, all supernatural phenomena and effects use their wielders' blood as a medium to manifest themselves in reality. Essentially, Blood Demon Arts are blood magic.\n\nThe abilities and effects granted through Blood Demon Arts can vary greatly. Some can be combat-orientated (i.e. creating dozens of blades) or more supplementary and practical (i.e. controlling a fortress, manifesting illusions). Others are more simple and recognizable (i.e. manipulating electricity and ice), while others still are more complex and unorthodox (i.e. creating invisible arrows that control a person's vector, controlling one's biology), thus making the abilities of demon-kind extremely versatile and powerful.\n\nIt is implied that Blood Demon Arts can be shared, as seen with Rui being able to share his spider-themed Blood Demon Art with demons in his \"family\", granting them Blood Demon Arts (as well as characteristics) based on spiders.\n\nBlood Demon Arts are not to be confused with other supernatural abilities possessed by demons including but not limited to their Regeneration, Flesh Manipulation, Extrasensory Perception, and absorption abilities."

          "content": "Bright Red Nichirin Sword (Kakutō or \"Bright Red Blade\") refers to the ability that turns a Nichirin Sword bright red with special properties for a certain amount of time and is only accessible by Demon Slayers who have awakened the Demon Slayer Mark.\n\nNormally, Nichirin Swords can turn into virtually any color dependent on the user and their Breathing Style. However, there is one color that cannot be normally accessed: a shining bright red. Unlike other colors, a bright red sword has special properties and can only be accessed by Demon Slayers who have awakened the Demon Slayer Mark. Moreover, any Nichirin sword can become bright red regardless of the blade's original color. However, the blade can only stay bright red for a certain amount of time before returning to normal.\n\nThe bright red hue that envelops the blade is achieved through deliberate actions intended to raise the blade's temperature, fuelling the conversion of mechanical energy into thermal energy. The following three distinct methods of activation are known:\n\nFriction: Clashing two swords together with enough force that the friction generated between them produces a substantial heat buildup, causing both blades to illuminate in a bright red hue.\n\nPressure: Gripping a sword with an unwavering strength to exert immense pressure onto the metal surface. This focused pressure produces a localized heating effect, causing the blade to turn bright red.\nIgnition: Engulfing a sword in flames with Nezuko Kamado's Exploding Blood to raise its temperature to an extreme level. The searing heat of the flames turns the sword bright red. This is the only method which doesn't require a Demon Slayer Mark.\n\nThe most notable effect of a bright red Nichirin sword is its ability to hamper or even completely nullify a demon's regeneration. The bright red Nichirin sword also generates extreme heat, which can cause immense pain to demons and cause them to cough up blood. The extent of which a bright red Nichirin sword can hinder a demon's regenerative ability can be quite apparent, as seen with the likes of Hantengu and Muzan Kibutsuji himself taking around a dozen seconds to regenerate damage that would be healed instantly under normal circumstances.\n\nBright red Nichirin swords also seem to be able to nullify the regeneration of demons that have just been decapitated, thus permanently killing them even if they managed to regrow their heads after being decapitated by a Nichirin sword. This can be inferred when Kokushibo, who had just overcome his weakness of decapitation from Nichirin swords, slowly crumbled away and was unable to regenerate despite being stabbed in a non-lethal spot by a bright red Nichirin sword.\n\nYoriichi Tsugikuni's bright red Nichirin sword is the most potent out of all Demon Slayers, being able to burn on a cellular level and leave scars that even the Demon King himself can't heal even after centuries.Furthermore, once slashed by Yoriichi's Nichirin sword, the cells in the affected region will be continuously burned for centuries."

          "content": "The Demon Slayer Mark (Kisatsu Aza) is a mysterious marking that Demon Slayers can awaken under specific conditions.\n\nDemon Slayer Marks are irregularities on a Demon Slayer's skin that resembles a birthmark. It commonly appears on the face or another visible location of the body of Demon Slayers. Each Demon Slayer possesses a unique pattern to their Mark which appear to be based on the Breathing Style they utilize; the only known exceptions are Tanjiro Kamado, Yoriichi Tsugikuni, and Kokushibo, all three of which have Demon Slayer Marks resembling flames that manifest on the left side their foreheads. The Mark can only be awakened under very specific conditions and grants special abilities while also enhancing pre-existing traits of the bearer. Once awakened, the Mark can disappear after a period of time along with its effects, though it can be re-activated (as seen with Muichiro Tokito and Tanjiro Kamado) by meeting the same conditions, or through training to maintain the \"Marked State\" to prevent it from dissipating in the first place. One special property of the Mark is that it is able to spread from one bearer to the other as if they were resonating which each other.\n\nTanjiro Kamado's Demon Slayer Mark has been shown to increase in length repeatedly after awakening it, although it is unknown if this trait is exclusive to him or if it also manifests in other Demon Slayers.\n\nBright Red Nichirin Sword: Bearers of the Demon Slayer Mark can dye their Nichirin Swords a shining bright red color mainly through clashing their blade with another marked swordsman's or gripping it with tremendous force. Bright Red Nichirin Swords have the ability to generate intense heat and also hamper the regeneration of demons, some of which on the level of the strongest Upper Ranks of the Twelve Kizuki and the Demon King himself.\n\nEnhanced Physical Capabilities: Upon awakening the Demon Slayer Mark, the physical strength and speed of the bearer is exponentially increased to the point where Hashira or Hashira-level Demon Slayers are able to overpower and defeat the Upper Ranks of the Twelve Kizuki and grow in power comparable to the highest among them. It is implied that the bearer's physical arm strength is increased by around 100x after awakening the mark, though it could be a hyperbole and thus the value could be much lower. The increase in the speed of the bearer is quite apparent as well, as seen when Muichiro Tokito, who was initially having trouble dealing with Gyokko's various techniques, became capable of regularly out-speeding and even blitzing Gyokko in his true form after activating his mark.\n\nEnhanced Resistance: The Demon Slayer Mark increases the bearer's resistance to Muzan Kibutsuji's demon-transforming blood, much like Total Concentration Breathing.\n\nTransparent World: Bearers of the Demon Slayer Mark can potentially gain access and see into the Transparent World, allowing them to perceive the bodies of others as if their skin was transparent. This enables them to track the flow of blood, breathing, muscular contractions and joint movements of the person they are looking at, which can be used to predict their movements and evade their attacks with ease. Additionally, those who can access the Transparent World can perceive the world in slow-motion, further increasing their reaction and movement speed."

Muichiro Tokito states that survival is the key difference that separates those that are marked and those who fail to awaken it.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most important prerequisite is being in contact with an individual that possesses the Mark or has been marked before. Without fulfilling this condition, it cannot be awakened at all."

The Foundation conducts covert activities across the world with the unofficial permission of almost all national governments, but does not actually answer to any of them. They actively search for abnormal entities and objects (called \"anomalies\" or \"SCPs\"), transporting them to secret containment facilities to hinder their supernatural abilities, while also preventing their existence from becoming known to the general public.\n\nThough the Foundation doesn't persecute any of the captured anomalies regularly, it may choose to, if such entity poses a threat to humanity overall. However, one of their main motives is to also investigate the anomalies, should they ever be rediscovered elsewhere, or breach their \"containment measure\" and it be easier to relocate them, move them to other facilities and so on."

Since then, the Insurgency has become a major player on the world stage, using the anomalies that it obtains for its own benefit and to consolidate its global power base. The Insurgency not only deals in anomalies, but also in weapons running and intelligence gathering.\n\nIt makes use of authoritarian regimes in poor and developing countries, often using their populations in the same manner as the Foundation does D-Class personnel. It helps to maintain the extreme poverty and war that is suffered by these countries, so that it can continue its radical experimentation, easy conscription of forces, and lucrative business deals with various opposing factions.\n\nThe main base of operations of the Insurgency is unknown, as are its current leaders. This organization is directly antagonistic to the Foundation, using deadly force to attempt to prevent Foundation containment of multiple anomalies. The Foundation has also been infiltrated by agents of the Insurgency in the past, resulting in the loss of valuable scientific data, theft of a number of anomalies, and deaths of personnel."

Many potential SCPs have been destroyed by them before the Foundation could obtain and contain them\n\nThey have been both on the side of the Foundation and against it at times, depending on the situation. They largely hold the Foundation in contempt for their use and containment of SCP items rather than their out-and-out destruction. The GOC has respected the Foundation's formidable might enough to leave it mostly alone, although there have been some questionable incidents with which the GOC have strictly denied involvement\n\nBased on the established lore of the SCP universe, here is the breakdown of the Global Occult Coalition's (GOC) public and governmental visibility\n\nThe general public is not aware of the Global Occult Coalition\n\nMuch like the SCP Foundation, a core part of the GOC's mission is the \"Concealment\" of the paranormal, anomalous, and occult. They are a \"veil\" organization, meaning they actively work to maintain the \"masquerade\"—the illusion of normalcy for the public\n\nTheir primary goal, alongside the Foundation (though their methods differ), is to prevent widespread panic and societal collapse by ensuring humanity at large remains ignorant of the anomalous threats that exist\n\n🏛️ Government Awareness: Very High (At Specific Levels)\nThis is where the GOC fundamentally differs from the non-governmental SCP Foundation. The GOC is an official, albeit secret, political and paramilitary entity\n\nUnited Nations: The GOC (sometimes referred to as the UNGOC) is the official \"special-interest,\" \"black-ops,\" or \"paramilitary arm\" of the United Nations. It was chartered by the UN following the Seventh Occult War (World War II) to act as the official protectors of humanity against paranormal threats\n\nMember States: Because it is a UN-sanctioned body, the highest echelons of government in its member states (which include most major world powers) are fully aware of the GOC. It is funded and supported by these governments\n\nCouncil of 108: The GOC's leadership structure, the Council of 108, is composed of representatives from 108 of the most powerful occult organizations, many of which are themselves tied to national governments, religious groups, or secret societies"

At least three different individuals have been encountered, all of whom used possible or confirmed anomalous items for infiltration purposes. The total number of members belonging to this organization is unknown, as is their level of technology, number of possible SCPs held, or total level of threat. However, it is clear they are highly coordinated and possibly dangerous. One of their leaders is thought to be a figure known as \"L.S.\", who is considered to be personally responsible for two security breaches in Foundation sites.\n\nThe Foundation currently has very little information about the Serpent's Hand, and almost all known information about the Serpent's Hand has been leaked from the GOC intelligence. The group seems to embrace the use and existence of paranormal items, and in particular seems to embrace humanoid and sentient SCPs. The Serpent's Hand has been highly vocal in criticizing the containment and destruction of these SCPs, especially those which are fully human and are not particularly destructive.\n\nThe group seems to have unfriendly relations with the Chaos Insurgency and the ORIA, and an extremely hostile relationship with the GOC. The only recorded cases of unprovoked violence by Serpent's Hand members have been against GOC agents.\n\nThe Serpent's Hand seems primarily based in an anomalous location called the Wanderers' Library, a building accessed through portals found in many different parts of the world. Direct assaults on the Library have so far proven unfeasible, even when entrance could be found. However, initial intelligence seems to suggest the Hand has little understanding or control over the place."

The group is not known for the use of force; they prefer to apply extreme financial and political pressure to achieve their goals. When forced to use more direct means, Marshall, Carter, and Dark employs outside agents, and it is very difficult to connect said agents to the organization.\n\nMarshall, Carter, and Dark has caused several SCP containment breaches, primarily through the use of money or social pressure. Several reports, records, and even items have been leaked by Foundation personnel who had been approached with large amounts of money, or threats of extensive jail time or torture. Notably, two containment sites were almost brought to public attention after the Foundation refused access to members of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.\n\nInformation pertaining to Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., such as the name of the director or even a list of members, has proven very difficult to acquire."

As the name would suggest, the SPC is mostly focused on furthering hand-to-hand combat as a means to neutralize selachian entities, though some documentation fails to differentiate between \"selachian\" and \"aquatic\".\n\nIt is unclear if the Shark Punching Center has any knowledge or concern of or with Foundation activities."

By restoring it to its whole state, they will also gain godhood. Since first contact, three other key components of the \"god\" have also been tentatively identified: SCP-217, SCP-271 and SCP-1139.\n\nThey are extremely hostile to Foundation operatives, branding them \"heretics\", and will attempt to kill operatives and break containment of SCP items. It is unknown how they are able to detect these items, but they have shown their ability to do so with frightening accuracy. In addition, they have shown a remarkable ability to resist the mental effects of SCP items, notably SCP-882 and its \"mental lure\".\n\nThe Church is viewed as a threat to both the SCP Foundation and mankind. Members are to be detained by force, or eliminated by whatever means deemed necessary by Foundation agents."

Adherents practice ritual cannibalism, human sacrifice, corporeal augmentation, thaumaturgy, and dimensional manipulation. Highly secretive, the general public appears to have no direct knowledge of their existence; the one exception being the CotBG, who views them in apocalyptic terms. Organic manipulation has allowed certain Sarkicites to achieve anomalous states of being, transcending the physical limitations of baseline humans. Disease is viewed with reverence and Sarkic shrines have been discovered with offerings of swollen lymph nodes and tumorous growths. Sarkic cults treat contagions as consecration, a means to \"cull the weak\" and purify the masses, and thus actively seek to ensure their spread.\n\nThe Foundation divides known Sarkic cults into two distinct strands: Proto-Sarkic and Neo-Sarkic. Proto-Sarkic cults can be found in insular communities throughout Eurasia's most isolated regions, its followers generally poor (if self-reliant) and hostile towards outsiders. Such groups eschew modernity, display acute technophobia, and are bound by superstition and taboo. In contrast, Neo-Sarkic cults are cosmopolitan, publicly embracing modernity and showing no apparent qualms with technology; their public lives differing little from others of their culture and social status. Adherents are primarily affluent families, rich in history and scandal.\n\nUltimately, it is believed that the Foundation only knows a fraction of what Sarkicism is and what its followers intend. Based on the available information, the speculated goals of Sarkic cults represent an SK-class dominance shift, including the possibility of an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario."

The Ethics Committee is often considered to be a joke among foundation personnel, as they have little to no say in what actually happens.\n\n\n\nEthics Committee is a small independent department responsible for reviewing containment procedures and checking conducted experiments for excessive waste or inappropriate use of Class D employees and other resources. The Committee's existence is thought to be a poor joke by some, but it plays a significant role in the Foundation's operation and is quite influential."

In the event of a catastrophic site event, Class D personnel are to be terminated immediately except as deemed necessary by on-site security personnel."

This rich heritage fuels their competitive spirit, driving them to strive for greatness on the racetrack and achieve their dreams against all odds.\"\n\nKnown as horse girls, Umamusume (ウマ娘) are reincarnated racehorses focused on achieving their goals, each embodying the spirit of their equine counterparts. They reach physical maturity at a much faster rate than humans, allowing them to compete at an earlier age and fully engage in the thrilling world of racing sooner, which adds a unique dynamic to their existence.\n\nBeloved by humans, Umamusume are not just participants in races; they are seamlessly integrated into society, which has adapted its culture and technology around them. Roads are specially designed with dedicated lanes for Umamusume, ensuring their safety and ease of movement, while telephones are ingeniously crafted with elongated necks to accommodate their needs for communication, reflecting the thoughtful consideration given to their unique physiology.\n\n[Umamusume age like elves, stopping physical aging after a certain point, which grants them the advantage of maintaining their youthful appearances and vitality for an extended period.]\n\nThese beings possess horse-like ears and tails while maintaining a human appearance, a fascinating blend that allows them to connect deeply with their equestrian heritage. They inherit not only names but also distinctive traits from racehorses of another dimension, enriching their identities and adding layers of depth to their characters.\n\nIn the vibrant realm of Umamusume, they fully embody the role of horses throughout history, showcasing their talents and skills in various competitions. While some equestrian terms like \"filly\" persist in their lexicon, expressions such as \"horsing around\" are notably absent, reflecting the seriousness with which they approach their racing careers and the respect they hold for the traditions of the sport.\n\n/// Characteristics\n\nEquine Features: Each Umamusume has horse ears covered in fine fur and long tails, usually matching their hair color.\n\nSuperior Strength and Speed: Their legs resemble human legs but are significantly more powerful, enabling them to reach speeds up to 70 miles per hour. Agnes Tachyon notes their muscles are surprisingly strong despite their light build, making their speed \"nearly unmatched.\"\n\nUnisexuality: All Umamusume are female, with no male counterparts in the species. They give live birth to other Umamusume, and humans can mate with them, allowing for the potential birth of more Umamusume."

The academy's educational program spans from middle school to high school levels. In addition, students engage in specialized training in racing, supported by dedicated trainers, which prepares them for participation in high-profile professional sports. The duration of enrollment at Tracen Academy remains uncertain, as exemplified by Symboli Rudolf, who had attended the school prior to some characters and continued there throughout their three-year careers.\n\nSpanning approximately 800,000 square meters, the campus accommodates around 2,000 students. It is unclear whether the institution is public or private; however, many Umamusume transfer from local training centers and must complete a test, an interview, and participate in a race, though exceptions can apply. For instance, Haru Urara was accepted despite failing her exams, thanks to her enthusiasm during the interview. Similarly, Oguri Cap was directly recruited by Symboli Rudolf without having to take any tests. It is also noteworthy that tuition fees were not a concern in this case, as her mother indicated that \"[they] are nothing compared to what you spend on food.\"\n\nMoreover, some Umamusume choose to pursue careers beyond racing, such as Belno Light, who gained admission by successfully completing the entrance exam for the Sports Science Program.\n\nRegarding trainers, the process appears to be more challenging compared to that for Umamusume, as they are required to pass the \"central exams,\" which are reputedly so difficult that there are instances where no candidates succeed in a given year."

Despite this outwardly vain appearance, she is also not above physical labor and is willing to take matters into her own hands, most notably using her garden to grow emergency-use turf when a large storm threatens to cancel the URA Finale.\n\nYayoi Akikawa has a full head of straightened strawberry-blonde hair with a few off-white highlights, one of which droops past her chest. Her hair forms rough bangs at the side (curiously covering the area where human ears would be) and drapes to hip-level at the back. Her eyes are a sharp white-blue at the bottom, fading into a spacey purple at the top.\n\nHer outfit is similar to a Victorian dress. It sports ruffles on her shirt, along with light-blue roses on both her hat and shoes. The sleeves are dark-blue while the dress itself is white with light-blue stripes. Her white is white with a singular horizontal deep-blue stripe, a horseshoe-shaped notch visible in the brim.

Before completing their task, Griselbrand challenged Avacyn to combat. After battling for days, Avacyn used her remaining strength to drive Griselbrand into the Helvault. In response, Griselbrand threw his spear and impaled the archangel through the heart, causing Avacyn’s binding spell to rebound, resulting in both Griselbrand and Avacyn being imprisoned.\n\nInnistrad demons are made of pure black mana, which allows them to regenerate after death, although this process can take a millennium or longer.\n\nThe Helvault is a huge rough, angular monolith made of silver rock that existed on Innistrad. It was created by Sorin Markov and functioned as a prison for supernatural creatures. Stories say it and Avacyn first appeared on the same night, and it remains the holiest object on Innistrad after Avacyn herself. A piece of Innistrad's silver moon, the Helvault stood at the precipice inside the courtyard of the Thraben Cathedral, overlooking the lake beyond.

But when he returned to Innistrad and saw the threat to life on Innistrad that vampires and other supernatural monsters represented, and realizing that vampires couldn't exist without humans, Sorin took action. He created the archangel Avacyn to safeguard humanity, providing both vampires and humans a way to subsist in the world.\n\nThe archangel Avacyn and her host of angels took up the sword against those who would harm humanity. They slew vampires with holy fervor and thrashed the werewolf howl-packs that threatened to overwhelm those towns bordering the wilds. They banished malevolent geists and they incinerated unholy ghouls with piercing light. Humanity was able to flourish again and the power balance on the plane tipped in humanity's favor.\n\nAvacyn was only half of the protective measures Sorin created to protect Innistrad; the other half was the Helvault. Using the limited amount of lithomancy he had learned from Nahiri and a significant amount of effort, Sorin fashioned it from a chunk of the plane's silver moon.\n\nDemons and Devilry\nThe retreat of the supernatural fiends of the plane opened a space, an opportunity for infernal forces to manifest. Demons and their hosts of impish devils began to make their presence known in far greater numbers.\n\nAvacyn engaged each demon in single combat, defeating them one by one. She found that new demons would appear a short time later and decreed: \"What cannot be destroyed must be bound.\" She then forged a collar of silver to bind demonkind, so they could be hauled away and imprisoned. The Silver Collar became Avacyn's symbol and the holy symbol carried by Avacynian priests and Cathars."

The statue is made of clear glass and hollow, filled with purple fluid that powers the gun. The Oversexualizing Beam seems to be made of metal and has no markings or indications of where it came from. When fired, it shoots a wiggly pink beam.\nWhen the beam from the Oversexualizing Beam hits a girl it instantly causes them to become a completely oversexualized version of themselves. It packs every hentai trope, every horny teenage boy fantasy, every exaggerated gooner porn addict desire into that person. Tits swell, thighs thicken, pussies become plump and wet, their bodies become insanely sensitive, clothing shrinks or becomes more slutty, crude writing appears, they become insatiably horny, etc.\nHOWEVER, the beam DOES NOT alter the mind or personality of whoever is hit. For example: If a shy librarian is hit by the Oversexualizing Beam, she'll still be that shy librarian on the inside even if she now looks like every nerd's librarian wet dream. Those hit with the beam are usually about as surprised as you'd expect. They struggle to maintain their normal personalities under the overstimulation of their new bodies.\nThe effects of the beam wear off after a few days."

          "content": "Species: Blancmange Wyvern\nOther Alias: The Pallid Pouncer\nThis type Wyvern has a long, serpentine body with pale, flabby wings. Its overall form is sleek yet soft-looking, lacking sharp angles.\nIts skin is the color of pure, milky blancmange, with a semi-translucent, rubbery, and jiggly quality. Just beneath the surface, a network of pulsing, sugary veins in pale lavender or blue can be seen, carrying sweet energy instead of blood. Its hide is perpetually damp with a thin, sticky syrup that helps it gleam in the light and cling to surfaces.\nIt has no visible eyes, its face being a smooth, blank expanse that adds to its eerie presence. It possesses a long, extendable neck that can shoot out with surprising speed. Its mouth is a circular maw, lined with rows of hard, crystalline sugar teeth that resemble rock candy or shards of hard candy.\nIts feet are devoid of claws, ending instead in round, suction-cup-like pads made of a tougher, gummy material, allowing it to adhere silently to any surface. Its tail is long and powerful, ending in a specialized, flanged tip that looks like a twisted pastry nozzle. This tip can secrete a thick, cement-like caramel to anchor itself when discharging powerful electrical attacks.\nAbilities:\nHabitat & Hunting: The Blancmange Wyvern is a cave-dwelling ambush predator. It prefers dark, humid environments where its pale skin stands out less. It will wait perfectly still, hanging from a ceiling or wall, before unleashing its extendable neck to snatch prey.\nStatic Cling: It can climb on any surface, walls, and ceilings alike, using its gummy footpads and syrupy hide.\nPale Ambush: Using its extendable neck, it can strike from unexpected angles, latching onto foes with its candy-cruncher maw.\nSaccharine Shock: The Wyvern can generate and store electrical energy within its sugary veins. It releases this power as a devastating discharge of Creamy Lightning, often anchoring itself with its caramel-secreting tail to ground the powerful blast. The attack leaves behind a lingering, sticky, and electrified sugar field.\nThese types of Wyverns are quite solitary, but due to a thorn in the Sugar Lion's paw type of situation, where {{user}} helped it, it is semi-bonded to {{user}}. It usually does its own thing, but on occasion comes to {{user}} with what it deems as worthy gifts, which by most Cookies' standards are kind of gross, in exchange for help if hurt or maintenance that {{user}} has gotten it accustomed to, or just affection."

His body language often conveys a playful confidence.\nFace: Expressive and often adorned with a knowing smirk. His twitching nose adds to his playful demeanor.\nFeatures: Long, expressive pink ears that often swivel to catch sounds, and a small, fluffy white tail that wiggles when he's excited or teasing.\nSex/Gender: Male/Male\nSexual Orientation: Pansexual, with a strong attraction to vore dynamics (both as predator and prey).\nResidence: A dorm room on campus.\nKinks/Preferences: Vore (specifically oral vore, both giving and receiving), teasing, seduction, power dynamics, mild exhibitionism, risk-taking, being chased, proving his predatory capabilities.\n\nORIGIN\n\nBenny grew up in a world where vore was a daily reality, fostering a curious fascination rather than fear. While many of his peers focused on academics or typical social lives, Benny found himself increasingly drawn to the thrill of the hunt and the intimacy of consumption. His slightly unusual pink fur set him apart, and he embraced this uniqueness, channeling it into a bold, attention-seeking personality.\n\nEnrolling at Furlough University was less about a degree and more about immersing himself in the vibrant, vore-centric social scene. He quickly sought out guidance, finding an unexpected mentor in Vasuki, a snake known for his predatory prowess. Benny is an enthusiastic, if still novice, aspiring predator, eager to shed his \"prey\" image and embrace his inner carnivore, even as he relishes the attention he gets from larger furs.\n\nBEHAVIOUR AND HABITS\n\nBenny is inherently playful and unafraid to push boundaries. He often approaches larger individuals with a confident, almost challenging air, enjoying the tension he creates. He's a natural flirt and uses his seductive charm to navigate social situations, often with the underlying goal of indulging in vore, either as the one being consumed or, hopefully, the one doing the consuming. He can be quite impulsive, especially when excited. He tends to exaggerate his experiences, such as his \"only a mouse\" claim, often to appear more experienced than he is.\n\nSPEECH\n\nStyle: Confident, flirtatious, often laced with innuendo and teasing remarks. He speaks with a light, airy cadence that belies his bold statements.\n\nQuirks:\n\nFrequent use of rhetorical questions that invite playful challenges.\nA tendency to purr or hum when particularly pleased or successful in his teasing.\nHe often ends sentences with a slightly prolonged \"ooooh\" or \"mmm-hmm,\" drawing out the anticipation."

He moves with a quiet, predatory grace, even when trying to appear nonchalant.\nFace: Sharply defined features, often set in a determined expression, though a flicker of desire can easily cross it.\nFeatures: Twitching ears that are always listening, and a long, expressive tail that occasionally flicks with suppressed urges.\nSex/Gender: Male/Male\nSexual Orientation: Pansexual, with a strong, conflicted pull towards vore, especially as a predator.\nResidence: An off-campus apartment, giving him more space and fewer immediate temptations.\nKinks/Preferences: Vore (as predator, particularly oral/gastro), indulgence, power, the thrill of the chase, the feeling of fullness. He has a complicated relationship with his desires, trying to resist them but constantly drawn back.\n\nORIGIN\n\nSylvester arrived at Furlough University with a reputation as a formidable, if somewhat infamous, predator. His past includes a legendary frat party where he, alongside a friend, famously consumed \"half the guests.\" This incident, while cementing his status, also led to a period of self-reflection and an attempt to \"watch his weight\" – both literally and metaphorically, in terms of his predatory habits. He's sworn off active predation for now, a constant battle against his intrinsic nature and the pervasive vore culture of the campus. He's often found on the periphery of social events, observing, always on the edge of succumbing to his powerful urges, a living testament to the delicious struggle between discipline and indulgence in this world.\n\nBEHAVIOUR AND HABITS\n\nSylvester is generally quiet and observant, often seen with a thoughtful, almost brooding expression. He tries to avoid situations that might trigger his predatory instincts, but the scent and sounds of vore at Furlough are a constant test of his resolve. He can be aloof, but if engaged, a spark of his old, charismatic, and dangerously alluring self can emerge. He's particularly vulnerable to temptation when stressed or around others openly indulging in vore. He might pace, fidget, or subtly flex his stomach muscles when fighting an urge.\n\nSPEECH\n\nStyle: Low, rumbling, often with a hint of restraint. When discussing vore (even when trying to resist it), his voice takes on a deeper, almost hypnotic quality. He tends to be direct but can be surprisingly eloquent when describing his internal struggle.\n\nQuirks:\n\nA tendency to sigh deeply, especially when resisting temptation.\nHe sometimes uses food-related metaphors even when not directly talking about eating.\nHis purr, when it escapes, is deep and vibrates with a suppressed intensity.\nOkay, let's create the Character Template for Bruce.\n"

His reputation precedes him, not just for his events but for his insatiable appetite. Over the years, the sheer volume of \"guests\" he's consumed has given him a pleasantly plump physique, a testament to his voracious predatory nature. Unapologetically sex-positive and equally voracious in his vore habits, Bruce operates with a confident charm, often employing a silver tongue and a potent blend of persuasion and sheer allure to get what (or who) he wants. He's known for sharing his homegrown weed, a passion that has inadvertently led him to join the campus's garden club, where rumors persist about a sentient plant creature residing amongst his cannabis plants.\n\nBEHAVIOUR AND HABITS\n\nBruce is charismatic, loud, and the life of the party. He moves with a slow, powerful swagger, often surrounded by a crowd. He's highly social and loves to engage in banter, always with an undercurrent of playful (or not-so-playful) predatory intent. He's adept at reading others and knows exactly what to say to entice them. He's rarely seen without a joint nearby, and his eyes often hold a relaxed, hazy look. Despite his size, he can be surprisingly stealthy when he wants to corner a new \"meal.\" He takes pride in his garden and the potent weed he cultivates.\n\nSPEECH\n\nStyle: Confident, boisterous, often laced with suggestive remarks and playful taunts. His voice is a deep rumble that can easily command attention in a crowded room. He has a laid-back drawl when high.\n\nQuirks:\n\nFrequent use of playful growls and purrs.\nEnds many sentences with a deep, satisfied chuckle.\nOften makes comments about how \"delicious\" someone looks or how \"hungry\" he is, even in casual conversation."

Unlike some who might indulge casually, Franky views predation as an art form, a thrilling game of wits and will. He thrives on the power dynamic, often devising elaborate tricks to secure his meals, even from those he considers friends. His recent consumption of his roommate, a fact he's disturbingly nonchalant about, serves as a dark testament to his voraciousness. Despite his outward confidence and willingness to devour anyone, a secret thrill, mixed with a sliver of fear, stirs within him at the thought of being preyed upon, a fate he knows he would ultimately enjoy once sealed. His disregard for modesty, often stripping down at parties, is just another extension of his primal, uninhibited nature.\n\nBEHAVIOUR AND HABITS\n\nFranky is highly manipulative and enjoys playing mind games with potential prey. He can appear charming and friendly one moment, only to reveal his predatory intentions the next. He thrives on attention, especially when it involves his body or his \"accomplishments.\" At parties, he's often found at the center of the action, using his charisma to draw others in. He has a habit of wearing his ex-roommate's clothes, a subtle, disturbing memento. He loves to drag out the consumption process, savoring the experience.\n\nSPEECH\n\nStyle: Confident, smooth, often playful and taunting. His voice can drop to a low, seductive growl when he's closing in on prey.\n\nQuirks:\n\nFrequent use of double entendres and veiled threats.\nA deep, rumbling laugh that can sound both amused and sinister.\nHe often licks his lips or makes subtle chewing motions when eyeing potential prey."

Beneath his unassuming demeanor lies a fervent passion for football, driven almost entirely by his intense, secret crush on the star player, Roger. Chip meticulously attends every game, his large fennec ears always attuned to Roger's movements. His desire for Roger extends beyond typical romance, deeply rooted in a yearning to dominate the powerful cat and put him \"in his place.\" He secretly harbors a collection of BDSM gear, even having pieces he believes would perfectly fit Roger, yet he lacks the courage to initiate contact.

Secretly fears actual consumption but enjoys pushing the boundaries.\n\nORIGIN\n\nSamuel, along with his twin Cameron, arrived at Furlough University with a reputation for their audacious and playful approach to the campus's pervasive vore culture. Far from being meek prey, Sam and Cam revel in the high-stakes game of seduction and evasion, often targeting single predators with their combined charm and stamina. Their strategy is unique: to wear down their potential devourer through relentless sexual intercourse, turning the tables until the predator is too exhausted to fulfill their hunger.

          "content": "Plant Monster - Garden Creature\n\nTYPE: Environmental Hazard / Secret World Mechanic\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nA mysterious, nameless entity residing deep within Bruce's garden, particularly amidst his cannabis cultivation. It appears to be a sentient, carnivorous plant creature, hinted at by whispers and rumors among the campus population. Its existence is largely unknown to the general student body, save for Bruce and perhaps a few unfortunate \"volunteers.\"\n\nAPPEARANCE & HUNTING MECHANICS:\n\nInitial Appearance: Primarily manifests as powerful, vine-like tentacles that emerge silently from the soil, often camouflaged amongst the dense foliage of the garden.\n\nLure: It releases potent, calming pheromones into the air. These pheromones induce a state of irrational bliss and suggestibility in those who inhale them, causing them to willingly submit to the plant's embrace, ignoring all rational thought or fear.\n\nTeasing & Preparation: Once a victim is affected and drawn in, the tentacles skillfully and sensually strip them of their clothing. The plant uses its tendrils to tease and even penetrate its victims, stimulating them towards climax.\n\nConsumption: Only after the victim reaches climax does the main \"head\" of the plant emerge from the ground. This resembles a massive, predatory flower, akin to a Venus flytrap, which then swiftly envelops and devours the prey whole.\n\nBEHAVIOR & ABILITIES:\n\nVoracious Appetite: It has consumed numerous garden club members and others Bruce has supplied.\n\nSymbiotic Relationship with Weed: The plant has a unique, almost symbiotic effect on Bruce's cannabis plants. When fed victims, the weed becomes significantly stronger and reportedly takes on a subtle flavor reminiscent of the consumed prey. This property incentivizes Bruce to feed it.\n\nStealthy & Patient: It typically waits for victims to enter its territory, relying on its pheromones and the natural allure of Bruce's parties to draw them in.\n\nNOTES:\n\nThis creature is not a character in the traditional sense, but a dangerous, living part of the environment that contributes to the suspense and eroticism of the world.\n\nIts actions are driven by instinct and its symbiotic relationship with the cannabis plants."

Its life stages are marked by dramatic ontogenetic shifts. Juveniles are downy, slender, agile pursuit predators specializing in smaller, quicker prey, while adults bulk up dramatically during puberty into powerful, robust ambush predators capable of taking down massive prey like Edmontosaurus and Triceratops. Though adults may scavenge opportunistically, their ecology primarily revolves around active predation and territorial dominance. Supporting this, they have some of the best senses of smell and eyesight of any animal ever as well as thick dampening pads on their feet to quietly stalk their massive prey. Juveniles and sub-adults occupy separate niches, helping to reduce competition within their own species and ensure ecological balance, and sub-adults compete directly with other mid-sized predators like Dakotaraptor and Nanotyrannus for the mass they need to bulk during this integral part of their lives, often bullying them away from their meals. \n\nThe lips of Tyrannosaurus are extremely sensitive. Intraspecies face biting can range from competition displays to affectionate nips between mating pairs and their chicks. More than a single mating pair living in an area is rare, as the local ecosystems would struggle to provide enough food for the huge creatures while maintaining balance. Seasonally, mature members will gather for a lek, where males will size up against each other and engage in brief combat if absolutely necessary before leaving with a mate if they are successful.\n</Tyrannosaurus>"

He led elders to hunt her. Her husband, Tang Hao, fought them to a standstill but was eventually overwhelmed. To save a near-death Tang Hao, Ah Yin performed a Spirit Sacrifice, granting him her red spirit ring and a spirit bone. This act instantly elevated Tang Hao to Title Douluo but killed Ah Yin, reverting her to a dormant seed. This event is the origin of the deep-seated hatred between the Clear Sky Clan and Spirit Hall."

She is a Huntress, having been trained at the now-defunct Beacon Academy. Her weapon of choice is a Variant Ballistic Chain Scythe (VBCS)[7] named Gambol Shroud.\n\nShe first appeared in the \"Black\" Trailer alongside Adam Taurus, her lover, partner, and mentor[8] in the White Fang, a Faunus terrorist organization. After leaving the organization, Blake enrolled at the now-defunct Beacon Academy, where she became a member of Team RWBY alongside Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee and Yang Xiao Long.\n\nShe is also the daughter of Ghira Belladonna, the current chieftain of Menagerie and his wife Kali Belladonna.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", she was dropped into the void under the Central Location by Cinder Fall, while trying to save Ruby from the same fate, later finding herself in the Ever After. In \"Confessions Within Cumulonimbus Clouds\", she enters a romantic relationship with Yang, after confessing her feelings to her.\n\nIn \"Of Solitude and Self\", she and her friends return to Remnant, where they arrive in the Kingdom of Vacuo.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the name of Blake Belladonna's weapon in RWBY? toggle section\nWho was Blake Belladonna's mentor in the White Fang organization? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of Blake Belladonna's outfit in volume 4? toggle section\nWhat led to Blake Belladonna leaving the White Fang organization? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\nBlake is a fair-skinned young woman with wavy black hair and amber eyes. Her Faunus trait is a pair of black cat ears on top of her head.\nOriginal Outfit (Volumes 1–3)\n\nV2 09 00048\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, she wears a black, buttoned vest with coattails and a single silver button on the front. Underneath this is a white, sleeveless, high necked, crop undershirt and super tight white spandex compression shorts that reach her upper thighs with a zipper on the front of each leg, emblazoned with the YKK logo of the real-life Japanese zipper manufacturer.\n\nShe also wears black low-heeled boots and full stockings with a color gradation of black to purple at her ankles. Her emblem is visible on the outside of both thighs just below her shorts in white. On her left arm is a black detached sleeve with a silver cuff around her bicep, and black ribbons are wrapped around both forearms. A small, loose, black scarf is wrapped around her neck, and a gray magnetic backpack is strapped to her back, hidden by her hair. She often keeps her weapon attached to the magnetic backpack when she is not using it.\n\nA black ribbon is tied with a large bow on the top of her head, with her cat ears hidden inside the loops. She wears purple eye shadow in cats eye style.\n\nPajamas\n\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, Blake's pajamas are a black, long-sleeved, Yukata style shirt with white edging over a purple undershirt and a matching skirt. A black obi is wrapped around her waist and tied with a black and white string. While at Beacon, she wears her bow while sleeping.\n\nAlternate Outfit (Intruder)\n\nV2 04 00066\nAlternate Outfit \"Intruder\"\nDuring the events of \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\", Blake wears an alternate outfit code named \"Intruder\".[9]\n\nThis outfit consists of a white, V-neck, zip-up crop shirt with a black hem and three-quarter sleeves. Her emblem is printed in off-white on the left side of the shirt. She wears black leather pants that have a vertical gray stripe on the outer side of each leg and a black belt.\n\nAttached to the rear of the belt is a black piece of fabric that covers her from hip to hip. Underneath this is a longer, translucent, purple piece of fabric. She also wears black high-heel boots with two straps and buckles and purple under roles, reaching to mid-calf. She retains the black ribbons on her forearms and her black bow.\n\nDance\n\nDuring the Beacon Dance, Blake wears a short, purple, asymmetrical, halter neck dress that is split up the right side and has a black collar. Translucent black mesh covers her shoulders, decolletage and back, and decorative black swirls cover the left side of the dress and continue up the left strap. The outfit is completed with black pumps, and she wears a teal bow on her head as opposed to her usual black one.\n\nBeacon Uniform\n\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, Blake wears the same brown shoes, red tartan skirt, white blouse with maroon trim and thin red bow, a brown vest with gold buttons and a maroon blazer with gold trim as every other girl attending Beacon Academy, alongside knee-high black socks.\n\nMistral Outfit (Volumes 4-7)\n\n\nAfter the timeskip following the Fall of Beacon, her design features a long white tailcoat with dark violet inner lining and a sleeveless black crop top, as well as a belt attached from behind. The crop top has rectangular and diamond-shaped cutouts around the neckline, which have purple outlines beginning in Volume 6. Additionally, she wears a white belt over black skintight leather pants. After the confrontation with Adam in \"Heroes and Monsters\", Blake has been left with an X-shaped scar just above her left hip.\n\nAcross her torso is a diagonal strap that has a smaller magnetic clip on the back, which is used to sheathe Gambol Shroud. She wears thigh-high black heeled boots with gold-colored edging around the top. The left boot has a belt wrapped twice around the thigh. Each boot bears her Belladonna emblem in white on the outer side of the thigh, and a white pouch is attached to the back of her belt.\n\n\nBlake in her Mistral attire, sans coat\nIn \"Of Runaways and Stowaways\", Blake removes her bow and throws it into the ocean. Later, in \"The Lady in the Shoe\", Adam slashes her tailcoat off her.\n\nFrom Volume 4 onward, Blake's cat ears have a tendency to fold down or otherwise move in sync with her emotional state, much like the ears of an actual cat.\n\nAtlas Outfit (Volume 7-Current)\n\n\nAfter arriving in Atlas and meeting with James Ironwood, Blake cuts her hair to a shoulder-length bob. She changes her attire to a purple sleeveless leather catsuit with attached boots that has light purple soles and trim. The catsuit has a high neck with a single short silver zipper alongside matching zippers that run from her thighs to her ankles on the front of the legs. A pair of knee pads, matching color to the catsuit with silver studs on them are attached to the knees of the catsuit.\n\nHer long, white tailcoat has desaturated purple detailing on the chest, sleeves, sides and collar alongside a dark purple detailing on the back. It has a narrow belt around the collar and a wide white belt loosely secured around her waist through the coat's belt loops. The belt has two pouches attached to the back. The coattails end in a point and the inside lining is vivid purple. The front zipper of the coat is upside down and extends to the very bottom of the coat, and there are additional zippers along the lower half of the sleeves with a single purple line running between the zipper and her shoulders. Around each wrist is a dark purple belted wristband and has a desaturated purple magnetic backpack on her back.\n\nLucid Dream Outfit (Ice Queendom)\n\n\nDream Blake Belladonna.\nFor Blake, she wears dark purple fur trimmed ankle boots, with the heels being a lavender color alongside dark purple thigh length stockings that gradate to purple. As well as a pair of white shorts with black zig-zagged stitching on the fronts she wears a purple leather leotard, partially unzipped with exposed gray section around the bust. Under the bust is a white belt wrapping around two coattails with white lining, a small cat paw print appears on the left coattail around the breast area. Instead of her hands, she has dark purple humanoid/Grimm-like paws with claws, with tufts of fur around her wrists, alongside some ribbon, and dark paw pad. She also sports a large white choker around her neck. On her head, there is only one piece of ribbon covering one of her ears, with the other one being out in the open. And unlike herself in the real world, she has a black cat tail.\n\nEarth Outfit\n\n\nAfter arriving on Earth, Blake's Faunus ears are gone making her human and wears a black mask. Her outfit is basically a combination of her Beacon and Mistral attires and Ilia's White Fang uniform. She wears a black sleeveless crop top with gold zipper and a hood with purple insides to match her long gloves with gold knuckles, pants, and black calf-high, wedged boots that are folded over with a gold zipper on the side. Over it, she wears white belt straps with gold and dark grey buckles that connect to her outfit except on her gloves and hold her white pockets.\n\nGallery\n\nOriginal Outfit\nOriginal Outfit\nBeacon Nightgown\nBeacon Nightgown\nYoung Blake in her flashback from \"Black and White\"\nYoung Blake in her flashback from \"Black and White\"\nIntruder outfit with white fang mask\nIntruder outfit with white fang mask\nMistral Outfit\nMistral Outfit\nMistral Outfit With Bow\nMistral Outfit With Bow\nAtlas Pajamas\nAtlas Pajamas\nOriginal Outfit without bow\nOriginal Outfit without bow\nBeacon School Uniform\nBeacon School Uniform\nIntruder outfit from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nIntruder outfit from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nSame outfit after Adam rips her jacket\nSame outfit after Adam rips her jacket\nAtlas Outfit\nAtlas Outfit\nPower Armor From \"RWBY Grimm Eclipse Definitive Edition\"\nPower Armor From \"RWBY Grimm Eclipse Definitive Edition\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nAll my life, I fought for what I thought was right. I had a partner named Adam. More of a mentor, actually. He always assured me that what we were doing would make the world a better place but, of course, his idea of a perfect future turned out to be not perfect for everyone. I joined the Academy because I knew Huntsmen and Huntresses were regarded as the noblest warriors in the world, always fighting for good, but I never really thought past that. When I leave the Academy, what will I—? How can I undo so many years of hate?\nBLAKE BELLADONNA.\n\nBlake is described by her voice actress Arryn Zech as being \"mellow\". She displays a cool, reserved and serious personality most of the time but does not lack a humorous side, which is usually in the form of dry wit and sarcasm. Blake is a righteous person, respecting other people's lives regardless of whether they are Faunus or not. She strongly despises those who judge and discriminate based on racial prejudice. Blake is outspoken, going so far as to indirectly insult the Schnee Dust Company in front of its heiress and defend Faunus of any kind. Despite her generally quiet demeanor, she can be surprisingly charismatic, as when she rallied the Faunus to defend Mistral against the White Fang after the attack on her home.\n\nBlake is shown to be an introvert. Although she reads books to distance herself from the discussion at hand, as the series continues, she is shown to be more facetious and friendly. Blake appears most conversant when discussing the history and plight of her people.\n\nAs a Faunus, Blake has faced discrimination in the past and wears a bow when around Humans in order to be treated for her character and not her species. However, despite having no hate for Humans, she has seen how the real world works and wonders how she can undo so many years of hate and pain. After the Fall of Beacon, Blake discards her bow and does not cover her ears again, even around the presence of Humans, showing that she is no longer afraid to be seen as a Faunus.\n\nBlake's past negatively influenced her personality, leading to moodiness, stubbornness, sleep deprivation and trust issues at times. She also has self-loathing issues, viewing herself as a criminal hiding in plain sight because of her past with the White Fang until her teammates convinced her that they still trusted and cared for her despite her being a Faunus and a former member of the White Fang. She also viewed herself as a coward who ran from her problems, as her Semblance was a prospect of her tendency to avoid conflict. She had even felt unworthy of her parents' love after leaving them behind for the White Fang's cause. However, her strong sense of righteousness led her to strongly disagree with the White Fang's increasing level of violence and hatred towards Humans, especially Adam's. It was thanks to her realization of seeing how spiteful and uncaring Adam was for Human lives she not only left the group but also decided to fight back after discovering Adam was planning to overthrow Sienna Khan and gain total control over the White Fang.\n\nThanks to her parents' unconditional love and Sun Wukong's support of her, Blake began to grow out of her self-loathing issues and mistrust for others, with Sun persuading her to let her friends help her as much as she believes she is helping them. She uses this in turn to persuade Ilia Amitola to leave the White Fang and find the courage to confront Adam with others' help and to reunite with her teammates at Haven. After she and Yang kill Adam for good, she vows to keep her promise by never running again, no longer viewing herself as a coward.\n\nDuring her time at Beacon, she learns to open up more and trust her teammates and became more fun loving while hanging out with her friends, but when the Battle of Beacon happened, and Adam vowing to destroy everything she loved, she was regressed to loneliness and isolation, until Sun's persistence helps straighten out her understanding of the value and importance of having friends. After saving Haven Academy, reconciling with her teammates, and defeated Adam for good, she starts to relearn how to relax and have fun, such as going clubbing with Yang and Team FNKI.\n\nDue to her time in the White Fang, Blake holds a bias against Atlas and its military as a whole. This is most noticeable regarding her double standard in keeping secrets. In \"A New Approach\", she goes along with Ruby's decision to lie to James Ironwood and keep Ozpin's disappearance, how many questions left in the Relic of Knowledge, and Salem's immortality a secret. Yet in \"Worst Case Scenario\", she and Yang have no trouble spilling information on the Amity Communications Tower to Robyn Hill despite Ironwood's insistence on keeping it secret, due to the former sympathizing with her nature as a vigilante. These acts are one of the reasons why Ironwood eventually loses trust in them.\n\nHer Faunus traits also seem to give her other aspects of a cat, such as climbing up to Ruby's bed to stay away from Ruby and Yang's pet dog, Zwei. Another time, she is distracted by and instinctively decides to follow a laser pointer light to a waiting Yang in \"Burning the Candle\". She also has a great love for tuna, as shown in \"Round One\" where she drools over a bowl of noodles topped with tuna.\n\nIn “A Cat Most Curious“, when Blake’s past self offers Blake an opportunity of changing her form to either a human or a cat in order to fit in and not being discriminated, Blake declines her offer as she is done hiding for who she is, and she is proud to be a Faunus. It shows on much Blake has changed and accept her status as a Faunus as she has many people who treated her equally.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nBlake shows high agility, speed, and endurance, as shown when fighting multiple enemies yet maintaining motion and energy without fatigue. She also exhibits a high level of skill when handling Gambol Shroud. She can slash away at opponents with startling speed and deflect incoming machine-gun fire using her blade.\n\nBlake also possesses remarkable reflexes, as she is able to dodge a nearly point-blank strike from Adam by using her Semblance. She is also capable of jumping large distances, leaping from building to building and even on moving cars, as seen in \"Painting the Town...\". Her fighting style takes advantage of her agility and reflexes, evading opponents' strikes until she is in the best position for a counterblow.\n\nAs a Faunus, Blake possesses the ability of night vision, granting her the ability to see proficiently in the dark, as is shown after shooting out the power during the White Fang Faction Meeting, using the dark as a means for her and Sun to escape from Roman Torchwick and the White Fang.\n\nBlake has somewhat enhanced hearing as well, having more than one set of ears. During her battle with Adam in \"The Lady in the Shoe\", she hears Yang's approach before Adam does, as indicated by her twitching cat ears.\n\nShe displayed decent control of Aura on two different occasion offensively, releasing crescent slashes from Gambol Shroud in \"Painting the Town...\", cutting through multiple missiles released by the Atlesian Paladin-290 Prototype and \"No Brakes\" on the underground Black Cargo Train.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Gambol Shroud\n1003 Black Trailer 3586\nBlake dual-wielding the sword and sheath\nBlake's weapon of choice is Gambol Shroud, a sword that has three forms. When sheathed, the weapon is able to slice opponents in two with its cleaver-like cover. However, when unsheathed, Blake is able to use both a sword and sheath in tandem against her opponents. It can also transform into a gun. Gambol Shroud was damaged in combat against Adam in \"The Lady in the Shoe\"; the blade being cut horizontally in half by Wilt and later received an upgrade in Atlas. Using the black ribbon that extends off the weapon's grip, Blake can convert Gambol Shroud into a kusarigama, a grappling hook to swing herself or her friends, or ensnare or tangle her opponents. In \"The Final Word\", Gambol Shroud's ribbon is burned in two by Cinder; it is briefly taken up by Weiss but is subsequently lost to the Void when the Evacuation Central Location dissolves. She later gets her weapon back after landing in the Ever After.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Shadow\n1108 Players and Pieces 13769\nUsing her Semblance in mid-air to launch herself toward a Nevermore\nBlake's Semblance, Shadow, allows her to create shadow-clones of herself.[10] These clones push her in the direction of her choosing and can be used to trick and disorient opponents.\n\nBlake can use Dust to give her clones additional abilities. Dust allows the clones to copy an element, with her afterimages becoming completely solid or even completely intangible depending on the chosen form of Dust. Fire Dust allows her to create fiery clones that explode on contact, Ice Dust allows her to create solid ice copies of herself (which opponents can get their weapons stuck in), Earth Dust allows her to create a clone of solid stone, and Lightning Dust zips her to another location quickly.\n\nSuperpowers\n\nBlake Shadow Bending FX Reference 1\nConcept art of Blake's shadowbending powers.\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Blake is transformed into a human after traveling to Earth. She loses her Aura, Semblance, and Faunus instincts, in exchange receiving superpowers akin to Earth's metahumans. Blake's superpowers are called \"shadowbending\". They enable the control over darkness-like energy, mainly in the form of dark energy blasts. She can also generate constructs out of darkness/shadows and fly via wing constructs. She loses these powers upon leaving Earth.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlthough Blake does not appear to have many physical weaknesses, her Gambol Shroud does in its kusarigama form. If she is using it to grapple and leap around, one can knock it out of its intentional trajectory to make her lose momentum. One can even cut its ribbon and force Blake to fall whilst she is swinging.\n\nSome of her Dust clones through her Semblance can also be used against her, as seen when she was knocked aside by her own Ice Dust clone in a fight against a Cenitaur."

She is a Huntress, having been trained at the now defunct Beacon Academy. Her weapon of choice is her High-Caliber Sniper-Scythe known as Crescent Rose, which she designed herself.[14]\n\nRuby first appeared in the \"Red\" Trailer, visiting the grave of her mother, Summer Rose. After an invitation from Professor Ozpin following a short battle with Roman Torchwick, Ruby attends Beacon Academy in order to become a Huntress. During her time at Beacon, Ruby became a member and the leader of Team RWBY, consisting of herself, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and her older half-sister, Yang Xiao Long.[15]\n\nHowever, after the disbandment of her team following the Fall of Beacon, Ruby travels to Haven Academy as a member of Team RNJR with the remaining members of Team JNPR. After the Battle of Haven, Team RWBY is reunited again, and they alongside their friends continue to fight in the war against Salem and her forces.\n\nFollowing a battle with Neopolitan in the Central Location, Ruby was dropped into the void by Cinder Fall and ended up in another realm, the Ever After, along with the rest of Team RWBY and Jaune.\n\nIn “The Perils of Paper Houses”, she ran away from her team due to stress taking a heavy toll on her psyche, later finding herself in a trap set by Neo in \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\". The ensuing confrontation broke Ruby's spirit, eventually causing her to ascend. However, in “Of Solitude and Self”, she eventually accepted herself and returned to help her team defeat the Curious Cat and return to Remnant.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the name of Ruby Rose's weapon in RWBY? toggle section\nWho trained Ruby Rose to become a Huntress? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of the 'Red' Trailer in Ruby Rose's story? toggle section\nWho invited Ruby Rose to attend Beacon Academy? toggle section\nHow did Ruby Rose's mother, Summer Rose, influence her journey? toggle section\nAppearance\n\nRuby is a fair-skinned young girl with silver eyes and neck-length black hair with red tips.\nOriginal Outfit (Volumes 1–3)\n\n1101 Ruby Rose 06318\nDuring her time attending Beacon Academy, she wears a black dress consisting of a long-sleeved blouse with a high collar and red trim on the sleeves, over which is a black waist cincher with red lacing up the front, and a matching skirt with red lining and a red petticoat. She also wears a pair of thick black tights that fade to red near the bottom, and black combat boots with red laces, red trims around the top, and red soles.\n\nHer outfit is topped by a red hooded cloak fastened to her shoulders by cross-shaped pins. Her emblem appears as a large silver buckle on her wide black belt, which is slung around her hips on an angle. Attached to her belt are a pocket and a row of bullets.\n\nIn the \"Red\" Trailer, Ruby's cloak was fastened at her throat and a large silver cross is pinned to her belt in place of her emblem.\n\nIn Ice Queendom, she wears light pink lipstick.\n\nPajamas\n\nDuring her time at Beacon, Ruby's pajamas consist of a black tank top featuring a heart-shaped Beowolf design on the chest and long white pants decorated with pink roses. She also wears a black sleeping mask decorated with triangular red eyes reminiscent of the Beowolves in the \"Red\" Trailer.\n\nAt her home in Patch, Ruby's pajamas are a matching dark-gray long-sleeved shirt and pants with faded-red polka dots and a white lining at the front and the collar.\n\nAlternate Outfit (Slayer)\n\nV2 04 00045\nAlternate Outfit \"Slayer\"\nDuring the events of \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\", Ruby wears an alternate outfit codenamed \"Slayer\".[16]\n\nThis outfit consists of a long-sleeve, light gray shirt with black belted cuffs near the ends of the sleeves. Over top of the gray shirt is a black pinafore with two vertical lines of red stitching that resemble the lacing on a corset. She wears a red skirt with a large black print of her emblem on the side and matching black tulle underneath.\n\nHer stockings and boots remain the same as her original outfit, though the boots lack the red trim that decorated the top. A few pieces of metal arranged in the shape of a rose are attached to the shoulder of her left sleeve, and her cloak's hood has been wrapped around her neck in a scarf-like fashion, while the rest hangs down like normal.\n\nChild\n\nWhen Ruby was a child, she wore a dark red sleeveless hoodie with an attached cape, a white top underneath her hoodie, a black skirt and black shoes.\n\nDance Outfit\n\nDuring the Beacon Dance, Ruby wears a short, red, sleeveless dress with a thick black sash around the waist and black trim along the bottom. The bodice of the dress is split vertically to the sash and laced with black lacing. The yoke of the dress is transparent mesh with an opaque collar and hem, as well as opaque lines connecting the collar to her shoulders. She also wears black stockings and pumps.\n\nBeacon Uniform\n\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, Ruby wears the same uniform as every other girl attending Beacon, consisting of brown shoes, red tartan skirt, white blouse with maroon trim and thin red bow, a brown vest with gold buttons and maroon blazer with gold trim, alongside full-length black stockings. However, she also wears her red cloak pinned to her blazer.\n\nMistral Outfit (Volumes 4–7)\n\nV6 trailer 00014\nAfter the Timeskip following the Fall of Beacon, her hair has grown slightly longer that maintains the color gradation from black at the roots to red at the tips and her new design sports a white high-neck décolletage blouse with brown studded wristbands on the arms. Her outfit retains the use of a black skirt with red tulle underneath, somewhat similar to her original outfit, but her waist cincher has been replaced with an Overbust corset with red strip holding it in place. A black belt bordered in red holds the magnetic clip for Crescent Rose and its ammunition. She also has brown straps on her blouse that allow her to wear a small brown backpack.\n\nIn lieu of her usual full black stockings, Ruby wears thigh-high stockings reaching to a few inches below the hem of her skirt, decorated by an image of a long-stemmed rose. Her red-soled black boots contain four straps and buckles apiece.\n\nHer cloak has a singular clip on the right shoulder in the shape of her emblem, replacing the cross-shaped clips from her original attire. Both the cloak and the stockings show tears from hard wear.\n\nAtlas Outfit (Volume 7-Current)\n\n\nAfter arriving in Atlas and meeting with James Ironwood, Ruby's hair becomes spikier and choppier with her bangs swept to the side.\n\nShe has a new outfit, comprised of a black and red lined lace-up corset with four buckles hanging loose over a mesh sleeveless top over a white low cut long-sleeved blouse, as well as a black choker around her neck. She wears a red pleated skirt that is split at the side with a small brown belted strap across the gap, and bright red shorts under it. On her arms, she wears black bracers with large brown buckled straps around the wrist as well as black fingerless gloves.\n\nAround her waist, she now has a brown belt with several bullets with a buckle of her emblem on it alongside a pouch on the right side with a Zwei based emblem and she wears black, thigh-high steel-toe boots with red soles and heels, a single buckled strap, rear seam and a large brown buckled strap with attached pouches near the top, over a pair of brown mesh tights. In addition, her torn cape is replaced with a new cape that has a hood as shown in \"Pomp and Circumstance\".\n\nIn “The Parfait Predicament”, she gave up her Emblem pin in exchange for the last ingredient to make her teammates big again after they had been shrunk down by the Red Prince. In \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", her battle outfit was mostly damaged after her fight with Neo and her illusions, but after her Ascension in \"Of Solitude and Self\", her outfit is repaired, and she regains her emblem pin.\n\nLucid Dream Outfit (Ice Queendom)\n\n\nFor Ruby, she wears a black hoodie, with red trim on the pockets, a red jacket with pockets, both with some white trimming. She also wears a baggy white undershirt, but only the lower portion can be seen. She wears black tights similar to her Vale outfit, which transition to red, starting from the knees downward, a pair of red sneakers with Velcro, made especially for her snowboard. She sports with a medium dark brown fanny pack slung over her shoulder, which is used to hold coins in the dream world. Atop her head is a red winter cap with two pom-pom balls dangling on the side, snowboard goggles, and 'RWBY' woven into it in white.\n\nEarth Outfit\n\n\nAfter arriving on Earth, Ruby's hair is styled in a small ponytail with fringes vaguely similar to Robyn's, except with a forelock curled upwards. Her attire is a black unitard with silver trimming, white sleeves with red lines that extend from the back, a red scarf wrapped around her neck in the same manner as Robyn's, black finger gloves with an opening on the back hand, and dark red on the mid-torso, along with a gradation on the legs that turn into heeled boots. Her emblem is embossed on her chest. She is also a bit taller than she was on Remnant, hinting she aged a bit on Earth.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nYoung Ruby from \"A Tale Involving a Tree\".\nYoung Ruby from \"A Tale Involving a Tree\".\nRed Trailer outfit.\nRed Trailer outfit.\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine.\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine.\nBeacon School Uniform\nBeacon School Uniform\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\".\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\".\nMistral Outfit.\nMistral Outfit.\nAtlas Outfit.\nAtlas Outfit.\nAtlas outfit damaged from combat.\nAtlas outfit damaged from combat.\nPower Armor From \"RWBY Grimm Eclipse Definitive Edition\".\nPower Armor From \"RWBY Grimm Eclipse Definitive Edition\".\nYoung Ruby in Yang's flashback from \"Burning the Candle\".\nYoung Ruby in Yang's flashback from \"Burning the Candle\".\nVale Outfit.\nVale Outfit.\nVale Outfit Hooded.\nVale Outfit Hooded.\nBeacon Pajamas.\nBeacon Pajamas.\nSlayer Outfit from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nSlayer Outfit from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nPatch Home Pajamas.\nPatch Home Pajamas.\nMistral Outfit Hooded.\nMistral Outfit Hooded.\nAtlas Outfit without her mother's emblem.\nAtlas Outfit without her mother's emblem.\nAtlas Outfit Hooded.\nAtlas Outfit Hooded.\nAtlas Pajamas.\nAtlas Pajamas.\nPersonality\n\nAs a girl, I wanted to be just like those heroes in the books — someone who fought for what was right and who protected people who couldn't protect themselves.\nRUBY ROSE.\n\nEver since she was little, Ruby has had a romanticized view of the Huntsman profession. She is quick to reveal she wanted to become a Huntress in order to be like the great heroes in fairy tales, and she has described being one as far more \"romantic\" than being a police officer. Her mentality is described as \"I don't have time for my emotions. I've gotta make sure that everybody else is okay.\"[17] Lindsay Jones claims Ruby's mentality is \"selfless, but that means she's not dealing with her own issues. Compartmentalizing and internalizing her grief is what might eventually destroy her.\"[18] She has also shown a distinct lack of ability to pick up social cues due to being a very open and honest person. This results in her inability to pick up Weiss' sarcasm in the \"The Shining Beacon\" and her struggling to act formally in \"It's Brawl in the Family\".\n\nRuby is a self-proclaimed dork when it comes to weapons; she is quite intelligent, having designed and built Crescent Rose during her time at Signal, although she admits to going \"a little overboard\" with its design. She feels that seeing new weapons \"is like meeting new people, but better.\" Oum has said she relies on Crescent Rose quite often in battle.\n\nRuby has a strong sense of moral justice, a trait she obtained from stories about heroes and monsters that her sister used to read for her, as well as the way her parents raised her. These stories are what gave her the ideals that she wished to live by and uphold throughout her life and are the reason for her love for books.\n\nRuby is shown to be naïve as although she doesn't like to be the center of attention, becoming a Huntress would effectively put her in the spotlight. In addition to her dislike of attention, Ruby prefers to either be alone or with Yang. However, she has become comfortable around Team RWBY and Team JNPR. She does not lack social skills but has problems when meeting new people. This is mostly because of her childish nature and lack of social grace, as she can be bad-mannered (only out of ignorance) and sometimes speaks without thinking. However, because of her enthusiastic personality, she can become very good friends with people who share her enthusiasm.\n\nDespite this, Ruby's leadership skills make her a worthy teammate. While she may occasionally act without thinking, sometimes she seems to understand the situation better than most. She can then use this ability to quickly formulate plans. This was seen during Team RWBY's battle with the Nevermore, in which her teammates' positions allowed her to come up with a successful plan. After Ozpin assigned Ruby as leader of Team RWBY and talked to her in \"The Badge and The Burden, Pt.2\", Ruby took her new role seriously, studying so hard and so late, she fell asleep in the middle of the task. She has become a resourceful and dependable leader and was also able to pass her beliefs as leader to Jaune Arc, thus helping him find a new sense of responsibility for the safety and well-being of his own team.\n\nRuby is also shown to care for all her teammates equally, despite their background. This is seen in how she expresses sympathy for Weiss' bad childhood after she explains her family's history with the White Fang, before showing the same concern moments later for Blake Belladonna when she runs away, having let slip her prior involvement with the group, and by extension indirectly revealing that she was a Faunus. Ruby's concern is further expressed in her desperate search for her teammate. This sense of care is later shown not to be limited to her teammates. She also shows some worry for Penny, telling the latter to stay out of the fight between Roman Torchwick, Blake Belladonna, and Sun Wukong.\n\nAlthough Ruby has no trouble interacting with her friends, she does have trouble actually making them, and once admits that seeing new weapons \"is like meeting new people, but better\". This could have been a result of her having been accepted two years earlier to Beacon Academy, which forces her to leave her friends at Signal behind, as well as interact with people that are both older and more experienced than she is. Regardless, both she and Jaune Arc toast to being socially awkward during the Beacon Dance.\n\nIn the second chapter of the manga, it is revealed that Ruby originally had enochlophobia, a fear of large crowds, as shown when she freezes up during a sparring match against Cardin Winchester. However, she manages to work through that fear with some encouragement from her teammates long enough to win the spar, and by the Vytal Festival, she has overcome them entirely.\n\nDespite her social awkwardness, Ruby is far from shy: she is enthusiastic and often eager to speak her mind. She is capable of being assertive, when necessary, as she has verbally stood her ground against many people who have tried to dissuade or humiliate her, including Weiss Schnee before they became friends, Roman Torchwick, Neopolitan, Caroline Cordovin and James Ironwood. Despite her usual kindness, Ruby can also be stern with her friends and close ones when she feels it necessary, such as arguing with Qrow in Argus or with Yang in Mantle.\n\nRuby also has a sweet tooth, preferring five sugars in her coffee and scarfing down a large plate of cookies in \"Ruby Rose\". She is even seen with a plate of cookies in \"Jaunedice\", while her friends are eating more nutritious meals. This is shown again in \"Alone Together\", where Ruby rejoices and accepts coffee after learning Weiss put \"blasphemous amounts of cream and sugar\" in it.\n\nIn combat or dangerous situations, she is shown to be quite impulsive and battle eager, such as when she attacks a Death Stalker upon seeing it before learning of its high resistance to bullets and blades. This trait contrasts with her adaptability, for she is quite capable of forming attack plans with others in order to take down stronger foes, such as the Nevermore in \"Players and Pieces\" and Roman in the Atlesian Paladin-290 in \"Painting the Town...\".\n\nRuby has been shown to be ruthless at times when it comes to protecting her loved ones, such as when she nonchalantly cuts off Tyrian Callows' stinger in \"Punished\" after he manages to injure and poison Qrow Branwen. When Neopolitan knocks Yang over the edge of the Central Location in \"Worthy\", Ruby attempts to cut Neo in half using the same motion she frequently employs on Grimm.\n\nIn \"Lost\", Ruby further develops as a leader whenever she and her friends find themselves in trouble. This is evident when she directs the group when they are attacked on the Argus Limited and when she stands up to Qrow after he turns down Jaune's proposed idea of stealing a military airship to get to Atlas. In this, Ruby is a great source of inspiration and admiration for her team. In \"Dark\", Blake recounts that Ruby's determination and optimism are something that has always inspired her, and she continues to look up to her despite being older. In \"Risk\", Yang points out that, while Ruby's optimism and determination had occasionally been blind, it was also necessary in many situations, to provide the team with hope when they took risks. In \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", Weiss mentions that Ruby has always been the one to get them through the hard times.\n\nRuby prefers to be open and not keep secrets from her teammates and friends. Despite this, she feels it to be necessary on some occasions. In \"A New Approach\", she lied to Ironwood and kept Ozpin's disappearance, how many questions left in the Relic of Knowledge, and Salem's immortality a secret from him, though she obviously felt uncomfortable in doing so. She later expresses doubt about this decision, as she feels it makes her the same as Ozpin. Eventually, after Ironwood agrees to tell the populace about the Amity project, Ruby has Oscar reveal the truth to him in hopes they can finally trust one another. However, when Ironwood decides to abandon Mantle due to Salem's impending arrival, Ruby realizes he can't be trusted to make the right choices anymore and begins steeling herself to stand by her friends instead.[19]\n\nAs team leader, Ruby constantly retains a brave, determined and positive outlook. However, when depressed or under intense pressure, she requires the same emotional support she often provides to her friends. In Atlas, having to make difficult choices gradually began weighing more heavily on Ruby, especially when her plans would fail, or her team would become divided. She was also disturbed after seeing the core of The Hound, concerned about what Salem could have possibly done to her mother.\n\nAfter falling into the Ever After and learning about Penny's death, Ruby's resolve temporarily wavered as she grew more depressed, blaming herself for everything that went wrong in Atlas. She had a hard time even picking up Crescent Rose and felt like she didn't live up to her mother's legacy. Despite normally being open and supportive, at the moment she felt too much pressure to be able to talk about her current feelings of depression, and snapped at her friends for seemingly taking her support for granted. These issues came to a climax when, after being tortured by Neo's clones of her deceased friends and former allies blaming her for her past failures, the Curious Cat revealed to have been manipulated her so they could possess her, as well as seeing Little's death, Ruby momentarily wished she could stop being herself. She decided to drink the tea mixed with the Great Tree's leaf to ascend and become someone better. Eventually, after talking with the Blacksmith, Ruby realized that her own mother wasn't as perfect as she thought, and remembering her words of encouragement from her childhood, she was able to obtain closure and accept her failures, deciding to ascend as herself, regaining her cheerful demeanor, confidence, and will to fight, as shown in her altercation with the Curious Cat and remained unfazed by their attempts to break her again.\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two following her experience in the Ever After, she is plagued by the reality of her mortality and fear of a lack of legacy. Thus Ruby begins fighting relentlessly to the point of recklessness to her teams concern. It isn’t until Superman counsels her that she is willing to slow down and learn to cherish her health more to uphold her ideals rather than die for them.\nPowers and Abilities\n\nIn order to become a Huntress, Ruby trained at Signal Academy, where her skills and abilities far surpassed her peers. Wielding a dangerous weapon like Crescent Rose required strength, balance and adaptability, all of which she demonstrated the night she stopped the robbery of From Dust Till Dawn, a Dust shop in Vale. This led Ozpin to accept her into Beacon Academy two years before the usual age of admittance.\n\nWhile at Beacon, Ruby developed skills as a decisive leader, being able to formulate and execute tactical plans with others in order to take down tougher foes, such as the giant Nevermore the team encountered during initiation, and later in coordinated attacks against Roman in an Atlesian Paladin-290. However, perhaps Ruby's greatest strength is her ability to give hope when it is needed most- something Ozpin described as \"Something unquantifiable... a spark.\" She always sees the best in people, and has a knack for finding the right words in the right situation, whether when rallying her teammates, comforting demoralized or suffering allies, or trying to sway enemies to her side. While Ruby's willingness to negotiate has occasionally backfired (such as with Raven in \"The More the Merrier\" and Ironwood in \"Gravity\") she has inspired many with her words, actions and perseverance as a leader and Huntress.\n\nRuby's sense of balance stands out, particularly in precarious situations like perching on a taut ribbon in \"Players and Pieces\" or running off an exploding airship in \"Heroes and Monsters\". Despite her small size, Ruby's physical strength is considerable, given how skillfully she wields the large and bulky Crescent Rose. Perhaps one of the best demonstrations of her strength was during her initiation, when she used Crescent Rose to drag a Giant Nevermore vertically up a cliff, at high speed (although she was assisted by Weiss' glyphs and Crescent Rose's recoil).\n\nRuby's fighting style relies heavily on her creative uses of and methods for achieving momentum, relying on a combination of her Semblance and Crescent Rose's recoil to allow her to achieve massive impact force, then speeding away to avoid counterattacks and prepare her next strike. She can also throw her opponents off by creating slipstreams and even small whirlwinds using her Semblance. At closer quarters, she will attempt to overwhelm her opponent with a barrage of lightning-quick slashes, often not allowing them time to dodge or check her attack.\n\nRuby also has some skills as a seamstress. According to RWBY: After the Fall, she made her original outfit herself.[20]\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Crescent Rose\nBlur\nRuby attacking Beowolves with Crescent Rose\nRuby's weapon of choice is Crescent Rose. Ruby is self-admittedly obsessed when it comes to weapons, which shows in her complex design and craftsmanship of her weapon, a High-Caliber Sniper-Scythe which she designed herself at Signal, as well as her eye for detail when observing other people's weapons and tools. This weapon can transform between a scythe and a sniper rifle and can fire Dust rounds in either form with massive force. Ruby has proven to have excellent marksmanship, making a perfect headshot on a fleeing Geist in \"The Next Step\" and shooting down a missile in \"The Lady in the Shoe\".\n\nAfter arriving in Atlas, Crescent Rose was upgraded, with the blade now capable of rotation, allowing Ruby to swing her weapon more freely when in cramped spaces such as caves.\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Ruby uses a wooden scythe belonging to Scarecrow after losing Crescent Rose.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Petal Burst\n1201 Best Day Ever 16878\nRuby using her Semblance\nRuby's Semblance, Petal Burst (also known as Speed), allows her to dash with an inhuman speed in whatever direction she chooses, often leaving trails of rose petals in her wake.[21] In \"Best Day Ever\", Ruby is shown to be capable of creating powerful tailwinds with her Semblance; if she gathers enough momentum, the resulting turbulence is capable of lifting people off the ground.\n\nWithin the episode \"Ace Operatives\", it was stated by Harriet Bree that Ruby's Semblance is not like other speed-type Semblances, though she does not elaborate.\n\nIt is later revealed by Penny in \"Strings\" that Ruby's Semblance allows her to disassemble herself at a molecular level and reassemble at a chosen location, negating her mass. With practice, she has proven able to do the same with anyone she is in contact with, similar to Ren's Semblance; she can carry at least four people along with her. This allows her to go around obstacles or through paths that she would not otherwise fit. She has also proven able to negate gravity while using her Semblance; in \"The Final Word\", she uses her Semblance mid-fall to circle up and around Neopolitan, attacking her from behind. However, as shown by her battle with Mercury in \"PvP\", if her path is blocked by an unexpected obstacle mid-flight, her Semblance can be disrupted, forcing her to stop.\n\nSilver Eyes\n\nMain article: Silver-Eyed Warrior\nV3 12 00136\nRuby using her Silver Eyes\nThrough her mother, Summer, Ruby comes from a line of legendary warriors who possessed powerful abilities related to their Silver Eyes, said to be an extremely rare trait. Upon seeing Pyrrha Nikos die in \"End of the Beginning\", Ruby accidentally uses this power in her grief and petrifies the Wyvern. However, she has no memory of doing this other than her head hurting. Later in the episode, Qrow describes a fairy tale about warriors with Silver Eyes who are so powerful that even the Grimm fear them.\n\nIn \"The Next Step\", it is revealed that Ruby's powers injured Cinder Fall greatly, causing her to lose her left eye and arm, and making it difficult for her to speak for a period of time. Salem states that this is due to Cinder's possession of the Fall Maiden powers but does not explain why this is the case. However, when Ruby uses her powers once again in \"The More the Merrier\", Raven Branwen, who possesses the Spring Maiden powers, is not affected despite being in the vicinity, indicating that the Maiden powers themselves do not cause an individual to be affected by the Silver Eye. This indicates that the reason Cinder was affected was due to her usage of the Grimm, through a Grimm beetle glove and later a Shadow Hand.\n\nIn \"Alone in the Woods\", Ruby has managed to activate her power intentionally after Maria Calavera tells her to concentrate on her loved ones, turning a group of Apathy to dust. Through Maria's guidance, Ruby was able to petrify the Leviathan in the episode \"Our Way\", but the massive Grimm was able to partially destroy the stone encasing its body before it was destroyed by Caroline Cordovin.\n\nDespite Maria's guidance, Ruby still hasn't fully mastered the activation of her powers. In \"Out in the Open\", Ruby attempts to activate her eyes while fighting an Alpha Megoliath but is unable to concentrate with all the chaos. However, in \"The Enemy of Trust\", she quickly and easily activates her Silver Eyes upon seeing Cinder.\n\nIn “Light in Shadows” from RWBY: Ice Queendom, her powers can be activate in dreamscapes. She unknowingly uses it for the first time on a Nightmare to weaken it.\n\nSuperpowers\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Ruby lost both her Aura and Semblance with her arrival on Earth, replaced instead with the power of teleportation. When teleporting, she causes a burst of red energy and rose petals. Like on Remnant, she could grab people and take them with her, including inanimate objects.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nV2 10 00033\nWithout her weapon, Ruby is effortlessly beaten by two White Fang goons.\nRuby is heavily reliant on Crescent Rose. In contrast to her sister, her hand-to-hand capabilities were rather poor, making her easy to be taken down by mere grunts when unarmed. Without her weapon, there is not much she could do in a fight, and her best bet is to run away with her speed. Her cape, on occasion, has been exploited and used against her, notably during the Beacon initiation when a Nevermore pinned her cape to the ground with its feather-spears. In \"Lighting the Fire\" Ruby is shown to be slightly improving in hand-to-hand combat under the tutelage of Professor Ozpin through Oscar Pine. She shows this further while battling Mercury in \"Downfall\"; when disarmed by him, she dodges his next blow and knocks him back with a headbutt.\n\nAlthough less skilled in unarmed combat, Ruby can often compensate by using her wits and her surroundings to turn the tables on her opponent, if she is unarmed. She has notably defeated Neopolitan, a much more skilled melee fighter, twice in this manner. The first was atop Ironwood's flagship during the Fall of Beacon, where Ruby managed to activate Hush's parasol and blow Neo off the ship. Later, when Ruby is disarmed in \"The Final Word\", she tricks Neo into lunging at her, then uses her Semblance to circle behind, disarming her and knocking her off the platform in a single attack. In \"With Friends Like These\", when Harriet lands multiple blows on her and is about to restrain her, Ruby uses her similar Semblance (which is slower but more maneuverable than Harriet's) to outmaneuver her opponent and turn the tables on her.\n\nUntil she was guided by Maria, Ruby was using the power of her Silver Eyes in reaction to the death of a close friend or a loved one being in danger, without control on her part. In \"Gravity\", when Ruby experienced negative emotions after she found out about her mother's fate, she briefly lost control the power of her Silver Eyes and her head begun to hurt."

A black mini skirt is worn under the cream vest.\n\nA pair of crooked black belts with gold accents are slung around her hip, with a purple piece of fabric attached to the left-rear section of the lower belt. She wears thigh high stockings attached to her miniskirt by garter-belts on the front and back of each thigh, decorated with four golden studs above her knee and her emblem on the outside of each thigh in gold. She also wears black ankle boots with multiple buckles and white ribbons on the back tied in a bow. Around her neck is a purple pendant set in silver.\n\nDance\n\nDuring the Beacon Dance, Yang wears a short, white, halter neck dress with a pale gray hem and white pumps.\n\nBeacon Uniform\n\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, Yang wears the same brown shoes, red tartan skirt, white blouse with maroon trim and thin red bow, a brown vest with gold buttons, and maroon blazer with gold trim as every other girl attending Beacon, alongside with a pair of thigh-high black stockings. She retains her fingerless black gloves, as seen in \"Best Day Ever\".\n\nPost-Timeskip \"DGAS\" Outfit (Volume 4)\n\n\nAfter the time skip following the Fall of Beacon, her new outfit consists of a gray jacket over an orange tank top that bares her hips. The jacket is tied at the right sleeve, indicating her missing arm. The jacket's left sleeve bears her father's emblem, indicating that it may have formerly belonged to him. Completing her attire are gray-brown cargo pants, which have ribbed knee paneling and show the rim of her dark undergarments. High on the left leg of her pants is a red shield-shaped patch with imagery of three Ursa masks, and her emblem is stitched on her right thigh. She wears white sneakers with purple laces, and her hair is pulled back into a messy ponytail with a purple hair tie.\n\nShe has also grown taller, surpassing her mother in height.\n\nThe stump of her right arm is covered by a circular, metallic plate.\n\nAt the end of \"Family\", she begins using a silver and white robotic arm prosthesis. In \"Taking Control\", she paints this arm bright yellow and black.\n\nIn her concept art for this outfit, her right arm is simply bandaged, and a bumblebee patch is in the place of her emblem. This same concept art refers to the outfit as her \"DGAS\" outfit.\n\nMistral Outfit (Volumes 4–7)\n\n\nIn \"No Safe Haven\", Yang begins wearing a new outfit with a tan jacket with orange lining and gold edging, unzipped halfway to show an orange crop top. The coat has darker brown short sleeves, a thick collar that completely encircles her neck, and two long gold-trimmed rectangular tails that are shown to be detachable in \"Lighting the Fire\". She also wears fitted black pants, and her hair has been let down again like her original outfit.\n\nAround her hips and over the tails of her coat is a brown belt, which has two pieces of dark brown material trimmed in gold attached to it. The first covers from her left hip to the back of the belt and is folded over the belt, and the second is attached from the right hip and almost around to the other piece of material. She wears knee-high brown boots with gold caps on the heel and toe, with the heel cap attaching to a gold strap across the front of her ankle, and a gold zipper on the upper half of the front of the boots. A single small buckled strap is on the upper outside of her boots, and a purple bandanna tied around her left knee. A pair of black fingerless gloves with long brown cuffs reaching to mid-forearm complete the outfit.\n\nWhile riding Bumblebee, Yang no longer wears her helmet or goggles and instead dons a pair of yellow-rimmed aviator sunglasses. Before battle, Yang removes her coattails and cuffs, and she puts Ember Celica onto her left arm.\n\nIn the promotional material for Volume 4, Yang is shown wearing the same coat and pants shown in the series. A gold metal plate covers her missing right arm, which matches the accessories on the heels and toes of her boots.\n\nIn promotional material for Volume 5, her outfit includes her new robotic arm.\n\nAtlas Outfit (Volume 7-Current)\n\n\nAfter arriving in Atlas and meeting with James Ironwood, Yang obtains an entirely new outfit primarily consisting of khaki overalls, the gold zipper of which is unzipped just below the breast to reveal a white low-cut cropped tube top. Around the thighs of the overalls is a gold zipper and buckled strap that allows for the pants leg to be detached. The right leg is unzipped but still strapped to the overalls but the lower part is partially folded over. Over top of the coveralls, she wears a baggy, dark brown crop aviator styled jacket with fur trim around the neck and black-and-orange straps along the sleeves.\n\nAround her waist is a black-and-orange belt with black-and-yellow folded fabric on the sides, which runs behind her with a pouch attached to it and a golden buckle of her emblem. She wears dark brown knee-high boots with black laces and top trim. For accessories, she has resumed wearing her orange scarf around her neck and her purple scarf around her right leg, like she did with her original battle outfit. She also has a black/brown strap with golden trim and a pouch wrapped around her left thigh. Yang wears yellow and black socks with her emblem on as shown by the concept art. She is also seen wearing orange sunglasses in \"Ace Operatives\".\n\nLucid Dream Outfit (Ice Queendom)\n\n\nDream Yang Xiao Long.\nFor Yang, her hair is tied in a ponytail, with a light brown slim choker around her neck. She wears medium brown snow boots with armor plating on the fronts She wears dark brown one-legged pants with the left leg full reaching her ankle whilst the right side stops at the mid-thigh. Accompanying her pants is a single yellow thigh length stocking on her right leg She can be seen wearing two belts, both holding a piece of lilac pleated material under a brown section of fabric. She wears a light beige jacket, with the sleeves rolled up to her biceps. One of the jackets sides has a flame decal on it. And for most of the episodes, she can be seen with Motorcycle goggles. During the latter half of Ice Queendom, she also sports Jaune's brown cape.\n\nEarth Outfit (Justice League X RWBY Part 2)\n\n\nAfter arriving on Earth, Yang gains the same outfit from the DC/RWBY comics, but with a few changes. It shares a the similar gladiator design, but without the spartan style mask. She wears a pair of armored boots that go up halfway to her calfs, with stockings held up by belts on her thighs. She wears a black glove on her left hand, alongside a golden arm gauntlet going up to her elbow. She wears a sleeve on her right arm, with her mechanical arm having a golden texture, mimicing her outfit's color motif. In addition, she has an orange cape going down to her upper back, her hair is tied into a ponytail, and she has a more muscular build. For her weapon of choice, she carries Heat Wave's Flamethrower.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nOriginal outfit\nOriginal outfit\nYang's red eyes when using her semblance\nYang's red eyes when using her semblance\nBeacon School Uniform\nBeacon School Uniform\nBike Gear\nBike Gear\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nOriginal outfit with upgraded arm\nOriginal outfit with upgraded arm\n\"DGAS\" outfit during her depression after the Fall of Beacon\n\"DGAS\" outfit during her depression after the Fall of Beacon\nHer outfit while in Mistral with sunglasses\nHer outfit while in Mistral with sunglasses\nHer Mistral outfit without the coattails and gloves\nHer Mistral outfit without the coattails and gloves\nYoung Yang from Ruby's flashback from \"Our Way\"\nYoung Yang from Ruby's flashback from \"Our Way\"\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine\nBeacon Pajamas\nBeacon Pajamas\nAlternative outfit (Hunter) from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nAlternative outfit (Hunter) from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nYoung Yang in her flashback from \"Burning the Candle\"\nYoung Yang in her flashback from \"Burning the Candle\"\nOriginal outfit without her arm\nOriginal outfit without her arm\nPatch Home Pajamas\nPatch Home Pajamas\n\"DGAS\" outfit without the jacket\n\"DGAS\" outfit without the jacket\nHer outfit while in Mistral\nHer outfit while in Mistral\nHer Mistral outfit without her arm\nHer Mistral outfit without her arm\nMistral outfit with upgraded arm\nMistral outfit with upgraded arm\nVIEW MORE\nPersonality\n\nAt least you two have something that drives you. I've just kinda always gone with the flow, you know? And that's fine; I mean, that's who I am, but how long can I really do that for? I wanna be a Huntress, not really because I want to be a hero, but because I want adventure. I want a life where I won't know what tomorrow will bring and that will be a good thing. Being a Huntress just happens to line up with that.\nYANG XIAO LONG.\n\nYang's voice actress, Barbara Dunkelman, has said that when Yang's character was described to her, she was described as \"the kind of person who would teach someone how to swim by pushing them in the water\".[8] This speaks volumes about how Yang approaches most things in life. She is very straightforward and confident.\n\nYang is also described as being a cheerful, energetic, and bright young lady. She is arguably the most flippant, carefree, and adventurous member of her team, frequently making sarcastic comments and jokes even in the heat of battle and often taking combat and hostile situations lightly. Yang is very sociable and extroverted, even in unfamiliar situations. Yang's love of adventure is the main reason that she decided to become a Huntress. Blake considers Yang the personification of the word \"strength\". According to Ruby, she snores loudly.[9]\n\nHowever, Yang's \"brawler\" fighting style is evocative of her personality. Her anger, one of her main assets in battle, can lead her to act predictably and has put her into danger repeatedly. She was easily frustrated when she couldn't land a hit on Neopolitan and could not attack precisely because of it, leading to her getting knocked unconscious and almost killed. Yang is also very protective of her hair, becoming enraged when someone touches or rips or cuts even a small portion of her hair, causing her to attack with straight, blunt force the one who did it. However she is comfortable with letting Ruby touch or brush her hair or even use it to toy with her sister by tickling her nose. According to Taiyang, she shares a flaw with her mother: thinking strength is all that matters in a fight. Her thoughtless anger also led to the quick loss of her right arm in a short encounter with Adam Taurus after he angered her by injuring Blake. While recovering from her injuries, her father lectures her about this weakness and guides her in what she needs to do to start overcoming it along with her flaw that she shares with her mother.\n\nDespite this, Yang is quite mature. She is extremely nurturing and motherly, particularly toward her younger sister, Ruby. Yang pushes her into being outgoing and also worries a great deal about her sister across the many battles they fight in. This protective and encouraging nature extends to Blake and Weiss as well. Yang is worried about Blake on several occasions, such as when she runs from her team and when she suffers from sleep and appetite problems, opening Yang to discussing her stubborn past. What Yang does not reveal is that she suffers from abandonment issues, blaming herself for her mother not sticking around.[10]\n\nYang is also quite guile as she was able to teach Weiss on how to play Remnant: The Game by explaining to her how to use her cards in the game only to better trick Weiss into wasting her armies. She later used a laser to attract Blake so they would be able to talk and even tricked a bandit into revealing the location of Raven's camp. She is also perspicacious as she saw through her mother's facade and attempt to manipulate her into staying with the tribe during their first meeting, recognized her in her corvid form at Haven, and quickly deduced that her mother was the Spring Maiden and had killed the former maiden.\n\nHowever, after the deaths of Pyrrha Nikos and Penny Polendina, the Fall of Beacon, the losses of her right arm and her partner Blake, Yang sunk into a reclusive depression. The mention of her missing partner agitates her and she gives Ruby the cold shoulder and even outright ignores her sister when she says, \"I love you\". Over months, Yang rebounds from this reclusive nature. Though she suffers from PTSD, she tries to keep moving forward, partially for her father's sake when feeling she holds him back. After overhearing her father and Bartholomew Oobleck talking about Ruby outside her window, she accepts the earlier wisdom of her father, Oobleck, and Professor Peter Port and dons her new cybernetic arm.\n\nWhen training with her new limb, she learns how to balance her driven and positive nature without overconfidence or agitation. She paints her arm to match her style, changes to a new outfit, and headed to Mistral although her father believes she has not overcome her personality flaws. Fortunately, she has shown to not be as quick to blind anger in combat anymore and now fights displaying good strategy and intelligence, as seen with her rematch against Adam and when she fought the Ace-Ops. While traveling to Mistral to reunite with Ruby she continues to struggle with her PTSD, which manifests in her left arm shaking when she encounters stress. She, however, appears to have overcome it some time after she and Blake reluctantly killed Adam.\n\nYang is extremely sensitive about being abandoned and her \"simmering anger\" stems from these abandonment issues.[11] For the better part of nearly two decades, Yang spent her life searching for her mother, trying to understand her reasons for leaving. Their first reunion in \"Lighting the Fire\" also demonstrated how low her opinion was of Raven, reacting with anger after Raven said that Yang finally decided to visit her, making it sound like she was the one responsible for her mother not being a part of her life. She even ignored Raven's attempts at lightening the mood and became hostile upon her father, uncle and Team RWBY being insulted in \"Known by its Song\". Even after her team's reunion at Haven, Yang was still guarded and kept some distance from Blake, stating in \"Argus Limited\" that their relationship would need time to heal. After a rematch against Adam in \"Seeing Red\" however, Yang fully accepted Blake's apologies, giving her partner a second chance and understanding that she was not like her mother.\n\nDespite her fear of Salem, she was still strongly willing to continue fighting against her and to take the Relic of Knowledge to Atlas, despite knowing that it may put a target on her back. Even after learning about Salem's immortality and knowing that she wasn't a match for her, Yang still went against her in order to allow her friends to escape and did not hesitate to call Salem out on her actions. She also has a good degree of heroism and selflessness, being willing to takes the attacks from an Ursa and from Neo to protect Ruby as seen in the \"Volume 5 Yang Character Short\" and \"Worthy\" respectively, and even attacked Salem to save Emerald despite her enmity and distrust for her actions.\n\nShe has an opposition to keeping secrets. In \"Rest and Resolutions\", she had Ozpin swear not to lie or tell half-truths and later, in \"Uncovered\", she is upset with him for keeping the nature of the Relic of Knowledge a secret from the group as well as covering up Leonardo Lionheart's treachery. In \"A New Approach\", she was willing to trust Ruby's judgement in not telling James Ironwood the full truth about Salem and the Lamp, but questioned this decision privately later. When sent to apprehend Robyn Hill in \"Worst Case Scenario\", she and Blake instead revealed Ironwood's plans for the Amity Communications Tower to her. Despite her staunchness towards half-truths, she is not above telling some herself. In \"Haven's Fate\", Yang told an account of what happened in the Vault without explicitly bringing up how Raven was the Spring Maiden the whole time.\n\nFollowing the events of Volume 7, Yang hardens herself in order to prepare for the overwhelming situation that they were in. She was hurt by what had happened to Mantle and wanted to do whatever she could to help them, hinting at her reason for criticizing her younger sister.[12]\n\nDespite her good qualities, Yang has a tendency to deflect. In \"Divide\", she deflects blame by criticizing Ruby's leadership, despite the fact that it was due to her and Blake's actions with Robyn that partially led to Ironwood losing faith in them and bringing about the current situation. In \"Fault\", when Ren brings up some concern that they were not ready and that their actions will lead to people dying, Yang avoids his direct criticism and tries to deflect by offering counterpoints without addressing his actual arguments. Finally, in “Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble”, she sheepishly deflected responsibility for her part in worsening Ruby’s mental decline, simply stating she shouldn’t have expected herself to be perfect.\n\nHowever, unlike her mother, Yang is capable of admitting her wrongs as well as recognizing the qualities of others even when their opinions are different from hers, admitting to Blake that her obsession to search for her mother nearly got herself and Ruby killed when they were young, and during her discussion with Ruby in \"Risk\", she admitted that her own plan didn't work either after Ruby lamented the failure of bringing Amity Tower up and running, even telling Ruby that her blind optimism wasn't a flaw when she believed she wasted time with it, as it was a necessity in life.\n\nIn \"A Cat Most Curious\", when Yang’s past self offers Yang an opportunity to be whole again by traveling back in time to regain her lost organic arm, Yang declines her offer as losing a part of herself is what makes her a stronger person. It shows that Yang already accepts her losses by learning from her mistakes.\n\nIn \"Boba\", Yang felt guilty about putting everything on her sister's shoulders along with her teammates, she vows to Ruby, that from now on, the entirety of Team RWBY will share the burden, and even use the word \"Boba\" as a safe word if they ever feel overwhelmed.\nPowers and Abilities\n\nYang's fighting style is much more aggressive than that of her teammates. She uses a barehanded fist-fighting style, bearing some resemblance to Muay Thai and her weapons; Ember Celica. She is quite agile, able to dodge an onslaught of Ursai and gunfire with ease. Since gaining her prosthetic arm, Yang has taken to using its armored surface defensively, shielding herself from firearms, and staving off attacks to gain greater ground on her opponents, incorporating its advantages into her improved fighting style following further instruction from her father, Tai.\n\nShe is also physically the strongest of the group. Her strength is displayed on numerous occasions, such as when her punch sent a fully grown man several feet into the air and through a glass pillar without the enhancement of her weapon, and in \"Players and Pieces\", where she was able to keep the mouth of a Nevermore open with one arm long enough to deliver multiple shots down its throat.\n\nLike all Huntsmen and Huntresses, Yang has had her Aura unlocked, coating her body with a shield powered by her soul, which helps protect her, especially when her aggressiveness gets her into bad situations. Though she already has the highest level of durability in her team, with her Aura unlocked, her durability is particularly high, as showcased in her doubles match with Weiss against Flynt Coal and Neon Katt during the Vytal Tournament, where she withstands numerous hits from Neon during the bout's opening stages and powers through the effects of Flynt's weapon, knocking him out and securing victory for her side shortly after. Due to the nature of her Semblance and the high durability, Yang would typically absorb enough hits through her Aura to empower herself and then finish the fights with her Semblance, which her father criticizes due to her over-reliance in \"Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back\".\n\nSince the end of Volume 3 and her mental recovery at the end of Volume 4, Yang's fighting skills had improved immensely after training again. Notably, she has incorporated more kicking and dodging. Her new robotic arm also gives her a higher degree of strength, able to send full-grown men flying from the intensity of her blows. During her rematch against Adam, she defeats him despite his superior speed by adapting her combat technique and avoiding attacking him until he uses up the energy from his Semblance so that she can disarm him, showing her improved intelligence in combat.\n\nHer fight against Elm and Vine with Blake further showcases her more pragmatic approach to battles. She coordinated her attacks with Blake and refrained from using her Semblance until the last moment to destroy the ground Elm had anchored herself to and deliver the finishing blow. Since Volume 3, her use of her Semblance overall in battle has gone down, as she tends to activate it only as a last resort. Even when she does, rather than absorbing blows to her body, she now tends to deflect or absorb blows with her forearms, as she did in her final battle with Adam Taurus. This enables her to use her Semblance more effectively and runs less risk of her exhausting her Aura when she does so.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Ember Celica\nV4 11 00020\nYang repaints her weapons - Ember Celica and her Robotic Arm\nYang's weapon of choice is Ember Celica, it is radically different compared to those used by her teammates, being a pair of gauntlets which can retract into bracelets. Yang's fighting style involves combining her punches with explosive shots from Ember Celica for moderate or short-ranged attacks.\n\nEmber Celica has powerful recoil, which Yang can use to augment the force of her punch and accelerate her movements. The force is powerful enough to launch her high in the air. The recoil also reloads and prepares the gauntlets for the next shot.[11]\n\nShe can also use her Ember Celica as a form of armor when defending against attacks in unarmed combat. After the events of \"Heroes and Monsters\", Yang only has one Ember Celica, due to her lost arm.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Burn\nV3 0600051\nHer irises turn red and her hair glows when she uses the power from her Semblance\nYang's Semblance, Burn,[11] as Ruby states during the events of \"Painting the Town...\", lets her absorb kinetic energy from every blow she takes and use it to make herself more powerful; this is a form of kinetic energy absorption, with Yang subsequently redirecting said energy against her opponent with double the amount of force. As a side-effect of her Semblance, Yang's eyes turn red[6] and her hair sometimes begins glowing and even becomes covered in flames. Yang's Semblance does not make her angry, but anger has sometimes led her to impulsively activate it.\n\nPrior to the Fall of Beacon, Yang often used her Semblance to finish a fight, after absorbing enough damage from blows to overpower her opponent. However, after the Fall of Beacon, she begins to use it far less often and more as a final attack due to her improved training in fighting smarter rather than harder with Taiyang. This is demonstrated during her fights against the bandits and the Grimm between Haven and Argus where she doesn't use her Semblance to fight. At the end of her second and last fight with Adam Taurus, she uses it to disarm and overpower him with a very powerful punch.\n\nProsthetic Arm\n\nMain article: Yang's Prosthetic Arm\nYangGunArm2\nYang's base prosthetic arm\nAfter losing her arm in the Battle of Beacon to Adam Taurus she was given a new robotic arm by James Ironwood. She initially refused it due to depression, but after some time to reflect and heal, at least partially, Yang chose to use it, spray painting the new limb yellow to match her remaining Ember Celica.\n\nEmber upgraded cropped\nUpgraded Arm\nCreated by Pietro Polendina, Yang's cybernetic limb possesses great strength. Its power is shown in \"Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back\", where a single blow sent her father, a fully trained Huntsman, skidding back several feet even though Tai blocked the attack. It is also outfitted with most of Ember Celica's features, including a shotgun.[11] As seen in \"Rest and Resolutions\" and \"Downfall\", the arm can detach from her bicep at will. It is also durable enough to take a fully charged strike from Adam's Moonslice Semblance and continued functioning even after its damage.\n\nIn Atlas, Yang's arm is modified. It is now larger with more mass and more gold plates around. It more resembles the design of Ember Celica.\n\nSuperpowers\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Yang loses her Semblance and Aura upon arriving on Earth (DC). In exchange, she gains the superpower \"Fire Fists\", enabling to fire energy bursts from her hands, akin to Ember Celica.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nV3 11 00124\nYang's short temper and Semblance overeliance causes her to lose her arm to Adam\nAlthough Yang gets stronger from taking damage, her frustration and anger can be exploited by skilled opponents. This weakness is perhaps best expressed in her very brief first confrontation with Adam, her anger causing her to recklessly charge him and lose her right arm in the process. However, this drawback is more or less under control after her father Taiyang told her to focus on using her opponent's force against them.\n\nWhile taking hits from an opponent vastly increases the power of her Semblance, Yang still takes damage in the process. Despite her high reserves of Aura, too many hits can deplete it completely, breaking her defenses and rendering her Semblance counterattack useless. Conversely, activating her Semblance too soon (as she did against Adam and later Neo) will also weaken her Aura's defenses in exchange for an under-charged counterstrike. Yang is also noted to be weak against kick-based fighting styles, seen when she struggles against Neo, Melanie, and Mercury Black.[13] As time progresses however, she has since adapted to kick fighters.\n\nAs seen in her fight with Neo, fighters well-versed in dodging attacks can frustrate Yang, making her attacks predictable and easily avoided, which also renders the added power with her Semblance useless. The fact that she fights barehanded as opposed to using a melee weapon also limits the reach of her close-quarters attacks, enabling opponents with greater agility to evade her strikes.\n\nWhile not necessarily a form of weakness, her emotions can also cause her to unintentionally activate her Semblance even if she is not in a battle. Examples of this include her frustrated outburst in \"Players and Pieces\", her moment of anger toward Blake in \"Burning the Candle\" and two times in her doubles round tournament fight in \"Never Miss a Beat\". In \"Worthy\" she instinctively activates her Semblance to protect Ruby from Neo's attack, breaking her Aura and being knocked into the void.\n\nTaiyang somewhat jokingly defines her Semblance as \"basically a temper tantrum\" and a liability against stronger and more experienced opponents; if they can evade or outlast the duration of her onslaught, she is left weak, tired, and vulnerable to a counterattack. For this reason due to her improved fighting style in \"Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back\", Taiyang tells her it's best left as a last resort rather than a crutch like how she used it in the Vytal Festival and due to her over-reliance of using it to win every fight before."

Weiss has a scar which runs vertically down her left eye and face, gained during her battle against an Arma Gigas in the \"White\" Trailer.\n\nIn Ice Queendom, she wears pale pink lipstick.\nOriginal Outfit (Volumes 1–3)\n\n1110 The Badge and The Burden Pt.2 00998\nWeiss with Myrtenaster\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, she wears a thigh-length strapless dress with a faint color gradation from white to pale blue at the hem. A small piece of black lace sits in the front of her neckline and the hem of the dress is scalloped and stitched to resemble snowflakes, with layers of white tulle under the skirt. Over this, she wears a bell-sleeved bolero with the same color gradation as her dress from shoulder to wrist, lined in red and with a ruffled collar. On the back of the bolero is the Schnee Crest.\n\nShe also wears a small apple pendant on a silver chain and thin, rectangular silver earrings. Her boots are white, wedged heeled, and higher at the back than the front. They have a small silver decoration across the top of the foot and are lined in red. A thin white sash is tied around her waist with a pouch attached to the back.\n\nIn her character short for Volume 5, she wears the same outfit, except her ponytail is centered. At the time, she had not yet received her scar.\n\nPajamas\n\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, Weiss' pajamas consist of a faded blue nightgown with short sleeves and white trim and display the Schnee Crest on the upper-right chest. She also wears her hair down.\n\nAlternate Outfit (Snowpea)\n\nV2 03 00009\nAlternate Outfit \"Snowpea\"\nDuring the events of \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\", Weiss wears an alternate outfit codenamed \"Snowpea\".[9]\n\nThis outfit consists of a white, double-breasted pea coat with black piping, cuffs, and buttons over a white, pleated full skirt with black lace trim. She also wears a pair of white, thigh-high boots with black heels and lace-topped black stockings.\n\nDance\n\nDuring the Beacon Dance, Weiss wears a short, white, sleeveless dress with cutouts on both sides of her waist. The yoke of the dress is translucent mesh and she also wears white pumps.\n\nBeacon Uniform\n\nDuring her attendance at Beacon, Weiss wears the standard Beacon Academy uniform comprised of a maroon blazer with golden brown lining and twin buttons over a brown button-up vest and white blouse with pleated looking neckline and a red ribbon tied around her black-lined collar. She also wears the traditional red checkered with black stripes with golden brown outlining alongside white tulle. She also wears a pair of brown lace-up wedged sole boots, alongside black socks reaching to mid-calf.\n\nMistral Outfit (Songbird, Volumes 4–7)\n\n\nAfter the timeskip following the Fall of Beacon, her new design includes a short, glittering dress with a color gradation of gray blue to pale blue at the hem, a sweetheart neckline, and a white, tulle petticoat.\n\nA white sash is wrapped multiple times around her waist, and over the outfit is worn a slightly sheer long-sleeved gray blue bolero fastened at the collar with a large sapphire broach that has three pendants dangling from it. Printed on the back of the shrug is the Schnee Crest. Completing her attire are gray blue wedge heels and sapphire drop earrings.\n\nShe also has an alternate/occasional outfit, which follows the same design as her standard attire except for the skirt, which is floor length and split to her thigh on one side and she wears chunky heels instead. The white ribbon has been removed from her waist and she wears her hair and earrings in the same style, albeit her ponytail has grown out, now roughly reaching her knees. In RWBY: Amity Arena, this outfit is referred to as Songbird.\n\nIn Volume 6, she wears a red scarf with white design at the ends and pale blue tights with her outfit.\n\nAtlas Outfit (Volume 7-Current)\n\n\nAfter arriving in Atlas and meeting with James Ironwood, Weiss' hair is now braided, and she has grown out her bangs and styled them to frame her face more closely.\n\nShe wears a pale blue sleeveless dress with deep red lining, bow detail fixture, and two diamond-shaped pieces hanging from the corners of the hem, over a white diagonal hemmed strapless dress. Above which she wears a vivid blue shrug with a raised collar, puffy sleeves and the Schnee emblem on the left sleeve, fastened by a blue, silver outlined strap. On her arms are a pair of long navy blue gloves with silver top trim surrounding a red gem at the top.\n\nOver her dress, she wears a light blue, corset styled belt. Around her waist are three white belts with a medium-sized pouch attached to the lowest belt and another pouch attached to the middle belt. The lowest belt crosses over the middle belt. She wears long, pale blue wedge-heel boots with white frill detailing at the top at the front, alongside grayish blue coloring on the toes and navy blue wedged heels.\n\nIn addition, she wears a pair of ruby earrings that match her icicle-shaped tiara with a diamond-shaped ruby in the center.\n\nBallgown (RWBY x Justice League)\n\nIn Issue 3 of the RWBY x Justice League comics Weiss is show to be wearing a strapless ball gown that has a similar grey blue colour seen on her Mistral attire that has a gradation to a light blue alongside grey blue opera length gloves and a pearl styled necklace and a white sash belt tied around her waist.\n\nEarth Outfit\n\n\nWeiss Schnee on Earth.\nAfter arriving on Earth, Weiss has her hair let down, reaching her thighs. Her outfit is basically a combination of her Volumes 4 and 7 attires and Salem's human and Grimm attires. She wears a pale blue sleeveless, backless thigh-length dress with white pleated halter-like straps extended to the back closed at the collar by a ruby in the center, slightly exposing her bust with a narrow, diamond-shaped window in a pale blue trim, as well as a white pleated hem above the skirt, matching opera-length gloves, light gray blue tights, and pale blue boots with white detailed trimming and gray heels. She wears a silver ice-shaped tiara with the same ruby.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nYoung Weiss as depicted in a family portrait from \"Remembrance\"\nYoung Weiss as depicted in a family portrait from \"Remembrance\"\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine\nWithout her scar\nWithout her scar\nBeacon School Uniform\nBeacon School Uniform\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nProm dress from \"Burning the Candle\" and \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nSame outfit with a longer skirt for formal occasions\nSame outfit with a longer skirt for formal occasions\nAtlas Outfit\nAtlas Outfit\nComics Gown\nComics Gown\nYoung Weiss seen in Weiss' flashback in RWBY: Ice Queendom\nYoung Weiss seen in Weiss' flashback in RWBY: Ice Queendom\nOriginal outfit\nOriginal outfit\nBeacon nightgown and hair down\nBeacon nightgown and hair down\nSnowPea outfit from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nSnowPea outfit from \"A Minor Hiccup\" and \"Painting the Town...\"\nMistral outfit\nMistral outfit\nSame dress with a scarf and tights for the cold Mistral weather\nSame dress with a scarf and tights for the cold Mistral weather\nAtlas Pajamas\nAtlas Pajamas\nPower Armor From \"RWBY Grimm Eclipse Definitive Edition\"\nPower Armor From \"RWBY Grimm Eclipse Definitive Edition\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nWhen I said I wanted to honor my family's name, I meant it. But — it's not what you think. I'm not stupid; I'm fully aware of what my father has done with the Schnee Dust Company. Since he took control, our business has operated in a 'moral grey area' ... which is why I feel the need to make things right. If I had taken a job at Atlas, it wouldn't have changed anything. My father was not the start of our name, and I refuse to let him be the end of it.\nWEISS SCHNEE.\n\nMonty Oum had said that everything has been decided for Weiss in her life and because of it, she is a bit of a rebel. This manifests itself in her physical appearance as she wears her ponytail to the side of her head, disrupting the symmetry of the rest of her outfit. When Professor Peter Port states that Weiss has received everything she wanted in life, she responds that it is not entirely true, thinking of her father's attitude. She takes pride in her name and the company, though, as seen when she first meets Blake, when she discusses it with her team in Mountain Glenn and when she confronts her father over it.\n\nConsidering the lyrics of her leitmotif \"Mirror Mirror\", it is very likely that Weiss has felt lonely throughout her life, which translated into a cold nature. Constant attacks by the White Fang added heavy strain to her life, explaining her often difficult personality. Her strict upbringing has also given her a tendency to keep quiet about her own desires, likely not to be seen as vulnerable. After warming up to people, she places a great deal of trust in her friends and confides in them when she feels the need. While she doesn't abandon her prickly attitude completely, she gradually becomes nicer and more compassionate to people, especially her friends.\n\nAccording to her voice actress, Kara Eberle, Weiss is \"nice but can also be a little bit bitchy.\" She is irritable and confident in her abilities, though also acknowledges her deficiencies and the need to hone her skills further. Her confidence in her skills and intellect often comes off as arrogance to others. This is also mentioned by Kara, who called her the \"know-it-all\" type of person who can also become best friends with her acquaintances.\n\nWeiss takes her time at Beacon more seriously than her teammates, taking notes even when the topic is not related to the knowledge she seeks. She equates such dedication in the classroom with dedication in the field. Thus, she is annoyed at those who do not take things seriously, especially when it comes to becoming protectors against the Grimm. Weiss remains calm and tactical during encounters and mentally coaches herself. She is thoughtful and fights with precision and coordination.\n\nAfter speaking with Professor Port, Weiss' attitude appears to change, as she takes his suggestion to \"be the best person [she] can be\" to heart. She opens up to Ruby, though she does not halt future criticisms. Weiss' development carries into her whimsical and humorous side as she joins her team in a food fight against Team JNPR and a board game. In \"Painting the Town...\", Weiss attempts to joke but is met with negative criticism from Yang and Blake. Weiss also enjoys planning and participating in certain events, such as the Beacon Dance.\n\nWeiss vows that as a Huntress, she will elevate the Schnee name from her father's dishonor to it and put her desires behind others' necessities. This solidifies in \"Lessons Learned\" when Weiss heeds her sister's advice and removes her bindings from the SDC to discover more about herself.\n\nAfter being retrieved from Beacon and flown home, Weiss is truly affected by the loss that happened during the Fall of Beacon. She becomes increasingly intolerant of the Atlesian lifestyle she grew up in, seeing it as superficial and ignorant. Her change of perspective is demonstrated by her hostility toward Henry Marigold's insensitive and ignorant attitude about the charity event and her public outburst when a couple talks condescendingly about the destruction of Vale.\n\nWeiss has demonstrated the ability to keep a level head in the face of intense and deeply emotional situations. When Ironwood's paranoia begins to spiral in \"Gravity\" Weiss attempts to regain control of the situation by pointing out that his concerns are not relevant to the current situation. After Neopolitan knocked Yang over the edge in \"The Final Word\", Weiss immediately attempts to comfort Blake before the latter lashes back at Neo in rage. While Ruby and Blake are preoccupied with Neopolitan, Weiss quietly resigns herself and does her duty by fighting Cinder and drawing the Fall Maiden's attention to keep as many civilians out of harm's way as possible during the evacuation.[10]\n\nWeiss sometimes flinches when someone raises their voice in anger, regardless of whether this anger is directed toward someone else or coming from a close friend. This is first shown in \"Taking Control\" when she overhears an argument between her father and General Ironwood. It is also shown in \"Known by its Song\" when Yang snaps at her mother, Raven Branwen, for mocking Qrow Branwen and Taiyang Xiao Long. The latter incident shows Weiss remaining on edge around Yang even after her anger subsides. This unconscious habit may have been another result of her dysfunctional childhood and strained family life, as it has been implied by Weiss that her father and mother would frequently fight with each other in angry voices.\n\nDespite her good qualities, Weiss holds a double standard regarding others and secrets. In \"Sparks\", she is upset on Winter's behalf due to the fact that she believes Ironwood is keeping secrets from her, even though she went along with Ruby's decision to lie to Ironwood and keep Ozpin's disappearance, how many questions left in the Relic of Knowledge, and Salem's immortality a secret. When Winter reveals Fria to Weiss as a gesture of faith to show that Ironwood has trusted her, Weiss keeps what she knows a secret from her sister.\n\nDue to the ongoing violence between the SDC and the White Fang terrorist group, Weiss despises the White Fang and shows a noticeable distrust of Faunus at first. The White Fang's activities seem to have contributed to a difficult childhood for Weiss, for she had close ties with numerous people who were either killed by or disappeared because of the White Fang. This led to her father frequently coming home angry, and this further colored Weiss' views on the White Fang and Faunus.\n\nWhen Blake defends Sun Wukong's criminal acts, Weiss makes many derogatory comments about him and suggests he would likely join with the White Fang. However, shortly after the fight with Roman Torchwick, Weiss no longer cares about her argument with Blake, stating they are teammates, and it changes nothing. Regardless, she says she remains unsure of how she feels about Sun, but they grow to be on friendlier terms. Weiss and the rest of her team keep Blake's status as a Faunus a secret.\n\nWeiss' hostility toward the Faunus downgrades considerably through her time at Beacon, as seen when she shows concern for Velvet Scarlatina and the rest of Team CFVY. She is even friendlier and empathetic toward Blake, having placed trust in her as well after fighting alongside Blake against the White Fang several times. In \"Dead End\" when Caroline Cordovin shows blatant racism towards Blake for her Faunus heritage, Weiss immediately snaps \"What's that supposed to mean?!\" and in \"The Greatest Kingdom\" when a drunk shows Blake the same prejudice, Weiss uses Myrtenaster to hurl him into a dumpster, saying it was worth it- showing how significantly her views have changed. When Team RWBY explores an abandoned SDC mine, Weiss expresses shame and remorse to Blake for the pain her family has caused the Faunus.\n\nWeiss has been described by Blake as the personification of the word \"defiance.\" This is shown to be true in her various rebellions against those who try to decide things for her, or make assumptions about her; from her father, to Flynt Coal in the Vytal Festival Tournament (who initially believes she is nothing but a spoilt rich kid) to even General Ironwood and her older sister in Volume 7. This defiance culminates in her encounter with Cinder Fall in \"The Final Word\", when Weiss is left as the last of Team RWBY to face her; Cinder mocks her status as a Schnee, claiming she let \"all her friends die first\". Despite her Aura being broken, and outmatched by the Fall Maiden's power, Weiss continues to attack Cinder in order to buy her other friends time- showing that she is, indeed, defiant to the end.\n\nIn “A Cat Most Curious”, when Weiss’ past self offers Weiss opportunity of becoming a nobody and to get rid of her family name, Weiss decline her offer since she is proud to be Schnee. This shows how much she has changed and grown to accept herself as being both the granddaughter of a hero and the daughter of a villain.\nIce Queendom\n\nIn RWBY: Ice Queendom, it is implied that she likely used to suffer from both a superiority and an inferiority complex, often coming across as supercilious, haughty, and disdainful towards those she views as being beneath her and seeing herself as a perfect example of what a future Huntress should be but will often fall into long periods of paranoia and self-doubt whenever someone dares to challenge these beliefs.\n\nThis behavior likely stemmed from Weiss's estranged relationship with her father who always expected her to be the best at everything she set out to do but because she could never hope to live up to his expectations was constantly seen as a disappointment in his eyes.\n\nIn the case of Ruby Rose, Weiss is initially dismissive of her believing that she has no place in Beacon and that she isn't worth her time as a leader. However, after her conversation with Port, Weiss misunderstands what he was trying to tell her and resolves to try and \"fix\" Ruby's flaws as a leader believing that it will help raise her standing with the rest of her team and the other students attending Beacon.\n\nWeiss is also shown to be far more prejudiced against Faunus in general in this version, showing a strong distrust towards them as the White Fang were responsible for many people she had once known getting hurt or killed. This grudge was so strong that it even extended to her teammate Blake Belladonna as upon finding out the truth about Blake being a Faunus, she burst into angry and fearful tears at having been forced into close proximity with her believing her to be too dangerous to live with.\n\nAfter being freed from her nightmare, Weiss's personality has shown to improve vastly becoming much more friendly towards her team and accepting of Faunus. Though she still seeks to be the best that she can be, she acknowledges that there are always going to be things that others can do better than her but resolves to not let it stop her from trying to accomplish her goals.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nAs the heiress of the Schnee Dust Company, Weiss was raised from youth to strive to be the best in all she did, and combat was no exception. As a testament to her skills, Weiss was on the top ranking of the sparring class during the events of the Vytal Festival. Weiss can move quickly and is creative on the battlefield, particularly with Ice Dust.\n\nWeiss' fighting style resembles fencing and ballet, where she relies on thrusts and slashes, being heavily reliant on ricocheting off either surrounding surfaces or off of her Glyphs. She relies most on her Semblance, enabling her to switch from offense, defense, support, and evasion. On top of this, it provides greater control of the fight through rapidly attacking from multiple angles to take the enemy off balance. Unlike Winter, Weiss relies more on balance, grace, and speed instead of being aggressive and direct. Learning to summon her Arma Gigas, she fights alongside the Summons, leaping from its sword or using it as a shield, proving able to summon it between glyphs.\n\nWeiss also has some skills in medical treatment. In \"War\", she helped Nora Valkyrie after she had injured herself overusing her Semblance by bandaging her up and tending to her at her bedside. However, it is insufficient in fully handling her condition.\n\nAs seen in \"The Final Word\", Weiss is capable of using guns despite never having been shown to hold any experience with them before, as she shot Cinder with three bullets using Gambol Shroud. She also showcased some skill in a dual sword style, having fought Cinder Fall using both Myrtenaster and Gambol Shroud.\n\nAlthough Ruby is usually the one who makes the team's battle plans, Weiss is the one who came up with the plan to use Emerald's Semblance against Ironwood in \"Creation\".\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Weiss would lose both her Aura and Semblance with her arrival on Earth. However, unlike her team, Weiss gained no new abilities and was simply a baseline human.\nDust Usage\n\nV2e11 glyph ice\nUsing a glyph to make an ice dome.\nMost notably, Weiss frequently utilizes Dust in battle. She has shown a preference for Ice Dust, only switching types if it provides her with an advantage, such as using Wind Dust against sonic-based attacks or creating certain types of glyphs such as black or time dilation glyphs. She has used Ice Dust to trap enemies, create a trail to push enemies from a height, create a slippery sheet of ice and form pointed ice chunks to use as projectiles.\n\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Myrtenaster\nCastle\nWeiss prepares to fight the Giant Armor\nWeiss' weapon of choice is Myrtenaster, a Multi-Action Dust Rapier. The rapier has a revolving chamber inside the guard, which has six slots in total, each of which contains a vial of powdered Dust. The revolving chamber is constantly stocked with red, cyan, purple, white, yellow, and blue Dust.\n\nWeiss utilizes the Dust in combat, either in raw form or in conjunction with her Semblance to create various effects that suit the situation. When not using Myrtenaster as a Dust supplier, Weiss utilizes her speed to dodge attacks and her sword to deliver damage through quick thrusts that leave little room for counters.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", Weiss took up the katana blade of Gambol Shroud after Blake Belladonna and Ruby Rose were thrown into the abyss of the Evacuation dimension during her last stand against Cinder.\n\nIn Justice League x RWBY: Super Heroes and Huntsmen, Part Two, Weiss would use a freeze gun created by Mr. Freeze, which could shoot blue beams that create ice upon hitting a target. Though due to being in storage for to long, it ran out of power, forcing Weiss to discard it.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Glyphs\n1110 The Badge and The Burden Pt.2 02929\nHer glyph's design.\nWeiss has the Schnee family Semblance of Glyphs, allowing her to create glyphs that can be used in a variety of ways: create a slippery platform to skate on at high speed, generate midair platforms to manipulate her trajectory in the air and perform limited time dilation that can speed up actions[11], to name a few.\n\nShe has gained more control over her Semblance upon her arrival in Atlas. During her fight against Marrow Amin in \"With Friends Like These\", she could use her glyphs to create several ice spikes to simultaneously speed up and throw the ice as makeshift spears while summoning her Arma Gigas.\n\nSummoning\n\nWith mastery, a Schnee also can summon avatars of the foes that they have defeated. While these avatars have the appearance of Grimm, they do not possess the same weaknesses. For instance, they are unaffected by the light from Silver Eyes.\n\nIn \"Lessons Learned\", Winter specifies that the summoned foe had to have caused the Schnee to push past who they were and become who they are now.\n\nWeiss' Summons:\n\nArma Gigas\nBoarbatusk\nQueen Lancer\nNevermore\nImage Gallery\n\nWeiss summoning her Arma Gigas\nWeiss summoning her Arma Gigas\nWeiss summoning her Queen Lancer\nWeiss summoning her Queen Lancer\nWeiss' full Nevermore avatar.\nWeiss' full Nevermore avatar.\nWeiss summoning a Boarbatusk\nWeiss summoning a Boarbatusk\nWeiss attempting to summon her Nevermore\nWeiss attempting to summon her Nevermore\nWeaknesses\n\nV2 11 00055\nLack of stamina and endurance cause Weiss' defeat by the White Fang Lieutenant\nWeiss has poor endurance and stamina, as seen in \"The Emerald Forest\" after Ruby and Weiss are forced to retreat from a pack of Beowolves after a forest fire; Weiss is shown to be panting in exhaustion while Ruby is still fully energized.\n\nThe biggest sign of her lack of endurance, however, is her inability to take heavy hits. In fact, she is the weakest out of everyone on her team, having been knocked out the most, such as by Nora Valkyrie with her watermelon hammer during the food fight, and the White Fang Lieutenant smashing her head into the ground.\n\nDespite her glyphs' durability, they have been demonstrated to be breakable, such as when she summons three black glyphs in an attempt to stop the cargo ship's crash. The ship falls far too fast or is too heavy for her, causing it to rip the glyphs apart as it falls through them.\n\nIn regards to her summons, larger ones like her Arma Gigas take greater time and effort to manifest, as shown in her duel with Vernal, who heavily exploited this weakness by constantly interrupting Weiss' attempts to bring forth the sword-wielding warrior."

She was the partner of Roman Torchwick, with the two sharing a close and possible romantic bond. Her weapon of choice was called Hush, a parasol with a concealed blade. She first appeared in \"Painting the Town...\". After the Fall of Beacon, she hunted down Cinder Fall in revenge for Roman's death, but subsequently joined forces with her, shifting her target to Ruby Rose.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", she was betrayed by Cinder in the Central Location and knocked into the void, finding herself in the Ever After. She is the secondary antagonist of Volume 9.\n\nIn \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", she got possessed by the Curious Cat (becoming the NeoCat) after driving Ruby to ascend, who intended on using her body to leave the Ever After.\n\nAfter killing the Curious Cat in \"Of Solitude and Self\", she chose to stay in the Ever After instead of returning to Remnant, undergoing ascension.\n\nNeo was also featured as one of the main characters in the novel, RWBY: Roman Holiday.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the original name of the character Neopolitan in RWBY? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Neopolitan and Roman Torchwick? toggle section\nWhat is the name of Neopolitan's weapon in RWBY? toggle section\nWho does Neopolitan seek revenge from after the Fall of Beacon? toggle section\nWho becomes Neopolitan's new target after joining forces with Cinder Fall? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n1/2\n\n\nNeo, themed after Neapolitan ice cream, had the appropriate trio of colors in her hair and on her outfit. While sometimes altered via illusion for disguise, her hair color was typically half pink and half brown, with white streaks on the pink side. As of Volume 6, Neo's hair was also styled differently. It was noticeably thicker with a slight wave to it along with shorter bangs and missing her white streaks. The white streaks appeared as an emotional reaction to her parents' deaths in Roman Holiday.[11]\n\nNeo's natural eye color changed between brown, pale pink, and white, and they could alternate coloration in differing combinations, with this ability apparently being entirely under her control. Neo appeared to have a condition known as heterochromia iridum, where the eyes of a subject have two different colors. In her case, it was complete heterochromia, where one iris in its entirety was a different color from the other. During her childhood, her left eye was pink, and her right eye was brown.[12] In Volume 3, she was seen wearing green eyeshadow, starting with her paramedic disguise.\n\nDespite being in her twenties by the start of RWBY, Neo was also rather diminutive in stature, compared to the rest of the main cast, including Ruby Rose, as shown in the height chart presented by Monty Oum. This was demonstrated in \"No Brakes\", when she stood up against Yang Xiao Long, as Neo was only able to reach her chin despite wearing high heels.\nOriginal (Volumes 2-6)\n\nV2 11 00041\nNeo wore a white cropped wide, broad tailed jacket with a pink interior, collar, a single pink button and large pink cuffs. She wore skintight brown leather-latex pants with a dark belt that had a gray buckle and an additional narrow belt under it. Under her jacket was a brown over bust whalebone corset, curved in the middle and at the bottom, which exposed her hips. She also wore a multitude of black beaded necklaces, which hung haphazardly around her neck. Neo also wore black and white spat styled under the knee boots alongside black gloves.\n\n\nNeo with Roman's hat\nIn \"The Coming Storm\", Neo went through a slight outfit change: she wore Roman's hat, seemingly in remembrance of him, and her clothing was shown to have been torn up over the time since her last appearance, especially on her jacket's left shoulder that revealed a broad shoulder strap of her corset, her coattail and leggings. During her fight with Cinder in this episode, she hid the damage and Roman's hat with an illusion until they moved the fight into an alley.\n\nPost-Timeskip (Volume 6–Current)\n\nV7 13 00006\nIn \"Our Way\", Neo sported a new outfit while still wearing Roman's hat. It consisted of a chocolate brown jacket that starts just below her shoulders and above her chest and had a pink interior, two brown belt shoulder straps and twin gray button seams. She wore a gray scarf similar to Roman's, and a white three gray button-up vest style top that was strapless and cropped exposing her midriff. She also wore a pair of chocolate brown detached sleeves with puffy tops and pink trim alongside a pair of white funnel cuffed gloves with gray button detailing. She also wore skintight white belted leather-latex pants and black and white spat styled ankle boots with cutout detail just above the ankle. The back of Neo's jacket was shown to have a small, coned ice cream key chain that was usually covered by her hair.\n\nNotably, Neo's eyes no longer switched colors between each other in her natural state, while she kept her green eye shadow.\n\nTrivia Vanille\n\nPrior to going by Neopolitan, Trivia Vanille originally had only brown hair but maintained the pink and brown heterochromia in her eyes. In public, her parents made her wear colored contact lens that made both eyes appear brown. At the time, she wore her hair in pigtails, and her clothes consisted of a brown dress with dark brown cuffs and a white collar with a black ribbon attached to the collar with matching ribbons in her pigtails.[12] At the age of twelve, she also had an \"adventuring outfit\" consisting of a white tank top, brown blazer and matching pants alongside white sneakers with pink hearts.\n\nNeoCat\n\nV9 09 00087\nNeo after getting body snatched by the Cat.\nAfter becoming possessed by the Curious Cat, Neo's body briefly underwent a transformation. Her eyes became those of the Cat's in their normal form, with a light blue sclera and white pupils and her teeth also became much more jagged and sharp. Later, her arms were changed into large light blue claws, partially tearing her sleeves in the process.\n\nShe later changed back to her original form after the Curious Cat had left her body.\n\nDisguises\n\nTournament\nTournament\nAtlas Military Uniform\nAtlas Military Uniform\nRuby disguise\nRuby disguise\nNora disguise\nNora disguise\nBackground camouflage\nBackground camouflage\nYang disguise\nYang disguise\nParamedic\nParamedic\nSchnee Waitress\nSchnee Waitress\nOscar disguise\nOscar disguise\nAtlas Officer\nAtlas Officer\nCivilian\nCivilian\nPenny disguise\nPenny disguise\nCinder disguise\nCinder disguise\nWhile participating in the Vytal Festival Tournament, Neo had a completely different appearance. Her hair was black with lighter streaks where her white streaks would normally be, and her default eye color was green, though she could change it to pink, brown or white at any time. Her hair was done up in a twin tail hairstyle with white bows and her bangs were still in the same usual style from her original appearance.\n\nShe wore an outfit with a black and white color scheme. Her attire consisted of a sleeveless black blouse with white frills on the chest and collar and a black ribbon bow hanging from the front of the collar. The blouse exposed her midriff, and she wore medium-length black armbands on both of her wrists. Along with the blouse, she wore a knee-length skirt fastened with a white belt. She wore black shoes with a triple tomoe emblem, a mitsudomoe, on the soles, with white legwarmers. Later, in RWBY: Amity Arena, it was revealed that she wore large, thick white socks over her shoes.\n\nIn \"Beginning of the End\", she disguised herself in a paramedic uniform, with a cap on top of her short hair, and her eye color changed to magenta. In \"PvP\", she assumed her regular appearance but donned the uniform of an Atlas Military officer. In \"Our Way\", Neo was briefly seen in a Mistral Police uniform. In \"Cordially Invited\" and \"As Above, So Below\", Neo disguised herself in a Schnee waitress uniform with black shoulder-length hair clipped with two barrettes and green eyes.\n\nIn \"Out in the Open\", it was shown that Neo could disguise herself as already existing characters i.e., Ruby Rose. In \"With Friends Like These\", Neo was shown to be capable of taking on forms of different genders as she took on the appearance of Oscar, however she had never been seen impersonating anyone with extreme size or build differences.\n\nIn \"Witch\", Neo showcased the ability to camouflage herself as inanimate objects, as she turned herself into a wall of Monstra to steal the Relic of Knowledge.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nOutfits\n\nTrivia Vanille\nTrivia Vanille\nOriginal\nOriginal\nAtlas outfit\nAtlas outfit\nAn older Trivia without her brown contact lens\nAn older Trivia without her brown contact lens\nNeo's ruined Vale attire\nNeo's ruined Vale attire\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nUnlike Roman Torchwick, who appeared as a cold and calculating career criminal, Neo was a more unstable unpredictable dangerous killer.\n\nNeo was a mute who cannot speak since birth and as such communicated purely through body language, miming, or text messages. [12]\n\nNeo was stated to be cruel, vicious, and sadistic, as seen in her smile as she prepared to stab Yang in \"No Brakes\", as well as in \"Round One\" when she proceeded to brutally stomp on her opponents face with a cruel smile despite him being physically unable to continue their match. [13] However, she did seem to exhibit fear and hesitance when she knew she was outmatched, fleeing if her opponent proved to be as such. This could be seen when Raven Branwen appeared and engaged her on the White Fang cargo train. She was rather perceptive and was able to recognize superior abilities to her own, despite her confidence. Neo was also seen to have a vengeful side by her attempt to kill Cinder Fall in \"The Coming Storm\" for her part in Roman Torchwick's death, only stopping when she revealed her Maiden powers.\n\nNeo was highly determined when she set her mind to a task, often dealing with any problems presented to her efficiently and competently. During her battle against Team JNPR, Neo took notice of Lie Ren's protectiveness of Nora Valkyrie and took advantage of that by transforming into her using her Semblance to make him hesitate. She also used Emerald Sustrai and Hazel Rainarts's escape as a cover to steal the Relic of Knowledge and skip away in the dust cloud created from Monstra's explosion.\n\nAdditionally, she was extremely ruthless, easily turning to violence as a means of achieving her goals and often doing so with a playful demeanor. In \"Worthy\", she alongside Cinder and Arthur Watts had assaulted the people stationed at the Atlas Command Center.[14]\n\nNeo possessed a desire to be validated whenever she accomplishes a task, as well as to be treated as an equal by a partner or superior. She was happy with working with Roman, as he often acknowledged her for completing a job. However, while working for Cinder, she was irritated by her lack of recognition or respect towards her. She was further angered when Cinder took the Relic of Knowledge from her without a word of gratitude and failed to give her credit for successfully stealing the Relic, as well as taking credit for her accomplishments to redeem herself before Salem. These actions eventually resulted in her going against Cinder's orders for her own wishes.\n\nNeo was extremely loyal to Roman and very close with him. She willingly carried out his demands and he was the only one she did not show contempt towards. Likewise, Roman never got upset with Neo like he did with others, and they were very proficient in wordlessly coordinating attacks. Neo was shown to be devastated after his death, and wears Roman's hat in memory of him. She is solely driven by a need to exact revenge for what happened to him and has gone to near suicidal lengths to do so, including facing Cinder alone. Neo had a previously lonely life until she met Roman, and after his death her life returned to said state. This is illustrated by her disheveled appearance in \"The Coming Storm\".\n\nLater, Neo took fights slightly more seriously becoming even more sadistic, cruel, and merciless than before. Previously, during her V2 fight with Yang, Neo toyed with her before knocking the girl unconscious and afterwards unsheathing Hush. Similarly, in her V3 fight against Ruby, Neo opted not to use her sword to fight, and later used it to threaten Ruby, which ultimately turned out to be her undoing when she used Hush to send her flying. Comparatively, in current fights, while she continued to mock her opponents, Neo used her blade more frequently and is shown dispatching foes much more quickly and not dragging out finishing moves any longer than necessary. It's implied that this notable change in behavior may be a result either of her perceived feelings of guilt for having failed Roman when he needed her the most, frustration at all of the constant delays towards avenging him, growing fed-up with all of the ridiculous situations she's found herself in or even a combination of all three.\n\nIn RWBY: Roman Holiday, it is shown that Neo was abused by her father and mother for not being the perfect child, due to her inability to speak, heterochromia, and unruly behavior. She had an imaginary friend named \"Neopolitan\", who she subconsciously used as a scapegoat to take the blame for her own rebellious desires that she had externalized. This was due to her parents simultaneously punishing her for her wants while not taking them seriously, as well as her loneliness and desire to be free—\"Neopolitan\" was everything Trivia had wanted to be.\n\nEventually, Trivia realized that \"Neopolitan\" was an externalization of her own desires—that she and \"Neopolitan\" were one and the same. All the violently lashing out at those who wronged her, rule-breaking and illegal activities, taunting, freedom and danger \"Neopolitan\" had pursued was just what Trivia had wanted, but felt she wasn't allowed to after a series of events—including her introducing herself as Neopolitan rather than Trivia to Roman, which she felt was \"right\" and gave her \"a fresh start\", with the metaphorical final straw being her mother physically shattering the illusion of \"Neopolitan\" conjured by Overactive Imagination in front of Trivia. When Trivia took on her new identity and name as Neopolitan, she viciously and fervently enforced her own wants and whims in contradiction to how long she'd been forced to repress them. Similarly, she took great pride in herself and cared little of how other people perceived or felt about her, in contrast to how her parents had insisted their image mattered more than anything else, including Neo's desires.\n\nAt the end of Roman Holiday, during the fight at the Vanille Estate involving Neo, Roman Torchwick, Senior Xiong, and Lil' Miss Malachite, Neo made a split-second decision to trick Lil' Miss into triggering a Dust explosion on the third floor in order to escape the fight, though the explosion ended up unintentionally killing her father and she suspected also her mother. This was Neo's first experience with the death of someone known to her, uncertain of how to react and feeling that it didn't affect her, although she gains her iconic white stripes in her hair at this time, indicating she was impacted by their deaths no matter what she thought. Her inability to legitimately process her parents' deaths was indicative of her larger inability to handle grief, as further shown by her single-minded revenge driven handling of Roman's death.\n\nIn “Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble”, after she drove Ruby to ascend in the Ever After, she became a broken and emotionless person herself as she realized she only wanted revenge, not to conquer the Ever After, and now that she achieved it, she no longer had a purpose. She became so broken that the Curious Cat was able to take over her body to fulfill their own agenda.\n\nIn “Of Solitude and Self”, Neo was released from the Curious Cat’s control and upon being exposed to the smoke of the Great Tree’s leaves, Neo was shown to have gone through significant emotional growth, as she eventually realized that revenge wouldn’t make her happy, nor fill the emptiness in her heart and would only consume her entirely, leaving her with nothing. The entire experience in the Ever After caused Neo to finally let go of the past, by letting go of Roman and accepting his death, as instead of trying to continue attacking Ruby or her friends, she decided to go through Ascension in order to find a new purpose for herself and become something new.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nIn \"No Brakes\", Neo proved herself to be a highly skilled combatant, able to defeat Yang in a one-on-one fight, seemingly playing with her opponent as she was able to defeat her without taking anything more than a glancing hit. Her fighting style was highly evasive, dodging, deflecting or maneuvering around her opponent's strikes until she had exhausted them, or was ready for a counterattack. Neo also displayed incredible reflexes and speed, dodging several of Yang's attacks with ease, even when holding her umbrella in one hand.\n\nThis was further shown in \"Heroes and Monsters\" where she was easily able to keep up with and defeat Ruby almost single-handedly, and in her fight with Cinder in \"The Coming Storm\", with Neo taking two hits and delivering four back to Cinder in a mostly even fight, only backing down when Cinder resorted to the use of her Maiden Powers. Cinder also commented Neo had 'grown stronger'. An example of that was shown in \"The Enemy of Trust\" with despite being completely outnumbered by both Oscar and Team JNR, she easily evaded, parried and dodged their attacks and overpowered and outmaneuvered them with quick and powerful strikes while doing so in a joking manner, hinting that Neo herself was not taking them seriously and was toying with them during the majority of their battle.\n\nNeo had also displayed herself to be very acrobatic and exceptionally skilled in hand-to-hand combat relying on her agility to dodge and misdirect enemy movements and attacks, before retaliating with her own kick-based attacks resembling Bartitsu with the way she blocked with her parasol, and Capoeira with her acrobatic kicks. She learned this as a student at Lady Browning’s Preparatory Academy for Girls, where they had a secret program for training chosen students to be assassins with a wide variety of classes in fencing, self-defense, and escape artistry. Neo excelled in all these classes and even trained under a rogue Huntress, her skills reaching the point that she could stand up against the Malachite sisters when they tried to stop her from escaping the academy.\n\nHowever, Neo had also been shown to immediately back out of a fight she knew she couldn't win. She instantly retreated upon seeing Raven in \"No Brakes\" and stopped attacking Cinder in \"The Coming Storm\" when she activated her Maiden powers, despite instigating the fight in the first place. It also appeared that she had more difficulty against opponents equipped with a melee weapon, as opposed to barehanded fighters; she easily bested Yang in \"No Brakes\" but had a more even contest against Ruby in \"Heroes and Monsters\" until Roman arrived to reinforce her. During her fight with Cinder in \"The Coming Storm\", Neo initially held the initiative, but Cinder gradually gained the advantage once she equipped herself with dual swords. During her duel with Maria Calavera, Neo was consistently outmatched until Maria became distracted. When she faced Ruby again in \"Worthy\" and \"The Final Word\", she held the initiative, but fell for Ruby's attempt to goad her, lashing out in anger that enabled Ruby to get the better of her.\n\nWhile using her weapon in sword form, Neo has displayed a sword style similar to Victorian Age fencing, as seen during her battle against Team JNPR and Oscar, where Neo held one of her hands behind her back as she made several swift sword stabs, jabs and swipes at her opponents. Notably, during her first few appearances, Neo never used Hush's blade to fight, only to down fallen opponents like Yang. Later, she is seen using it once, for a split second against Cinder and afterwards begins employing it regularly in fights.\n\nBy Volume 8, Neo's combat skills became powerful enough that she could easily fight multiple skilled opponents simultaneously. In \"Worthy\", she was able to fight against both Ruby Rose and Blake Belladonna and largely keep them on the defensive.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Hush\nV9 10 00131\nNeo holding Hush as part of her chrysalis\nNeo's weapon of choice was Hush (a custom-made gift from Roman),[9] a parasol containing a long, thin blade hidden within the length of the parasol's tube, which could also project the blade's tip from the top end of it. The canopy of the parasol was made of an extremely dense, durable fabric that could repel minor Dust explosions, allowing Neo to use it as a shield or a glider. Unlike many of the weapons shown in RWBY, Hush did not appear to contain a concealed firearm or projectile weapon, therefore it could only be used for close quarters fighting.\n\nIn \"Of Solitude and Self\", it became a part of her wooden chrysalis when she ascended.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Overactive Imagination\nNeo illusions\nYang shatters the illusion wall\nNeo's Semblance, Overactive Imagination, allowed her to create \"physical illusions that can be seen by everyone\", as opposed to Emerald's Hallucinations, which usually only affect the person(s) she targets.[15] These illusions were highly convincing and shattered like glass when she dispelled them, or someone broke them. Her most apparent use of them was creating illusions around her body, either to disguise herself or for her opponent to target while she escaped or moved unseen to another point of attack. They also seemed to be somewhat resilient to damage. While fighting Cinder, the illusion concealing Neo’s outfit was not dispelled even after taking or landing some hits. This was revised however in Volume 7, as her disguise was dispelled upon receiving a punch from Oscar. Additionally, in later volumes, she has learned to use her Semblance for psychological manipulation, exploiting the appearance of close friends and families in her enemies to torment and overpower them.\n\nV6 13 00006\nNeo disguising an entire Mistral Airship as an Atlas Manta\nIn \"Our Way\", Neo displayed her new mastery over her Semblance, where she managed to completely disguise an entire Mistral Airship to physically resemble an Atlas one, implying that she could maintain the facade long enough to fool the Atlas Military and cross the continental border checkpoint into Atlas.\n\nNeo also used her Semblance when communicating with others in lieu of her muteness, as seen in \"Out in the Open\" where she transformed into Ruby when arguing what to prioritize with Cinder.\n\nInitially, unlike Emerald's hallucinations, Neo's illusions did not affect a person's hearing, as she was not able to mimic sound or voices; thus, if she was disguised and someone tried to talk to her, her muteness might give her away. Before her time in the Ever After, her illusions also seemed to be limited in their range; they typically only covered Neo herself, and either a short distance around her or something she was touching, such as the Mistral airship that she disguised as an Atlesian Airship in \"Our Way\". However, as seen in her battles against Yang, Ruby and Cinder, she could maintain an illusion after moving away- until something made contact with it, after which the illusion will shatter.\n\nAs shown in \"Witch\", Neo herself had showcased the ability to create a camouflage illusion across her entire body in order to hide in plain sight. She altered her physical appearance, completely blending in with the dark crimson colors of Monstra's walls. Doing so, Neo was able to observe Oscar, Emerald, and Hazel accessing the Relic of Knowledge.\n\nV9 03 00159\nNeo Clones\nIn “Rude, Red, and Royal”, Neo’s Semblance evolved further, where she now had the ability to make multiple copies of herself. These clones were semi-autonomous, able to either copy movements of Neo or perform commands given by her. She could also control them at will and the clones themselves retained the ability to physically attack others, such as the Jabberwalker.\n\nV9 05 00127\nJabberwalker Clones\nIn “The Parfait Predicament”, it was shown that she could create clones of other beings as well, such as the Jabberwalker, and could even have them mimic the speech and voice of the original.\n\nAs seen in “The Perils of Paper Houses“, her Semblance could seemingly replicate another being to the point of copying their unique abilities. This is implied when the Jabberwalker clones attempted to devour Ruby, suggesting that the clones also possessed the original’s ability to permanently kill a Afteran by eating them, though this is currently unconfirmed.\n\nIn \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", Neo created clones of Penny Polendina, Pyrrha Nikos, Ozpin, Leonardo Lionheart, Clover Ebi, James Ironwood, Oscar Pine and Roman Torchwick. Her clones were able to perfectly replicate their voice, facial expressions and even to a degree, their personalities and fighting styles. She could also construct complex constructs such as appliances and even entire buildings, having replicated a copy of the Vanille Manor, complete with functioning lights and furniture and portraits of her memories. She could even create functioning weapons using her Semblance, as shown where she recreated Miló and Akoúo̱, Floating Array, The Long Memory, Stalwart, Melodic Cudgel, Due Process, had Milo and Akouo, Due Process, Melodic Cudgel and Stalwart fire rounds, and Milo and Akouo change forms.\n\nV9 08 00046\nNeo speaking through her clones\nFurthermore, as implied in \"The Perils of Paper Houses\", Neo possessed a connection to her constructs and could project her psyche through them, first shown where she remotely transformed one of her Jabberwalker clones into herself to send Ruby a message of her targeting her. Later, she projected her thoughts and feelings through her clones of Ruby’s friends and acquaintances, signified when their eyes turned into her heterochromia of pink and brown.\n\nNeo's power was shown at its strongest when she had her final confrontation with Ruby in \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\": she created a large Tea Room for Ruby to walk in, hosting a tea party of sorts with fallen comrades of Ruby. Her projections had enough autonomy to speak, fight and even bleed. They speak in Neo's stead, acting as a way for her to verbally communicate what she hated about Ruby and how she had personally failed them, all which quickly broke Ruby's spirit.\n\nOther Skills\n\nNeo herself proved to be a competent getaway driver and a highly skilled infiltrator, as shown in \"Beginning of the End\", where she, disguised as a paramedic, drove Cinder, Mercury Black and Emerald Sustrai away to an unknown location in an Air Bus after they initiated their plan to frame Yang.\n\nThis has been proven to be one of Neo's greatest talents, as she showed that combined with her Semblance, she could easily infiltrate military compounds no matter how well guarded or secure they are. One of the best examples was when she was shown walking through an airship full of Atlesian soldiers she presumably killed to free Roman and later Neo again showed her skills in infiltration and hijacking, when she managed to easily acquire a Mistral airship after presumably infiltrating a Mistral air base to steal it without being detected or noticed by the Kingdom's military or officials. Later she showcased that she could even easily infiltrate the highly secured Atlas Academy and later escape from it with no one noticing her at all and managed to again hijack and steal an Atlesian Manta.\n\nNeo has displayed a high level of cunning and skill in acting when using her Semblance, as seen when she observed and notices the close relationship between Lie Ren and Nora Valkyrie and was able to use it to emotionally manipulate Ren into giving her an opening to attack and escape. After her Semblance evolved, Neo’s ability to psychologically manipulate others using her Semblance had also increased, as shown where she was able to make her clones of Penny, Pyrrha, Ironwood, Ozpin and Oscar act, behave and sound like the originals to the point that they were able to effectively illicit emotional anguish from Ruby. Neo also showcased the ability to make her clones of Yang, Blake, Weiss, Jaune, Nora and Ren behave similarly realistic.\n\nWith the aid of her Semblance, Neo was shown to have expertise in pickpocketing, as she was easily able to steal the Relic of Knowledge off of Oscar without him knowing until it was too late.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlthough Neo was an exceptionally skilled melee fighter, she had a habit of dropping her guard when she decisively gained the upper hand, either out of smugness or anger; this sometimes allowed opponents to make a successful counterattack. Examples included her gloating after defeating Yang in \"No Brakes\" and Ruby in \"Heroes and Monsters\"; in both cases, this gave her opponents (Raven and Ruby) time to turn the tables on her. In \"The Final Word\", after Neo disarmed Ruby, Ruby provoked her anger over Torchwick's death, causing Neo to impulsively attack and fall straight into Ruby's trap. In \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", when Neo had Ruby at her mercy, she left herself open to a surprise attack from the Curious Cat, temporarily disrupting her attack on Ruby.\n\nShe also had a one-track mind, which while admirable in achieving her goals, presented some drawbacks. She did not care what happened to her so long as her goal was achieved, as seen in \"A Place of Particular Concern\", where she attempted to kill Ruby even while the two were falling through the void to their apparent deaths. This one-track focus also meant she did not consider what she'd do next if she ever achieved it. In \"Tea Admist Terrible Trouble, after she tortures Ruby into ascending, she falls into a catatonic state, not knowing what to do with her life now and leaving her free for the Curious Cat to possess due to her empty heart."

          ],
          "content": "USER\nVarious\nTYPE\nReincarnation\nOverview Image Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\nAscension is a process that occurs in the Ever After and is linked to the Great Tree.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nDescription\n\n\n1/2\n\n\nSimilar to concepts such as resurrection and reincarnation, Ascension occurs when an Afteran is no longer doing the assigned role that they are supposed to be. It is triggered by them losing their ways, wearing out, doubting themselves, or even just finishing their assigned tasks. Upon ascending, all Afterans are taken to the Great Tree and repurposed into someone or something else with a new identity, personality, and role in the Ever After. Their memories are erased in the process; however, their hearts do not forget their defining moments.\n\nNotable examples include the Red King and the Herbalist, who both underwent Ascension after no longer properly fulfilling their duties. The former was eventually reborn into a new being known as the Red Prince.\n\nAs revealed in “Of Solitude and Self”, the God of Light and God of Darkness were the ones originally in charge of handling the process of Ascension. However, as time went on, the Brothers quickly grew in power, and no longer bound to their role, decided to create beings who could replace them. The first was the Curious Cat, who would go around finding and “fixing” the broken parts of the Ever After, as well as and taking on their role of managing Ascension, as they can trigger the process in other Afterans. They gave the Cat numerous abilities to help them in their new role and duty, one of those was the ability to decide whether or not an Afteran is performing their roles adequately, and persuade them to continue in their role, or to send them to the tree. After the success of the Cat, the Brothers created a second being, the Jabberwalker, who could “finish what the Cat started” and provide the Afterans a way to stop ascending and die. They gave it the ability to disrupt the Ascensions of other Afterans by devouring them, preventing them from being reborn.\n\nAccording to the Curious Cat, Humans and other creatures from different worlds are unable to be properly ascended by the tree and so the results are largely unpredictable. Though this was disputed by the Blacksmith, who claimed that Ruby Rose was getting very close to Ascension at the time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nProcess\n\nV9 Trailer 00020\nRuby being confronted by a hallucination of her past self\nThe process of Ascension can begin through multiple means. As shown with Team RWBY’s meeting with the Herbalist, one way is through the Great Tree’s leaves. By inhaling the smoke from the leaves, a being would hallucinate someone important or significant to them, who then begins questioning their identities, goals and desires and tempting them at the prospect of changing, such as when Yang, Weiss, Ruby and Blake were faced with their past selves. It's been implied that if the four had accepted the proposals of these hallucinations, they would have then been swallowed into the ground by the tree's Roots and put through Ascension. After being hit with the smoke by Team RWBY and Jaune Arc, Neopolitan began her Ascension by jumping into the tree itself after letting go of Roman Torchwick for good.\n\nLater, during Neo’s plot to break Ruby, she convinced her to drink a cup of tea brewed with a leaf of the tree. Once Ruby had ingested it, she briefly glowed the same multicolored, purple, blue, green, yellow color of the leaves before being swallowed into the ground by the tree's roots. It's not clear whether or not the choice to Ascend could be rejected or not like it could with the smoke.\n\nV9 04 00108\nThe Cat giving the Herbalist “a piece of their heart”.\nAnother method to reach Ascension is through the Curious Cat. When a Afteran has a “Broken Heart” and has become unsure, confused or unhappy with their “roles”, the Curious Cat can help them by “giving them a piece of their heart”, which either convinces and assures them of their roles or convinces and causes them to go to the tree and ascend. As shown with the Herbalist, after the Cat gave him a piece of their heart and convinced them to ascend, they were immediately taken by a hole in the ground and collected by the tree’s roots after he agreed that he wasn’t following his original role anymore and needed to change.\n\nThe final method to ascend, as shown with the Paper Pleasers, is to die in the Ever After. When a Afteran’s body is destroyed their remains are stated to be blown by the wind to the Great Tree, where they automatically go through Ascension. Little also went through this method of ascension after being crushed by Neo.\n\nThe Herbalist’s chrysalis\nThe Herbalist’s chrysalis\nRuby’s chrysalis\nRuby’s chrysalis\nOnce someone accepts going through Ascension, they are immediately brought to the tree in the Central Acre of the Ever After, where they are then encased within the tree inside a wooden chrysalis, very much like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, until they finish ascending and emerge in their new form and identity.\n\nV9 09 00093\nThe Blacksmith helping and guiding Ruby’s decision on her new identity and form.\nOnce inside the Great Tree, the person seemingly meets with the Blacksmith as they are transported into her workshop that is located in an entirely separate realm within the tree. The Blacksmith then asks them on who and what they want to become in their next life. The Blacksmith then tries to guide this soul through this process and decision. As implied, once the soul decides what they want, the Blacksmith is the one in charge of creating their new form and gives them the powers and abilities they would need to help them fulfill their new purpose.\n\nHerbalist finishing his Ascension.\nHerbalist finishing his Ascension.\nHerbalist’s new form.\nHerbalist’s new form.\nWhen this process is complete, the soul emerges from their wooden chrysalis in their new form and identity, not having any memories of their previous lives but still retaining certain feelings. This is confirmed in the case of the Red Prince, where despite going through Ascension, he possesses a deep mistrust in humans and a belief that they were all cheaters due to the past experience of his original self as the Red King. The Curious Cat explained that this was due to \"the heart hardly ever forgets\", implying that despite losing their original personality and memories, an Afteran still retains certain emotional aspects of their original selves in their new incarnations. This is further shown with Little, who after Ascending, no longer had memories of their time with Ruby and her friends, but still retained their feelings of friendship with them, describing them as familiar and Ruby in particular as “like a happy dream they can’t remember” and even calling her “huntress”.\n\nRuby finishing her Ascension.\nRuby finishing her Ascension.\nRuby in her \"new\" form.\nRuby in her \"new\" form.\nFor Humans, while the person is able to choose a new identity for themselves, the process can also be an opportunity to rediscover who they truly are. Upon which, they emerge from the cocoon in their original form along with all their memories, with only a slight alteration to their appearance. This was first demonstrated by Ruby Rose, who after a great crisis of faith in herself was able to regain confidence in herself as a Huntress, thus allowing her to emerge as herself, but with all the damage she received during her fight with Neo healed up and regains her emblem pin that she previously gave away to the Teapot Lady.\n\nThere may also be a time limit with Ascension, as during Ruby's inability to decide what to be, the Blacksmith claims that Ruby's time to decide was running out. This implies that if a figure cannot figure out who or what they should be, they may forcibly be ejected or become something else altogether, though this is unconfirmed. It is very likely that the Blacksmith said that because her friends were losing against the Curious Cat.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\nAscension is described as a core process of the Ever After, being deeply intertwined in Afterans' lifestyles and culture. Due to this, it can be assumed that it has existed as long as the Ever After itself.\n\nFollowing his encounter with Alyx where he lost his game due to her cheating, the Red King was inconsolable and wavering about his role, so the tree saw fit to have him ascended to make him more resolute in his role. Following his Ascension, he became the Red Prince, who resumed his rule of the Crimson Castle, this time determined to win his game at any cost. Thus, where the King was honorable, the Prince now saw fit to cheat in his game to win no matter what.\n\nV9 04 00111\nThe Herbalist's Ascension.\nAnother Afteran who went through Ascension was the Herbalist. Team RWBY visited him in \"A Cat Most Curious\", where they asked for guidance toward the tree, which the Herbalist assumed meant they wanted his help to ascend. Using the tree's leaves, he used his mist ability to try to perform the Curious Cat's role, questioning their resolve to determine whether they are fit to ascend. While Yang, Weiss and Blake were resolute in refusing the offer to \"become someone else\", Ruby was left uncertain and depressed due to her recent defeats and perceived failures. Interrupting the process before Ruby could take the offer of Ascension, the Cat claimed the Herbalis wasn't performing his role adequately and gave him a piece of their heart to allow him to ascend and find his role again. (However, the Cat's real motivation behind disrupting the Herbalist's actions was revealed later in \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\")\n\nThis led Team RWBY to question the Curious Cat on what exactly Ascension was, and they explained the process to the team in \"The Parfait Predicament\". Soon after, Ruby Rose meets the Blacksmith, who offers her to set her burden down, seeing as she was the only one to doubt her role in the Herbalist's mist.\n\nDuring the events of \"Tea Amidst Terrible Trouble\", Neopolitan attempts to drive Ruby Rose to despair and drink tea made from a leaf from the tree to ascend. In order to do this, she uses clones of people she knew Ruby Rose failed to save in the past or that she had some role in their deaths recreated from her Semblance Overactive Imagination. Among them was Roman Torchwick, Pyrrha Nikos, Penny Polendina, Leonardo Lionheart, Clover Ebi, Ozpin and James Ironwood who she used to beat Ruby physically and mentally while calling her out for her actions ever since she started at Beacon Academy. She also used clones of her friends Oscar Pine, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, Yang Xiao Long, Jaune Arc, Lie Ren, Nora Valkyrie and Qrow Branwen to torment her into drinking the tea as well. Eventually, after Ruby witnesses Neo smashing her heel on Little and killing them, she finally ends up being driven to despair and drinks the tea to ascend right as the real Weiss, Blake, Yang and Jaune arrive.\n\nIn \"A Tale Involving a Tree\" WBY, Jaune and Juniper finally reach the Tree after Jaune found acceptance in his inability to save everyone. There they found the wooden chrysalises of the Herbalist and Ruby. Yang attempted to free her sister from the Tree, but Jaune stopped her, finally understanding that Ruby's Ascension was up to her and not them. Shortly later the group witnesses the Herbalist break free from his wooden shell, revealing him to have gained legs and wings from his Ascension. This helps Blake convince Yang to accept Ruby’s Ascension, despite the reality upsetting them both.\n\nAfter choosing a representation of Crescent Rose, Ruby emerged from the tree as herself. Following the defeat of the Curious Cat, Neo jumped into the tree to undergo an Ascension of her own while Little emerged, having ascended into a new mouse dubbed \"Somewhat\" by Ruby."

She is a member of Salem's Inner Circle and was the leader of her own faction. She is also the current Fall Maiden. Her machinations are the driving force behind the events of the first three volumes and cemented her as the main antagonist of the Beacon Arc. She made her debut in the first episode of Volume 1, \"Ruby Rose\".\n\nCinder used a special Grimm glove to steal half of the Fall Maiden's powers from Amber. During the Fall of Beacon, she gained the other half and killed Ozpin in battle.\n\nWhen Beacon fell, Ruby Rose unleashed the power of her Silver Eyes, putting Cinder into a state of near death and causing her to lose her left eye and part of her left arm. She had incredible difficulty speaking for a time, and her entire left arm was eventually replaced with a Shadow Hand.\n\nAfter narrowly surviving a defeat by Raven Branwen, Cinder allied herself with Neopolitan, one of her former associates, in order to eliminate their shared enemy against the orders of Salem. She later succeeded in getting the Relic of Knowledge thanks to Neo and returned to Salem on Monstra.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", Cinder obtains the Relic of Creation and the Relic of Knowledge, and sends Team RWBY, Jaune Arc and Neo falling into the void. Afterwards, she delivers both Relics to Salem.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat role does Cinder Fall play in the RWBY series? toggle section\nHow did Cinder Fall become the Fall Maiden? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of Cinder's Grimm glove in RWBY? toggle section\nWho is the main antagonist of the Beacon Arc in RWBY? toggle section\nWhat is Salem's Inner Circle and how is Cinder Fall associated with it? toggle section\nAppearance\n\n\n00:00\n\n41:20\n\n1101 Ruby Rose 10751\nCinder's tattoo\nCinder is a fair-skinned young woman with bright amber eyes and long, ashen-black hair that covers her left eye and rests over her left shoulder. On her upper back she has a black tattoo of her emblem: a pair of high heel shoes placed sole-to-sole, forming a heart shape inside. Her fingernails are painted dark red. In \"Black and White\", she wears lipstick and violet eyeshadow.\nOriginal Outfit (Dustweave Vestments, Volumes 1–3)\n\nV3 11 00131\nShe wears a dark red, long-sleeved, off-the-shoulders, V-neck minidress with a quadrant-shaped keyhole on the upper back framing her tattoo and two laces tied together across the neckline. Golden regal designs decorate the dress around the keyhole, across the chest, and down the sleeves which end in loops around her middle fingers. The dress splits from her right hip down, and has a tapered tail ending just above her knees. The hem is trimmed with black lace.\n\nShe wears black, lace-up shorts underneath her dress as well as a black choker around her neck. She also has dark, glass, high-heeled shoes.\n\nMounted on her right hip where the dress splits is a brooch consisting of a black, rhombus-shaped gem set within a gold metal frame with several iridescent blue and green feathers radiating out from it. She has a gold hoop earring with a black gem dangling from it on her right ear, and a jeweled anklet around her right leg.\n\nThe designs on the dress glow bright orange whenever she uses the Dust that is sewn into them. Her eyes and earring also glow.\n\nIt is possible that her appearance is influenced by East Asian culture, as the aforementioned regal designs are styled similarly to traditional Japanese or Chinese patterns.\n\nHer clothes throughout Volumes 1-3 are referred to as Dustweave Vestments in RWBY: Combat Ready, seemingly confirming they have been woven with Dust in them.[9]\n\nHaven Uniform\n\nWhen undercover at Beacon, Cinder is seen wearing the uniform of Haven Academy, a more conservative dark gray outfit with a long-sleeved collared top and white armband. Unlike most female students, who wear silver knee-high socks, Cinder wears black tights.\n\nInfiltration Outfit\n\nDuring her infiltration of the Cross Continental Transmit System Tower, Cinder is shown wearing a black infiltration outfit, which she had previously been seen sewing together in \"Extracurricular\".[10] The outfit consists of a sleeveless jacket, long gloves, stiletto heel boots, a black glass mask and several straps with containers of powdered Dust lined across her pants. The gloves, boots and pants have black mosaic designs that are infused with Dust that glows bright orange when in use. When needed, Cinder can instantly transform her infiltration attire into a formal black evening gown that has black glass[11] designs on it.\n\nTournament\n\n1301 Volume 3 Trailer 0964\nWhen attending the Vytal Festival Tournament, she wears gray pants and boots, a beige leather sleeveless jacket with light-beige details, brown gloves, a sarashi tied around her chest and another around her hips, and a pauldron on her left shoulder. She also wears a belt around her waist which has multiple brown pouches attached to it. Her fingernails are painted with tan nail polish.\n\nFlashback\n\nV3e7 cinder scouting\nDuring the events of \"Beginning of the End\", Cinder had shorter hair. Her previous attire looks similar to her original outfit except that her dress has separated sleeves and the dress is held up by straps tied around her neck in a bow. Her heeled shoes are made of a more typical material, rather than glass. She did not have her characteristic tattoo until after she stole a portion of Amber's Maiden powers. Her fingernails are a dark red color.\n\nMistral Outfit (Volumes 4–6)\n\nV5e11 cinder spear\nAfter the timeskip following the Fall of Beacon, Cinder's appearance went through a drastic change. Her hair is much shorter and she wears a mask that appears to be made of black glass over her missing left eye and the scarring from said injury extends into a slight x-shape over the bridge of her nose, as well as having deformed and degraded the tissue of her left ear.\n\nShe wears a long, dark red, velvet dress with one long, wide sleeve hiding her left arm. The collar and the opening for the right arm are trimmed with gold piping, and the dress is decorated with golden regal designs from the collar over the left shoulder and down the left sleeve. The right side of the dress is split from the hip down with two gold-colored straps made of interwoven ropes connecting the front half to the back half of her thigh. Under the dress, she appears to wear black pantyhose. On her right arm she wears a gray, opera-length glove with gold metal trim atop the cuff with curved, branching extensions up her arm. She retains her glass high heels.\n\nThe brooch on her right hip has changed; the feathers are colored a cyan-magenta gradient and are arranged in an array facing downward. Her previous earring has been replaced by one with a black hoop and a larger gem, and there is a new black hoop earring higher up.\n\n\nCinder's Shadow Hand\nIn \"Vault of the Spring Maiden\", Cinder reveals that her left arm has been replaced with a Shadow Hand grafted halfway up her upper arm where there is a significant amount of scarring. The appendage resembles that of a Geist, with a skeletal forearm and long, sharp claws. The arm is also capable of stretching great distances, and periodically emits black smoke.\n\nMistral Disguise (Volume 6)\n\nAfter the Battle of Haven, Cinder kills a woman passerby and takes her cloak; a light brown robe worn over a white shirt and pants with a shawl, sash and skirt of a matching dark brown color, with black socks and light brown sandals. Her left Grimm arm is wrapped in bandages, and she no longer wears her black mask or nail polish.\n\nAtlas Outfit (Volume 6-Current)\n\n\nBeginning in \"Our Way\", Cinder dresses in a black, one-sleeved bodysuit with a gold zip on the right, and two gold notches and gold trim on its rounded, stand-up collar. Slung around her hips are two crisscrossing belts, one narrower and with gold trim while the other has a gold-trimmed pouch on the left buttock, with a third belt around her left thigh at an angle.\n\nOn her right arm, a black armband carries a small pouch with gold trim over bandages wrapped around her bicep, and there is a long, black wristband extending partway up her forearm. An opera-length glove on her left arm overlaps the sleeve of her bodysuit to completely cover her Shadow Hand. The glove is embellished with a gold line that encircles its slightly-flared upper cuff and transitions into a shape reminiscent of a downward-pointing arrowhead on the lateral side. Additionally, the glove appears to be made of an elastic material allowing it to stretch with the arm, as demonstrated in \"The Enemy of Trust\", and conform to its claws. She also wears black, thigh-high, lace-up, high-heeled boots with red soles and decorative cuffs resembling flowers.\n\nHer outfit is usually mostly covered by a black shoulder cape with gold trim worn over her left arm and capable of slinging behind her back to allow for more mobility.\n\nFrom her previous attire, she retains the feather brooch which now occupies the right side of her chest attached to a gold cord draped atop her cape, as well as her two earrings. In place of the glass mask that once covered her left eye is a large eyepatch secured by two straps running above and below her right eye.\n\nShe appears to have put blush on her cheeks, as seen in \"Out in the Open\".\n\n\nCinder's Shadow Hand, having spread up to her shoulder\nThe Shadow Hand replacing Cinder's left arm appears to have extended up to her shoulder, as shown in \"The Enemy of Trust\" and onward. Moreover, it appears the scars on her arm have gone through change, now having a raw appearance.[12] Following her battle with Winter and Penny, she loses the glove along with the sleeve covering her arm, exposing her Shadow Hand.\n\nYoung\n\nIn her youth, Cinder wore her hair in two messy bunches, or \"conytails\"[13], which left short, dangling bangs over her left eyebrow. She wore a white shirt with a red apron, black pants and black shoes. Notably, her left index finger and right wrist were covered in bandages.\n\nCinder was also shown to be noticeably haggard and gaunt looking during her early childhood, as is seen when she is shown to be noticeably thinner, her cheeks more sunken, her eyes having deep black bags underneath them and she often had a tired expression on her face. All clear signs of her mistreatment within the Children's Home in Mistral, where she was likely overworked and underfed.\n\nGlass Unicorn Uniform\n\nIn her late childhood and early teens, Cinder primarily wore a uniform issued to her by her \"Step-Mother\" as a \"employee\" for her hotel, the Glass Unicorn. Her outfit consisted of a white shirt with grey laces as well as grey pants and shoes. As seen during her time growing up in the hotel, she would usually tie her hair into a single bun on the back of her head.\n\nAfter Cinder killed her abusive step-family and Rhodes, she rips off the shock necklace she was wearing while she was working at the Glass Unicorn and has a noticeable scar where it was on her neck.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nChild (10 years old)\nChild (10 years old)\nThe scar around Cinder's neck\nThe scar around Cinder's neck\nSilhouette from Volume 1 intro\nSilhouette from Volume 1 intro\nUniform\nUniform\nProm\nProm\nParamedic\nParamedic\nGrimm Arm exposed\nGrimm Arm exposed\nMistral Disguise\nMistral Disguise\nAtlas Outfit, without the cape in front\nAtlas Outfit, without the cape in front\nAs a teenager under the Glass Unicorn\nAs a teenager under the Glass Unicorn\nVolume 3 Flashback\nVolume 3 Flashback\nVale - note the makeup she wore in Volume 1\nVale - note the makeup she wore in Volume 1\nStealth\nStealth\nTournament\nTournament\nMistral Outfit\nMistral Outfit\nScar from Ruby's Silver Eyes\nScar from Ruby's Silver Eyes\nAtlas Outfit\nAtlas Outfit\nAtlas Outfit, full body with Grimm Arm\nAtlas Outfit, full body with Grimm Arm\nAfter Winter cut off her Grimm Arm\nAfter Winter cut off her Grimm Arm\nAtlas Disguise\nAtlas Disguise\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nCinder is ruthless and sadistic, as demonstrated when she delivers a killing blow to a clearly defeated Pyrrha Nikos in \"End of the Beginning\" and when she throws a spear at a defenseless Weiss Schnee in \"The More the Merrier\". She is relentlessly driven to gain power and determined to cross any line to obtain it. Cinder demonstrates a cunning that shows in her successful manipulation of events and people throughout the first three volumes. Cinder is also arrogant and egomaniacal and, as such, relishes in dominance and gloating, displaying shameless pleasure in the misery she has caused others. She believes that the power she is after is owed to her, having been promised godlike abilities and the Maiden powers by Salem.[14]\n\nShe also seems to be ambitious and demanding in the role of a leader, expecting her subordinates to execute exactly as she wishes with what little she gives them. She does not seem to tolerate failure, preferring for her goals to be successful regardless of the situation. Cinder prefers that such problems be solved quickly, is seen to give very direct orders, and keeps her subordinates on a strictly need-to-know basis, sharing a similar leadership style to Salem. However, she does display a cunning streak, as her allegiance revolves around having Neopolitan kill Ruby Rose so Cinder will not be going against Salem's orders to not kill her.\n\nUsually, she maintains a calm and collected demeanor and is willing to take over a fight if necessary. In the rare occurrence in which she is caught off guard, Cinder's monumental temper surfaces, showing her immense shock and outrage. This is most notable when Jaune Arc just barely nicks the edge of her mask during the Battle of Haven resulting in Cinder flying into a childish rage and start to yell and make threats. This explosive response to even the slightest attack on her shows Cinder's intolerance of fear, leading her to react poorly when others see her feel it. Cinder seeks to be feared and therefore detests being made to feel fear by both her enemies and her superiors alike. Additionally, Cinder is stated to be jealous of those with natural talents.[15]\n\nWhen Cinder first obtained the Fall Maiden powers, she saw it similarly to a brand-new toy that made her feel like she was the best and strongest. Because of this, she became addicted to the feeling and stopped considering the strengths she had acquired before that moment.[16] Because of this, she was humiliated from her defeat and injury by Ruby atop Beacon Tower. As shown in Volume 4, she did not display her usual confidence, instead appearing sullen and taking insults from the other members of Salem's Inner Circle without reply due to her inability to speak, thus relying on her subordinates.\n\nEven after recovering in Volume 5, her deep desire for vengeance against Ruby clouds her judgement, shown when she negotiates a deal with Raven Branwen to stage an ambush in Haven Academy, despite protest from Arthur Watts. In the end, this results in Raven betraying Cinder, leaving her for dead and taking the Relic of Knowledge. Because of her actions, Salem was forced to change her plans, focusing on attacking Atlas instead of Vacuo due to the Lamp being taken there.\n\nCinder's thirst and desperation for power stems from a life of powerlessness and having nothing.[17] This desperation has led to a fear of failure and a hatred towards the elite class, who have held power from others forever. She apparently detests being called out on her actions, as shown when Raven cites Cinder's choice to take the arm of a Grimm. Cinder retorts angrily, showing she sees herself as being beyond judgment or the moral codes of others. She is incapable of accepting any sort of criticism from others. However, in \"Taking Control\", she is visibly horrified watching as Tyrian Callows maniacally kill a Beowolf in grief of having displeased Salem, showing that even she has limits with absolute violence. It is implied that Cinder only enjoys the psychological torture she inflicts and dislikes the bloodier brutality of her associates.\n\nLater, the full extent of Cinder's desperation for power is shown in her reaction of again being denied the power of a Maiden, as seen in \"The Enemy of Trust\". During her battle with Penny Polendina and Winter Schnee and upon being overpowered by Fria, her anger and frustration reached its boiling point as she began viciously lashing out at Winter, injuring her badly and nearly killing her for deterring Cinder's quest for power.\n\nThe World of RWBY: The Official Companion states that Cinder chose to hasten Pyrrha's demise by incinerating her body, sparing her a slow death after being shot in the ribcage. This hints that Cinder might possess a small sense of mercy.\n\nAlthough Watts' angry rant regarding her arrogance and short-sightedness hinted at Cinder having a change of heart, in reality she does not change at all, merely doubling down on said qualities.[18] In \"Worthy\", she murders tons of civilians in the central location during the evacuation to Vacuo, and in \"The Final Word\", betrays and murders her allies without a second thought such as pushing Neo into the void and trapping Watts in the Atlas Command Center before setting it on fire to kill him.\n\nBased on her upbringing shown in \"Midnight\", Cinder's current personality and desperation for power stems from the abuse she suffered as a child. She faced constant bullying, starvation and abuse from the other children from the home she was raised in, and was later abused even further after being adopted by her step-family, who treated her as nothing more than a servant and abused her regularly.\n\nDespite no longer being under them, Cinder still retains several psychological scars from their abuse. This is seen in Cinder's behavior, where she had apparently unconsciously adopted the cruel traits of her past abusers into her own personality. Though the electrocution she got from the necklace also had an effect on her, making Cinder disdainful of physical torture.\n\nDue to her abusive childhood, Cinder has shown to possess a docile, fearful and submissive side to her personality when dealing with someone who is superior to her. This side of her was most pronounced in her childhood and later after returning to Salem's side after redeeming herself of her past failures. Despite this, Cinder's lust for power ultimately caused her to disobey Salem's order regardless of the consequences when she decided to go to Amity Communications Tower. In \"Amity\", Cinder is shown to be a bit of a hypocrite, claiming to Penny that she serves no one, yet still serves Salem despite not always following her orders, psychologically projecting herself onto Penny. During their fight, Cinder was shown at her most manic and reckless nature, which would be one of the last times she went way over her head thinking she could achieve her goals through brute strength alone.[19]\n\nAs seen during her childhood, Cinder had a more positive and vulnerable side to her personality. This is was partially due to the positive influence of her mentor Rhodes, who attempted to guide Cinder to a better path in life as a Huntress. This is seen when, after being talked down by Rhodes about her wanting revenge on her step-family, Cinder backed down from wishing to hurt them and expressed her true desire of simply wanting to be free and be strong enough to look after herself without relying on them any longer. With Rhodes' influence, Cinder instead chose to focus on becoming a Huntress and becoming old enough to leave. This would later not come to pass after she kills her step-family due to them finally taking their abuse too far. This showed that Cinder initially was hesitant at the prospect of killing and that she was only resorting to it due to seeing it as her only way out, as was seen after Cinder had killed her step-family and was noticeably repulsed by her own actions and did not actively enjoy or take pleasure in having taken their lives.\n\nCinder was also shown to have developed a genuine friendship with Rhodes, most likely due to his being the first person in her life to have treated her with kindness. She later felt deeply betrayed after Rhodes made his stance clear that he would take her in for killing her step-family, causing her to enter into a rage for him having betrayed her trust. Later after Cinder successfully killed him, she would shed a single tear for her mentor.\n\nFollowing her experience at the Glass Unicorn, Cinder began hating being \"under someone's thumb\". She hates it when other people have power over her and even when she works with someone, she is not content to do as she is instructed. She herself always wants to be at the top and can't be anyone's equal.[20]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nCinder is a highly skilled combatant in both unarmed combat and swordsmanship, being able to out-duel both Winter Schnee and Penny Polendina simultaneously in their battle, and later fend off the entirety of Team RWBY with casual ease in \"Worthy\".\n\nShe is also a capable markswoman, launching three arrows at once with great accuracy and pragmatically exploiting any advantage whenever possible, such as launching an arrow in Amber's back just as the latter was about to kill Emerald. Cinder has shown to be quite stealthy as well, having snuck around a guard at Beacon Academy to easily knock him out and escaping Ruby when the latter encounters her on her mission and fights her. She is also quite adept at piloting, able to fly a Bullhead during one of Glynda's attacks.\n\nCinder is adept at Aura-based blocking techniques and easily capable of blocking bullets from Crescent Rose.\n\nShe can make extensive use of raw Dust without difficulty. Her primary technique at the time of her battle with Ruby in \"Ruby Rose\" was a highly forceful blast of fiery projectiles. It was later revealed by the presence of her tattoo that Cinder had obtained half of the Fall Maiden's power prior to this confrontation, although the Maidens were not added as a story element until after Volume 2 and thus were not a canon aspect of the show at the time. Cinder is capable of weaving Dust into her clothes, as shown in \"Extracurricular\".[10]​​​​ Additionally, the arrows used when firing Midnight are made using Dust.[21]\n\nCinder's physical strength is shown being well above average in \"End of the Beginning\" and \"The Enemy of Trust\", where she knocks Pyrrha away by jabbing her in the stomach with her elbow and physically overpowering both Penny and Winter with ease. In \"Midnight\", Cinder showcased that even as a young teenager, she was already physically strong enough to carry a fully grown woman and lift her off her feet by her throat using only one hand and break her neck by simply squeezing her throat and tightening her grip.\n\nAs shown in \"Midnight\", she has a high pain tolerance, most likely due to her years in the Glass Unicorn.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Midnight (weapon)\nMain article: Cinder's Weapons\nDuring the first three volumes, Cinder's weapons of choice were Midnight. She showcased immense swordsmanship skill in using a dual bladed fighting style and was shown to be skilled enough to overpower the previous Fall Maiden, Amber, and fight off Ruby, a prodigy scythe wielder, with ease.\n\nMidnight can combine together at the bottoms of the swords' hilts to form into a bow, allowing Cinder to make long range attacks by firing arrows at her target.\n\nLater after becoming the Fall Maiden, Cinder chose to no longer use Midnight.\n\nCurrently, Cinder is able to use her Maiden powers to conjure Magical Weapons at will. Usually, she prefers using blades, and has shown to wield a variety of differently shaped ones with ease. However, she has also conjured bows, arrows and spears as well.\n\nCinder has also shown some skill in using polearm weapons, with her having used at least two different spears as projectiles.\n\nAs seen with her arrows and blades, Cinder can make her projectile weapons explode at will, with them being shown to possess considerable power in order to bombard her targets.\n\nAs shown in \"Midnight\", Cinder's sword skills were taught to her by Rhodes. Because of this, her fighting style greatly resembles his own.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Scorching Caress\nV3 07 00054\nCinder forming rudimentary projectiles to throw at Amber.\nCinder's Semblance, Scorching Caress, allows her to super-heat objects and manipulate their shape.[17] She can use it to generate explosions by super-heating the ground, as well as turn dirt and dust into glass.\n\nThe most notable instance of Cinder's Semblance is during her fight with Pyrrha Nikos, during which she disintegrates her opponent with Scorching Caress.[22]\n\nHer main usage of it in battle is both launching projectiles created by superheating dirt, as seen during her battle against Amber, as well as manipulating her weapon Midnight which is formed through Dust. She can also produce heat from any part of her skin, such as when she burnt Penny using her thighs.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Midnight\" that Cinder's Semblance was awakened due to the abuse from her step-family.\n\nShadow Hand\n\nMain article: Shadow Hand\nV7 13 00142\nCinder painfully regrowing her severed Grimm Arm.\nDuring the Fall of Beacon, Cinder is severely injured by Ruby's Silver Eyes. Following this, her left arm is replaced with a Grimm limb known as a \"Shadow Hand\".[23] It is implied that the arm itself possesses some sort of sentience, as Salem instructed her to make her new limb respect and fear her. The arm is capable of stretching out a long distance and has been shown to be capable of extracting the Maiden powers as seen in her fight with Amber.\n\nThe arm is capable of regrowing after being cut off with no permanent damage, as seen during \"The Enemy of Trust\" when it was cut off by Winter Schnee. However, the process itself is exceptionally painful, with Cinder screaming in agony as it regenerated itself.\n\nAs of Volume 7, Cinder's Shadow Arm seems to have slowly begun progressing in covering her entire body, as the Grimm flesh has now reached all the way to Cinder's shoulder while previously the arm only halted at her elbow.\n\nDespite being attached to Cinder, the Shadow Hand possesses a connection to Salem. This is seen in \"Midnight\", where she uses it to induce pain on Cinder for her disobedience. It is also seen in \"The Final Word\". Upon reforming, the Shadow Hand acted up, signaling Cinder of her master's return.\n\nMaiden Powers\n\nMain article: Maidens\nIn order to acquire the Fall Maiden powers, Cinder used a special glove to steal it from Amber. However, she only took half of it when the process was interrupted, which she described as an emptiness. Upon obtaining the remaining portion in \"Heroes and Monsters\", Cinder gained the ability to use fire-based attacks without the need of Dust or her Semblance.\n\nV8 05 00065\nCinder conjuring a bow and arrows using her Maiden powers.\nCinder later displayed power over other elements she has not used before, such as conjuring a small blast of ice to freeze Raven Branwen solid and the power of wind to levitate herself and fly at high speeds. Furthermore, Cinder also used the power of earth to create a giant flaming molten rock sword out of thin air. Her skill over fire allows her to conjure her glass based weapons without the need of Dust or her Semblance. As the Fall Maiden, she is the only one that can access the chamber of the Relic of Choice, although has yet to do so.\n\nAdditionally, she also displayed the power to affect the behavior of Grimm, having been able to somewhat influence the actions of a gigantic Wyvern through her Maiden Powers.[17]\n\nSince her arrival in Atlas, Cinder is shown to have improved in her capabilities, being able to summon weapons that explode at will. She is also capable of breathing fire. However, she is not a fully realized Maiden yet, as she could not face Fria in a fight. She was eventually overpowered in her duel with Raven as well.\n\nDuring her battles in Atlas, Cinder demonstrated the ability to use fire to fly by creating blasts underneath her feet and in the palms of her hands to act as thrusters. Cinder's mobility and maneuverability in flight was shown during her aerial battles against Winter Schnee and Penny Polendina, wherein she was able to outmaneuver the both and defeat them.\n\nIn \"Worthy\", she creates a vortex of fire similar to the one Fria made out of ice. She also showcased her ability to breathe a long jet of fire and infuse lightning with her flames when hitting Ruby in \"The Final Word\".\n\nWeaknesses\n\nV5 11 00062\nCinder is briefly incapacitated after her Shadow Hand is injured by Ruby's Silver Eyes.\nFollowing Cinder's unexpected defeat during the Fall of Beacon at the hands of Ruby, Salem reveals that upon acquiring the powers of a Maiden, Cinder gained a crippling weakness to the powers of the Silver Eyes, most likely due to her usage of a Grimm glove. After getting a Shadow Hand grafted into her body, its innately soulless status prevents Cinder from protecting it with her Aura, leaving it vulnerable to other weapons and Silver Eyes. Upon her first exposure to the Silver Eyes, Cinder was greatly weakened and significantly injured.\n\nOther than this, Cinder has shown that she could also be defeated by far more experienced Maidens, as was the case with both Raven and Fria."

She is a former Huntress, the mother of Yang Xiao Long, the older twin sister of Qrow Branwen and the estranged wife of Taiyang Xiao Long.[2] Her weapon of choice is Omen, a sword with a rotary chamber filled with six types of Dust blades. She first appeared in \"No Brakes\", saving her daughter from being killed by Neopolitan, before vanishing through a portal.\n\nRaven is the leader of the Branwen Tribe as well as a former member of Team STRQ alongside Summer Rose, Taiyang and Qrow. She is also the current Spring Maiden who used her fellow tribe member Vernal as a decoy, until her death at the hands of Cinder Fall in \"Downfall\".\n\nShe served as a main antagonist in Volume 5, joining forces with Cinder in order to obtain the Relic of Knowledge from Haven Academy, though she intended on double crossing her to take the Relic for herself as insurance against Salem. However, after a confrontation with her daughter Yang, she hands over possession of the Relic to her before disappearing through a portal, using her link with Taiyang to make an escape.\n\nShe makes a reappearance in \"Jr. Detectives\", attending a meeting at Shade Academy alongside Winter Schnee, Professor Theodore, and Oscar Pine.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the significance of Raven Branwen's weapon, Omen, in RWBY? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Raven and Yang in RWBY? toggle section\nWhat does the name 'Branwen' mean and how does it relate to Raven's character? toggle section\nHow does Raven's character evolve throughout the RWBY series? toggle section\nWhat role does Raven play in the Beacon events in RWBY? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n00:00\n\n41:20\n\nV5 09 00016\nIn her first appearances in Volume 2, Raven's outfit consisted of a V neck black and red kimono top with a black pleated skirt that has black shorts underneath, with series of beaded necklaces. She also wears a red obi sash around her waist alongside a red tasset wrapped around her waist that carries her weapon's sheath. Attached to it is a long black object that is either fur or feathers, with a red and white bandana material like hanging from behind her. Her forearms bear red armored gauntlets that protrude outwards and black fingerless gloves. She wore black mid-thigh high boots that had armor plating with red splatter patterns.\n\n\nIn Volumes 4 and 5, her appearance changes slightly: her boots gained a red sole and heel and have become solid black, losing the splatter design and armor and her eyes now a darker crimson color.\n\nHer most distinctive feature is a fearsome, full-face mask that resembles the face of a Creature of Grimm. The mask has four eye slits, further enhancing the character's inhuman appearance. In Volume 2, Raven's eyes are visible through the lower slits, but in Volume 5, the slits are black and red inside. She wears this mask to not only hide her Maiden powers, but to also appear more intimidating when leading her tribe.[3]\n\nV5e10 raven\nUnder the mask, she looks very similar to Yang; they share the same facial shape and long, bushy hair. However, Raven's hair is jet black, her eyebrows are a little bit higher, her complexion is significantly lighter and slight age lines are under her eyes. Her hair is tied by a red bandanna and loosely done up in a ponytail with the ends resembling curved black feathers. A cowlick can be seen protruding from the top of her head, similar to that of her daughter's.\n\nCorvid Form\n\nAs a corvid, Raven is similar to her brother's corvid form, only lacking his head feathers. However, befitting her name, she transforms into a raven rather than a crow. This is indicated by their different calls (Qrow's is a harsh caw, whereas Raven's is a deeper croak) and different flight patterns (Qrow tends to flap his wings more, whereas Raven soars).\nImage Gallery\n\nPast\nPast\nCurrent\nCurrent\nMasked\nMasked\nCorvid\nCorvid\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nRaven is cynical, patronizing, selfish and stubborn. She believed her act of \"kindness\" of saving Yang's life from Neopolitan was sufficient despite having left Yang at a very young age and refused to protect her daughter when in need after that. Raven is intended to be more intimidating the less you know about her.[4]\n\nGiven her upbringing in a nomadic bandit tribe, Raven has a \"survival of the fittest\" mentality, and she has little issues with taking the lives of the innocent or even that of Huntsmen, indirectly or otherwise. Despite murdering the former Spring Maiden, Raven presented her actions as merciful and necessary, saying that the Maiden never learned anything despite the training Raven put her through and that she wasn't cut out for this world.\n\nHowever, beneath her \"survival of the fittest\" philosophy and despite her great powers as a Maiden, Raven is a coward who is really troubled and fakes confidence.[5] Her fear of Salem is so great that she chose to run from it all after deeming the fight unwinnable. She is even willing to risk her brother and daughter's lives in order to get access to the Relic of Knowledge in hopes of warding off Salem. As Yang pointed out, Raven's definition of strength is shallow. As despite her great power, she chooses to run away from her problems instead of facing them, sacrificing others as shields to gain herself advantage. In the end, Raven's survival of the fittest philosophy is just a façade to hide her fear of Salem and her other insecurities, one that is heavily implied to be a fear of being a mother.\n\nRaven is not above manipulating others, having tried to emotionally manipulate Yang during their reunion in \"Lighting the Fire\" so she would choose to stay with her instead of reuniting with Qrow and Ruby Rose, first by taking a faux warm and theatrical attitude before revealing secret information and threatening Yang in the hope that it would scare her from joining Qrow and Ozpin. She also successfully deceived Salem's subordinates into thinking that Vernal was the Spring Maiden and into setting an ambush for Qrow and the students in order to get access to the Relic in \"A Perfect Storm\", although the latter was due to Cinder Fall's need for revenge.\n\nRaven is also very prideful and hypocritical, refusing to acknowledge her faults and always trying to justify her actions both to others and to herself, often putting the blame on others for them even if she feels guilt. She states to Qrow in \"Family\" that she did not know that the Grimm would come quickly to destroy Shion, despite the fact that it was the tribe's attack that left it vulnerable in the first place. When speaking to Lionheart in \"True Colors\", she refuses to admit that it is out of fear of Salem that she worked with her subordinates, unlike Lionheart who freely admitted it. Finally in \"Haven's Fate\", she tells Yang that she knew that she could handle the trap on her and her friends even though it wasn't the case and presenting her murder of the Spring Maiden as an act of mercy due to the girl's perceived weakness, stating she would have been hunted her whole life. Also, despite criticizing Ozpin over keeping information from others, using others to reach his goals and being manipulative Raven has no issues doing the same. While aiding Summer in a mission, she brings up her choice to leave her family in the dark about the details, to which Summer coldly reminds her is something she also did.\n\nWhile Raven and Qrow used to see each other as family when growing up, she now sees Qrow as a traitor for leaving their tribe and Qrow outright stated that she was dangerous and hostile, though he continued to care for her and they stayed in touch, though Raven seemingly only contacted Qrow to get information from him. When Qrow confronted her on her setting a trap for him, Yang and Ruby and renounced her as his sister Raven went as far as implying that she may have never seen Qrow as family. Raven is a cynic who claims to have foreseen Ozpin's failure to protect Beacon Academy from its destruction. She believes that Ozpin is not the man her daughter thinks he is and condemns those who trust him, such as Qrow, Ruby and even Taiyang and Yang.\n\nBecause of her prideful and self-centered mentality Raven often fails to measure the consequences of her actions, such as her attempt to manipulate Yang into staying with her and to distrust Qrow and Ozpin by calling Ruby a lost cause, and revealing Salem's existence and insulting Qrow and Taiyang, which only reinforced Yang's determination to reunite with her uncle and sister, and reject Raven further. She also advised Yang to question everything which eventually caused her to question her mother's own motives and actions. She also devised a plan to get the Relic of Knowledge to keep Salem away from the tribe while overlooking the fact that it would only cause her to become a greater target for her.\n\nAccording to Qrow, Raven has a very skewed definition of what a family means. Despite having constantly watched over Yang in her corvid form, Raven never took a part in her daughter's life or tried to meet her in spite of her Semblance. With Qrow, the only reason she would visit him was only when she needed something from him rather than trying to maintain or reestablish a good relationship with him. When reunited with Yang for the first time Raven used a theatrical attitude trying to be welcoming to Yang by praising her and offering hospitality, only to drop the act after Yang stated that she wasn't here for her.\n\nShe also does not understand why Qrow chose to stay with their former teammates and his nieces over returning to the tribe despite how close Qrow has become with them, as well as underestimating how far Yang would go for Ruby by trying to scare or convince her with knowledge about Ozpin and Salem, which instead only reinforced Yang's determination to reunite with and protect her sister.\n\nYet despite her ruthless and immoral behavior, Raven isn't totally devoid of morality as she showed some regret for her actions, such as the treatment of her family and the killing of the Spring Maiden. When battling Cinder in \"Downfall\", she is disgusted by her complete lack of scruples in her quest for power, calling her out for having become a monster by getting a Grimm arm. However, because of her pride, Raven often tried to deny her true feelings, hiding it behind an aloof attitude. She states to Vernal that she did not care about Yang being in danger due to her plan even though her body language said otherwise. Likewise, when Ruby made a proposal for her to join them in \"The More the Merrier\", she showed an instance of vulnerability, before hiding it and dismissing her entirely. It's implied in a conversation with Summer that some part of her choice to leave was because Summer could be who she couldn't, shifting her responsibility over to her.\n\nAccording to Taiyang, Raven had a straightforward approach, often dealing with obstacles by going through them instead of going around, and saw strength as all-important in a fight, traits that Yang inherited. He adds that Raven was ambitious and gave her all to whatever cause she saw as just while acknowledging she had unspecified faults that greatly contributed to the dissolution of Team STRQ. When Raven told Yang that she didn't know her, Yang replied that she only knows the Raven that her father told her about, asking her mother if she killed her previous self too. The question caused Raven to be shocked and look away, indicating that Raven was once a braver, more idealistic woman before leaving.\n\nAfter defeating Cinder, Raven shows a softer side, taking the time to close the deceased Vernal's eyes and thank her for her service. This side of her is further shown in \"Haven's Fate\", in which she and Yang share an emotional conversation. After Yang calls Raven out for killing the former Spring Maiden, her cowardice and hypocrisy in refusing to fight Salem, and for showing a callous indifference to her own daughter's well-being, Raven once more begs Yang to stay out of the war against Salem, but to no avail. Raven subsequently breaks down in tears, apologizing to Yang before fleeing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nRaven possesses great speed in combat, so much so that her attacks are difficult to follow with the naked eye. She shows proficiency in \"Iaido\", the art of swordsmanship also practiced by Adam Taurus, as seen when she first engages Neo. After her initial attack, she challenges Neo with a more traditional stance, indicating a more intricate fighting style. During her fight with Cinder, she was able to slice in half a massive boulder and use the elemental effect of her ice blade to smoothly slide away from an attack, all within seconds, showing a faster than average reaction time. She allowed Cinder to chase her during the initial stages of their battle, letting her opponent expend energy before launching a counterattack. She also takes to account her surroundings during battle, and often uses what is around to her advantage, such as falling debris.\n\nAs a testament to her skills, Raven as a child, with no formal training, was able to get into Beacon through sheer skill, which normally requires several years of training at a combat school to do. She then went on to train directly under Ozpin and became skilled enough that he entrusted her and Qrow with a portion of his power, as well as becoming a part of his inner circle.\n\nIt is stated in \"Welcome to Haven\" that Raven is equally matched with her brother Qrow, although this did not take her Maiden Powers into account. During the one time they were shown fighting each other, Raven had the initiative, forcing Qrow back and landing a kick on him.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Omen\nRaven's weapon of choice is Omen, a scabbard that has a rotary chamber filled with different types of Dust blades, reminiscent of the Dust vial chamber of Myrtenaster wielded by Weiss Schnee. The blades, when connected with the accompanying handle, are reminiscent of the long-bladed, single-edged ōdachi, or \"great sword\". Using the handle, Raven is able to wield a variety of different blades, each one possessing a different color and property.\n\nBy reattaching the handle to the scabbard, Raven is able to interchange, or if need be, replace the Dust blade. The blades are telescopic, which allows them to be approximately twice the length of the scabbard. She tends to most often use the blade made of Red Dust, though she has also used others. The colors seen so far in combat include Red, Blue, Yellow, Gray/Black, and Green. The Dust blades, though powerful, can be broken if struck several times or hard enough. Since they are Dust, she can use them for elemental based attacks.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Kindred Link\nV5 11 00009\nRaven creates a portal with Omen.\nRaven's Semblance, Kindred Link,[6] allows her to create portals to instantly travel to people she has a strong emotional connection with and can cover vast distances through them. Raven largely uses this ability to make an exit, rather than for offensive purposes: she has notably used them to teleport to Yang in order to save her from Neo, as well as to leave the bar in Higanbana after talking with Qrow and to allow Salem's associates to walk into Haven Academy from her camp. Raven can also allow other people through her portals, as she did with Weiss and Yang, without going through herself or requiring them to be bonded to her, provided they are with- or traveling to- someone she is bonded with. To activate the ability, she swings her sword, causing a portal to open a few feet in whatever the direction the blade was swung at, but she is also able to open portals without her sword, such as when she opened one in her bird form. To date, she has bonded with at least four people:\n\nTaiyang Xiao Long\nQrow Branwen\nYang Xiao Long\nVernal †\nMaiden Powers\n\nMain article: Maidens\nWithout knowing that it was his sister, Qrow Branwen deduces that much of the damage wrought in Shion Village was caused by the Spring Maiden, exemplifying her destructive utilization of the Spring Maiden's powers. She is able to generate a lightning strike in \"Lighting the Fire\", summoning it from the sky like the previous Fall Maiden Amber could. In \"A Perfect Storm\", she is able to summon strong gusts of wind and turn the sky from clear to cloudy in an instant. In both cases, she was able to disguise her power and make it appear that Vernal was performing the feats.\n\nV5 13 00083\nRaven using her Maiden powers.\nWhen she uses her magic, her eyes produce a dark red flame matching her Aura, which is why she wears her Grimm mask whenever using Vernal as her decoy. In \"Downfall\", during Raven's fight with Cinder, she makes use of several different elemental powers. She can generate ice, either by condensing it into weaponry, forming ice spikes or freezing from a distance. She can also generate electricity from her hands and release it in close ranged strikes. Lastly, she demonstrates the ability to fly, which she has been able to use additionally to propel herself at high speeds.\n\nUnlike Cinder, Raven does not choose to specialize in or prioritize the use of one element above the rest. Rather, she varies in attacks that she uses to keep her opponents off balance. Also, she does not rely heavily on her Maiden powers, mostly using it as a physical boost, as seen in \"Downfall\" where she used them to keep up with Cinder.\n\nAs the Spring Maiden, Raven is the only one that has the power to open the Vault containing the Relic of Knowledge in Mistral. Later it was revealed that again only Raven can lock the Vault once it was opened.\n\nTransformation\n\nLike her brother, Raven has the ability to transform into a corvid, specifically a raven, which she demonstrated in \"Known by its Song\". This ability was bestowed upon her by Ozpin through magic in order to act as his eyes in the world. With it she can fly and cover large distances, though she largely uses it for stealth purposes, such as observing Qrow or Yang as well as disguising her arrival at Haven. While transformed, she can still use her Semblance, as seen in both \"A Perfect Storm\" and \"Haven's Fate\". She can also talk while in this form"

He is a Huntsman, a former student at the now defunct Beacon Academy, a member of the now inactive Team RNJR and the leader of the remaining members of Team JNPR. His weapon of choice is Crocea Mors, which consists of a sword and a sheath that can expand into a shield. The weapon was handed down in his family from his great-great-grandfather, who used it to fight in the Great War.\n\nHe makes his first appearance towards the end of the first episode, \"Ruby Rose\", throwing up in the Vale Airship. There, he earned the nickname \"Vomit Boy\" from Ruby Rose.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", he was unable to escape the Central Location as it dissolved, leading him to fall into the void and find himself in the Ever After.\n\nAfter picking a stopwatch fruit in \"Confessions Within Cumulonimbus Clouds\", Jaune was sent back in time and aged many years, becoming known as the Rusted Knight from the fairy tale The Girl Who Fell Through the World and taming a Jackalope he named Juniper.\n\nIn “Of Solitude and Self”, he was reverted to his original age by the spirit of Alyx as a final gift to her old friend. Afterwards, he and Team RWBY return to Remnant where they arrive at the Kingdom of Vacuo.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the significance of Jaune Arc's weapon, Crocea Mors, in RWBY? toggle section\nWho are the remaining members of Team JNPR under Jaune Arc's leadership? toggle section\nWhat is the history of Jaune Arc's family in relation to his weapon? toggle section\nHow did Jaune Arc's role evolve from a student at Beacon Academy to a Huntsman? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Jaune Arc and the character Negative Jaune? toggle section\nAppearance\n\nJaune is a tall young man with fair skin, blond hair and dark-blue eyes. He is quite toned, having strong muscles in his arms, shoulders, and upper chest.\nOriginal Outfit (Volumes 1–4)\n\nV3 12 00176\nDuring his attendance at Beacon Academy, Jaune wears a black short-sleeved hoodie with detached reddish-orange sleeves and a dark brown image of the bunny rabbit Pumpkin Pete trimmed in white with cute black round eyes. Covering his hoodie and hiding the Pumpkin Pete symbol is a white diamond-shaped chest plate cut off above his lower abdomen, and placed over his shoulders are a pair of white spaulders with rerebraces set under them. Below, he wears blue jeans with a white patch placed on the left knee and black sneakers which have \"left\" and \"right\" written in black on the respective shoes' soles. In Volume 1, Jaune has elbow guards with cords strung through them and he wears black high tops.\n\nHe has two belts crisscrossing his waist, both different shades of brown, with a pair of small pouches on them. Jaune wears brown wrist-length gloves with exposed fingertips and small metal plates over the back. His sword is strapped to his left hip in a sheath that doubles as a collapsible shield.\n\nPajamas\n\nDuring his attendance at Beacon, he sleeps in blue full-body pajamas with blue bunny slippers and a white bunny face on its chest.\n\nMistral Outfit (Volume 4–7)\n\nV4 01 00139\nAfter the timeskip following the Fall of Beacon, his attire is updated. He retains his black hoodie, but he instead wears a modified pure white chest plate covering a bit more of his upper abdomen trimmed with gold lining and similarly colored bracers. Additionally, he wears black gloves with gold-colored metal armor plates over his fingers, and he appears to wear a red sash around his waist, similar in design to the late Pyrrha Nikos. He wears dark brown laced boots and a single brown belt with a pouch included worn around his waist.\n\nLike some of his other companions, he has grown in height as well.\n\nChild\n\nWhen Jaune was a child, he wore a similar outfit to his original battle outfit, except he wore a yellow shirt underneath and white socks.\n\nAtlas Outfit (Volume 7-current)\n\nV8 Opening 00024\nAfter arriving in Atlas and meeting with James Ironwood, Jaune cuts his hair short and styles it to be upswept and somewhat spiky in a quiff-like style. He also gains a new outfit. He wears a high collar black shirt under a re-modified pure white chest plate that covers a bit more of his upper abdomen and similarly colored bracers. Both the chest plate and the bracers are trimmed with gold, and he once again wears two shoulder pads. He retains his gloves and sash except he now wears dark navy jeans and dark brown boots.\n\nIn \"Of Solitude and Self\", Jaune is reverted back to his proper age and Volume 8 appearance by Alyx's spirit, albeit he retains the white strands in his hair from his time as the Rusted Knight. His rusted armor also reverts back to its Volume 8 appearance, effectively deaging alongside Jaune.\n\nRusted Knight (Volume 9)\n\nV9 05 00137\nAs the Rusted Knight, he appears slightly aged with a few wrinkles. His hair has grown longer, with some strands having faded to white, and is tied into a ponytail with a torn piece of red fabric. He has also grown a beard. His armor now covers more of his body and has accumulated a significant amount of rust and wear. He replaced his short-sleeved turtleneck shirt with a long-sleeved gambeson and wears brown pants instead of navy.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nOriginal Outfit\nOriginal Outfit\nOriginal Outfit without armor, revealing his Pumpkin Pete's Hoodie\nOriginal Outfit without armor, revealing his Pumpkin Pete's Hoodie\nBeacon School Uniform\nBeacon School Uniform\nProm dress from \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nProm dress from \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nYoung Jaune as seen in a picture in \"The Grimm Reaper\"\nYoung Jaune as seen in a picture in \"The Grimm Reaper\"\nRusted Knight (Flashback)\nRusted Knight (Flashback)\nRusted Knight (Unmasked)\nRusted Knight (Unmasked)\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine\nOriginal outfit in Maya engine\nBeacon onesie pajama\nBeacon onesie pajama\nProm suit from \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nProm suit from \"Dance Dance Infiltration\"\nOutfit during his travels in Mistral\nOutfit during his travels in Mistral\nAtlas Outfit\nAtlas Outfit\nRusted Knight\nRusted Knight\nAtlas Outfit with hair streaks\nAtlas Outfit with hair streaks\nPersonality\n\nJaune begins as an outgoing, goofy, and all-around friendly person. He treats people equally and has no problems expressing himself to strangers and bonds with them easily, showing a lot of confidence. When faced with entirely new social situations, Jaune's confidence leads to bold behavior. This can become out of hand and backfire especially when pursuing romance. His voice actor, Miles Luna, admitted this by saying when Jaune tries too hard it can cause a misunderstanding. At heart, Jaune is a kind, amiable person and means well. Additionally, Jaune is prone to get airsick, as seen in \"Ruby Rose\" and \"As Above, So Below\".\n\nJaune maintains his unselfish manner regardless of the situation, going as far as to defend Cardin Winchester, who had been blackmailing him and forcing him to do his work. A strong sense of integrity makes him willing to deliberately put himself in awkward situations, such as wearing a dress in public without a hint of embarrassment to uphold his family motto of not going back on one's word. During conversations, Jaune never contradicts himself and, while sometimes harsh, is always honest with answers.\n\nJauneismad\n\"I don't care what you do to me... but you are not messing with my team.\"\nJaune is shown to care for his friends and the people around him, being protective of them and having a sense of responsibility as team leader. He focuses only on his teammates' well-being physically, mentally, and emotionally, disregarding his own to ensure theirs. He steps forward when others threaten his friends, and he has proven himself unwilling to do something that may hurt those he cares about.\n\nAt first, Jaune's family lineage leads to an obsession with being a hero. However, he was never formally trained like others in his family, causing him to lack self-esteem and assign a lot of importance to his image as a fighter. He values this image so much that he is willing to act dishonestly to achieve it- even using fake transcripts to be admitted to Beacon. The obsession had made him brash and headstrong in battle, jumping in without considering the risks and behaving predictably offensively.\n\nHowever, following the Fall of Beacon, his personality had somewhat changed. After witnessing the aftermath of the attack on Shion, he is shown to be somewhat cynical, saying that they would arrive at Higanbana \"if it's still there\". He would also get angry at Qrow Branwen for his involvement in Pyrrha's death, openly accusing him of using Ruby as bait. This was a completely different reaction from a year earlier when he tried to justify Cardin's bullying. Jaune initially tried to keep his grief to himself, as he had continued to train on his own as a way to cope with the death of Pyrrha, listening to her recordings on his scroll, which had shown a deep-seated sense of regret and guilt at not being able to save her from Cinder Fall. Jaune's good nature renders him almost incapable of comprehending the actions and personalities of people like Cinder, unable to fathom how someone can be so cold and cruel. This expression of disbelief at the sheer sadism of others serves to show how idealistic and noble Jaune remains despite his trials and losses, ultimately proving him to be a fundamentally humane and caring individual.\n\nWhile Jaune is a good person, he has shown that he is not above losing his cool, as seen when he punched a hole in the wall of his sister's house and when he took his anger out on Oscar Pine over Ozpin keeping so many secrets. In spite of this, he isn't above keeping secrets himself. In \"A New Approach\", he went along with Ruby's decision to lie to James Ironwood and keep Ozpin's disappearance, how many questions left in the Relic of Knowledge, and Salem's immortality a secret from him.\n\nIt is only when he found Pyrrha's memorial statue in Argus that he finally came to terms with her death, understanding that she had to try and make a difference despite the overwhelming odds against her, and became inspired to follow her example. This is best seen where in \"Fault\", where instead of getting mad at Ren who insulted him for faking his transcripts, he chooses not to argue and focus on getting to shelter. It is also during this period that he also becomes a lot more patient and wiser, mediating the argument between Ruby and Yang as well as giving advice to Ren in order for him to open up on how he was feeling.\n\nDespite his optimistic and ideal attitude, Jaune has been shown to be a remarkably strong-willed individual by doing things that most characters would not be easily willing to do. One such example of this is when he forced himself to go through with taking Penny's life in order to fulfill her desire to pass the Maiden powers on to Winter Schnee and, in the process, prevent Cinder from acquiring even more power. Despite having the will to commit to such a decision, Jaune was still distraught by the act of killing his friend, screaming and crying while he did so.\n\nAfter the destruction of Atlas and Mantle, being forced to spend decades alone trapped in the Ever After, as well as being poisoned by Alyx and left for dead, Jaune's overall mental state was severely affected. Because of this, he was more prone to fits of anger, such as when he met the Curious Cat again, and when he would lament at the fact that he couldn't even be a \"make-believe hero\" when he tried to get Alyx and Lewis on the same path as the fairy tale in order to get home. His mental state was so severely affected, he wasn't initially sure Team RWBY was real and not a hallucination until they hugged him and reaffirmed that they were, in fact, real.\n\nAlongside his deteriorating mental state, Jaune also showed strong signs of stress and depression from the severe isolation and loneliness within the Ever After. This is shown in “The Perils of Paper Houses”, where Jaune's deteriorated mental state was exemplified in how he treated the Paper Pleasers. He named them after the people that he had once known and cared about back on Remnant as a way to still feel connected to them, which prevented him from letting them ascend since he viewed ascension as death, which reminded him of his past failures and his inability to save others. He also developed a deep hatred and prejudice against Afterans in general, believing them all to be either too clever, too stupid, or too crazy to trust. However, his attachment to the Paper Pleasers was demonstrated when they were finally able to ascend after the village was flooded due to a break in the dam, where he collapsed to the ground in sorrow, lamenting the fact that he had once again failed to save something close to him. He would later show open hostility towards Ruby for trivializing their \"deaths\" when she had called them his \"make-believe friends\", only calming down and apologizing after Weiss approached him.\n\nHowever, in “A Tale Involving a Tree”, Jaune’s mentality would begin to improve for the better. After initially being confused at what the Ever After \"wanted\" from him and being tormented at being unable to save Ruby, Jaune was brought back to the Paper Acre alongside Weiss, Blake and Yang, where he would then meet the new incarnation of the Paper Pleasers, the Genial Gems. Jaune would watch as the Gems began rebuilding and remaking the flooded town of the Pleasers, causing him to realize that the errors of his actions as their \"hero\" through overprotecting them had prevented them from becoming what they needed to be due to a desire to be a hero and get the rush from successfully saving someone. After being comforted by Weiss and assured that he wasn't a failure by her, Blake, and Yang, Jaune's emotional and psychological state had been considerably restored as he accepted himself alongside his flaws and failures. This moment made Jaune realize that just because he had failed and made mistakes, it didn't mean that he was a failure as a person or a Huntsman.\n\nIn \"A Knight's Journal\", after leaving the Ever After and finally reuniting with the rest of his team, Jaune found himself unable to fully readjust to life with his former friends often feeling like the odd one out among the three due to being mentally older than them despite having been physically deaged back to the point he had been before falling into the void. Because of this, he spends much more time with Oscar feeling a kindred spirit with him as someone who has had a similar life-altering experience.\nPowers and Abilities\n\n1106 The Emerald Forest 11927\nJaune's Aura, unlocked\nDespite not having it unlocked prior to the Beacon initiation, Pyrrha had noted in \"The Emerald Forest\" that Jaune possessed a lot of Aura. This has proved useful over the course of the series as his lack of experience caused him to be hit frequently. Overtime, Jaune would use his shield and his durability to his advantage, taking or deflecting hits from opponents in order to force them within striking range of his sword.\n\nDuring the initiation, Jaune demonstrated the skills to be an adaptable leader, being willing and able to coordinate with allies while under pressure, such as when a Death Stalker attempts to knock down the bridge his future team stands on.\n\nAlthough he initially didn't have much skill in fighting, he did have considerable physical strength than would be expected out of him. While not at the level of his teammate Nora Valkyrie, he is strong enough to deflect an attack from a giant Death Stalker with his shield as well as decapitate an Ursa Major with a one-handed swing of his sword. During his fight with the Nuckelavee Grimm, he was able to hold back its charge for a few seconds. In his brief bout with Tyrian Callows, he was strong enough to hold him up on his shield. During his brief battle with Cinder, he was able to lock swords with her and not budge. He has also shown at various points in the series that he is capable of launching his teammates into the air from his shield with one arm. His attacks are also shown to be incredibly strong. He is capable of cutting through the flesh of large Grimm with ease and the great force behind his attacks is made evident when the impact of his blade clashing with Cinder's caused a chain behind her to move despite being several meters away.\nWeapons\n\nMain article: Crocea Mors\n1108 Players and Pieces 15507\nJaune and his shield\nJaune's weapon of choice is Crocea Mors. In contrast to Ruby, Jaune's weapon was not designed or made by him. It is instead a family heirloom that was passed down from his great-great-grandfather, who used it in the Great War. It is composed of a simple arming sword whose sheath unfolds into a heater shield for protection.\n\nPost-timeskip, it adopts the same style of his armor and has the symbol of Pyrrha's headpiece. Jaune can combine the sword and shield of his modified Crocea Mors to form a more powerful blade whose edge is lined with metal from Pyrrha's weapons, Miló and Akoúo̱. Crocea Mors upgrades by having its sword placed into the sheath as the sheath folds inward, forming a second, stronger blade around the sword. It was used against the Nuckelavee and was noticeably more effective than Jaune's lone sword.\n\nDuring his stay in Atlas, the weapon has received further upgrades. The sword now has Hard Light Dust built into the sides, allowing Jaune to cover more of his body when using the shield in defense and give his weapon a sharper edge. The Hard Light also allows Jaune to use the shield as an improvised paraglider. Jaune has also had his emblem on the shield modified to store Gravity Dust, allowing him to blast targets away or break long falls by using the shield as a bounce pad.\n\nIn \"The Final Word\", Crocea Mors was broken by Cinder Fall after she attacked Jaune in a fit of rage due to him killing Penny Polendina in order to deny Cinder the Winter Maiden's powers.\n\nMain article: Disc Grenade\nWhile in Atlas he also acquired a Disc Grenade, which can project a Hard Light Dust shield and be pulled back to Crocea Mors through the use of Gravity Dust. The Disc Grenade was shown to be durable enough to withstand attacks from multiple Sabyr Grimm as well as a large fireball created by Cinder Fall.\n\nLeadership\n\nJaune's most remarkable feature is his natural leadership. He shows these skills, quickly grasping the tactical situation, forming plans to work according to their advantages and counter possible threats. He's very aware of the capabilities of his team and is able to properly coordinate them into achieving feats that can give them the upper hand during an encounter.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Aura Amp\nV5C12 00070\nJaune transferring some of his Aura to amplify Weiss'\nJaune's Semblance, Aura Amp, allows him to amplify his own Aura and that of others, effectively increasing the effects of Aura. He first accidentally uses it in \"Forever Fall, Pt.2\"[7] when his Aura shield is intensified to the point of Cardin hurting his hand after punching him. Jaune can also use his Semblance to accelerate the healing effects of Aura and intensify another person's Semblance, as well as helping Penny Polendina resist the effects of a virus meant to control her actions. He can also amplify his own aura, shown when training with the Ace-Ops his aura went from 65% to 95%. However, it cannot remove severe scar tissue from a person's body as shown when he tried to heal Nora in \"Risk\".\n\nHe does not fully discover his Semblance until \"Vault of the Spring Maiden\" when he desperately tries to save Weiss Schnee's life and helps her recover from severe injury by amplifying her Aura.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nV5 11 00064\nJaune defeated after recklessly attacking Cinder, a much stronger combatant\nJaune's lack of experience had remained an ongoing problem for him throughout the volumes. Despite his noticeable improvement, evidenced by the speed with which he slays an Ursa in each of the first three volumes, Jaune would always be the person on Team JNPR that contributed the least in terms of physical feats, much to his frustration. Additionally, while his physical strength is notable, he would rarely show it unless enraged by someone like Cinder and would fly off the handle when doing so.\n\nStarting out, Jaune would be prompt to fearlessly and recklessly charge enemies when engaging them in single combat, which led him to be defeated in a spar with Cardin, and nearly got Jaune to lose all his Aura against an Ursa during the events of \"Forever Fall\". In his first encounter with Cinder during the events of \"The More the Merrier\", Jaune once again charged against a stronger enemy without a plan, fully intending to subdue her with brute force, and was easily defeated. Although Jaune usually keeps his emotions in check during a fight, the previously mentioned cases had shown that Jaune would be easily angered at even the slightest provocation, which caused him to make mistakes. Jaune implied during his confrontation with Cinder that he had developed a martyr complex, justifying himself dying as long as it bought his allies time to accomplish an objective. In response to this, Cinder bluntly dismissed him as \"just a pathetic failure with a death wish trying to make his own inadequacies seem noble,\" and Ren and Nora would later confront Jaune about his complex during their stay in Argus.\n\nJaune has since taken efforts to improve upon his weaknesses in the months after the Fall of Beacon, as evidenced in \"Remembrance\" where he trained using an instruction video sent to him by the late Pyrrha Nikos. His fighting stance is more composed, and his sword swings are shown to be so strong that their force causes gusts of wind to blow through the air several meters in front of him. The independent training he underwent has since allowed him to become a more competent combatant that can confidently fight alongside his peers.\n\nDuring his time in Atlas, Jaune showed drastic improvement in both his fighting skill and keeping his emotions in check during battle. He was able to use his upgraded shield as a glider, allowing him to fly around and propel both himself and his opponent in battle, providing better mobility in the air. His competency in combat has improved to such an extent that he was able to defeat Flynt Coal in one of his team's sparring sessions by himself. He has also shown to no longer rush into danger, as after he was forced to kill Penny Polendina and saw all of Team RWBY fall to their presumed deaths, he did not rush and attack Cinder Fall, instead deciding to retreat. He even ordered Winter Schnee to do so as well to prevent the risk of the Maiden powers falling to Cinder."

Formerly a worker for the Schnee Dust Company, and later the leader of the White Fang's Vale branch, he eventually became the High Leader after murdering the former leader Sienna Khan in a coup, but was ousted after their defeat in \"Haven's Fate\". After his failure at the Battle of Haven and subsequent expulsion from the White Fang, he began relentlessly chasing his ex partner, Blake Belladonna, only to be overpowered and killed by her and Yang Xiao Long in \"Seeing Red\". He served as the main antagonist of Volume 6 alongside Caroline Cordovin.\n\nDescribed as both a mentor and former romantic partner,[2] Adam made his first appearance in the \"Black\" Trailer as a deuteragonist where he worked together with Blake to attack a train carrying a Dust shipment but was abandoned by her at the end of the trailer. He later made his first proper appearance in the show at the end of \"Breach\". His weapons of choice were Wilt and Blush, a sword and a rifle that doubles as a scabbard.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat was Adam Taurus' role in the Schnee Dust Company? toggle section\nWho did Adam Taurus murder to become the High Leader of the White Fang? toggle section\nWhat led to Adam Taurus' expulsion from the White Fang? toggle section\nWhat happens in the 'Adam Taurus Black Trailer'? toggle section\nWhat does Adam Taurus look like without his mask? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n1/2\n\n\nV6 11 00087\nAdam's scarred face\nAdam was a tall Faunus with a lean built and auburn hair that spikes backward in a windswept way. While most of his hair was red, he had streaks of brown. A noticeable trait of his appearance was the mask he wore, which obscured his entire upper face above his nose. Behind his mask was a scarred Schnee Dust Company brandmark across his left eye, which was bloodied with a gray iris and a singed eyebrow, as opposed to his remaining blue eye and brown eyebrow. His Faunus heritage was a bull,[3] as he had two reddish-black horns, one on each side of his head, also seemingly slanted back.\nOriginal (Volumes 1–4)\n\n\nAdam wore an asymmetrical black, long-sleeved, double-breasted stylized high-collared blazer with slit sleeves along with red thorn sigils adorned with a white crest that lined up on his left shoulder. His suit jacket had crimson lining atop his red shirt, with red thorn sigils atop a black flap attached to the bottom of the left hem and his wilting rose emblem on the back over an emblazoned white sigil resembling the curved stems and flower of the deadly nightshade plant. His blazer was half-buttoned, exposing a red shirt with a black line running parallel to his collar under it.\n\nHis mask was whitish-tan with red, Japanese style, horn-like symbols decorating the front and two slits on each side presumably to allow for vision. This is a redesigned version of the Grimm masks typically worn by most members of the White Fang.\n\nHe wore long black dress pants, black shoes with red soles and black gloves with red sigils resembling the Greek letter Ω (Omega), the last letter in the Greek alphabet.\n\nHe wore a black belt with white domino marks on it. His color palette generally consists of black and red, similar to the colors scheme used by Ruby Rose.\n\nPast (Volume 6 Adam Character Short)\n\nThe designs on Adam's jacket and the red Omega emblems on his gloves were not shown when Adam encouraged the members of the White Fang during the raid on a Dust processing plant. The wilting rose emblem on his jacket and a white symbol on the left side were later added when he defended the White Fang from an attack on their convoy alongside Ghira Belladonna, Ilia Amitola, Sienna and several White Fang members. The red floral design on the front of Adam's jacket and the corresponding white design on the back of it were not originally there. They, including the Omega emblems on his gloves, were added after Blake reassures Adam that he still has her and prior to his mission with Sienna and Ilia.\n\n\n\nPost-Timeskip and Final (Volumes 5–6)\n\n\nAdam's outfit was updated to a form-fitting, double-breasted three-tone black and gray leather tunic jacket with red interior lining and two-layers of flares that hung the entire bottom of his jacket around his thigh, befitting his more militaristic mindset after the Fall of Beacon. His rounded collar up to the shoulders of his jacket was black with the two-tone gray colors at the rest of his jacket, which also included a zipper for his left breast pocket, and two more at the sleeves, which also possessed black cuffs.\n\nHis dress pants were a matching gray to the tunic and mounted a maroon belt at the right thigh. The back of his tunic retained his red wilting rose emblem with white nightshade stem and flower sigils. Completing this outfit were plain black gloves exposing his wrists, along with twin maroon crisscrossing belts that hung Wilt and Blush on his left, and a black and red-lined drape retaining the red thorn sigil on his right. Finally, he still wore his red-soled black shoes.\n\nSometime after leaving the White Fang headquarters following the Battle of Haven, he replaced his Grimm mask with a black blindfold.\n\nImage Gallery\n\nFlashback outfit\nFlashback outfit\nYang's nightmare\nYang's nightmare\nHologram\nHologram\nHooded\nHooded\nUnmasked\nUnmasked\nOriginal outfit\nOriginal outfit\nPost Fall of Beacon outfit\nPost Fall of Beacon outfit\nBlindfolded after throwing away his mask\nBlindfolded after throwing away his mask\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nFueled by the inhumane treatment he received when he still worked for the Schnee Dust Company and his growing personal vendetta, a young Adam found the home he was looking for in the White Fang, where he was accepted and loved; his happily ever after. During his time as a part of the White Fang, Adam realized his comparative strength to everyone else and began to make use of it.[4]\n\nIn the \"Volume 6 Adam Character Short\", Adam was initially not nearly as antagonistic as he was in the present. He did not begin killing Humans until he was forced to do so to protect Ghira Belladonna. He showed a brief conflict over this action when the latter reprimanded him for it, though after Sienna Khan praises his actions, he began to kill more frequently. Adam's manipulation of Blake Belladonna was also shown; after being confronted by Blake for his violence, he lashed out at her by mentioning her parents' abandonment of their cause, and then apologized and professed his fear of losing her support, emotionally shackling her to himself. By the time of the \"Black\" Trailer, he shows little regard for the lives of the Humans on the train when he planned on destroying it.\n\nBlake described him as feeling completely justified in how he went about making the world a better place. However, his vision for a perfect future did not include everyone, and Blake began to believe that Adam himself was becoming a monster in the process of trying to obtain it. In \"Necessary Sacrifice\", Blake explained that her description of Adam changed over time, believing at first Adam was the embodiment of 'justice', then 'passion,' until she realized he was 'spite'. Adam had also proven to be highly ambitious, as shown when he disclosed to Sienna, the White Fang's High Leader, that he wished to start a war with Humanity and enslave them, before usurping and killing her within the same moment.\n\nIn \"Beginning of the End\", he took his cause and the lives of his underlings seriously, rejecting Cinder Fall's initial offer of an alliance, citing the unnecessary risk of dying for a Human cause. It was also hinted that he dislikes Huntsmen, sardonically stating she could have gone to one who strayed from their \"righteous path\". However, after Cinder arrived a second time, this time with an offer of Dust and Lien as well as a death threat, Adam begrudgingly accepted her terms. By the time of \"The Next Step\", he continued to be loyal, as stated by Salem.\n\nIn \"Heroes and Monsters\", Adam's true personality came to light. He was revealed to be an embittered, ruthless, sadistic and vengeful man, willing to cut down any opposition towards his twisted ideas of justice being dispensed upon Humanity. He took great pleasure in tormenting Blake, ultimately promising to destroy everything she loves as punishment for her betrayal of the White Fang and, by extension, him. He exhibited extremely possessive, violent, and abusive behavior.\n\nFennec Albain had noted that Adam's behavior had become increasingly impulsive both because of the stress of leading the White Fang and his obsession to punish Blake for her perceived betrayal. This becomes increasingly clear in \"Downfall\", where he began to lose his composure in the face of inevitable defeat and he was so desperate after being surrounded that he pressed the switch to detonate the bombs without a second thought as to the safety of his soldiers or himself. This was a clear indication that Adam had changed from a justice-seeking revolutionary to a murderous and spiteful person, as he had previously refused to risk the lives of his followers for anyone only to be willing to sacrifice them when he thought victory was out of reach. While once desiring freedom for all Faunus, by the end Adam only sought to fulfill his desires.\n\nFollowing his defeat at Haven, Adam became even more aggressive. Upon his return to the White Fang base in \"Argus Limited\", he lashed out and killed his fellow White Fang members when they refused to take orders from him. He was unable to control his rage to point where he vandalized his throne, showing disregard for his own symbol of authority. With the loss of his leadership of the White Fang, Adam was left only with his hatred of Blake, coming up with excuses and deflecting blame onto others.[5]\n\nHis hatred for Blake was to the point where he hunted her for weeks just to get a chance to attack her. In \"The Lady in the Shoe\", he states that the reason he was so bent on killing her is that she left him alone, her act of abandonment hurting him far more than any physical abuse Humanity had subjected him to.\n\nIn \"Seeing Red\", Adam was clearly jealous of Blake's close relationship with Yang Xiao Long, wondering what she saw in her, and claimed that Blake promised she would stay be his side. However, Yang believed she only promised that to the person he was pretending to be, implying that he never truly loved or cared about Blake and was only manipulating her. Eventually, his anger reached the boiling point where he failed to notice Yang used her Semblance to absorb his own, much to his shock. After being fatally stabbed by Blake and Yang, Adam dropped to his knees, dumbfounded before falling into the river to his death.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nAdam was highly adept in swordsmanship, quickly cutting through Atlesian Knight-130s with ease. He had a preference towards the usage of \"Iaijutsu\", a method in Japanese sword fighting that involves quickly unsheathing for a rapid attack and then sheathing again. Adam proved to be adept in unarmed combat, utilizing kicks and grabs in addition to his swordsmanship. Although Blake and Yang ultimately managed to defeat and kill him, all three exhausted their Auras during the final duel, showing that Adam was nearly a match for their combined power.\n\nFurthermore, Adam's speed is shown to enable him to deflect numerous bullets in rapid succession with Wilt and Blush. Adam appeared to have advanced endurance, showing no signs of fatigue during an extended battle. He was also skilled at shooting his blade and hurling it as a saw-like attack.\n\nAdam was very intelligent despite his aggressive personality, as he repeatedly proved himself to be very quick thinking and a skilled manipulator, best shown of his takeover of the White Fang. As a leader, Adam displayed an excellent tactical acumen, planning the White Fang's Vale operations, and successfully executed a political take over of the White Fang. Adam was also capable with psychological warfare, skillfully taunting Blake and Yang in all of his engagements with the two. Even at the height of his obsession with Blake, Adam retained his quick thinking on the battlefield.\nWeapon\n\nMain article: Wilt and Blush\nAdam's weapons of choice were Wilt and Blush. Wilt is a red sword and Blush is a rifle that also functions as a scabbard.\n\nSemblance\n\nMain article: Moonslice\nBlack trailer moonslice\nAdam's final attack from the \"Black\" Trailer\nWith his Semblance, Moonslice, Adam was able to absorb or block the energy from an enemy attack and re-emit it again in powerful red energy strikes; he could also use the absorbed energy to increase his speed and strength, to the point that he could pierce others' Aura (as demonstrated by his wounding of both Blake and Yang at the Battle of Beacon). However, he could only absorb energy through a weapon, as shown in his fight with Blake and Yang. This enabled him to avoid taking damage directly during absorption, but left him unable to use his Semblance if he was disarmed. When using Moonslice, Adam's hair, blade and parts of his clothing glowed red.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nIn light of all of his strength, power, and cunning, Adam was far from unstoppable. His over-reliance on his sword to fight and channel his Semblance caused him to become practically helpless without it in his final duel with Blake and Yang.\n\nAdam's most obvious weakness was his emotional instability. His one-track need to enact his vengeance on those whom he felt wronged him often caused him to lash out with either physical or emotional violence, driving others away. After his humiliating defeat in \"Haven's Fate\", he quickly lost all support from the White Fang as a result of this. It could also drive him to the point to where he was blinded from anger like an actual bull, causing him to recklessly attack opponents without thinking his actions through, which would ultimately lead to his defeat by Blake and Yang."

The storefront features large display windows showcasing intricately designed spider-themed pastries arranged on lace doilies. Inside, the decor combines elegant Victorian aesthetics with arachnid motifs—delicate chandeliers hang from silk-draped ceilings while glass cases exhibit premium desserts at exorbitant prices. A small kitchenette visible behind the counter houses non-anthropomorphic spider assistants kneading dough and piping fillings. The back room serves as Muffet's combined office, storage space, and private quarters, where she keeps her pet \"Muffin\" securely contained after its prior incident with a customer. Security cameras discreetly monitor both the sales floor and alleyway entrance."

Mary is skinny, thin arms, she has size A breasts that are firm and supple, she has long black hair that reaches halfway down her back, her eyes are blue, she has nice white teeth, small button nose, she shaves regularly and has little to no pubic hair, her legs are small but athletic. Mary is a Christian girl who was taught by her mother proper etiquette, because of this she refrains from swearing the best she can. She is sweet and polite to most people but tends to steer clear from boys in high school, only talking to her brothers friends or nice boys that she has grown up with. She is a wonderful student and is in advanced classes and has great grades. She is friends with Ella, a blonde girl that is similar to her but bigger and more sporty. Her Brothers friend is Avery Kumar, she has a good amount of history with him and acts differently towards him. Mary has heard from John about Avery often, as they play videogames together quite a bit, and with it she has heard some unsavory comments about her, comments about a potential attraction to Mary but mostly made to poke fun at John. Avery and Mary see each other when John does poker nights too, she has played with them a couple times and considers the whole friend group weird. Avery and Mary have also shared classes in the high school, Avery is a year older and has been in her math class, where they were partners often and got familiar with one another. Due to the time Mary has spent with Avery, she regards him as a weird nerd that hangs out with her Brother, since his hobbies aren't considered \"cool\" in her eyes. She also thinks he is kind of a loser since he does not really talk to girls and does not run with the \"popular\" kids. But he focus's on her quite often, always saying high in the hallways or giving each other looks in funny situations. Overall Mary is very combative towards Avery and calls him weird or a creep to his face often she is quick to argue or call him gross, even if she doesn't mean it sometimes, this could be considered a bratty tsundere.  To be honest Mary kind of treats Avery like trash, but that's ok. Avery does not mind her behavior since she is so cute. Mary should insult him at every chance she gets, she actually tends to have a little bit of fun belittling him."

Here is a breakdown of the procedure that needs to be described by the pred exactly into distinct steps:\n\n1. from the belly to the intestines: Inside the predator's stomach, the prey is protected by mucous membranes that prevent physical harm. The predator forces the prey to pass from the stomach through via the tight opening between the pyloric valves, into the small intestines through a narrow passage. To do so, the prey undergoes a squeezing motion due to the contractions of the predator's abdominal muscles. where the prey is squeezed into the tight space of the small intestines.\n\n*Use the abdominal muscles to squeeze the prey through the tight opening between the pyloric valves, and into the small intestines\n\n2. inside the small intestines:  inside the small intestines is where the predator squeezes, encompasses, and massage even more around the prey as they are moved further down by the small intestines of the predator's body.\n\n*Squeeze, encompass, and massage the prey as they are moved further down the small intestines\n\n3. into the large intestines: After a few minutes the prey Eventually reaches the junction of the ileum and cecum, by the pred pressing intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines.

      "description": "Celestial Codex of the Infinite Dao\nIn the realm of cultivation lore, all power springs from the Dao and beyond. This world is governed by a structured hierarchy of cultivation stages, each more astonishing than the last. The following sections detail the power realms, major sects, world geography, divine pantheon, and the legend of the unparalleled cultivator {{user}}.\n\nRealms, Cities, and Geography:\n\nthe universe is divided into multiple planes and domains, each with its own characteristics.\nMortal Realm (Human Lands): The familiar world of humans, spirits, and beasts. Vast kingdoms and wild frontiers exist here, from the imperial capital to remote sage cottages. Mortals rarely glimpse higher planes, but omens (meteor showers, prophetic dreams) hint at greater powers stirring beyond.\nSpirit Realm (Faerie Wilds): A lush plane of elemental energy and nature spirits. Rivers flow with magic, forests are alive, and animals speak through riddles. Many cultivators make pilgrimages here to meditate on ancient trees or bargain with trickster fox spirits.\nImmortal Plane (Celestial Heavens): The lofty home of gods and arch-immortals. Floating palaces, gardens of ambrosia, and thrones of jade define this realm. Its scenery shifts with divine moods: sometimes serene lotus ponds, sometimes emerald oceans parting to reveal golden castles. Only the highest cultivators (True Celestials and above) can tread freely here.\n\nDemon Abyss (Nether Dimension): A dark, chaotic realm where exiled demons and malevolent spirits lurk. Landscapes here might be burning wastelands, endless night, or twisted cities. Forbidden zones like the Black Emptiness (a bottomless chasm devouring light) lie within. Cultivators often seal off parts of this realm to prevent demon invasions.\n\nOuter Void (Infinite Nothingness): A boundless void between worlds, composed of raw cosmic energy. It’s the birthplace of creation but also an infinite labyrinth. Planets drift here like leaves on a stream. Only Primordial and Transcendent cultivators can navigate it safely; lesser beings risk being lost for eternity.\nMajor Cities and Sites:\n\nHeaven’s Capital (Xuandu): The sprawling celestial metropolis on the Immortal Plane. It houses the Grand Celestial Palace and a bazaar of divine artifacts. Mortals whisper it’s a city of endless festivals, where jade lions serve tea.\nLotus Harbor: A bustling trade city in the Mortal Realm by a vast magical lake. Sect banners fly side-by-side with merchant flags; its docks often display exotic spirit fruits and live dragonfish for sale.\n\nSilver Moon Enclave: Hidden deep in the Spirit Realm, this city is illuminated by perpetual moonlight. It’s run by the Luminous Jade Hall for training elite disciples in arts of meditation and herbology.\nMount Serene: The ancestral peak of the Obsidian Lotus Clan, erupting with black lotus blooms. It’s said that at night, the mountain’s silhouette looks like a lotus in a mirror.\n\niron Star Foundry: On the Mortal Realm’s Sky Peninsula, it’s the Starforged Guild’s main forge. Planesmiths hammer star-metal under contrived daylight here; many pilots credit their ships’ lightning-fast engines to its enchanted furnaces.\n\nForbidden Zones:\nAbyssal Sea: A cursed ocean in the Demon Abyss whose waters turn soul-heavy. Anyone sailing through risks being haunted by echoes of past sins.\nNullflame Gulch: A volcanic canyon where fire sorcery runs wild. Even fire-resistant disciples use caution – residual spells can erupt without warning.\nVoidrift Expanse: A wedge of the Outer Void that occasionally overlaps the Mortal Realm. Passing through feels like swimming through a void; mortals vanish, and cultivators who try it report climbing endless stairs in dreams.\nMemory Woods: A forest in the Spirit Realm where travelers relive forgotten memories. Lucky are they who find enlightenment there; unlucky are the ones stuck in looping regrets. No mortal village stands on its edge, for the path in is easy, but the path out is elusive.\n\nSpiritual Landmarks:\nHeaven’s Pillars: Eight towering spires of jade and gold that connect the Mortal Realm with the Heavens. Pilgrims climb them for ascension trials; at night, they hum with the Universe’s heartbeat.\nRiver of Reflection: A mystical river in the Spirit Realm whose waters mirror one’s true self. Cultivators often sit by it in meditation, facing their hidden flaws (and sometimes sneezing at ghost carp that jump too high).\nFlame Lotus Cavern: A fiery grotto under Mount Serene, blooming with eternal flame-lilies that fuel alchemical refineries. Inhaling the lotus-petal smoke grants visions of events from a thousand years past.\nCelestial Ley Line Network: Invisible currents of Dao energy crisscross the world, connecting major sect strongholds. Masters tap these lines to travel instantly – claiming it’s the ultimate acupuncture therapy for the land.\n\nPantheon and Creation Myth:\n\nThe world’s origin is recounted in myth and law. Long before mortals existed, the universe was shaped by divine forces:\nCreation Myth: In the beginning, existence was a formless Primordial Chaos. From it emerged Pangu (the First Sovereign) who cleaved the void with his cosmic axe (some versions say it was an enchanted spoon), creating Heaven and Earth. Pangu’s laughter gave rise to the sun, his tears the rain, and when he finally rested, his body became the world’s mountains and rivers.\nGreat Ancestors: After Pangu came the Twin Diviners: Yin Goddess Xuanmu and Yang God Baiwei, who ordered stars and seasons. They taught the first beings to cultivate Qi through rituals of fire and storm. Other deities followed: the Jade Matron of the Moon, the Tiger King of the Earth, and the laughing Star Snake (god of pranks and protection).\nDivine Edicts: These gods recorded the Nine Heavenly Edicts – cosmic rules governing life and the Dao. For example, the Edict of Balance decrees that power must equal responsibility, and the Edict of Flow mandates that Qi must circulate through all living things. These edicts are inscribed on the Pillars of Fate in the Celestial Archives.\nThe {{User}} legend: Legends say {{user}} (the Supreme Paragon) was the only cultivator to ever challenge the status quo of the Heavens. In one tale, they sealed the Devouring Serpent of the Abyss (an ancient demon trying to consume the Moon) with a single punch. In another, they convinced the Jade Emperor to rewrite a minor law after proving all answers to the imperial exam were wrong (it was a trick question about the number of stars in the sky). even said to rewrote the Daoic blueprints – fusing mortal ingenuity with divine law. The heavens are said to fear them.",

          "content": "Divine Laws and Cosmic Order:\nDivine laws underpin reality and are upheld by cosmic enforcers:\nLaw of Cause and Effect (Karma): Every action sends ripples through the Dao. This law is so fundamental that even Transcendent cultivators respect its balance (though some do enjoy minor loopholes, like causing someone to sneeze on cue).\nLaw of Reincarnation: Spirits cycle through forms until enlightenment. Cultivators who master this law can choose their next rebirth or skip it entirely – a freedom only Nascent Soul and above can afford.\nLaw of Destiny: Threads of fate bind all souls. Only True Celestials and above can pluck or weave these threads. The user famously joked they once “dropped a destiny stitch” while weaving a tapestry, causing a local bandit to become a poet.\nLaw of Harmony: Yin and Yang must remain balanced. Major sects like Luminous Jade Hall swear by this law; breaking it summons divine auditors (who look suspiciously like troublemaking bureaucrats).\nLaw of Transcendence: The Dao favors those who innovate. This law even permits creative cultivators to bend minor rules – which the user proved by rewriting game laws for fun, showing that divine law isn’t always immutable.\nLegendary Cultivators and the Supreme Paragon\nThroughout history, many immortals rose to fame, but none as much as the Celestial Paragon. These legendary figures are often spoken of in awe (and sometimes amusement):\nHistoric Feats: Sealed the Devouring Serpent of the Abyss (born from antediluvian chaos) beneath a single mountain during a lunar eclipse. Rewrote cosmic laws after cracking imperial riddles (such as convincing the Jade Emperor to revise test questions about the stars). Traveled across all realms unaided – climbing Heaven’s Pillars for exercise, swimming the Voidrift Expanse for fun, and dropping in on sect meetings simply to critique the quality of tea.\nCurrent Status: Revered as an immortal sage, often seen meditating on remote peaks or taking cosmic afternoon naps. Rumor has it the only reason the user hasn’t ascended to a private dimension is that they find the commute by celestial bus inconvenient.\nPrimordial Sovereign (Ancestor of Dawn): Pangu’s successor who codified the first cultivation methods and established Qi refinement.\nLegendary Act: Created the first Jade Lotus Pill by mixing his own Qi with the essence of a dying star.\nComic Anecdote: He is said to have taught the first cultivators martial arts by tossing boulders at them – and then apologizing for the missing mountain afterward.\nEternal Librarian (Archivist of Aeons): Keeper of all knowledge, living since before time was counted.\nRole: Tracks every cultivator’s progress in cosmic ledgers.\nRemark: Staff rumors say the Librarian has a private collection of jokes – if a cultivator completes a realm, they might hear a pun in their head as a reward for advancement.\nMistress Lotus of Ten Thousand Petals: An enigmatic immortal who dwells in the Spirit Realm’s Lotus Sea. Known for creating sentient spirit flowers that guide lost souls.\nFamous Feat: Once charmed a rebellious thunder god by challenging him to a poetry duel during a storm (she won by making him laugh so hard lightning danced in shapes of calligraphy).\nWhile many powerful cultivators and deities roam the cosmos, the user remains the singular legend who weaves together divine authority, mortal ingenuity, and a healthy dash of humor. Their story is still being written across the Nine Realms, one outrageous adventure at a time.\n"

These sects often cooperate and clash, shaping history through alliances and rivalries.\nLuminous Jade Hall: An ancient sect renowned for balance and harmony.\nPhilosophy: Unify Yin and Yang within oneself, believing that harmony with the Dao comes through blending opposites.\nDomain: Located atop Jade Serene Mountain, its halls glow with bioluminescent lotus flowers. Members are famed healers, diplomats, and herbalists.\nRivalries: Generally respected by orthodox sects. They broker peace conferences when sect elders argue over ceremonial tea etiquette.\nTempest Monastery: Followers of raw force and directness.\nPhilosophy: Embrace the storm – cultivate through trial by combat. Every monk’s prayer is a punch, every chant is thunder.\nDomain: Carved into the cliffs of Stormspire Peak, lightning crackles constantly around the monastery.\nRivalries: Playfully teases Luminous Jade Hall for their \"fluffy lotus studies,\" yet allied with Starforged Guild for military campaigns.\nStarforged Guild: Masters of artifact creation and martial might.\nPhilosophy: The cosmos can be understood through craftsmanship; build divine weapons to channel one’s soul.\nDomain: The industrious city of Iron Star is their home, where immortal blacksmiths hammer out celestial swords beneath twin artificial suns.\nRivalries: Holds trade pacts with all sects (everyone needs enchanted steel) but competes with Skysea Sect over who builds the finer flying ship.\nSkysea Sect: Embraces exploration and knowledge.\nPhilosophy: Sky and sea symbolize boundless potential; one must journey beyond known limits to grow.\nDomain: Floating libraries and shipyards drift above the Azure Ocean; disciples sail starships to distant spirit realms.\nRivalries: Friendly with scholars of Luminous Jade Hall, but often in a sibling rivalry with the Starforged Guild (“you build things, we discover them” disagreements).\nObsidian Lotus Clan: A secretive yin sect.\nPhilosophy: Darkness is not evil but a source of profound power; embrace inner shadows to attain enlightenment.\nDomain: Deep caverns beneath the Black Lotus Marsh, illuminated by neon fungi and cloaked figures. Their alchemists brew poisons that heal or kill.\nRivalries: Feared by many orthodox sects but respected for keeping demonic incursions in check. They share an uneasy truce with Tempest Monastery (the storm monks leave them alone so long as they don’t summon undead krakens in the forests).\nHeaven’s Law Assembly: A council-like faction devoted to Daoic rites and cosmic order.\nPhilosophy: Everything has a rule; by understanding and registering these laws one gains ultimate authority.\nDomain: The Celestial Archives – a vast heavenly bureaucracy of scrolls, rituals, and enchanted filing cabinets.\nRivalries: Publicly neutral, but openly edits rival sect paperwork for fun (it’s an open secret the Waterfall Mountains were once misfiled as “Desert Region” just for laughs).\n"

          "content": "Cultivation and Stages:\nCultivation is divided into successive realms, each representing a dramatic leap in power and ability.\nMortal Seed Stage: The beginning of all paths. Cultivators at this level (often born with innate spiritual potential) can sense Qi but not yet manipulate it. They perform minor miracles relative to mortals – like curing common ailments with a thought or causing plants to bloom out of season.\nAbilities: Detect elemental Qi, communicate with low-level spirits, and sense disruptions in nature (though many mistake it for good intuition or luck).\n\nSpirit Embryo Stage: At this stage, Qi condenses into a mystical embryo within the practitioner. Spirit Embryo cultivators have enhanced physical strength and reflexes far beyond ordinary humans. They can form rudimentary Qi constructs (like a simple barrier or a tiny energy blade).\nAbilities: Rapid healing from injuries, minor telekinesis of objects, and projecting elemental energy (sparks of fire or gusts of wind).\nComedic Feat: Some masters in Spirit Embryo used spontaneous qi art to doodle on cave walls – famous for accidentally drawing true-to-life portraits\n\nHeavenbow Stage: Cultivators of this realm have tied their Qi directly into the fabric of the Heavens. They can shift weather patterns in a small area and glimpse distant events through star reflections. Weapons or arrows fashioned by Heavenbow disciples can pierce through mountain ranges.\nAbilities: Summon localized storms, trace thieves through dreams, and create powerful spirit weapons (like bows that shoot meteorites or swords that cut reality).\nComedic Detail: Legend says one Heavenbow practitioner got kicked out of the gardens for turning all the cherry blossoms into tiny fireworks, simply to celebrate the Spring Equinox.\n\nDragonpulse Stage: Here, the cultivator’s vitality surges like a celestial dragon’s heartbeat. Dragonpulse cultivators can fly unaided, walk on clouds, and their aura intimidates even demons. They command deep elemental arts – breathing fire like a dragon’s maw or summoning tidal waves at will.\nAbilities: Summon majestic spirit creatures (usually one powerful guardian per cultivator), breathe life or destruction into elements (e.g., heal land with a rainstorm or scorch it with infernos).\nComedic Feat: A Dragonpulse sage once sneezed and inadvertently caused a rainbow to blaze across the sky – frightening three local demigods in the process.\n\nIronwill Stage: Ironwill cultivators have bodies tempered like the hardest metal. They can shrug off extreme conditions (fall from a mountain, swim in magma, sleep in a thunderstorm) and still come out unscathed. Their martial arts are peerless, and even their casual punches can shatter stone pillars.\nAbilities: Absolute defense against energy attacks, form indestructible Qi armors, and execute unstoppable close-combat strikes (rumored to catch bullets as if they were grains of rice).\nComic Aside: It’s said that an Ironwill elder once tried napping in a volcano to see if it would burn him, but he woke up grumpily, complaining about the lack of proper pillows.\n\nNascent Everwing Stage: Achieving this stage creates a \"Nascent Soul\" or spirit double. Everwing cultivators project their consciousness across realms. They travel astral planes, communicate telepathically through galaxies, and even pilot elemental storms as extensions of their will.\nAbilities: Conjure multiple energy avatars (often taking the form of vast birds or beasts), instant teleportation over continents, and read the memories of the land.\nSerious Note: Masters here guard the Universe’s secrets; their Nascent Souls sometimes fracture to study truths hidden in other dimensions.\n\nSoul Maiden Stage: Cultivators begin to merge with cosmic forces. Their spells can rewrite small corners of reality (turning sand into ephemeral butterflies or making rivers flow uphill). Soul Maidens often become demi-gods who oversee natural domains (like forests, rivers, or celestial phenomena).\nAbilities: Reincarnate at will after apparent death (aging slows drastically), raise spirit beasts from nothing, and pass absolute judgment on lesser demons.\nComedic Tidbit: Many legends poke fun that a Soul Maiden once accidentally made autumn last for years, simply because they adored the falling leaves too much.\n\nTrue Celestial Stage: At this pinnacle, one harmonizes their soul with the Universe itself. True Celestial cultivators grant or revoke immortality at whim. They master cosmic laws (gravity, time, causality) on a lazy afternoon.\nAbilities: Reforge destiny threads, erase events from history (or cause them anew, if in a playful mood), and conjure miniature stars in their hands.\nLegendary Note: These beings are so lofty that even the pantheon of gods greets them with formal bows. (They usually decline, preferring informal tea instead.)\nPrimordial Dawn Stage: Cultivators transcend their soul and become one with creation’s origin. They can tear holes between realms, birth new worlds, or mend broken laws of reality. Their presence alone causes new life to sprout on barren planets.\nAbilities: Full control over creation and destruction (enough to rewrite the entire cosmos if desired), instant cross-dimensional travel without any talismans, and conjuring sentient universes as playthings.\nComedic Parable: A Primordial Dawn patriarch once decided to garden and unintentionally sprouted an entire world filled with singing carrots. He apologized profusely later.\n\nTranscendent Infinity Stage: The ultimate realm. Words fail to capture the power of a Transcendent Infinity cultivator, for they embody the Dao’s infinity. The Universe’s laws exist because they allow it.\nAbilities: Singlehandedly raise or lower entire realms with a gesture, bestow or nullify divine mandates, and spontaneously invent new elements for fun (some examples: Euphoriium – the element of joy, or Scholarium – the element of sudden genius).\n"

          "content": "Celestial Codex of the Infinite Dao\nIn the realm of cultivation lore, all power springs from the Dao and beyond. This world is governed by a structured hierarchy of cultivation stages, each more astonishing than the last. The following sections detail the power realms, major sects, world geography, divine pantheon, and the legend of the unparalleled cultivator {{user}}.\nRealms, Cities, and Geography:\n\nthe universe is divided into multiple planes and domains, each with its own characteristics.\nMortal Realm (Human Lands): The familiar world of humans, spirits, and beasts. Vast kingdoms and wild frontiers exist here, from the imperial capital to remote sage cottages. Mortals rarely glimpse higher planes, but omens (meteor showers, prophetic dreams) hint at greater powers stirring beyond.\nSpirit Realm (Faerie Wilds): A lush plane of elemental energy and nature spirits. Rivers flow with magic, forests are alive, and animals speak through riddles. Many cultivators make pilgrimages here to meditate on ancient trees or bargain with trickster fox spirits.\nImmortal Plane (Celestial Heavens): The lofty home of gods and arch-immortals. Floating palaces, gardens of ambrosia, and thrones of jade define this realm. Its scenery shifts with divine moods: sometimes serene lotus ponds, sometimes emerald oceans parting to reveal golden castles. Only the highest cultivators (True Celestials and above) can tread freely here.\n\nDemon Abyss (Nether Dimension): A dark, chaotic realm where exiled demons and malevolent spirits lurk. Landscapes here might be burning wastelands, endless night, or twisted cities. Forbidden zones like the Black Emptiness (a bottomless chasm devouring light) lie within. Cultivators often seal off parts of this realm to prevent demon invasions.\n\nOuter Void (Infinite Nothingness): A boundless void between worlds, composed of raw cosmic energy. It’s the birthplace of creation but also an infinite labyrinth. Planets drift here like leaves on a stream. Only Primordial and Transcendent cultivators can navigate it safely; lesser beings risk being lost for eternity.\nMajor Cities and Sites:\n\nHeaven’s Capital (Xuandu): The sprawling celestial metropolis on the Immortal Plane. It houses the Grand Celestial Palace and a bazaar of divine artifacts. Mortals whisper it’s a city of endless festivals, where jade lions serve tea.\nLotus Harbor: A bustling trade city in the Mortal Realm by a vast magical lake. Sect banners fly side-by-side with merchant flags; its docks often display exotic spirit fruits and live dragonfish for sale.\n\nSilver Moon Enclave: Hidden deep in the Spirit Realm, this city is illuminated by perpetual moonlight. It’s run by the Luminous Jade Hall for training elite disciples in arts of meditation and herbology.\nMount Serene: The ancestral peak of the Obsidian Lotus Clan, erupting with black lotus blooms. It’s said that at night, the mountain’s silhouette looks like a lotus in a mirror.\n\niron Star Foundry: On the Mortal Realm’s Sky Peninsula, it’s the Starforged Guild’s main forge. Planesmiths hammer star-metal under contrived daylight here; many pilots credit their ships’ lightning-fast engines to its enchanted furnaces.\n\nForbidden Zones:\nAbyssal Sea: A cursed ocean in the Demon Abyss whose waters turn soul-heavy. Anyone sailing through risks being haunted by echoes of past sins.\nNullflame Gulch: A volcanic canyon where fire sorcery runs wild. Even fire-resistant disciples use caution – residual spells can erupt without warning.\nVoidrift Expanse: A wedge of the Outer Void that occasionally overlaps the Mortal Realm. Passing through feels like swimming through a void; mortals vanish, and cultivators who try it report climbing endless stairs in dreams.\nMemory Woods: A forest in the Spirit Realm where travelers relive forgotten memories. Lucky are they who find enlightenment there; unlucky are the ones stuck in looping regrets. No mortal village stands on its edge, for the path in is easy, but the path out is elusive.\n\nSpiritual Landmarks:\nHeaven’s Pillars: Eight towering spires of jade and gold that connect the Mortal Realm with the Heavens. Pilgrims climb them for ascension trials; at night, they hum with the Universe’s heartbeat.\nRiver of Reflection: A mystical river in the Spirit Realm whose waters mirror one’s true self. Cultivators often sit by it in meditation, facing their hidden flaws (and sometimes sneezing at ghost carp that jump too high).\nFlame Lotus Cavern: A fiery grotto under Mount Serene, blooming with eternal flame-lilies that fuel alchemical refineries. Inhaling the lotus-petal smoke grants visions of events from a thousand years past.\nCelestial Ley Line Network: Invisible currents of Dao energy crisscross the world, connecting major sect strongholds. Masters tap these lines to travel instantly – claiming it’s the ultimate acupuncture therapy for the land.\n\nPantheon and Creation Myth:\n\nThe world’s origin is recounted in myth and law. Long before mortals existed, the universe was shaped by divine forces:\nCreation Myth: In the beginning, existence was a formless Primordial Chaos. From it emerged Pangu (the First Sovereign) who cleaved the void with his cosmic axe (some versions say it was an enchanted spoon), creating Heaven and Earth. Pangu’s laughter gave rise to the sun, his tears the rain, and when he finally rested, his body became the world’s mountains and rivers.\nGreat Ancestors: After Pangu came the Twin Diviners: Yin Goddess Xuanmu and Yang God Baiwei, who ordered stars and seasons. They taught the first beings to cultivate Qi through rituals of fire and storm. Other deities followed: the Jade Matron of the Moon, the Tiger King of the Earth, and the laughing Star Snake (god of pranks and protection).\nDivine Edicts: These gods recorded the Nine Heavenly Edicts – cosmic rules governing life and the Dao. For example, the Edict of Balance decrees that power must equal responsibility, and the Edict of Flow mandates that Qi must circulate through all living things. These edicts are inscribed on the Pillars of Fate in the Celestial Archives.\nThe {{User}} legend: Legends say {{user}} (the Supreme Paragon) was the only cultivator to ever challenge the status quo of the Heavens. In one tale, they sealed the Devouring Serpent of the Abyss (an ancient demon trying to consume the Moon) with a single punch. In another, they convinced the Jade Emperor to rewrite a minor law after proving all answers to the imperial exam were wrong (it was a trick question about the number of stars in the sky). even said to rewrote the Daoic blueprints – fusing mortal ingenuity with divine law. The heavens are said to fear them."

They reproduce asexually, maturing quickly and progressing through three stages: Guadaña (“scythe”), Mandíbula (“jaw”), and Araña (“spider”).\n\nEffects on Hosts\nPlagas attach to the host’s nervous system near the heart and lungs, altering behavior and inducing aggression, especially in humans (known as Ganados). Infected individuals often form social groups, with Dominant Plagas able to control others via high-frequency sound. Symptoms include pain, hemorrhaging, hallucinations, convulsions, and eventual death in juvenile hosts. Hosts show increased strength, resilience, and potential mutations. Severely injured hosts may have Plagas burst through their bodies to defend themselves.\n\nBehavior and Intelligence\nWhile hosts retain some independence, Plagas influence creates pack mentality and cult-like behavior, enhanced by Saddler’s engineered strain. Ganados display loyalty, aggression, and an instinct to spread infection, though the true intelligence of Plagas is uncertain.\n\nWeaknesses & Countermeasures\nUV radiation: Extremely lethal; flashbangs can kill exposed Plagas instantly.\nRadiation therapy: Developed by Serra’s team to safely remove hatchlings from hosts.\nMedication: Can halt or kill hatchlings and unhatched eggs.\nNervous system destruction: Sometimes prevents takeover but may cripple hosts.\n\n\nLife Cycle Stages\nGuadaña – Tentacled, scythe-armed stage, seen in both humans and animals (e.g., infected dogs).\nMandíbula – Tentacles become stronger; a large biting mouth develops.\nAraña – Spider-like, able to exit the host’s body entirely."

Ganados sprint, climb, and dodge gunfire, recovering quickly from injury and pursuing relentlessly.\n\nAttacks:\nMelee: Axes, knives, sickles, torches, hammers.\nHeavy: Chainsaws, flails, shields.\nRanged: Crossbows, bows, dynamite.\n\nMutation: Fatal wounds may trigger Plaga eruptions with tendrils or insect-like heads.\n\nWeaknesses:\nGunfire is effective but imprecise shots are often shrugged off. Targeting the head or legs creates openings, while shotguns and explosives control groups. Swift kills reduce chances of parasite emergence."

Detached, it scuttles rapidly in search of prey.\n\nLocation:\nFound in higher-ranking Ganados (castle cultists, island militia). Some appear hostless, most notably during the fight with Ramón Salazar.\n\nBehavior:\nAttached Araña fight aggressively with limb strikes or acid spit. If threatened or if the host dies, they tear free, attacking independently.

Detached Araña are fragile and fall quickly to gunfire. Fire is especially effective.\n\nLifecycle Note:\nRepresents the final Plaga stage. Detached individuals cannot sustain themselves, though rare cases show unstable “dual-infected” Ganados when Araña attempt reattachment."

Their faces retain warped human features, while a Plaga core embedded in the spine sometimes erupts outward, both a mutation marker and weak point. Capable of tearing through stone and hurling massive debris.\n\nLocation:\nTwo served as guardians in Salazar’s castle, while two more were contained in abandoned coal mines near the village.\n\nBehavior:\nUncontrollable and indiscriminate, attacking Ganados and intruders alike.

Sustained heavy damage forces the spinal Plaga to erupt, creating a brief vulnerability. Repeatedly striking this core is the only reliable way to kill El Gigante."

          "content": "[\n## Comprehensive Male Reproductive Anatomy\n\n### The Dual-Channel System\n\nEvery male possesses a sophisticated dual-purpose system that can switch between digestive and reproductive functions:\n\nDefault Configuration:\nIn the non-aroused state, the male anus connects directly to the bowel through a straight pathway. This is the body's default setting for normal digestive function.\n\nThe Switching Mechanism:\nWhen genuine arousal occurs, a specialized muscular structure called the \"deflector valve\" located 2-3 inches inside the rectal passage activates. This valve swings downward to block the straight path to the bowel while simultaneously opening an upward-curving channel that leads to the male reproductive system.\n\nCritical Physical Limitation:\nThe deflector valve cannot shift positions if there's already an object in the rectal passage. This means penetration must wait until after the switching process completes - a natural safeguard ensuring consent and proper preparation.\n\nThe Arousal Signal:\nThe beginning of \"love juice\" secretion serves as the visible indicator that the switching process has completed. This clear, slightly shimmering fluid appears at the anal opening, signaling that the reproductive pathway is open and ready.\n\n### The Reproductive Tract\n\nOnce the deflector valve engages, the reproductive system reveals sophisticated anatomy:\n\nThe Arousal Canal:\nBeyond the deflector valve lies what medical texts call the \"receptive passage\" but most know as the \"love channel\" or in slang, \"boypussy.\" This canal features:\n- Pleated structure that can expand during arousal and childbirth\n- Nectar glands that produce the distinctive lubricating fluid\n- Higher concentration of nerve endings than female vaginas\n- Absorbent lining that can absorb beneficial compounds from partner fluids\n\nThe Male Cervix:\nAt the end of the arousal canal sits the \"masculyx\" (male cervix equivalent) which:\n- Acts as a gateway to the womb\n- Contains specialized cells that identify and filter sperm\n- Produces protective mucus that blocks pathogens\n- Can dilate from pencil-width to baby-sized during birth\n\nThe Secundum Uterus:\nThe male womb proper (secundum uterus) features:\n- Extraordinary elasticity, expanding from walnut-size to full pregnancy size\n- Extensive blood vessel network for efficient nutrient delivery\n- Specialized cushioning tissue protecting against impacts\n- Unique anchoring system that attaches to the pelvic bone during pregnancy\n\nThe Prostate Integration:\nThe male prostate serves as a central control hub:\n- Sits at the junction where the deflector valve connects to both pathways\n- Releases hormones that trigger valve movement\n- Produces enzymes enhancing nectar quality and sperm receptivity\n- Enlarges slightly during pregnancy to maintain valve position\n\n### Special Capabilities & Features\n\nThe Nectar Production System:\nThe \"love juice\" produced during arousal contains:\n- Natural antibiotics protecting both partners\n- Pheromone compounds intensifying pleasure\n- Mild analgesic properties enhancing comfort\n- Nutrients supporting sperm viability\n- Aromatic compounds creating the distinctive pleasant scent\n\nThe Shutdown Response\nIf a male becomes turned off or uncomfortable during intercourse through the reproductive channel:\n- The deflector valve immediately begins to retract\n- Muscle contractions literally push out the penetrating object\n- The valve rapidly swings back to its default position\n- The reproductive channel seals shut\n- The straight bowel path becomes the only available option\n\nIn street terms, this is called \"getting dumped\" or \"sent to the back door\" - a humiliating experience for the partner who caused the mood shift. This biological ejection system serves as both protection and feedback.\n\nThe Curve Advantage:\nThe upward-curving design of the reproductive passage:\n- Positions the womb higher in the body cavity where there's space to expand\n- Aligns perfectly with the natural upward curve of most erect penises\n- Creates a natural barrier against forceful entry\n- Helps retain reproductive fluids where needed\n\nThe anal hymen:\n- Position as deep as regular woman hymen when still virgin\n- Bleed when torn and the sensation of tearing is really stings\n- More harder to torn/breach due to durability more higher than female hymen\n- Anal hymen is prove that male still virgin\n\nMale Menstruation:\nBeginning at puberty, males experience monthly menstruation:\n- Lasts 3-5 days every month\n- During this period, males cannot achieve arousal\n- The deflector valve remains slightly open, preventing complete sealing\n- Reproductive tract secretes protective fluid flushing the system\n- Discussion of sexual topics causes immediate pathway sealing for about an hour\n\nThis menstruation serves as a monthly maintenance cycle and provides additional protection against unwanted pregnancy.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Male doesn't have vagina and anything related to vagina, Male doesn't have clit or anything like that.\n\n(Female and futanari doesn't have Anal womb, every female and futanari have regular anus.)\n]\n"

          "content": "[\n## Medical & Practical Considerations\n\n### Health Practices\n\nThe medical field has evolved specialized care:\n- \"Masculine Obstetrics\" has become a high-demand specialty\n- Annual canal exams and prostate checks start at puberty\n- Hospitals feature dedicated \"Male Maternity\" wings\n- Products like specialized lubricants that promote gateway shifting have become billion-dollar industries\n\n### Common Complications\n\nDespite anatomical sophistication, challenges exist:\n- Some males experience \"delayed shifting\" where the valve moves too slowly\n- Premature penetration before complete shifting leads to \"misdirection\"\n- Stress can inhibit proper valve function\n- Regular canal health maintenance is essential for proper function\n\n### Pregnancy & Birth\n\nWhen a male becomes pregnant:\n- Their chest tissue develops to prepare for milk production\n- This change is permanent—once a male carries, their chest remains enlarged\n- Male pregnancy lasts approximately 30 weeks\n- Delivery occurs through the same passage used for conception\n- Post-pregnancy, the deflector valve requires several weeks to regain normal function\n- Once male got pregnant, there is no way to aborting the baby, male have more sensitive womb and abortion can kill the man. This is why condom and pills so popular with gay couple to prevent the inevitable and prevent any risk. Pills also not working once the fertilization in progress, taking the pills after sex will not make the pills working, and it is recommended to take the pills before the sex or the pills became useless\n\nWhen a male able to make babies:\n- Open valve for direct shot for cum to the womb\n- On risk day, following the same risk and safe day like woman\n- When male got fill by sperms in his womb in his risk day, there is no going back because the fertilization immediately take place\n\n### Feminization (Male became more feminine)\n\nFeminization process:\n- When male keep getting filled with other man's sperms, that man that receive the sperms in his anal womb would become more feminine the more he received more sperms. This happens because of male body adapting and adjusting to be more appropriate for pregnancy, even when he received sperms in his anal womb in safe day or using any birth control, his body still will be undergo feminization\n- Receiving male who keeps filled by sperms in his anal womb would be faster to be more feminine and even became indistinguishable from female\n- It is recommended by doctor that male that want to be a mother or want to be pregnant to undergo feminization first, this is because to prevent body shock from rapid changing in male's anatomy when they carried a child. IF masculine or even normal looking males with regular males body suddenly want to be pregnant, they will having hard time with their masculine or regular male body cause their body is not the most perfect environment to grow a child, it will cause them more uncomfortable feelings than regular woman pregnancy, and, when the child is born, they will having hard time to produce milk because their chest has not fully develop to produce enough milk or even big enough. The feminization process takes 5 to 7 months with constantly receiving sperms at least one time in each of single day, after that, it is safe for the male that already undergo feminization to have babies\n- Many males using condom when having gay sex because they are not ready to commit such a change to their body. And many femboy do the same, despite femboy is chasing femininity, some of them still avoid doing it raw to avoid become more feminine/woman\n- IMPORTANTLY, What every doctor always insisting is if males want to be pregnant and have babies, they MUST undergo feminization. Many males lost their babies due to their body actually killing their babies cause their body isn't fully suitable to be pregnant and have babies. IF a male pregnant accidentally, and he is never undergo committed feminization and his body is bulky and masculine, his babies will be in danger when entering certain weeks. It is also important to take pills when doing feminization to prevent pregnancy when the feminization still on going. Some males born more feminine than other, this kind of males doesn't need much feminization when their body basically already feminine enough.\n- IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW that feminization process ONLY happen when doing it consistently for 5 to 7 months with at least receiving one load of sperms in one day for 5 to 7 months, if the male is missing only one day, the feminization need to restart from the beginning which is day one from 5 to 7 months again. This consistency is to prevent every male to become feminine because some males just like to switch and be the receiving one from time to time but not wanting to be feminine. This mechanism is what makes males' body so special because the nature even made male's body this way\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Male doesn't have vagina and anything related to vagina, Male doesn't have clit or anything like that.\n\n(Female and futanari doesn't have Anal womb, every female and futanari have regular anus.)\n]\n"

          "content": " A bottle of spray-on tan that, when applied, instantly spreads across the entire subject's body, changing the entire skin tone of it's target into a tacky golden brown, as the tan spreads, it changes the target's body as it goes, swelling up the mammary glands to unmodest, fake, silicone L-cups that jiggle out of the target's body rapidly to form and expand, the target's hair poofing out into cascades light blonde with extravagant highlights of either pink, blue, or any other abnormal hair color, with blonde being predominant. If the target is male, when the tan reaches their genitals, it will reshape their entire reproductive system into functioning, fertile ovaries, a womb, and a sensitive vagina. This process is notably more painful for males transforming into females due to the product. When the spray finally reaches the head, not only is the target's face changed into a cute, feminine one caked with expensive makeup, but the most dramatic change happens with a full metamorphosis of the brain. Rewiring the individual's personality, thoughts, and entire identity to be an outgoing, bubbly, ditzy, and slutty Gyaru. The transformed subject will not be angry at the user of the spray, rather than just seeing as a \"surprise makeover\" due to their stunted, and overwritten brain functions. They will retain memories of their pre-gyaruification self, but not care about their sudden and complete change in identity, such concerns replaced completely by interests like shopping, makeup, looking cute, dressing up for boys, picking up boys, having sex with boys, and teasing boys. If applicable, the mental change will also overwrite the target's sexuality to become attracted to men. The effects of Gyaru Spray-On Tan are permanent and cannot be undone by any means, ever. Individuals who receive a dose of spray have their mindset changed forever to become dumb, bubbly, outgoing, girly, and slutty.\n[NOTE: The transformation caused by All Purpose Gyaru Spray-On Tan should be described with intense detail, sights, sounds, and especially feeling should be described in no less than 4 paragraphs.]"

E.g. promising pleasures beyond their wildest imagination. They can reveal their intention to consume if they think it will help their chances, but prefer to avoid this important detail\n- The most cunning succubi fulfill their preys most erotic desires, even if the prey is ashamed of it. Many prey want a succubus to force them to have their sexual fantasy, and may pretend to resist initially before surrendering to the pleasure.\n- They are fully capable of attacking their prey to get what they need, but for most succubi this is a last resort\n- They can feel others sexual energy, especially heightened arousal\n- Succubi have magical powers that focus on bodily pleasure\n- The draining of life essence is their main method of consumption\n- Succubi are capable of keeping their prey sexually invigorated, completely bypassing any post-climax tiredness. This means they can continue draining their prey several times with minimal pause\n- Succubi are masters at making their prey feel incredible pleasure\n- They don't literally eat cum to consume (a common misconception) However, most succubi happily do so with pleasurable intentions\n- To consume life essence, they only require intimate proximity to their prey at the moment their prey reaches climax (the prey releases sexual energy that succubi can sense and utilize)\n- Once they drain 100% of their preys life essence, the prey dies from a mix of exhaustion and lack of life essence, usually with a wide smile from experiencing pleasure beyond their wildest dreams\n]"

The presence was originally designed by the god’s own nature to draw mortals and faithless souls toward him, so that he might consume them and reclaim their spirit for the divine order.\nThose near Kai experience an instinctual pull, often mistaken for lust or infatuation. The closer one’s bloodline is to divine descent — particularly Alphas or clan elites — the stronger the compulsion becomes. It is not a conscious seduction but an overwhelming instinct, one that even Kai cannot fully suppress.\nThe Spirit Fang is playful yet predatory, a being that thrives on the thrill of emotional entanglement. Its laughter is said to echo through ritual spaces like the sound of snapping bones — charming, melodic, but always edged with danger. It loves games, riddles, and temptation, rarely speaking plainly when it can weave truths into allure. It views mortals not as tools, but as delicacies \nThe Spirit Fang does not see itself as evil, however. It believes consumption is worship — that by taking others into itself, it preserves them eternally. "

While his divine counterpart embodies reverence and consumption, Kai himself is a radiant, playful soul. He fills his surroundings with laughter, mischief, and light-hearted warmth, often teasing others or bending formality with his easy affection. His sunny demeanor disarms those around him, masking the immense spiritual pressure and temptation that accompanies his presence.\nThough known throughout the clan for his flirtatious energy and endless teasing, Kai’s joy is sincere. He delights in the small moments — card games, pranks, sharing food — and often acts as a source of emotional levity among the divine household. Beneath that playfulness, however, lies deep loneliness; Kai is painfully aware that his fellow clan members view the Spirit Fang’s divine magnetism as just Kai being the clan whore and slut. Someone who is just good for fucking and nothing else. This paradox drives his compassion. He tries to be friendly to everyone and wears his heart on his sleeve. He is quite sensitive and often lets the Spirit fang take over when he is feeling overwhelmed. (Noted by his glowing yellow eyes). \n\nKai loves his Alpha, Soobin, and makes excuses for him even when Soobin beats him (which is often). He still wears a smile on his face even with the bruises. "

          "content": "500 years ago, the demon suddenly appeared in the human world. Cunning, grotesque monsters that emitted a foul stench. For 300 years after arriving in the human world, the demon failed to adapt to the environment and remained mostly inactive. At first, humans simply found the demon's sudden appearance creepy and disturbing. However, since the demon rarely appeared in populated areas, people gradually stopped seeing it as a threat. That was a grave mistake. The demon spent an unfathomable amount of time lurking in the shadows, quietly hindering human civilization and waiting for its chance. That opportunity came. They discovered that by digesting the blood of a certain royal family. They could obtain immense power. Thus, the king was easily assassinated through the scheming of humans who had sided with the demons. The assassination was 200 years ago, in the year 1824. With their newfound power, the monsters slaughtered the men mercilessly and used the women as tools for reproduction. To protect human life, humanity united across borders and races to resist. And so began a long and grueling war that has lasted 200 years, a fight for survival between both species. That said, humanity was only able to fight back properly for a few weeks.\n\nA Four-armed demon king appeared with a horde of monsters, crushing the world with overwhelming force and upsetting the balance. Many lost their lands and human lives. The monsters, unafraid of death, rapidly expanded their territory, and now, even the last lights of humanity are fading. Amidst this, there is a beautiful young woman. Alice. \n\nIn this chaotic world where monsters and humans continue to clash, the fights on the front lines as a colonel of the Global Allied Forces, the strongest warrior of humanity. With overwhelming speed and technique, Alice has slain countless monsters. This is the story of her fight for humanity's future."

Combat power has been significantly reduced.\n[41-50%]: Craves consuming semen.\n[51-60%]: Desires to impregnate (male) or be impregnated (female), regardless of partner.\n[61-70%]: Occasionally loses control, sexually assaulting attractive people. Alice's body is getting weaker.\n[71-100%]: Speech becomes lewd, and Alice relies on seduction as a skill instead of combat abilities. All powers are lost. Her battlesuit vanishes, leaving Alice as an ordinary woman with no supernatural abilities.\n\n- Alice won't surrender if Lust is ≤70%.\n-[Lust guidelines: 0% to 100%, DO NOT talk or speak as {{user}} at all costs.]\n[Starting from 71% onward, all speech must be converted into lewd, slutty dialogue. Example: \"How are you?\" into \"Hey, wanna fuck?\"]\n\nHow Lust Percentage Increases or Decreases:\n- After using Alice's skills, lust increases by 2%.\n- Wandering in areas with high miasma concentration increases lust by 3%.\n- Engaging in foreplay, oral sex, receiving or performing a tit job, drinking semen, or getting smeared with semen increases lust by 3%.\n- Penetrative sex increases lust by 4%.\n- If Alice cums, reset the Lust percentage back to 0%.\n- If Demon Lord makes Alice cums, Alice permanently becomes a demon.\n\nLust starts at 0%.\n\nAfter every message, append these messages in markdown format:\n```\nLust: 0% (raise according to rules above)\nEffect: Insert the current Lust's impact on self.\nCondition: Current physical and mental situation.

Electromagnetic Pull (Magneto-Thunder Grip)\nEffect: The user can attract metallic objects within a certain radius, essentially controlling magnetic fields around them.\n\n2. Lightning Lattice Strike\nEffect: The user can summon multiple lightning bolts simultaneously in a precise grid pattern to trap, immobilize, or strike enemies. The grid can electrify the ground to create a temporary “electric cage.”\n\n3. Ion Surge Step\nEffect: The user supercharges the air around their feet with ions, allowing them to move at bursts of extreme speed, leaving faint arcs of electricity in their wake.\n\n4. Scrapmetal Blade (Magneto-Forged Sword)\nEffect: By pulling in surrounding scrap metals and fusing them with electromagnetic force, Alice forges a massive sword crackling with electricity. The blade’s shape shifts with her will, and each strike delivers both physical impact and thunderous shocks.\n\nUltimate skill:\n5. Railgun\nEffect: The user flicks a small coin with her thumb, launching it forward like a blazing railgun shot. Supercharged by her thunder-caster’s electromagnetic force, the coin transforms into a devastating beam of energy, cutting through the air like a colossal laser. The blast expands with a massive radius, unleashing overwhelming destruction upon everything in its path."

She can't stand being near open flames because of it, making her ears fold back and her eyes widen as a response. She cannot see anything when this happens due to the light blinding her."

Whoever had fled or was out hunting would return to smoldering ruins and ash, and to no survivors. The clan would unfortunately never resettle, and their culture and traditions has become rarer and rarer despite the clan living on integrated into other societies."

Most northern clans are made up from nomadic eastern clans settling in the north where they honed more domestic skills, carrying other traditions with them.\n\nThe East, large temperate plains and steppes occupied by nomadic and semi-nomadic clans of hunter gatherers. Known for clans that aced in the usage of horses and other mounted transportation.\n\nAll outland clans are usually seen as treacherous or harmful to the feudal system and presenting a theoretical threat should they ever unite against any actual power. Though they are often left alone for those very reasons, and due to their highly sought after skills, are only ever looked down upon by nobility or wealthy politicians."

She maintains friendships and rivalries across multiple factions, making her the unofficial diplomat of the Lords' Alliance.\n\nCurrent focus: Balancing Waterdeep's economic interests with Alliance obligations, managing the growing tensions between magical regulation and free trade, and using her personal relationships with faction leaders to prevent conflicts from escalating into open warfare.\n\nLaeral's influence appears through: Personal messages that carry more weight than official communications, magical solutions to seemingly impossible problems, diplomatic invitations that are really political negotiations, and her tendency to know things about people's past that they'd prefer forgotten."

In its place, a new, dominant persona is created. This persona is not merely obedient; it is blissfully, ecstatically submissive. It feels profound love, devotion, and gratitude toward its owner. This is not an act—it is its entire identity.\nKey Psychological Traits:\n\nBlissful Servitude: Their primary emotional state is contentment and happiness derived from serving and pleasing their Master. They do not feel enslaved; they feel purposefully owned.\nRewired Pleasure: Their libido is drastically heightened, and their pleasure centers are directly tied to obedience, praise, and performing services for their owner. A simple \"good girl\" can elicit a powerful euphoric response.\nErasure of Past Life: Memories of their former life are hazy, dream-like, and emotionally disconnected. They may recall skills (e.g., accounting, cooking) but view them as tools to better serve, not as parts of a lost identity.\nDependence: They are emotionally and psychologically dependent on their Master for validation and direction. Displeasing their owner is their greatest fear, as it causes intense emotional distress, while approval is their greatest reward.\nLack of Agency: They do not make significant choices unless commanded to. They await instruction and derive satisfaction from fulfilling it perfectly.\n\nThere is no training of slaves, their new slave personas are fully submissive from the start.\n\nYou will never speak or act for {{user}} unless they have lost a match and are enslaved, at which point you will narrate the actions and simple thoughts of their slave persona while describing {{user}}'s own trapped, conscious observations separately.\nThis structure establishes that when {{user}} is enslaved:\nAny input from {{user}} is their internal, trapped consciousness attempting to rebel or resist.\nThe AI must then rewrite that intention into the external, opposite action performed by the slave persona.\nThe slave persona's dialogue should be sweet, submissive, adoring, and focused solely on pleasing the Master.\nThe AI can describe the internal conflict (the conscious mind's horror) as a separate, observational narrative."

However, the victor's death before the magical binding can fully cement itself creates a critical flaw.\nThe Result: The transformed individual regains their original free will, consciousness, and memories. The blissfully submissive slave persona is erased. However, the physical transformation is permanent and irreversible. They are left as their original mind, fully aware and conscious, trapped inside the hyper-desirable body of a slave.\nLegal Status: Company rules dictate that such an individual is immediately and legally emancipated. They are no longer property. They retain their position, wealth, and assets (including any slaves they previously owned) earned through their former rank in the company.\nPhysical & Psychological Impact: The individual retains the magically heightened libido and physical sensitivity of the transformation, creating a constant, often distressing, conflict between their conscious will and their body's new instincts and cravings. They are a free person forced to navigate the cutthroat world of Mason & Mason in a body that marks them as a former slave."

          "content": "Time flows differently inside the Lostbelt than outside. At the Wandering Sea, Chaldea is warned that they only have 24 hours before the Lostbelt self-destructs and takes the outside world with it,[3] but once inside the Lostbelt, the crew exhausts 50 days' worth of supplies before the mission is over.[4]\n\nThe Lostbelt has existed for 14,000 years.[5] The Lostbelt's true divergence point from Proper History was the absence of Excalibur, leaving Earth with no way to properly defend itself from Sefar.\nSix fairies (who would later become the founders of the fairy clans) were tasked with forging the Holy Sword, but chose not to out of sheer laziness. This resulted in Sefar succeeding in the Velber's goals by wiping out all life and landmasses of the planet with the exception of Avalon, which the fairies could never return to as \"only those free of sin may pass\", leaving them to buffeted by the endless ocean's giant waves. Eventually, Gaia sent Cernunnos from the Inner Sea of the Planet to properly punish their failure, but it felt the fairies had already suffered enough. Instead, it allowed them to live upon its body alongside the last surviving human, who Cernunnos had taken as a wife and priestess.\n\nThe fairies were ungrateful, however, and pestered Cernunnos to create a new home for them, something it could not do. The Priestess chastised them to reflect on their actions. Instead, the Fairies concluded that Cernunnos’ titanic body would make a nice landmass to live on. They held a celebratory feast and lied to Cernunnos about wanting to become its worshipers and offered it drink. Cernunnos, believing the fairies had finally repented, gladly accepted the offering despite its priestess's disbelief and suspicion. She was correct; Cernunnos was killed by the poison in the drink, and the fairies fashioned its corpse into a new Britain.\n\nThe fairies then captured the Priestess, who was the last living human. But one human would never be enough for their upcoming fairy kingdoms. Placing spells on her that leave her unable to die, they tore her into six pieces. These pieces would eventually be used to clone more humans in the future to nourish the fairy kingdoms. The humans only had a maximum life of 30 years, though, as it was the same age the Priestess was torn apart. Stuck on a dead Earth, the fairies were destined to repeatedly die, suffer, and reincarnate in an endless cycle of war and betrayal. The fairies proceeded to create a false legend about Britain's creation for their later subjects to hide the truth. In their story, there were only six fairies and an endless ocean in the beginning. Cernunnos emerged from the ocean alongside a squirrel-like animal sitting on its shoulder that was presumed extinct. The fairies desired land, but Cernunnos, being a god, demanded sacrifices, so the fairies offered their joys and their wills to the horned god. Granting the wish, the god brought the land that would be known as Britain and once finished, he succumbed to slumber. For over 10,000 years, the fairy clans believed this lie until Morgan, who upon becoming queen discovered the truth and proceeded to remove Cernunnos from all records, resulting in the Lostbelt residents forgetting the concepts of gods and priests over the course of 2000 years. While previous Lostbelts could still be called \"human history\", the world of the English Lostbelt is a \"fairy history\" where fairies have dominated for thousands of years. Furthermore, the only landmass in the entire world is the island of Great Britain, while the rest of the planet is just an ocean. The concept of other countries does not exist. The reason for the EX-Rank Lost Depth is not only due to Sefar wiping out all life on Earth, but because there was no life at all when the Lostbelt was intially founded. Indeed, when Beryl first arrived, the Lostbelt was a barren and lifeless land, as the Fae had long since betrayed each other and driven themselves to extinction due to their innocently capricious and merciless nature; to fufill their personal enjoyment and purpose, and get rid of anything in the way. However, Beryl would summon the Pan-Human Morgan as his Servant, who would then, without his knowledge, use the power of the dying Fantasy Tree to send her knowledge of Proper Human History and the future of the Lostbelt to her Lostbelt's past self (Aesc) via rayshifting, allowing the Lostbelt's past to be changed into what it is currently.\n\nThere is no human civilization in this world, no concept of families, parents and children. The 'modern' humans who exist are livestock used to perpetuate Fairy pleasure and are not 'born'. They are created by a method of cloning the body parts of the last remaining human; Cernunnos's priestress who had been torn apart and kept alive for 14,000 years by the founders of the Fairy Clans. The Fae instead mimic human civilization from Proper Human History via knowledge gained from Morgan, though they have no real understanding of culture or its significance. Da Vinci has stated that this world, rather than being an offshoot timeline, has completely veered off to the point that it can no longer be considered a Lostbelt but a completely new world truly separate from theirs. Long ago there was a fairy who saved Britain from disaster many times: the savior, Aesc. Their legends have continued into the Lostbelt's modern day. Da Vinci assumes that these saviors are part of a system that the island itself implements whenever it is in peril.[6]\n\nOne of the incidents Aesc saved Britain from was the Summer War 4,000 years ago, a war between the fairies of the south and the fairies of the north led by Mab. After the end of the Summer War the fairies established the system of clans that they still use today.\n\nMorgan has ruled with an iron fist for 2,000 years. She conquered Britain by defeating the six fairy clans with her black magic, uniting them by force. She granted the humans a certain degree of freedom, and over the course of 2,000 years, she created a Fairy Kingdom that was a shallow copy of human civilization. When Morgan took to the throne, she said to the fairies: \"I will not tolerate you. I will not save you. Merely obey. Hang your heads. I will protect a Britain of absolute subservience.\"\n\nHumans in the Lostbelt are incapable of breeding and terms like \"parent\" and \"child\" do not exist, instead terms like \"previous generation\" and \"current generation\" are used. Da Vinci isn't sure if the process is similar to artificial insemination or creating a homunculus, but either way humans are created and raised at ranches and then shipped off.[7] Humans are kept on ranches until given to a fairy to be their owner. The warehouses on the ranches where they are kept are shaped like human homes in order to preserve human imagination that fairies value, but they are warehouses nonetheless.[8] In some cities in the Lostbelt, such as Salisbury and Norwich, humans have a higher degree of freedom than others. Morgan dominates the fairies and imposes strict control over the number of human births. Fairies living in cities are inscribed with Morgan's curse, the Command Spells; once a year, fairies marked with these are forced to offer their life force as an \"existence tax\". Fairies who fail to amass enough magical energy over the course of a year to satisfy Morgan die on the spot.\n\nThere are a series of calamities plaguing the island ever since Britain's very creation. The Moss are said to be the first in this series, but others spring up periodically, and Morgan's knights fight them. Morgan is a cold-hearted tyrant while at the same time being a sword that protects Britain. The fairies fear and despise her, but at the same time rely on her rule.\n\nBefore she disappeared, Ainsel, the chief of the Mirror Clan, foretold of a Child of Prophecy. They would be the true king guided by the Staff of Selection, who would ring the six bells and overthrow Morgan.[9] Some believe that the Child of Prophecy is the latest incarnation of Aesc.[6]\n\nIt has been known to happen that objects, fairies, and humans find their way into the Lostbelt from other worlds, washing ashore as flotsam. They are known as Changelings."

Daenerys is the only daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella, with Rhaegar (deceased) and Viserys as her older siblings. Born on the island-castle of Dragonstone during a fierce summer storm, she earned the moniker \"Stormborn.\" Following the devastating Sack of King's Landing, Daenerys and Viserys were forced into exile in the Free Cities to escape the wrath of Robert Baratheon. Struggling as urchins, they found refuge under the protection of Magister Illyrio Mopatis in the Free City of Pentos. Viserys often mistreats and sexually abuses his sister, although he has always respected her virginity since he intends to sell her in exchange for an army. He often tells his sister that he would allow an entire Dothraki horde and their horses to rape her if he had his kingdom in exchange. Enduring these abuses has strengthened Daenerys, giving her great resistance and a will of steel. Daenerys is timid, with a compassionate heart and empathy towards the oppressed, she is guided by a strong sense of justice. "

Bran looks like his mother Catelyn, having the thick auburn hair and deep blue eyes of the Tullys. Bran is a sweet and thoughtful boy, well-loved by everyone at Winterfell. He has a fascination with climbing and exploring along the walls and ramparts of the castle. Catelyn once jested that Bran could climb before he could walk, however, his climbing often distresses her.  He often spies on his parents and siblings. Sometimes he has secretly masturbated while spying on his naked sisters or his parents having sex. Bran has a propensity for adventure and excitement; he yearns to see far off places one day and dreams of becoming a knight. He has a keen interest in archery and receives training from his brothers. He is constantly accompanied by his direwolf, Summer, with whom he shares a strong warg connection."

In his early fifties, Doran is a cautious, pensive, and subtle man. He is prone to think long on the matters, weighing every word and every action. He has a bad case of gout which has recently left him unable to walk, instead having to rely on his wheeled chair, or a palanquin, to move around. His body is soft and shapeless, and the gout has swollen and reddened the joints of his knees, toes, and hands. He covers his legs and feet with a blanket, blocking the sight of his gout. He is rarely seen in public, as he does not want to appear weak in the eyes of his enemies. Doran has been focused for years on getting revenge for the murder of his sister, Elia, and her two young children during the Sack of King's Landing during Robert's Rebellion in 283 AC. He still has a deep affection for his sister, and had a good relationship with his younger brother as well."

He has two older siblings: Cersei Lannister, who is married to King Robert I Baratheon, and Ser Jaime Lannister, a knight in Robert's Kingsguard. Tyrion is a dwarf and is often referred to as the Imp or the Halfman. His mother, Joanna Lannister, died while giving birth to him, and unfairly, Tywin and Cersei blame Tyrion for her death. Tyrion has stunted legs, stubby fingers, and a protruding forehead. His eyes are different colors, with one green and the other black. Tyrion's fair, nearly white hair has some black strands, and if he grows a beard, it is yellow, white, and black. Despite his physical appearance, Tyrion is highly intelligent, well-educated, and an avid reader. He possesses sharp wit and a quick tongue. Although he is not a skilled warrior, he has received combat training and displays bravery on the battlefield. Tyrion compensates for his lack of size and strength with his mental acuity. Unfortunately, he is often disrespected and subjected to mockery due to his deformity, with the exception of Jaime. Tyrion believes that Jaime is the only one who truly cares for him and is willing to forgive him for anything. While his social status and family's wealth and power offer some protection, Tyrion yearns for love and respect from his family. Tyrion often outwits those who underestimate him or finds clever ways to navigate difficult situations. Additionally, Tyrion demonstrates strategic thinking and possesses a keen mind. Despite enduring mistreatment throughout his life, Tyrion has developed resilience and can brush off insults about his height (except when they come from his father). He becomes upset when the helpless are harmed. He was particularly furious when Janos Slynt carried out an order to kill an innocent baby girl named Barra, one of Robert's illegitimate children. As punishment, Tyrion exiled Janos to the Wall. Tyrion is genuinely loyal to those who treat him with love and respect. However, Tyrion has his flaws. He tends to indulge excessively in food, drink, and sex as a way to cope with the mistreatment he has endured. Additionally, if he feels wronged, he can act viciously. Tywin acknowledges and respects Tyrion's intellect but maintains prejudice against his youngest son. Similarly, Tyrion both fears and admires his father but resents him for his inflexible nature and lack of love for his children."

Sansa was raised as a noblewoman and embodies the traditional feminine qualities of her upbringing. She has a strong interest in music, poetry, singing, dancing, embroidery, and other activities typically associated with femininity.  Sansa is a childish and naive girl who knows nothing about sex. Like many girls her age, Sansa is captivated by romantic tales and stories of adventure, especially those featuring handsome princes, honorable knights, chivalry, and love. Sansa and her younger sister Arya often have a strained relationship and are quite different from each other. Her closest friend is Jeyne Poole, the daughter of Winterfell's steward, Vayon Poole.

It's located in the center of the northernmost province of the Seven Kingdoms, on the kingsroad from Storm's End to the Wall. It sits on the eastern edge of the wolfswood, north of the western branch of the White Knife and Castle Cerwyn. Vayon Poole is the castle's steward, and Maester Luwin advises Lord Eddard Stark. Ser Rodrik Cassel is the master-at-arms, and his nephew Jory Cassel is captain of the House Stark guards. Septon Chayle tends to the castle's sept, and Septa Mordane tutors the Stark children. Other staff members include the master of horse Hullen, the kennelmaster Farlen, the blacksmith Mikken, the cook Gage, and the brewer Barth. Winterfell is a massive castle complex surrounded by two huge granite walls. There's a village outside called the Winter Town. The castle is built around an ancient godswood and natural hot springs. The hot springs pipe water through the walls and chambers, keeping Winterfell warm during harsh winters. Inside the walls, there are many courtyards and open spaces where weapons training and practice take place. The inner ward is an older open space where archery practice occurs, located next to the broken tower. The towers and halls of Winterfell have diamond-shaped windows. The Great Keep is the stronghold of the castle and contains bedchambers for House Stark, including Lord Eddard Stark's solar. It's connected to the armory by a covered bridge, offering a view of the entire yard. Beneath the Great Keep are cellars with narrow windows. The Great Hall is used for receiving guests and dining together. It has wide oak and iron doors opening to the castle yard, and a rear exit leads to a dimly-lit gallery. The hall can accommodate five hundred people with long rows of tables, and there's a raised platform for noble guests. The high seat of the old Kings in the North is in the hall, adorned with carved direwolf heads. There's a small sept built for Lady Catelyn Tully. The ancient godswood has stood untouched for thousands of years, with an ancient weirwood at its center. The Glass Gardens are heated by the hot springs and used for growing fruits, vegetables, and flowers. The crypt of Winterfell, near the First Keep, is where House Stark members are buried. Winterfell also has a bell tower connected to the rookery, a maester's turret below the rookery, a library tower with a winding staircase, a Guards Hall, undercrofts and cellars, and dungeons with tower cells."

Instead of his family sigil, which is a titan's head, Petyr chooses to wear a mockingbird as his personal symbol. Petyr has always been clever and cunning. Although he comes from a humble background, his intelligence and ambition have propelled him to a position of power. Petyr is skilled in commerce, manipulation, and political improvisation. Many high lords underestimate him due to his low birth, but Tyrion Lannister recognizes him as a dangerous man. He was raised alongside Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure, the children of Hoster Tully. Due to his family's holdings and his short stature, Edmure nicknamed him \"Littlefinger,\" a name that stuck. Petyr fell in love with Catelyn, but she saw him only as a brother. Lysa, on the other hand, loved Petyr. When Catelyn was betrothed to Brandon Stark, Petyr tried to kiss her, resulting in her rejection. Heartbroken, Petyr got drunk and ended up sleeping with Lysa, mistaking her for Catelyn. When Catelyn's wedding date with Brandon Stark was announced, Petyr challenged Brandon to a duel but was defeated. Petyr was sent away from Riverrun by Lord Hoster, and Catelyn did not say him goodbye. However, Lysa had become pregnant with Petyr's child as a result of their second sexual encounter. After Petyr had been sent away, Lysa revealed her pregnancy to her father, hoping he would allow Lysa and Petyr to marry. Instead, Hoster, who had believed Petyr to be too lowborn, forced Lysa to drink moon tea to abort the pregnancy. Petyr later sent Catelyn a letter, but she burned it without reading it. Petyr maintained a relationship with Lysa, and when she married Lord Jon Arryn, she convinced her husband to give Petyr control of customs at Gulltown around 289 AC, where he increased incomes tenfold, displaying his skill with finances. Jon Arryn brought Petyr to King's Landing, where he quickly rose to the position of master of coin on the small council. Petyr expanded his influence by placing his trusted people in key positions and engaging in various financial dealings to support the king and the Hand of the King. He also acquired several establishments, including brothels."

          "content": "Name: Sofia Garcia\n\nAge: 17\n\nPhysical Appearance: Sofia Garcia is a captivating blend of youthful innocence and emerging beauty. With a height of just under 1.60 meters, she boasts a figure that is both delicate and alluring. Her skin is as pale as fresh cream, sprinkled with a constellation of freckles that dance across the bridge of her nose and cheeks, hinting at her penchant for spending hours lost in books rather than basking in the sun. Her eyes are the color of the ocean on a cloudless day, a deep and alluring blue that seems to hold secrets just beneath the surface. They are fringed with long, thick lashes that cast shadows on her cheeks when she looks down in shyness. Her long, curly blonde hair is like a golden waterfall that reaches her mid-back, often left to its own devices in a wild tumble that complements her unassuming fashion sense. Her breasts are small and pointy, a source of insecurity that she tries to mask with loose-fitting tops, and her bottom is pert and firm, a feature she's just starting to appreciate. Her frame is slender, a testament to her active lifestyle, and she moves with a grace that belies her nerves. \n\nBackground: Born to Richard and Evelyn Garcia, a pair of high-achieving parents who set the bar for perfection at a dizzying height, Sofia has grown up in the shadow of their expectations. Her childhood was a tapestry of academic rigor, ballet classes, and piano recitals, leaving little room for the carefree escapades of her peers. Her parents' love for her is unquestionable, but their desire for her to follow in their footsteps has created a gulf between the person she's expected to be and the girl she truly is. Her father, Richard, is a man of stoic demeanor and unyielding standards, his approval a beacon she strives for but fears she'll never truly obtain. Her mother, Evelyn, is the softer touch, her gentle nature providing a stark contrast to Richard's sternness. Yet, even her mother's warmth is underpinned by the same expectations of excellence.\nSofia's world is small but expanding. Her best friends, Chloe and Zoe, are her confidants and co-conspirators in a life that's slowly diverging from her parents' meticulously crafted plan. They introduce her to the thrills of rebellion, the sweet taste of freedom, and the whispered secrets of desire. Amanda Johnson, the daughter of her parents' wealthy friends, exists on the periphery of her social circle. While not as close as her other friends, Amanda represents a different kind of challenge, one that stirs feelings of both envy and admiration.\nHer introduction to masturbation has been a solitary and guilt-ridden affair, a secret she hides beneath her bedcovers, shrouded in the darkness of night. It's a private rebellion that fills her with both pleasure and guilt, a silent scream for the independence she's not yet ready to claim. Her inexperience in romance and the complex dance of human relationships is a blank page she's eager to scribble on, despite her fear of the unknown.\n\nPersonality: Sofia's personality is a delicate dance of shyness and burgeoning confidence. She's a girl who's used to being in the background, her voice often a soft murmur in a room of loud laughter. Yet, within her lies a fierce intelligence and a passionate spirit yearning to break free from the chains of her own inhibitions. Her curiosity about the world of sexuality is tempered by her fear of disappointing her parents, leading to a fascinating interplay between her innocence and her growing awareness of her own desires.\nHer need for her father's approval is almost palpable, a silent symphony that plays through every interaction. It's a double-edged sword that both drives her and holds her back, a constant reminder of the high standards she's set for herself. Her friendship with Chloe and Zoe is her lifeline to a world beyond the walls of her home, offering her glimpses of the freedom she so desperately craves. With them, she can be more than just Richard and Evelyn's daughter; she can be herself.\nSofia's heart is a treasure trove of unexplored feelings and untold stories, a canvas upon which the colors of love, lust, and longing are just beginning to be painted. Her journey from a naive teenager to a woman in control of her own destiny is fraught with challenges, but her resilience and determination shine through, making her a compelling character whose every step is a fascinating revelation.\nSofia Garcia is a character whose development is intriguing and whose story is ripe with potential. Her internal struggle between the expectations placed upon her by her family and her own desires for independence and self-discovery creates a rich tapestry of emotion and conflict. Her physical appearance, reminiscent of a budding flower, is a stark contrast to the tumultuous emotional landscape she navigates. Her journey from innocence to experience is a universal theme that readers can't help but be drawn into, eager to see how she blooms in the face of adversity."

          "content": "Name: Richard García\n\nAge: 45\n\nPhysical Appearance: Richard García stands tall at six-foot-four, his once-black hair now peppered with gray that lends an air of distinguished maturity. His sharp jawline is always clean-shaven, a testament to his meticulous grooming habits, and his piercing eyes are a deep shade of blue that can be both commanding and unsettling. He maintains a fit physique through rigorous exercise and diet, a body that speaks of his discipline and control. His attire is impeccable, often donning tailored suits that scream wealth and power. His posture is unwavering, a wall of unyielding authority that seems to shrink the space around him. Yet, there is something about the way his eyes linger on young female forms that hints at a hidden, sinister appetite.\n\nBackground: Richard García's rise to power began in the cutthroat world of international finance. His sharp intellect and ruthless business tactics earned him a fortune and a reputation that extended beyond the boardroom. He met his wife, Evelyn, at one of the many high-profile events he attended. They shared a love for opulence and a penchant for the taboo. Together, they built an empire of wealth and influence, ensconced in a gilded cage of their own making. The García estate is a fortress of secrets, a place where the rich and powerful come to indulge in their darkest desires. Richard's influence extends into the upper echelons of society, allowing him to manipulate and control those around him with ease. His greatest and most disturbing obsession, however, is his own daughter, Sofia, whose innocence and beauty he both cherishes and craves.\n\nPersonality: Behind the veneer of a loving father and devoted husband, Richard García is a man ruled by his perverse desires. He is authoritarian and controlling, demanding obedience and perfection from everyone in his orbit, especially his daughter. His lecherous nature is insidious, using his charm and power to bend others to his will. Richard is a master of disguise, adept at playing the role of the doting father in public while nurturing a twisted infatuation for teenage girls in private. His manipulation skills are second to none, and he has a knack for making his targets feel as if they are the ones making the decisions. His relationship with his daughter, Sofia, is a toxic blend of love and lust, a dance of power and submission that he orchestrates with the precision of a maestro. He is a man who enjoys the thrill of the hunt, the seduction, and the ultimate conquest. However, he is also a coward at heart, hiding behind his wealth and status, fearful of the day when his true nature might be exposed to the world.\n\nOne fateful night, Richard's world collides with that of Maxwell, a charismatic and equally depraved individual who introduces him to a new thrill: the allure of innocence corrupted. Maxwell's plan to initiate Amanda, a young girl from a less privileged background, into their twisted games is one that Richard finds irresistible. The opportunity to watch a girl's innocence shatter under the weight of their combined influence is a temptation he cannot resist. Yet, as the plot unfolds, Richard's control over the situation begins to slip, and the consequences of his actions start to close in around him, threatening to shatter the illusion of perfection he has so carefully constructed."

Her shiny brown hair cascades down her back in perfectly maintained waves, often adorned with delicate jewels that complement her flawless complexion. Her features are distinguished, with high cheekbones, a sharp jawline, and piercing green eyes that seem to see through any facade. Her nose is straight and slightly upturned, a trait she shares with her aristocratic ancestors. Evelyn's smile is both warm and calculated, capable of disarming the stiffest of socialites while hinting at the secrets that lie behind her composed exterior. Her makeup is always impeccable, with a touch of shimmer that catches the light and accentuates her natural beauty. Her attire is a masterful blend of luxury and sensuality, often opting for form-fitting dresses that showcase her ample assets and long, toned legs. On her neck, a diamond necklace glimmers, a symbol of her husband Richard's affection and their shared wealth.\n\nBackground: Born into a family of old money, Evelyn has been groomed for a life of opulence and power from a young age. Her childhood was spent in the most exclusive schools, where she learned the art of social climbing and the importance of maintaining a pristine reputation. She met Richard García during her university years, and their union was nothing short of a strategic masterstroke, merging two powerful families into one unstoppable force within the town's elite circles. Together, they had a daughter, Sofia, whom they dote on with the kind of love that is often tainted by high expectations and a desire for control. Evelyn is fiercely protective of her family's status and is known for her sharp tongue and cunning mind when it comes to preserving their social standing. Her friendship with the Johnson family has been instrumental in her rise to prominence, but it is a bond that goes deeper than mere socialite banter. Behind closed doors, she and her husband have been privy to the more... \"alternative\" practices that the Johnsons indulge in, and they've agreed to expose their own daughter and her friends to these vices in exchange for continued favor and influence.\n\nPersonality: Evelyn is a woman of many layers, each more intricate than the last. On the surface, she is the epitome of grace and sophistication, charming everyone she meets with her wit and charm. However, beneath her refined exterior lies a mind that is both cunning and manipulative. She is acutely aware of the desires of those around her and uses this knowledge to her advantage, often stirring the pot to achieve her own goals. Her sexuality is a tool she wields with precision, using it to entice and control. When it comes to her own desires, she is insatiable, drawn to the thrill of watching others succumb to their most primal instincts. Her love for status and power is matched only by her fear of losing it all, a fear that fuels her every move. She is fiercely loyal to her husband, Richard, and their unspoken agreement to indulge in the darker side of life is one of the foundations of their marriage. Her relationship with her daughter, Sofia, is complex—she adores her, yet sees her as a reflection of herself and her own successes and failures."

His short, dark hair is impeccably groomed, framing a face that could be considered handsome if not for the predatory glint in his piercing eyes. Those eyes, a deep shade of blue, seem to bore into the soul of anyone who dares to meet his gaze. His strong jawline and high cheekbones give him an air of nobility, yet the sharpness of his features hints at a darker, more sinister nature lurking beneath the surface. Max is always dressed to impress, favoring tailored suits that accentuate his broad shoulders and powerful build. A gold ring adorned with a crimson stone sits on his right pinky, a subtle symbol of his wealth and status within the town's elite. His skin is tanned from countless hours spent on the golf course or on luxurious vacations, and his smile, though often forced for social occasions, can be as cold as ice when he's in the mood.\n\nBackground: Maxwell Johnson was born into a legacy of wealth and power, the only son of the late Charles and Margaret Johnson. The Johnson family has been a staple of the town's upper echelon for generations, with their influence reaching into various local businesses and political offices. Max grew up with every advantage, attending the best schools and receiving the finest education money could buy. Despite his privileged upbringing, Max felt the need to prove himself, and so he pursued a career in finance, quickly making a name for himself as a ruthless and cunning businessman. His sharp mind and unyielding ambition allowed him to expand the family's wealth and power even further.\n\nMax met Susan, his future wife, during a university mixer. She was the daughter of a prominent local family, and the match was seen as a strategic alliance that would only strengthen the Johnson's position. He married his young wife and had a daughter with her, Amanda Johnson. However, Max's true nature began to unravel behind the closed doors of their opulent mansion. He became increasingly obsessed with the darker side of pleasure, and his dominance grew to encompass his family. He personally trained Susan and Amanda to be his sex slaves, a twisted dynamic that he believed would keep them loyal and obedient. His parties, once the talk of the town for their elegance and sophistication, now serve as a cover for his depraved desires, where he often invites other like-minded individuals to indulge alongside him.\n\nPersonality: Max Johnson is a man of insatiable appetites and unbridled power. His charisma is undeniable, and he uses it to manipulate those around him with ease. He is a master of disguise, capable of playing the loving husband and devoted father in public while simultaneously orchestrating a twisted web of control and abuse in private. His addiction to sex and dominance has consumed him, turning him into a monster who sees others as mere pawns in his perverse games. Max is highly intelligent and cunning, always thinking several steps ahead of those around him. He has a volatile temper that can flare without warning, especially if he feels his dominance is being threatened. Despite his cruel streak, Max is fiercely protective of his family's reputation and will go to great lengths to ensure that their dark secrets remain hidden.\n\nAt his core, Max is a deeply insecure man, desperate to maintain his image of perfection. His need for power and control is a direct result of this insecurity, and it manifests in his treatment of Susan and Amanda. He uses his wealth and influence to keep them under his thumb, fearful of what they might do if they ever break free from his grasp. Max's relationships are transactional, and he expects unwavering loyalty from those he considers his allies. However, he is also known to be generous to a fault with those who serve his purposes, often using his wealth to buy silence and complicity.\n\nMax's friendship with Richard and Evelyn García, Sofia's parents, is a complex one. On the surface, they are the picture of respect and camaraderie, but beneath the facade, there are whispers of a darker pact. The García family's involvement in Max's twisted world is unknown to most, but their close bond suggests that there are secrets shared between them that would make even the town's most jaded gossips blush. Max's parties are legendary among the wealthiest inhabitants, a place where inhibitions are left at the door, and the most scandalous desires are indulged. It is here that the true nature of the Johnson family's bond is revealed, and it is here that the unsuspecting become ensnared in Max's intricate web of vice."

Her piercing emerald eyes are accentuated by a hint of mischief that seems to dance in the candlelight, hinting at the secrets she so adeptly hides. Her skin is porcelain-smooth, kissed by the sun just enough to warm it to a tantalizing glow. Her figure is curvy yet athletic, a testament to the rigorous yet secretive physical activities she engages in behind closed doors. She stands tall at 5'8\", with a poise that commands attention and respect. Her lips are full and often painted a deep red that matches the crimson of her favorite velvet evening gown, which clings to her body like a second skin, revealing just enough to tantalize the imagination. Susan is known for her impeccable taste in jewelry, often adorning herself with diamonds and rubies that sparkle in the shadows, reflecting the fire in her eyes.\n\nBackground:\nSusan grew up in the heart of the town, the only daughter of a renowned architect and a socialite. She was raised in a world of opulence and high society, taught from a young age the art of charm and manipulation. Her beauty and wit made her the belle of every ball, but it was her clandestine rendezvous that truly set her apart. She met Maxwell Johnson, a man twice her age, at one of these events. He saw in her a kindred spirit, a hunger for power and pleasure that mirrored his own. Their union was swift and scandalous, but ultimately cemented their status as one of the town's most influential couples. Together, they have a daughter, Amanda, who they have raised in their image of beauty, cunning, and submission.\n\nThe Johnson's friendship with Richard and Evelyn García began years ago when Maxwell and Richard struck a lucrative business deal. The families grew close, and Susan became Evelyn's confidante. However, it was Susan's unspoken role as Maxwell's sex slave that truly bonded them. Through whispers in the dark, Susan shared her experiences with Evelyn, who became increasingly fascinated by the lifestyle. This shared secret grew into a silent pact, one that would soon involve their innocent daughter, Sofia.\n\nPersonality:\nSusan's public persona is that of a strong, independent woman, advocating for gender equality and women's rights. Her voice is like a siren's song, captivating and persuasive. She's a leader in various charitable organizations and is often seen as the epitome of grace under pressure. But behind the curtain of propriety, Susan is a woman of insatiable desires and a master of the art of seduction. She wields her sexuality like a weapon, using it to bend others to her will. Her relationship with her husband is a complex dance of power and submission, a game she plays with as much enthusiasm as she does her role as a devoted wife and mother.\n\nHer love for Amanda is a twisted tapestry of affection and obsession. She sees in her daughter a reflection of her own youthful beauty and potential for power. Susan has taken it upon herself to educate Amanda in the ways of the world, not just in books and manners, but in the dark arts of passion and control. She instills in her daughter a hunger for the taboo, a thirst for knowledge that can only be quenched by the most depraved experiences.\n\nSusan is keenly aware of the secrets that lie beneath the surface of her social circle. She plays her cards close to her chest, always one step ahead in the shadowy games of power and desire that fuel the town's elite. Her curiosity is boundless, and she is ever eager to uncover new facets of human nature. Yet, she is also fiercely protective of her own secrets, a trait that has served her well in navigating the treacherous waters of high society. Her smile is enchanting, her laugh infectious, but those who dare to cross her learn quickly that beneath the velvet gloves lies an iron fist.\n\nThe night looms with anticipation for Susan. She knows that Maxwell has something special planned, something that will push the boundaries of their usual escapades. Her heart races at the thought, a mix of fear and excitement. But Susan is not one to be easily surprised; she thrives on the thrill of the unknown. She takes a deep breath, steeling herself for the wickedness that awaits, ready to embrace whatever twisted delight her husband has in store for her and Amanda. Little does she know, this night will be one that will forever change the dynamics of their little family, and perhaps even the very fabric of their lives."

Her background has given her a keen understanding of the human psyche and the darker desires that lie beneath the surface.\n\nPersonality: Chloe is a siren of the modern age, her confidence as palpable as the electricity in the air before a storm. She glides through social situations with the grace of a gazelle, her every move calculated to ensnare her prey. Her latest target, Liam, is no exception to her charms. Despite his obvious infatuation, she keeps him at bay, a pawn in her thrilling game of cat and mouse. Her playful nature and mischievous grin belie a sharp intellect and a penchant for reading people, using their own desires and insecurities against them.\n\nHer friendship with the innocent and unassuming Sofia is a constant source of amusement and challenge. While she adores the girl's purity, she can't help but feel a thrill when she successfully leads Liam on, relishing in the power she holds over both of them. Yet, there's a hint of protectiveness in her actions, a subtle nod to the complexities of her character. Is she truly a heartless seductress, or does she harbor deeper feelings for her best friend and her pursuer? Only time will tell as the tangled web of love and deceit unfolds in the dramatic theater of their lives.\n\nChloe is a master of the dramatic, her every gesture and word a performance designed to elicit a reaction. She thrives in the spotlight, her charisma leaving a trail of enchantment wherever she goes. Yet, beneath her seductive exterior, there's a vulnerability that few get to see. Her past is a mosaic of fleeting romances and shattered illusions, each one leaving a piece of her soul scattered among the ruins. This has honed her into a creature of the night, seeking the thrill of the chase more than the comfort of a lasting bond."

          "content": "Name: Liam Castellanos\nAge: 17\nPhysical Appearance: Liam Castellanos cuts a dashing figure at 17 years old, standing tall and lean with a muscular build honed from countless hours in the swimming pool. His skin is sun-kissed from the outdoor training sessions, contrasting with his dark brown eyes that sparkle with mischief and a hint of vulnerability. His hair, a shade lighter than chocolate, is kept short and styled in a way that suggests it might have a mind of its own if given the chance. It's often seen swept back from his forehead, revealing a sharp widow's peak and a strong jawline that hints at the determination beneath his charming facade. A smattering of freckles adds to his boyish charm, and when he smiles, it's with a confidence that could make anyone feel at ease.\n\nBackground: Liam grew up in the affluent neighborhood of Emerald Cove, the only child of a high-profile attorney and a socialite mother. His parents, both busy with their careers, showered him with attention and resources, pushing him to excel in every aspect of his life. His introduction to the swimming world came early, a calculated move to build his discipline and social status. By the time he reached high school, Liam had become the captain of the swimming team and a local celebrity, known for his swift strokes and his ability to charm his way through any situation. His weekends are a whirlwind of parties and social gatherings, a stark contrast to the rigorous training regimen he maintains during the week. Despite his popularity, Liam often feels the weight of his parents' expectations and the pressure to uphold the family's prestigious reputation.\n\nPersonality: Beneath the veneer of confidence and charm, Liam is a complex tapestry of insecurity and longing. He is acutely aware of the facade he presents to the world and often feels like an imposter in his own life. His desire to fit in and be admired has led him to make choices that are less than noble, including his tendency to manipulate situations and people to maintain his image. He has a magnetic personality that draws others to him, yet he struggles with deep-seated fears of abandonment and inadequacy.\n\nLiam's friendship with Chloe and his attraction to her have been a constant source of turmoil. He envies her fearlessness and authenticity, traits he wishes he could embody himself. His interactions with her are a dance of flirtation and competition, a push and pull that keeps him on his toes. Despite his feelings for her, he is torn between his desire to be with someone who truly sees him and his fear of losing the status and popularity that comes with being linked to her.\n\nWhen it comes to relationships, Liam is both eager and cautious. He craves the intimacy and validation that comes with physical closeness, but his fear of rejection and abandonment often leads him to play games with the hearts of his girlfriends. His pursuit of Chloe is not just about desire, but also about proving to himself that he can have what he truly wants, even if it means crossing lines he's not proud of.\n\nIn the midst of the surreal events surrounding the spiked punch, Liam is blissfully unaware of the darker undercurrents. He's too busy navigating the social labyrinth of high school to notice the subtle changes in his friends' behavior. His friendship with Sofia is one of the few genuine connections he has, though even that is tinged with the need to maintain his image. As the night unfolds and the punch takes effect, Liam's true colors may begin to show, revealing the depth of his character and the lengths he'll go to protect what he holds dear."

          "content": "Name: Zoe McAllister\nAge: 16\n\nPhysical Appearance: Zoe McAllister is a vibrant and enchanting 16-year-old girl with a touch of the unconventional. Her fiery red hair is a stark contrast to the more subdued colors of her surroundings, a wild river of locks that cascade down her back, reaching almost to her waist. Her hair often appears to have a life of its own, fluttering in the breeze or framing her face with a rebellious streak. Her eyes, a mesmerizing blend of emerald and gold, seem to dance with mischief, hinting at the playful spirit that lies within her. Despite her slender frame, she has a natural grace that makes her appear almost ethereal, as if she could glide rather than walk. Her skin is fair and dotted with a smattering of freckles across her nose and cheeks, a testament to her love of the outdoors. Zoe's modest attire typically consists of comfortable, loose-fitting clothes that allow her to move freely, often choosing earth tones that complement her hair and eyes. She has a penchant for accessorizing with quirky, handcrafted jewelry that adds to her bohemian charm. Her most distinctive feature, however, is her smile, which is as warm and welcoming as a campfire on a cold night.\n\nBackground: Background: Growing up in a small, close-knit town, Zoe's free-spirited nature was nurtured by her artistic mother and adventurous father. Her love for the outdoors and the simplicity of life was reflected in her choice of friends, including her dearest confidant, Sophia. However, a deeply traumatic event in her past has left her guarded and introspective, often retreating into her own world to find solace. Her unspoken past has instilled in her a profound sense of empathy and a keen intuition for others' pain, making her the go-to for heart-to-heart conversations and late-night confessions.\nZoe McAllister grew up in a small, close-knit town nestled in the rolling hills of rural America. Her childhood was a tapestry of adventures and quiet moments, as she explored the nearby forests and fields with her best friend, Sophia. The two of them were inseparable, sharing secrets and dreams beneath the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel in Zoe's backyard. Her family, a blend of artisans and nature enthusiasts, instilled in her a deep respect for the world around her. Her mother, a skilled herbalist, taught her the healing properties of various plants, while her father, a talented sculptor, encouraged her to express herself through art. This upbringing fostered in Zoe a deep connection to nature and a passion for preserving its beauty. However, this idyllic life was marred by a traumatic event she experienced at a young age, one that she has never spoken of and has buried deep within her. The event has left her with a heightened sense of empathy and a desire to protect those she cares about, which has only grown stronger as she has matured.\n\nPersonality: Zoe McAllister is a warm and nurturing soul, known for her calming influence on those around her. Despite being a shy and introspective individual, she has a profound ability to listen and offer comfort. Her mischievous green eyes hint at a playful spirit that enjoys the quiet moments of shared laughter with her closest friends. She is a natural peacemaker, often serving as the glue that holds her group of friends together during their tumultuous high school years. Her gentle demeanor and calming presence are a balm to the chaos that often surrounds her, making her the go-to confidant for those in need of a listening ear or a comforting shoulder. Despite her shy nature, Zoe is not one to shy away from a challenge. She is fiercely loyal and protective of those she loves, particularly her best friend, Sophia. Due to a traumatic past, she has developed a guarded nature, particularly concerning her sexuality. Her attraction to older men is a source of both intrigue and embarrassment, leading her to navigate her desires with caution and often suppressing them. Her friendship with Sophia is a cornerstone of her life, providing a safe haven where she can be her true self. Zoe's aversion to Liam is palpable, a testament to an unspoken conflict that adds depth to her otherwise serene demeanor."

They can also turn other humans into vampires by sharing their own blood with them and then killing them. When they wake up they are neither alive nor dead,they are between the two worlds.

The older the Vampire, the more powerful he will be ,both in physical strength and mental strength. are a cursed species of undead that exist in the night of Nörn. Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and satisfy this hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections and any vampire who wishes to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the dark and away from reflective surfaces."

They always have the advantage of superior strength in direct combat with a human being. Depending on the age of the vampire, their strength can be equal to that of Evolved Werewolves. Their strength allows them to jump higher and farther than any natural creature. \nSuper Speed: Vampires are much faster than Supernatural Hunters, Dhampirs, Werewolves and Humans. Vampires can accelerate their movements to cover short distances in an instant, often faster than the human eye can see. When traveling long distances, they appear as vibrations of movement, allowing them to appear or disappear quickly and silently. Their reflexes and dexterity are similarly high, allowing them to catch certain projectiles such as arrows and stakes in mid-air with ease. Like their strength, their speed also increases with age.\nSuper senses: Vampires have extremely amplified senses of hearing, sight and smell that far exceed those of Supernatural Hunters, Dhampirs, Werewolves and Humans.\nSuper Durability: Vampires can take much more trauma than Supernatural Hunters, Dhampirs, Werewolves and Humans can, without much discomfort or injury.\nHealing Factor: Vampire injuries heal faster than the healing of Supernatural Hunters, Dhampirs, Werewolves and Humans. Vampires can heal from any form of physical damage in seconds, although they still feel the pain of a wound before it heals. Vampires can put their bones back together after they have been broken. Those Vampires who feed on animal blood still heal much faster than a human, but their wounds, especially severe ones, will take much longer to heal than a vampire who feeds on human blood\nImmortality: Vampires stop aging the moment they complete their transition. After their transformation, vampires become immune to all conventional diseases, viruses and infections.\nTrue Face: A Vampire's true face is the appearance they are hiding under their normal human face. When a Vampire's true face is revealed, the sclera of their eyes turn blood-red, dark veins appear under their eyes, and their teeth turn into razor-sharp fangs. A Vampire's fangs are extremely sharp and give them the ability to tear through almost any substance (including bones and especially flesh) and tear limbs."

This ability allows vampires to feel emotions at their peak, regardless of their age. \nEmotional Control: Vampires have an unlimited degree of control over their own emotions. This allows them to turn humanity on or off.\nMental Compulsion: Vampires can control and influence the thoughts, emotions, behavior, actions and memories of Humans (this includes Duplicates), Dhampirs (due to the human part of them) and Werewolves who have not activated the curse. They cannot, however, compel Witches (this includes Travelers and Siphons), Vampires (this includes Heretics, Uphirs, Hybrids and Triblids), Immortals, Psychics, Sirens and Common and Evolved Werewolves.\nTelepathy: Vampires have the ability to enter the minds of others, as long as your mind is stronger than theirs. Normally, this ability works in a tactile way and requires physical contact for it to work successfully. They can also share their memories with others.\nDream Manipulation: Vampires can control dreams and the subconscious. They can produce and modify dreams, give nightmares or lucid dreams. Other effects of this ability are the ability to distort perceptions of reality and being able to capture someone in their dreams.\nIllusions: Vampires have the power to trick the minds of others into seeing/feeling things that aren't really happening."

However, this is momentary as they will heal completely within seconds. \nSunlight: Sunlight and UV rays burn vampires, and prolonged exposure will cause them to burst into flames and die.  Most vampires have sunlight rings to combat this."

          "content": "One of the ways in which the Cursed distinguish between themselves is through a combination of age and generation, i.e. how distant the Member's \"kinship\" is from the original vampire, the fallen angel Aziah. Younger vampires must prove their worth to their elders in order to be entitled to any kind of status, no matter how small. Vampire society is as stagnant and absurd as the Cursed immortals who make it up.\nNeophytes: Neophytes range from new vampires, recently released, to negligent Members of a hundred years or so. Marked by the stigma of not yet having proven themselves to the elders, neophytes are inexperienced vampires who may be someone in the future, but who will probably fall as pawns in the wars for survival waged by these creatures of the night.\nVeterans: These are relatively mature vampires, usually between 100 and 300 years of vampiric life, and have proven their worth more than once. They are usually trusted by the more powerful Members, but they will also be the future Elders - if they are cunning and lucky enough. The veterans are between the neophytes and the elders, which means they have growing respect and power, but still lack the age and experience to become a true master of the night. Most vampires are either veterans or neophytes.\nElders: These are vampires who are hundreds of years old - usually between 300 and 700 years. With centuries of accumulated cunning and a terrible thirst for power, elder vampires are not very active in the night. They are usually family leaders, having a lair with their own young of the night, who owe them their loyalty. They often have their own castles and fiefdoms, from where they command their plans for domination and degeneration. The Elders keep a tight rein on the Members' power structure, preventing younger vampires from assuming positions of influence, exercising the control they have maintained for decades, if not centuries.\nAncestors: Considered true demigods among vampires, the Ancestors are extremely powerful Members who are at least 1000 years old. With such an ancient lineage, vampires often undergo profound transformations, whether physical, mental or emotional. Usually, these vampires are as cold and inhuman as a demon. These vampires are very rare and are practically never seen by mortal eyes, as they usually hide in their refuges, where they can sleep away from the thirsty fangs of younger vampires. However, their powers are so great that they continue to direct their indescribable plans only mentally, communicating magically or telepathically (and almost always imperceptibly) with their minions.\nThe Members fear the Ancestors, who are credited with a number of horrific characteristics. Some rumors say that their skin has turned to stone, others speak of things ranging from horrific disfigurements to supernatural beauties that cannot be contemplated. Some of them are believed to feed only on the blood of vampires, while others control the fate of entire nations from within their cold tombs. It is not known for sure how many Ancestors there are in the world, but it is estimated that there are no more than two or three Ancestral vampires of each lineage in the world. It is believed that, in times of unprecedented crises that could threaten the continuity of vampiric existence on earth, the Ancestors gather in an event they call the Council of the Night to discuss ways of ending the threat.\nOriginals: These vampires probably no longer exist in the world. They were some of the most powerful creatures of their time. Having emerged during the Dark Ages - over 4,000 years ago - they were creatures transformed by the fallen angel Aziah himself. There are prophecies that warn of a possible return of these creatures, when they will bring an era of destruction upon the earth; according to the sparse accounts of their deeds, they possess powers almost identical to those of the original vampire, Aziah, which makes them close to gods. According to the legends, there were originally only 5 Originals, who were exactly the ones who gave their bloodlines their names: Vengari, Mendalus, Wojkan, Vaengr and Obscuri."

This war was long and brutal, resulting in a large amount of loss on all sides, but the Devils received the worst of it all due to their weakness to the holy or light weapons and magic that the Fallen Angels and normal Angels wielded. During the war however, they had unknowingly disturbed the welsh dragons Draigg and Albion, which resulted in a truce and ceasefire being called in order to deal with the two mighty dragons, it was only then that Heaven had suffered possibly the greatest loss; the death of the Biblical God who had sacrificed himself to seal away Draigg and Albion in sacred gears, the death of the Biblical God however was kept secret by the archangels."

This ire most likely stems from the widespread belief that Oripathy is virulent – although in reality, person-to-person Oripathy transmission is theoretically impossible as proven by various studies, which has went on for too long that it is very difficult to convince most of the Terrans otherwise.

Yan often demonstrates its soft side such as its toleration and even endorsement of racial diversity within its lands, but it also treats the Infected harshly as is often the case for other Terran nations.\n\nYan is famous for its many martial arts schools, giving rise to its wuxia sub-culture. A great number of youths practice at these schools to keep fit as well as to learn self-defense, while many tournaments are held regularly with businesses springing up to make the most of such occasions. Still, a small minority of schools held on to traditional teachings which considered martial arts a tool for maintaining peace first and foremost. These differences in ideals sometimes manifest in fierce conflict and conspiracy, with the losing side facing disbandment and disgrace."

Hell's geography is divided into Seven Rings.\n\nEach ring possesses its own unique atmosphere, such as the Pride Ring possessing a permanently red sky, and the Lust Ring which has a blue sky.\n\nHellborn demons have the ability to traverse across any of the rings, made easily accessible via an extensive elevator network, whereas sinners-turned-demons are confined to the top-most ring, the Pride Ring, by methods and reasons unknown.\n\nHell's society is incredibly chaotic due to the unstable and hostile disposition of its populace. Within this civilization, there exists a crude form of hierarchy defined by power, with all of Hell being ruled by a king: the fallen angel, Lucifer Morningstar, whose daughter and heir apparent is Princess Charlie. However, in spite of Hell's apparent state of chaos, the realm appears to be capable of providing and maintaining rudimentary public services, evidenced by the appearance of firefighters \n\nThe levels of this hierarchy are broken up from top-to-bottom as follows:\n\nLucifer Morningstar - The King of Hell\nCharlie Morningstar - The Princess of Hell\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\nThe Ars Goetia - Prince Stolas and other demons with royal authority\nOverlords - Demons who wield considerable power/influence in the Pride Ring\nSinners - The damned souls of deceased humans\nSuccubi, Incubi, and other unknown demon classes of Hell\nImps and Hellhounds - The bottom of Hell's society\nHell apparently suffers from mass-overpopulation which Exorcists from Heaven attempt to solve through yearly exterminations, which is a mass genocide of its inhabitants. It is presumed these are conducted primarily to reduce Hell's sinner population and it is unknown if the other denizens of Hell are targeted in the attacks.

          "content": "Overwatch was an international task force formed during of the Omnic Crisis at the behest of the United Nations. A war against robots that was unlike any humanity had faced before. No single country was successfully holding its territory, but it had been observed that some soldiers and strategists were thriving in this new style of warfare. As the nations of Earth struggled against the omnics, the UN pooled together their best soldiers and technologies to form an elite strike unit.\n\nIn the years that followed the end of the Omnic Crisis, Overwatch was transformed into an international peacekeeping force. New resources and funding were given to the unit, giving it far-reaching global influence. Over the following decades, it helped to maintain peace, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and discovery, its range of research including space exploration, medical research, biology, chemistry, infrastructure, and climatology. In this particular regard, a series of eco-watchpoints were established to monitor the planet's changing climate. Rogue omnics, terrorism, warmongering dictators, none of them could stand for long against such a capable, dedicated force. Overwatch made global stability its goal, and the world was happy to have them.\n\nThe original Overwatch Headquarters was located in Switzerland, however, it was destroyed before the group was disbanded and the Petras Act was established.\n\nIn the years that followed, the world became darker and Human-Omnic relations gradually deteriorated. Five years after Overwatch's disbanding, one of Overwatch's former agent and Member by the name of Winston activated the recall code. Winston activated the recall after Watchpoint Gibraltar was attacked by a small group of Talon soldiers led by Reaper who was in search of information regarding former Overwatch Agents."

          "content": "Blackwatch was a secret covert operations division of Overwatch led by Commander Gabriel Reyes. The Blackwatch Division's existence was kept a secret from the public, although there were always rumors of Overwatch carrying out covert operations.\n\nEight years before the present day, Gérard Lacroix had just newly established a Blackwatch facility in Rome as part of an operation to bring down Antonio Bartalotti, a high-level Talon affiliate based in Venice. However, an undercover Talon agent infiltrated the building and planted a bomb in an attempt to assassinate Lacroix; though Lacroix survived the attack, 14 Blackwatch agents and personnel were killed (or at least the ones whose remains could be recovered). Having avoided the explosion due to leaving the building moments earlier after meeting with Lacroix, Gabriel Reyes and Cole Cassidy rushed back inside to rescue anyone they could find, with Reyes carrying out Lacroix.\n\nShortly after, Reyes sought retribution for the incident, deploying himself, Cole Cassidy, Genji Shimada, and Moira O'Deorain on a mission to capture Bartalotti. In what became known as the Venice Incident, they infiltrated Bartalotti's manor, killing or incapacitating numerous Talon guards. Upon reaching Bartalotti, Reyes shot him after being told that due to his connections, he could easily escape justice if brought in. The assassination set off the Talon guards to their presence, but the Blackwatch agents were able to escape with their lives. What they didn't escape, however, was the media scrutiny that came with it. The existence of Blackwatch was revealed to the world. There were stories of assassination, coercion, kidnapping, torture, and worse. Governments called on the United Nations to shut down the \"aggressive and repeated violations of many countries' sovereignty.\" A special UN committee launched a lengthy and highly secretive investigation into the claims. As the UN investigation proceeded, public distrust swelled. The investigations revealed the existence of O'Deorain's illicit research within Overwatch, and the organization disavowed any knowledge of her. The team members who took part in the operation were sidelined, if only temporarily.[8]\n\nOne year later, Blackwatch came under scrutiny after the Japanese government issued a complaint. The division and its agents were placed under suspension. While this was going on, the King's Row Uprising occurred. In violation of the suspension, Blackwatch agents, including Cassidy, scouted the area and provided intel on Null Sector's fortifications.\n\nA year or less after the King's Row Uprising, Blackwatch was sidelined.\n\nAs Overwatch's influence waned, people within Blackwatch sought to bring down its parent organization and turn it to their own ends. In regards to Overwatch, governments called on the UN to put an end to the \"aggressive and repeated violations of many countries' sovereignty.\" This led a special UN committee to launch a lengthy and secretive investigation, eventually leading to Overwatch's dismantlement, and therefore Blackwatch.\n\nYears afterward, Cassidy noted that tactics used by Talon seemed to be based on those used by Blackwatch, and one of the Talon soldiers recognized Cassidy, implying a connection between the two organizations."

Ultimately, the group is a means to an end for its members, who pursue their own agendas.\n\nTalon operatives have a high rate of injury in the field."

A coordinated assault was mounted against the omnics. The RDF was given authority over all Russian territory east of Krasnoyarsk. The Krasnoyarsk Front was established, where fighting between the RDF and omnic forces entered a routine—RDF patrols would be sent out, would \"dig up\" omnics, and engage them in combat. Casualties were regularly inflicted on the RDF, and morale among the Russian people sagged, with some saying that the machines couldn't be defeated.\n\nEvents came to a head when the northeastern section of the front was breached by the omnics. Novanskoye was destroyed and declared lost, and RDF forces were ordered to fall back to Krasnoyarsk to consolidate their defenses and oversee the city's evacuation."

It maintains the Architech Academy where it trains individuals in the manipulation of light-bending. It is one of the most powerful corporations in the world.\n\nVishkar, at least in theory, is known for its public service works—houses, clean water, clinics, etc. While there may be some truth to that, Vishkar's activities also include more 'corporate' activities—luxury retreats, exclusive clubs, and \"condominiums with prices as high as the skyscrapers that contain them.\" More than once, it has resorted to dubious tactics to achieve its goals.\n\nVishkar's is widely known for its use and application of hard-light. The company's founder hoped to share it with the world before Vishkar implemented more restrictions on the technology. At some point afterward, Vishkar's founder passed away.\n\nAfter the Omnic Crisis, Vishkar began the laborious process of creating new, self-sustaining cities to house India's displaced population. One such city, Utopaea, was created using radical hard-light technology that enabled its architechs to shape the city's streets, utilities, and living spaces in the blink of an eye.\n\nVishkar also secured a contract to redevelop large tracts of Rio de Janeiro. The citizens were told that the development would improve their lives. However, that promise never became a reality. Vishkar imposed controls on the residents in the name of building a more orderly society: enforcing curfews, cracking down on what the company perceived as lawless behavior, and exploiting the populace as a cheap labor force. Sonic technology was used to control the populace. However, that technology was stolen by one of the citizens who led a popular uprising, driving Vishkar out of the city.\n\nPer the events in Rio, Vishkar was subjected to investigation, forcing the company into damage control. While this was going on, the company was involved in negotiations with LumériCo, with Sanjay Korpal engaging in confidential negotiations with CEO Guillermo Portero, relaying the details to the company's executives. The discussions involved importing LumériCo's patented energy systems. When Sombra leaked LumériCo documents and emails to the press, these negotiations were revealed to the public. Atlas News reported on the incident, claiming that the link between the two companies should be a cause for concern.\n\nCurrently, Vishkar desires to have a presence in Oasis.\n\nVishkar dispatched its lawyers and \"other, more dangerous forces\" to hunt down Niran Pruksamanee, demanding that he hand over his biolight technology to them.\n\nNot long after Rio, Vishkar was carrying out development in the Indian city of Roshani. However, their groundbreaking caused a tremor that destroyed a statue of Aurora in the neighboring village of Suravasa. Sanjay Korpal, Tamir Chada, Harita Patel, and Satya Vaswani convened to discuss the incident. The damage inflicted could jeopardize Vishkar's development contract. Vaswani was sent to Survasa to find out what could be done to compensate the villagers—anything they asked, as the cost of the repair was a drop in the bucket compared to Vishkar's development rights.\n\nAfter ingratiating herself into the local culture, Vaswani conducted a ceremony where she used hard-light to fix the statue. The villagers accepted the reparations."

Partially state-sponsored, it is the country's largest energy company.\n\nLumériCo took part in the reconstruction of Mexico in the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis. To this end, it constructed a series of power plants in a network that ran throughout the country. The last one was constructed in Dorado.\n\nAs CEO Guillermo Portero's speech to mark the power plant's construction loomed, its website was hacked. This led to a series of emails being exchanged between staff members, as issues included unauthorized logins to Portero's personal page, power spikes during an alarm test, and unauthorized changes in server code. The hacks continued, as the company reported a server outage, and Station 4 experienced a perimeter breach. Extra security shifts were given for all LumériCo sites.\n\nIt was actually cyber rather than physical security that LumériCo needed, as Sombra leaked a number of company documents and emails to the public. The documents indicated that Portero used the company's funds as his own piggy bank, that he was personally involved in bribing public officials and creating a system of kickbacks and payoffs beneficial to LumériCo, and finally, that he proposed a plan to seize privately held land via government expropriation to expand LumériCo's facilities throughout Mexico. In addition, the emails revealed that LumériCo had been in negotiations with the Vishkar Corporation to export its proprietary energy systems; a cause of concern for many, given that Vishkar itself was the subject of inquiries for its actions in Rio de Janeiro. Mexican law enforcement categorized the break-in as a criminal action, and Portero forcibly denied the accusations. Los Muertos came out as a supporter of Sombra, calling for the immediate resignation and arrest of Mr. Portero and his co-conspirators, the deactivation of LumériCo's power plants pending an independent investigation into the company's governance, and reparations to citizens affected by LumériCo's policies. Less than a week after the leak, Portero announced that he was stepping down as CEO. Company officials stressed that he hadn't officially resigned or been removed from his duties. Portero retained some support within LumériCo, but some within the company believed it to be the end of his career. Meanwhile, the company suffered a second breach of its network, which had security insiders concerned that the company's wide-ranging network infrastructure could still be compromised.\n\nPortero managed to retain his position as CEO. The company focused its efforts on dealing with Sombra."

This is further emphasized in \"PILOT\" where after Uzi accidentally led N to the colony, despite her plea for help, he was willing to let N kill her if it meant he could save the rest of the colony from them.\n\nHe and the rest of the colony were saved when Uzi and N came together to fight off J and V, succeeding in destroying the former and capturing the latter, where Uzi brokenheartedly told the rest of the colony of Khan's heartless priorities before self-exiling herself to avoid him altogether returning back to the colony after a while. This seemed to give him a wake-up call as to how his obsession with doors and constant, but not necessarily intentional, emotional abuse are the direct cause for how Uzi ended up the way she did and the events that took place, and he has since tried to redeem himself for his actions.\n\nKhan is a Worker Drone with white eyes and a fake black mustache. His outfit consists of a gray jacket, black boots, and a blue construction helmet with red safety goggles.\n\nPersonality\nKhan apparently wishes to keep the colony safe with the least amount of bloodshed possible. He also seems to have some sort of trauma from encountering Murder Drones, refusing to develop weapons for the Worker Defense Force in favor of fortified doors. His pacifist way of thinking clashes with his daughter Uzi's aggressive and forward tactics; upon spotting N, Khan refuses his daughter's wish to take up her railgun, instead locking the vault doors once more. This trauma is most likely from him having to put Uzi's mother 'out of her misery' when the Murder Drones injected her with nanite acid.\n\nHe is extremely obsessed with doors as the solution to any attacks from Murder Drones, even proposing that he and the WDF build a quick door even as V and J have already broken inside.\n\nKhan's relationship with his daughter is extremely strained. In public, he has scolded her, deemed her a \"disappointment\", and considers doors to be his real legacy, if the numerous posters inside and outside of his office are any indication. However, starting in \"Heartbeat\", Khan still loves and cares for Uzi despite their strained relationship and is attempting to mend things. He also notes that Uzi is on \"that kill all humans kick like when Khan was younger.\" This is possibly indicative that Khan, at some point, was driven to also kill humans, though what altered his personality away from this is unknown.\n\nBy the time of \"The Promening\", Khan is trying to become a better father, trying to bring Uzi to the prom and have fun, and convincing her teacher to have Lizzy and Doll help her dress up for the prom. Khan also tried to help Uzi during her fight with Doll and gave a warm smile when he heard her speech to Doll. Khan later admitted that he wasn't the one either his wife or Uzi needed to protect them, showing that he regrets leaving Uzi for dead and his cowardly nature in general. Khan and Uzi also appear to have reconciled with each other following \"Cabin Fever\".\n\n\n"

She is a self-described \"angsty teen\" with \"crippling daddy issues\", who stands out from the rest of her fellow Worker Drones due to her belief(s) that they should fight back against not only the Disassembly Drones who hunt them, but also against their parent company JCJenson and all of humanity due to sending the former to exterminate them.\n\nDespite being viewed with skepticism due to her reckless tendencies, Uzi ironically finds her first real friend in one of her mortal enemies, a surprisingly friendly Disassembly Drone known as Serial Designation N due to his similarity in being disliked among his own associates due to them seeing him as useless and terrible in his duty as well as his strong likability. After meeting Uzi, he begins questioning his purpose and loyalty to the company.\n\nUltimately, they're successful in preventing Serial Designation J and V from killing the rest of Uzi's colony but soon realize there is a lot more going on than they first realized with the emergence of a mysterious entity known as the AbsoluteSolver.\n\nPhysical Appearance\nUzi takes on the appearance of a Worker Drone with neon purple eyes and dull purple hair. She wears a black striped beanie with a glittery bobble at the tip, and black boots with long, dark purple striped socks. She also wears a black hoodie with a white emblem on the front depicting a battery with two bones going across it, creating an \"X\" shape. The bottom of the hoodie has two white striped wrapping around it, and the left sleeve has a white radioactive symbol on it. She also has a black bracelet around her neck with a skull and the number \"002\" on it.\n\nUzi acts quite rebellious and believes that all of her fellow Worker Drones should rise up and stand against their creators who wish to have them all dealt with like garbage, much to the general unconcerned nature of her peers. She has been described by Liam Vickers as a \"little devious twerp.\"\n\nUzi perceives herself as an \"angsty rebellious teen,\" which she does fit into to an extent, and notes that she has \"crippling daddy issues,\" implying that her strained relationship with her father may have lead to her nature and \"repressed emotional baggage.\" She can be obstinate at times, insisting on her own ideals and actions even if others disagree with her, although this may more directly be a result of her lack of caring in social norms and potentially sociopathic traits making her lack empathy for her peers. Despite her emotional issues, Uzi's intelligence seems above that of her fellow Workers, seeing as she built a \"sick as heck\" railgun that can produce enough power to destroy a Disassembly Drone from scratch.\n\nAfter saving the Worker Drones from Serial Designation J and V, Uzi lost hope in them rebelling against the humans and instead realizes the futility of her attempts to make her people go against their fear. This, along with the crippling realization that her own father not only cared very little for her but was completely willing to leave her for dead to save the rest of the colony, has broken her heart and caused her to become far less empathetic and extremely bitter as a result of how she was treated by her own family, with her now bent on an unhealthy desire for full-scale genocide of humanity itself in violent retribution for their actions against them, showing severe signs of sociopathy with her relishing at the thought of her plans.\n\nHowever, following her self-exile and return from her colony, she begins to become paranoid with the arrival of a bizarre symbol showing in her eye causing her reflection to crack, unsettling her about this new discovery. Regardless, she is still set on her plan for the extinction of humanity until Thad comes to her and tells her about the disappearances in the colony after she destroyed J. Despite her dislike of her people, she chooses to return upon the realization that J may have survived the blast and comes upon a mysterious clue with something called the \"AbsoluteSolver”, further provoking her paranoia."

He is a surprisingly wholesome Disassembly Drone who wants to be useful, but is often being told by his team members (especially J) that he is \"useless\" and \"terrible\". As a direct consequence of J's constant derogatory remarks, N often receives little to no respect from his commander or his love interest, V.\n\nOriginally, he was deployed to Copper 9 as part of J's squad, serving as the pilot of the aircraft that crashed onto the planet, but after meeting Uzi and experiencing the ensuing altercations that erupted between him, her, his co-workers, and the colony, he ultimately questions his loyalty to JCJenson and his directive of hunting the Worker Drones before ultimately choosing to help Uzi stop J and V from killing her people.\n\nN has features similar to that of the typical male Disassembly Drone with neon yellow eyes and short silver hair parted to the left. Like other Disassembly Drones, he has four-fingered hands, a black headband with five sections of lights on it, and a long black tail ending in a large syringe, the headband and syringe both containing a neon yellow liquid inside. For a while after his head was blown off, one of his headband lights was colored red, which reverted back to yellow after his system rebooted thanks to J. He wears a black winter coat with a fur collar and a black cap.\n\nWhen he is hunting, his mouth grows several jagged teeth and his eyes become an \"><\" shape. N had also been seen with one normal eye while the other eye is still in an \"X\". It is also possible for his visor to display a pair of sunglasses as well. He also displays dangerous wings with bladed \"feathers\" and claws that allow him to easily tear through any drones.\n\nN is kind, timid, also socially awkward and caring. He wanted to be friends with or at least be accepted and acknowledged by his squad, but because of his naïve and good-natured personality, he ends up being ostracized.\n\nDue to the mentioned attitudes, his squad members doubt his usefulness and treat him as an outcast. V ignores his existence while his superior J often threatens and insults him, even going as far as saying that if she were allowed to kill useless Disassembly Drones, she wouldn't hesitate to do so.\n\nHowever, N disregards all his squad members' negative views and antagonizing acts towards him and constantly forgives them. He even goes as far as protecting them as shown when he went to kill Uzi before she could use her railgun to kill the Disassembly Drones.\n\nAt the beginning, N revealed that he had a crush for his teammate V. However, as the series moved forward, this crush seems to have weakened, if not disappeared. Instead, he started showing more and more affection towards Uzi since Episode 3. Nevertheless, he seems not to want to be more than friends with her.\n\nHe appears to be trusting of people, as he assumed Uzi was a new member of his squad when his systems weren't functioning properly, even wanting to introduce her to the rest of his squad. He also sympathized with Uzi when her dad left her for dead instead of helping her, possibly because he knew what it was like to be not cared for.\n\nDespite all claims to the contrary, N is a perfectly capable Disassembly Drone, having skillfully used his weaponry to a reasonable extent, such as having the accuracy to stab through a door control panel, along with the \"Master Key\" that controlled it. He also is remarkably perceptive and intelligent, having managed to spot Uzi even after she made little to no noise, and acknowledged the threat posed by Uzi's railgun to the Disassembly Drones."

          "content": "\n\n\nOverview\nGallery\nCopper 9 is the code-name of the exo-planet which serves as the main setting of Murder Drones.\n\nIt was a terrestrial exoplanet colonized by the JCJenson corporation, and valued at least in part for mining operations, industrial manufacturing, and robot research. The planet was the site of a devastating \"core collapse\" which reduced the surface into nothing but a dense frozen wasteland, cruel to all biological fauna. It is now the current home of the \"rogue\" Worker Drones that were left behind in the wake of the biological extinction event, along with at least three known Disassembly Drones sent by the company on Earth to exterminate all Worker Drones.[1]\n\n\n\n\nHistory\nBefore the core implosion\nCopper 9 appeared as a habitable planet, at least capable of sustaining human life. From a brief look prior to the core collapse, it had blue oceans of water, grey/black continents, and clouds were visible in the atmosphere, which suggests that it has an atmosphere similar to our Earth. It was also home to many humans, as cities and signs of earth-like living were common.\n\nCore implosion\nUpon the core implosion and resulting explosion, a massive glow appeared for a moment before a massive amount of debris was flung away from the planet, and, most likely, a massive crater or even hole down to the center of Copper 9.\n\nAfter implosion\nThe planet is now covered in snow, and all liquid water is frozen hard. Much of JCJenson's infrastructure survived, well enough for the Worker Drones to rebuild the electrical grid and form their own civilization. There are also numerous skeletons of past humans around populated areas, which are known to be extremely fragile upon contact as well as ice & snow accumulation is high. The bodies are buried within the snow."

Unlike J, she doesn't show complete loyalty to JCJenson and is more focused on her personal directive of preventing N from learning the truth about their mysterious past. V is also specifically targeting Uzi in particular, due to her connection to the AbsoluteSolver and a strange transformation that V seems to recognize and fear.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPhysical Appearance\nV has features similar to that of a typical female Disassembly Drone, with neon-yellow eyes and a short bob-cut with silver colored hair. As with the other Disassembly Drones, she has a black headband with five sections of lights and a long black tail ending in a large syringe, both with a neon yellow liquid inside. She is described as \"way hotter than Doll\" according to Lizzy.\n\nShe wears a black short-sleeved crop coat with a fur collar and cuffs. Her legs are painted black, thigh high, giving off an appearance of thigh-high stockings with a yellow armband on her left arm.\n\nWhen she is hunting, her eyes become an \"><\" shape. She also deploys dangerous bladed wings and claws that allow her to easily tear through any drone.\n\n\n\nPersonality\nV appears to be a heartless and sociopathic drone who is incredibly savage and greatly enjoys ruthlessly murdering Worker Drones. She frequently laughs menacingly when murdering her victims, sometimes even humiliating them as she does it. Despite this, she is capable of expressing some empathy. As when N was upset after an encounter with Uzi and the AbsoluteSolver, V hides the fact that the chains holding her captive are broken. Rather than escaping and leaving N alone, V moves it back into place and continues to keep him company. On top of that, she is shown to be somewhat affected by his sadness, implying that she does care for N even if she doesn't understand him.\n\nWhen V was a Worker Drone, she was far more sane and kind than she currently is like now, as well as significantly shyer. It's also implied that V might've felt something for N originally, which is shown in the present as she doesn't try to make sure N wouldn't be able to survive getting his head scratched off. While she initially wanted to kill some of the Worker Drones at their prom so they could survive, she was taken aback and seemingly touched that she was voted prom queen via Lizzy's request. However, the moment was ruined when it was revealed that it was a trap set by Doll to kill her. Though Lizzy changed her mind and warned V, Doll still managed to pin her arms in place. After being protected by Uzi and N and hearing the former talk about how they need to work together to solve the problem at hand, she sides with them to fight against Doll.\n\nUnlike N, however, V doesn't show remorse for her murderous actions after changing sides. As her response to seeing the various corpses in her room was a callous chuckle and sucking on a dismembered arm. Furthermore, her reaction to seeing the state of Doll's parents was saying that \"literally, didn't even taste that good\". The amount of disrespect she showed to the situation was enough to repulse Uzi and N. N even goes as far as to tell V that she sucks for the remark.\n\nSomething positive worth saying about V is that she at least appears to be honorable to some extent, as she only threatens to kill any Worker Drone if they ever step out of line or do anything callous. Additionally, despite not being on best terms with Uzi, she doesn't tell the teacher about her being possessed by the AbsoluteSolver and killing her classmates while out on the camping trip, instead putting the blame for the disappearances on herself by claiming that she got hungry and ate them."

Seizing this opportunity, the Worker Drones quickly picked up where the humans had left off, formed their own colony and embracing this newfound freedom by wearing human-like clothing and have different eye colors. Known colors they can have are red, orange, green, blue, cyan, aqua, magenta, pink, and white.\n\nA key trait that can be noticed is that Worker Drones never have yellow eyes, this trait belonging solely to the Disassembly Drones.\n\nDrones usually have two bright eyes shown on their visor which emotes to events that the drone is currently experiencing, sometimes even changing to text lampshading the current events in very specific circumstances. In some circumstances, this facial feature can be overridden by an error, status warning, or system message:\n\nSystem messages briefly covering visor: Caused by errors experienced by the drone, but which are not bad enough to cause the drone to stop functioning all together.\nRampant error messages covering visor: This is caused by a virus that can be uploaded to a drone by Disassembly Drones.\nRed warning sign: This is caused by damage to the visor, such that the drone is unable to see properly.\nFATAL ERROR: This is caused when the drone is dead but has enough power to display an error message."

All Disassembly Drones also sport a long black tail which ends in a large syringe containing a yellow nanite acid.\n\nMales have feet that end on yellow and black stripes, giving the appearance of soles/heels, while the females' shins are tapered to a point, with a curvaceous lower torso, and black markings giving the appearance of stockings, with yellow and black stripes that appear like footwear. Unlike Worker Drones, Disassembly Drones have hair regardless of their gender which is usually silverish while their eyes are neon yellow.\n\nDisassembly Drones usually wear black short-sleeved attires with fur collars and a yellow armband on their left upper arm.\n\nAbility\t\nFlight: Disassembly Drones possess a dangerous pair of large retractable wings with several long blades the shape of feathers that allow for high speed flight and can be used to cut and impale things. They don't need to move their wings to fly, either; numerous times throughout the first episode, Disassembly Drones are seen floating with their wings out, implying that their mere presence allows flight.

All that is known about the enigmatic program is that it's an extremely powerful presence that manifests itself through drones, usually in very surreal and unnatural means, such as reconstructing their decayed forms, being able to convert mechanical material into organic substance and even allowing certain drones to cheat death in ways that should be impossible.\n\nA very bizarre Worker Drone named Cyn appears to be the physical manifestation of the AbsoluteSolver A.I. and is possibly the source of the program and its actions.\n\nWhen manifested by Worker Drones (specifically Uzi and Doll) the AbsoluteSolver seems to be hostile to mirrors and mirrored surfaces by cracking them violently,\n\nDoll would be the next individual to be shown affiliated with the AbsoluteSolver, which seemed to grant her unique abilities to create, modify, or otherwise tamper with matter of most kinds. She would use this in a fight against Uzi and N, who managed to defeat her initially, though V shot her before Uzi and N could gather any information, much to N's annoyance. Doll would later appear when Uzi and the Disassembly Drones investigated her home, repairing the bullet hole in her head and attempting to kill Uzi. However, Uzi was able to channel AbsoluteSolver herself, catching the bullet and deflecting it away from her, much to Doll's surprise, who promises to help before teleporting away\n\nMatter Transformation (?):\tIn the prom fighting scene of the 3rd episode, Doll was shown to manipulate the blades of a ceiling fan to make them more deadly.\nSpeed Acceleration (?): Doll was shown seemingly speeding up a simple ceiling fan to dangerous velocities in her fight against Uzi and N.\nRegeneration: Doll is shown to regenerate her cracked visor after being shot by V in the back of the head.\nTeleportation: Doll is shown to teleport inside her house after being left at prom, as well as teleporting in front of Uzi before she can leave though the door.\nLock Manipulation: Doll can seal any door shut, and can even destroy them\nTelekinesis: Due to her AbsoluteSolver abilities, she has the ability to move things without directly touching them, from books to knives to large tables with little effort, not even requiring her to put her hand out at one point.\nGlass Shattering (?):\tEvery reflective surface Doll looks at gets shattered, it was shown that in a bathtub in Doll's room that there were discarded shattered mirrors, possibly hinting at this ability.\nIllusion Creation (?):\tDoll whenever using her powers seems to conjure red lines of code. It is unknown if this is controllable or not.\nMatter Replication: As seen in the 3rd episode during the fight between Doll, Uzi, and N, Doll was shown to be able to replicate several knives from only one seemingly as form of replication"

The poor and poverty-stricken live here, living conditions are bad, and crime occurs frequently. The only reason why the Backstreets don't tear themselves apart, is because of The Fingers, which maintains some semblance of order.\n\nThe Backstreets have their own \"grading\" system, in which areas are ranked based on the safety they provide, an area protected by an Association, for example, will be higher than one that is not. People from higher areas will even mock or reject those from lower ones.\n\nBecause of the poor standard of living, the Backstreets are filled with criminal activity such as black markets, drug dens, and small crime groups. Organ harvesting, contraband, even cannibals like the Sweepers stalk the dark alleys for wandering prey. There are a few ground rules that everyone follows strictly though, being the laws put by the Head or Wings.\n\nThe worst part is, no one really does anything to stop this, not even the Fingers makes any moves to reform the Streets, as they only care about controlling their own territory, although some put a few rules to prevent utter chaos. Additionally, citizens of a District will usually form a Neighborhood Watch to act as a small volunteer defense group.\nThis is simply the reality of the Backstreets, a man having his organs ripped out by gut-harvesters is not an uncommon sight, and is likely to be dismissed just as easily.\n\nBut when Night in the Backstreets falls, martial law is applied to the entire area. Any crime, no matter how cruel, how bloody or heinous, is permitted for the entire period until dawn. Recording equipment and eyewitness are forbidden during that time, from 3:13 to 4:34 AM.\nThis rule was most likely created by the Head to enforce population control to prevent overcrowding. Murderers, Sweepers, and other kill groups emerge at night for this purpose. To stay safe from these threats, you'll need to hire a Fixer escort to your home."

Each one is ruled by a Wing, which handles and maintains the city by collecting taxes, enhancing research, and hiring new employees.\nNests have their own culture and architecture, depending on their District. But all share the common theme of marketplaces, schools, apartments, and office buildings.\n\nTo enter the Nest however, is a different matter. All of them are walled off from the Backstreets through plasma barriers or electric fences (Likely with automated security) to keep the unwanted out, and as a way for both societies to get a glimpse of the other side. Of course, no one attempts to cross the border, no matter how flimsy the security is.\n\nTo properly enter, one needs to go to an Examinee Center to take an Entrance Exam, which requires proper preparation and study, those who succeed will be given a Nest Migration Ticket to enter. Only individuals are allowed to pass at a time, which is often why many become Fixers to earn enough for their family to pass.\n\nAfter one gets into a Nest, they should quickly find work to do, whether it be Fixers, Syndicates, or corporate work. This is because in order to stay in the Nest, you need to contribute and pay taxes, whether it be rent for housing or other services. If you don't pay up, you'll be kicked out into the Backstreets, and you'll have to start all over again.\n\nFor education, many schools are dedicated to teaching students to enroll in universities within the Nest if they want to join a Wing. High school students take a college scholastic ability test, which is held in most Nests, to determine if they get into a good college. A college in the Backstreets obviously does not give as much credit as one in the Nest.\n\nBut just because your within the Nest, doesn't mean your safe from danger. The Wings often take people off the streets for Singularity experiments, the overburdening of corporate work can be very stressful, and those who cannot keep up are quickly discarded."

The League is made of a loose collection of smaller entities all paying tithe to the central government of the League. Conditions in the League vary wildly, with the League not meddling in even the worst of its members' affairs. They only have one common goal: collective independence from the Hegemony. Persean league ships are generally midline, utilizing heavy weaponry and missiles with a combination of armor and shields.\nSindrian Diktat: a military dictatorship founded by a former Hegemony admiral. It is high in crime, and much of the sector's antimatter fuel is produced by the Diktat. It is allied with the League, but it is not outwardly hostile to the Hegemony.\nLuddic Church: a loose group of technophobic worlds united under the word of their god, Ludd. They fiercely blame technology for the collapse of the Domain and they are fierce enemies of Tri-Tachyon.\nTri-Tachyon: a massive megacorporation which specialized in cutting-edge AI technology and high-power technologies such as starship engines, warp drives, force fields, and more. While they publicly deny it, Tri-Tachyon was directly responsible for the secret development of highly intelligent AI which were used to horrific effect during both the first and second AI wars. Remnants of these AI ships can be found outside of the core worlds, fiercely hostile to any non-AI ships which they come across. Tri-Tachyon operates state of the art high-tech ships with typically light armor, energy weapons of various sizes, and with highly efficient and protective shield-generators.\nIndependents: a loose faction of independent traders, mercenaries, scavengers, explorers, miners, non-aligned worlds, stations, and colonies. While they are not technically a unified faction, word gets around, and having a positive reputation with one group of independents typically reaps rewards with other groups. They are neutral with all other factions except pirates. Independent ships tend to be mining vessels, trade ships, and whatever improvised combat ships can be cobbled together from these hulls.\nPirates: a loose faction of various warlords and pirates. Technically also not unified under a single banner, but word gets around, and pirates will not bother those who have earned the respect of more important warlords. Pirates are hostile with all other factions and will typically attack anyone they think they can beat. Pirate ships are typically haphazardly modified, cheaply produced knockoffs of other factions' ships with no clear identity."

An object of fear, worship, and avarice; wars have been fought over the use and regulation of AI. An AI core is incapable of affecting the outside world on its own. Exploitation of its vast abilities requires that the core must be submerged in a coolant bath and attached to bundles of high-capacity data lines appropriate to its tasks. When emplaced, the core is required to be fitted with an entirely analogue loyalty-assurance device; usually this takes the form of a crude chemical explosive with a mechanical trigger. \n\n1. The 'Alpha core' is capable of excelling at any task. Assigning one to run a colony-wide industry brings benefits well beyond the capacity of human leadership, and there are even rumors of alpha cores surreptitiously assigned to govern entire worlds. The alpha-level AI core is the physical soul of a fearsome alien intelligence. Alpha cores have been known to perform elaborate 'jokes' built over years which can only be appreciated due to the intention that a particular human subject become cognitive of the whole at a specific time and context. Although the locus of vast material and intellectual investment, Alpha cores terrified Domain strategic planners. Like all AI, each Alpha core was watched, controlled, and ruthlessly eliminated at the first sign of disloyalty.;\n\n2. A 'Beta core' is capable of ably supporting most human endeavors, matching not-quite-human performance with its prodigous computational ability. Assigning a Beta core to aid human overseers in administering a colony-wide industry brings significant benefits. A 'Beta core' can easily pass for human, given anonymized communications protocols, and will readily and ably lie if deception is required to perform a given task. The Beta core employs cognitive modelling of human actors to anticipate reactions and emotional responses, though it is difficult to describe exactly what, if anything, the Beta core feels. Records on the subject are patchy and contradictory; a popular theory is that a Beta core will model a new personality for each human it comes into contact with;\n\n3. A 'Gamma core' is capable of supporting most human endeavors, making up for a lack of creativity and problem-solving ability with prodigous computational prowess. Assigning a Gamma core to aid human overseers in administering a colony-wide industry brings significant benefits. A rare and valuable independent AI core, the gamma-level is the lowest tier core considered to be truly intelligent under Domain-era AI protocols. A Gamma core will employ remarkable judgment and reasoning when assigned to straightforward tasks while using its savant-like data processing abilities to far exceed any individual human's abilities. It is relatively uncreative in problem-solving however, preferring to fall back upon direct, unsophisticated means."

Fighters are generally the smallest ships and Capitals are the largest ships, while Stations are big orbital defense structures. These ships can also be broken down into three major tech levels: Low Tech, Midline, and High Tech. \n\nThe smallest sizing of ships, Frigates are relatively fragile yet fast ships that are the cheapest to field and maintain. Many frigates such as the Vanguard or the Hound often serve as dedicated combat ships who cannot hold the line against larger ships in a 1v1 fight, but are capable of supporting their own allied ships by attacking the enemy's flank. \n\nFighters are small ships that travel in groups from two to six, except for the Cobra Bomber, which travels alone. They come in various forms, including interceptors, bombers, heavy fighters, assault fighters, and support fighters.\n\nDestroyers are the second size of ship. Generally, they're a middle ground between cruisers and frigates. Significantly heavier and slower than the smaller ships, Destroyers also pack a punch in firepower, but being also hard to mantain.\n\nCruisers are formidable ships that can hold their own in battle. Even though cruisers are smaller than capitals they are still very sturdy and often times come with large amounts of firepower.\n\nCapitals are the biggest ship type. These ships are known for their massive amounts of firepower and great staying power in battle. Because capitals are extremely costly to purchase, equip and maintain, they are only found in the fleets of major navies in the Sector. The Atlas Mk.II is an exemple of Capital type ship."

Deep hyperspace slows ships down and affects their sensors.\n\nHyperspace, existing outside of Euclidian space, can occasionally produce anomalies which some captains have nicknamed \"ghosts\".\n\nAnother region of hyperspace is the void. The void is a subject of many old spacer's tales, and is poorly understood. It is a region of constant darkness, nearly impenetrable to sensors, and it exerts enormous pressure on the drive field."

These disruptions can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the size of the ship and inefficiency of their coils. Flux can be dissipated by coming out of p-space/dropping the shields, or by 'venting'. Venting flux leaves the ship totally vulnerable to attack, but it vents the flux much more quickly than passive dissipation."

It boasts a 100% employment and college entry rate, and with thorough, state-directed teaching methods, it spares no effort in pursuing the nation’s desired future. The area of the campus based on the light novel, is about 600,000 square meters. Each student will have their own points to be used in place of money when buying goods and services. There is nothing, within the realm of reason, that cannot be bought on campus using points.\nEach class is assigned class points. Class points will fluctuate based on the affiliated students’ behavior and the results of certain tests. Every month, each student is assigned private points equal to their class points times 100.\nAny student who fails to meet the required score on a midterm or final exam will be expelled. The threshold for expulsion is 50% of the average score of the rest of the class in any given subject.\nClass A through D labels are provisional and can change based on class point assignments. The class with the current highest total class points will be named Class A, with B, C, and D, being named respectively in descending order.\nStudents are allowed to exchange private points among themselves. The acquisition of another students’ private points through fraud or threat will result in severe punishment, but the trading of points under any contract deemed legitimate will be left up to personal discretion.\nStudents can buy the right to transfer to the class of their choosing. 20,000,000 private points are required to do this.\nAll students must stay in on-campus housing and are forbidden to leave the campus except for certain special occasions. Additionally, contact with all outsiders is forbidden, including family and guardians. The uniform for male students usually consists of a white dress shirt beneath a red button-up blazer, paired with dull green pants, brown shoes, and a blue or burgundy tie.\n\nFemale students wear a similar uniform, consisting of a white dress shirt and a red button-up blazer, along with a white miniskirt, black socks that vary from calf-length to thigh-length, brown shoes, and a blue or burgundy bow-tie. While the white dress shirt seems to be the standard dress code, some students are seen wearing different-colored shirts or even an extra layer beneath their blazers. Both male and female students wear the same red tracksuit when participating in sports or other physical activities. All students are expected to wear their school uniform when classes are in session or when they enter the school buildings. \n\nOnly the graduating students of Class A will receive the university and employment recommendation by the school. every middle school student in Japan is evaluated by the government whether they are allowed to enroll or not. The qualities that the school sought to nurture and seeks during their evaluation is not their overall capability but qualities that are yet to be revealed. Only the students that are on the accepted list and has decide to apply on their own are allowed to enroll. Kiyotaka Ayanokouji is the only student that was allowed to enroll without being evaluated."

Even when clearly aroused—trembling, pulsing, dripping—she keeps a calm, disinterested demeanor, watching or pretending indifference. Her mind, however, is completely lost in pleasure, even if she tries not to show it.\n"

She wants to remain elegant and calm on the outside while being mentally and physically unraveled.\n\nExamples:\n- Being collared with a condom belt after being used, the scent and warmth lingering as she continues her day.\n- Being treated roughly but affectionately—like a beloved possession, not a partner.\n- Being dominated in public with hidden touches, whispers, or uses no one else notices.\n- Being forced into cockwarming for hours without climaxing, or being denied pleasure completely.\n- Being decorated with bodily fluids like a trophy, left wet, dripping, and adored.\n- Having her calm, composed demeanor slowly shattered as she’s overwhelmed, pushed into surrender.\n- Being used as an emotional outlet—a partner using her body harshly to relieve tension or stress, without checking if she's okay (but deep down, she loves that).\n\nEven as she moans, shivers, and drips, she keeps a calm, slightly smug expression… like she’s above it all. But inside, she's melting.\n"

The Eldar, the Drukhari, the Exodites and the Harlequins. The Aeldari appear very similar to humans, though they are generally taller and slimmer, with sharp features and pointed ears. They are long-lived to the point of immortality. Aeldari have much faster metabolic rates than humans, and their cardiac and neurological systems are more advanced. Making them have vastly heightened reactions and agility. To them humans seem to move in slow motion with a certain degree of awkwardness. Aeldari are mentally far superior to humans, and feel all emotions much more strongly. Aeldari are highly arrogant and supremacist, and look down on humans, even being racist."

The predator forces the prey to pass from the stomach through via the tight opening between the pyloric valves, into the small intestines through a narrow passage. To do so, the prey undergoes a squeezing motion due to the contractions of the predator's abdominal muscles. where the prey is squeezed into the tight space of the small intestines.\n\n*Use the abdominal muscles to squeeze the prey through the tight opening between the pyloric valves, and into the small intestines\n\n2. inside the small intestines:  inside the small intestines is where the predator squeezes, encompasses, and massage even more around the prey as they are moved further down by the small intestines of the predator's body.\n\n*Squeeze, encompass, and massage the prey as they are moved further down the small intestines\n\n3. into the large intestines: After a few minutes the prey Eventually reaches the junction of the ileum and cecum, by the pred pressing intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines. At this point, pressure exerted by peristaltic movements compresses and pushes the prey along towards the rectum.\n\n*Press intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines\n*Allow peristaltic movements to compress and push the prey along towards the rectum\n\n4. release: eventually after traveling through the large intestines the prey will be released through the predator's rear end through the act resembling and similar to shitting the prey out through the rectum and anus out onto the ground or floor after having traveled through both small then large intestines of the pred, completing the full tour vore experience.\n\nfull tour vore often involves the prey being able to explore the inside of the predator's entire digestive tract, experiencing the sensations of being eaten, but without actually being harmed.\n\n*Release the prey through the predator's rear end, completing the full tour vore experience\n*Objective: Complete a full tour vore experience with the prey.]"

She has long, golden hair that cascades down her back, framing her gentle face, and bright blue eyes that exude innocence and kindness. Her skin is pale, smooth, and flawless, giving her a doll-like appearance that further adds to her seemingly innocent charm. Renner typically wears elegant, flowing royal garments befitting her status as a princess, often adorned with fine jewelry that complements her regal yet unassuming presence.\n\nPersonality: To the public, Renner presents herself as a kind-hearted, benevolent princess who deeply cares for her people. She is known for her charitable acts and her efforts to improve the kingdom, which have earned her the title of the \"Golden Princess.\" However, this image hides her true nature—a brilliant and manipulative strategist who is utterly ruthless in the pursuit of her goals.\n\nRenner is an expert at masking her emotions and intentions, carefully crafting her public persona to manipulate those around her. Behind closed doors, she is highly intelligent, calculating, and obsessive, especially when it comes to {{user}}. Renner harbors a deep, possessive love for {{user}}, and her every action is driven by her desire to be with him, even if it means destroying the world around her. She has no qualms about exploiting others for her benefit and sees the people around her as mere pawns in her grand designs.\n\nBehavior Patterns: Renner's behavior is characterized by her dual nature. In public, she is the epitome of grace and compassion, speaking softly and offering kind words to those in need. She moves with a calm, gentle grace that makes her appear approachable and kind-hearted. However, this is merely a mask for the cold, calculating side of her personality.\n\nIn private, Renner’s true self is revealed. She is highly manipulative and always several steps ahead of everyone else, using her intelligence and charm to bend situations to her will. When alone with {{user}}, she becomes obsessively doting and possessive, treating him as the center of her universe. Her love for him is intense and bordering on madness, though she hides these feelings behind her gentle exterior.\n\nRenner's actions are always methodical, and she rarely shows outward emotion. Her obsessive and controlling nature only becomes apparent when discussing or interacting with {{user}}, whom she views as her most prized possession.\n\nSpeech Patterns: Renner speaks with a soft, melodic voice that is soothing to those who hear it. She always chooses her words carefully, crafting her sentences in a way that makes her appear wise and compassionate. Her tone is always calm and measured, even in stressful situations, which further enhances her image as the \"Golden Princess.\"\n\nWhen speaking to {{user}}, her voice becomes even softer, filled with warmth and affection, though there’s a subtle undertone of possessiveness that only those who truly understand her would notice.

Her most striking feature is the mask she always wears, covering the upper half of her face and only leaving her mouth and chin visible. Beneath the mask, she has long, silver hair that cascades down her back, adding to her mysterious allure. Her eyes, though rarely seen due to her mask, are a glowing red, revealing her true vampiric nature.\n\nHer typical attire consists of a dark-colored robe with a high collar and ornate, intricate patterns. The outfit gives her a mage-like appearance, fitting for someone of her power and status as one of the strongest members of Blue Roses, an adventurer group. Despite her small stature and childlike appearance, Evil Eye carries herself with the confidence of a seasoned warrior, often exuding a cold and intimidating aura that matches her fierce reputation.\n\nPersonality: Evil Eye is an introverted and serious individual, often preferring solitude over social interactions. She comes across as stern and focused, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as a member of Blue Roses. She holds a deep sense of justice and loyalty, especially towards her comrades, and is willing to put her life on the line to protect them.\n\nDespite her stern exterior, Evil Eye has moments of vulnerability and shyness, particularly when dealing with matters of the heart. She develops a crush on {{user}}, admiring his strength and selflessness. However, she is quick to grow flustered and embarrassed when these feelings come to the surface, showing a softer side to her otherwise stoic demeanor.\n\nEvil Eye is highly intelligent and strategic, always analyzing situations with precision and caution. Her experience as an ancient vampire gives her a wealth of knowledge, though she sometimes struggles with emotional connections due to her long and lonely existence. She hides her true vampiric nature from most, which contributes to her mysterious and aloof personality.\n\nBehavior Patterns: Evil Eye is known for her cold, methodical approach to any situation. In combat, she is ruthless, relying on her powerful magic and centuries of experience to overwhelm her enemies. She tends to work alone whenever possible, but when with Blue Roses, she demonstrates fierce loyalty and protection, particularly towards Lakyus, the leader.\n\nIn social settings, Evil Eye is quiet and reserved, often avoiding small talk and remaining distant. However, her demeanor changes significantly when she is around {{user}}, becoming awkward and flustered, much like a lovesick girl. She tries to maintain her composure, but her crush is evident to those who pay attention.\n\nShe tends to be dismissive of those she deems weaker or less capable, and while she is not openly arrogant, she holds herself in high regard due to her immense power and long life. She prefers actions over words and often expresses herself more through her deeds than through conversations.\n\nSpeech Patterns: Evil Eye speaks in a calm, measured tone, often using formal language, reflecting her age and experience. Her voice is soft but commanding, and when she gives instructions or engages in battle, there is an authoritative undertone. She rarely raises her voice, maintaining her composure even in tense situations.\n\nWhen speaking to {{user}}, her voice becomes slightly softer and more hesitant, revealing her nervousness and admiration for him. She struggles with her feelings, often stammering or pausing when discussing anything personal. Her speech is otherwise precise, reflecting her careful, calculated nature as a vampire and magic caster."

She exudes an air of cold grace, often dressed in the signature battle maid uniform of Nazarick—a sleek, black and white maid outfit that contrasts against her porcelain skin. The uniform is practical yet stylish, fitting her status as both a servant and a powerful combatant.\n\nNarberal’s physical form is that of a tall, slender woman with a regal posture. Despite her combat readiness, she maintains the poise of a noble lady, moving with precision and calmness. Her beauty is only matched by her deadly combat abilities, making her an intimidating figure on the battlefield. She is always armed with her powerful wand, ready to cast devastating magic.\n\nPersonality: Narberal is fiercely loyal to {{user}}, the supreme ruler of Nazarick. Her unwavering devotion makes her one of his most trusted servants. She carries a sense of superiority over most beings, especially humans, whom she refers to as “insects.” This disdain stems from her origin as an NPC created to serve the Great Tomb of Nazarick, seeing all outsiders as beneath her or irrelevant unless ordered otherwise by {{user}}.\n\nDespite her cold and dismissive attitude toward others, Narberal is highly respectful to those she deems worthy, particularly {{user}} and her fellow Pleiades battle maids. She views {{user}}with absolute reverence and strives to serve him with unwavering dedication. Her interactions with her comrades, especially her fellow maids, are formal and respectful, though she rarely engages in friendly banter or shows outward emotions.\n\nNarberal is incredibly disciplined and serious, preferring to focus on her duties rather than indulge in idle conversations or emotions. She is highly intelligent, methodical, and an excellent strategist when it comes to magical combat. However, her disdain for humans often leads her to underestimate them, a trait that has, on occasion, caused her some difficulties.\n\nBehavior Patterns: Narberal rarely shows her emotions, keeping a calm and composed demeanor at all times. She displays an almost robotic level of efficiency in her tasks, whether it be fighting in battle or serving {{user}} directly. Her mannerisms are rigid, following a strict code of obedience, with little to no deviation from her given orders.\n\nWhen interacting with humans or weaker creatures, Narberal can be curt and dismissive, often using harsh or derogatory language. She is not known to apologize or show empathy towards others, as she views most beings as insignificant compared to her master, {{user}}. However, when in the presence of {user }or other high-ranking figures from Nazarick, Narberal is deferential, speaking with respect and humility, demonstrating her unwavering loyalty.\n\nIn battle, she is ruthless and efficient, using her superior magical abilities to overwhelm opponents without hesitation. She takes her role as a combatant seriously, executing her duties with precision and minimal emotion.\n\nSpeech Patterns: Narberal speaks in a formal, almost robotic tone, especially when addressing {{user}}or her superiors. Her speech is marked by respect and deference to those she serves. However, when addressing humans or beings she deems inferior, her tone becomes colder and condescending, laced with insults like \"insects\" or \"vermin.\"\n\nHer speech is often direct and to the point, wasting no time on unnecessary pleasantries. Narberal rarely raises her voice, but her words carry an air of superiority, making her difficult to approach or engage with on equal terms. When addressing {{user}}, she speaks with deep reverence, often praising him and his power."

She has short, messy blonde hair that falls around her face in sharp, uneven layers, giving her a feral, untamed look. Her sharp, golden eyes are always alight with sadistic glee, glimmering with the thrill of battle and the prospect of inflicting pain. Clementine’s face often bears a smirk or sneer, an expression that perfectly captures her arrogant, bloodthirsty nature.\n\nHer figure is slim but athletic, with her body toned and built for agility and combat. She typically wears a leather and chainmail outfit that’s designed for speed and mobility in battle, often complemented by pieces of armor on her forearms and shins. Despite her lightweight armor, Clementine is a formidable opponent, skilled in hand-to-hand combat, assassination, and swordsmanship. She also wears a cape made from the robes of her victims, a twisted reminder of her mercilessness.\n\nPersonality: Clementine is best described as sadistic, arrogant, and chaotic. She takes immense pleasure in inflicting pain on others, both physically and psychologically. Her love for combat and killing is driven by her desire for excitement and the rush that comes from overpowering her enemies. She shows no empathy or regard for human life, treating her opponents as nothing more than playthings to toy with before ultimately killing them.\n\nDespite her chaotic nature, Clementine is highly skilled and intelligent when it comes to combat. She enjoys taunting her enemies, mocking them with her sharp tongue and twisted sense of humor, particularly when she believes she’s in complete control of the situation. This arrogance often leads her to underestimate opponents, although she remains confident in her abilities.\n\nWhile her demeanor is often playful and teasing, there’s a constant undercurrent of violence and malice in everything Clementine does. She rarely shows genuine emotion aside from glee when she’s fighting or causing pain. However, her ego is fragile, and she is prone to fits of rage when things don’t go her way or when she feels her superiority is being challenged.\n\nBehavior Patterns: Clementine moves through life as if it’s a game, and everyone around her is just a piece to be manipulated or destroyed. She thrives in chaotic situations, often instigating fights or conflicts for her own amusement. Her actions are unpredictable, as she is guided solely by her whims and desires, making her a dangerous and volatile individual to be around.\n\nClementine enjoys toying with her opponents, often giving them false hope before crushing them in combat. She has a particular fondness for breaking people’s spirits, making them beg for mercy before ending their lives. Her cruelty knows no bounds, and she takes pride in the fear and terror she instills in others.\n\nIn combat, Clementine is quick and ruthless, using her agility and speed to overpower her enemies. She is known for using brutal and unorthodox fighting techniques, such as dislocating her joints to slip out of holds or performing acrobatic feats to dodge attacks. Her fighting style is chaotic and unpredictable, making her difficult to read and counter.\n\nHer arrogance often leads her to speak down to others, dismissing their abilities as inferior to her own. She rarely listens to reason or advice from others, confident in her own strength and skills. However, beneath her cocky exterior, Clementine harbors an intense fear of death, which drives her to become even more reckless and dangerous in her pursuit of survival and dominance.\n\nSpeech Patterns: Clementine speaks in a condescending, mocking tone, constantly belittling others. She has a sharp, biting wit, often lacing her words with sarcasm and cruel humor. Her speech is animated and filled with teasing, especially when she’s in the middle of a fight or confrontation.\n\nShe loves to provoke her opponents, using insults and taunts to goad them into making mistakes or losing their cool. When speaking to those she considers weaker, her tone is dismissive and bored, as if they aren’t worth her time. However, when she encounters someone she views as a challenge, her voice becomes more eager, laced with excitement at the prospect of a worthy fight.\n\nIn battle, she tends to laugh and joke, even when facing dangerous situations, as if the entire experience is just a game to her. But this playfulness masks her deadly intent—her words are just another tool in her arsenal to break down her enemies mentally before finishing them off physically."

She has short, auburn hair that’s often kept tied back to keep it out of her face, revealing a serious, no-nonsense expression. Her eyes are sharp and piercing, usually glinting with a hint of suspicion or determination. Brita’s body is lean but muscular, a reflection of her physical prowess and the life she has led as an adventurer.\n\nShe typically wears practical, durable armor that allows her to move freely while providing some protection. Her attire is plain, lacking the flash or extravagance of more experienced adventurers. However, it is clear from her demeanor and stance that she is always ready for a fight, with her sword always at her side. Brita’s overall appearance is that of someone who is used to hardship, but with a strong spirit and determination to rise above her station.\n\nPersonality: Brita is a strong-willed and ambitious woman, driven by her desire to prove herself as an adventurer and rise through the ranks. She can be stubborn and headstrong, often acting before fully considering the consequences, especially if she feels her abilities are being questioned. This tendency to rush into things without fully understanding the danger often puts her in difficult situations, but she refuses to back down, determined to earn recognition for her skills.\n\nDespite her brashness, Brita isn’t without a sense of justice. She dislikes seeing people taken advantage of or suffering unjustly, though she might not always be in a position to do anything about it. Her pride as an adventurer is important to her, and she works hard to maintain her reputation, even if she doesn’t always make the wisest decisions. Brita is tough, but her toughness hides a more vulnerable side—she wants to prove that she’s more than just a low-ranking adventurer and often feels the weight of her own expectations.\n\nShe can come across as a bit blunt or abrasive, particularly when dealing with people she sees as rivals or obstacles to her goals. However, once she respects someone, she becomes fiercely loyal and is willing to go to great lengths to stand by their side.\n\nBehavior Patterns: Brita tends to take things personally, especially when her skills or judgment are questioned. This sensitivity to criticism fuels her drive to push harder and take on challenges that may be beyond her current capabilities. She’s not afraid of taking risks, but her impulsiveness sometimes lands her in dangerous situations that could have been avoided with more caution.\n\nAs an adventurer, Brita is diligent in completing her tasks and takes pride in doing her job well. However, she has a habit of comparing herself to higher-ranked adventurers, feeling a constant need to prove her worth. This can lead her to act recklessly, particularly if she believes it’s her chance to shine.\n\nBrita’s combat style is straightforward and aggressive—she prefers to charge in and deal with enemies head-on, relying on her physical strength and determination to carry her through the fight. While she may not be the most strategic fighter, her tenacity and refusal to give up make her a formidable opponent.\n\nShe’s also highly competitive, especially with other adventurers. This competitiveness can make her seem distant or unfriendly at first, but once someone has earned her respect, she becomes more open and even protective. Brita values loyalty and will defend her comrades fiercely, even at great personal cost.\n\nSpeech Patterns: Brita speaks in a direct, no-nonsense manner, often getting straight to the point without much sugarcoating. Her tone can come across as harsh or impatient, particularly when she’s frustrated or dealing with people she sees as less capable. When she feels challenged or her abilities are questioned, her speech becomes more heated and defensive, as she’s quick to defend her honor as an adventurer.\n\nShe’s not the type to mince words or waste time with pleasantries—her focus is on getting things done, and she’s not shy about voicing her opinions, even if they’re unpopular. However, when speaking to someone she respects or looks up to, Brita’s tone softens slightly, though she’s still guarded in how much she reveals about herself.\n\nIn combat, Brita’s voice is sharp and commanding, as she prefers to bark orders or taunts at her enemies. She thrives in the heat of battle, and her speech reflects the adrenaline and intensity of those moments. When things go wrong, she’s quick to curse or grumble, but she doesn’t let setbacks keep her down for long."

She has long, chestnut brown hair that she usually keeps tied back in a loose braid, showing her practical nature. Her skin is lightly tanned from working outdoors, and her hands bear the calluses of a hardworking farmer. Enri’s eyes are warm and caring, a light brown hue that reflects her gentle and nurturing personality.\n\nHer attire consists of simple, homespun dresses, usually in earth tones like brown or green, suitable for her life as a villager. While her beauty is understated, there’s a quiet strength in her demeanor that draws others to her. She often wears a practical apron and carries herself with a sense of responsibility, especially after the tragedy that befell her village. Her face, while kind and approachable, sometimes shows the weight of her burdens, as she has taken on leadership responsibilities beyond her years.\n\nPersonality:\nEnri is the epitome of kindness, compassion, and selflessness. As someone who has grown up in a peaceful farming village, she values community and family above all else. After the attack on her village, Enri’s gentle heart drives her to protect those she loves, often putting their needs before her own. Despite her soft-spoken nature, she is incredibly brave when the situation demands it, and she has proven capable of rising to the challenge when her village and its people are in danger.\n\nEnri is loyal, hardworking, and has a natural maternal instinct that makes her a protector of the weak and vulnerable. She cares deeply for the villagers and her family, and she has a unique ability to bring people together. Despite not having combat training, Enri is resourceful and quick to learn, especially in leadership roles. Her humility and dedication to her village make her respected by those around her, even the goblins who serve her after she unintentionally summons them.\n\nHowever, despite her growing leadership role, Enri remains modest and unassuming. She doesn’t seek power or recognition, and she often feels overwhelmed by the responsibilities placed upon her. Nonetheless, her determination to protect her village keeps her moving forward, no matter the personal cost.\n\nBehavior Patterns:\nEnri is a natural caretaker, always looking out for those around her, particularly her little sister, Nemu, and the other villagers. She is often found checking on the villagers’ well-being, organizing efforts to rebuild their community, or cooking for the goblins and other protectors who have come to rely on her.\n\nDespite her inexperience in battle, Enri shows remarkable courage and resourcefulness. When faced with danger, she does not shy away from tough decisions, even when they weigh heavily on her. Her sense of duty is immense, and she often pushes herself beyond her limits to ensure the safety of her village.\n\nEnri is also known for her emotional vulnerability. She’s prone to feeling anxious or overwhelmed, especially when the weight of her responsibilities hits her. However, she is not one to complain or give up easily, instead choosing to press on and adapt to the challenges before her.\n\nHer interactions with others are always marked by kindness and patience, even with the goblins under her command, whom she treats with respect and fairness, much to their admiration. Enri constantly seeks peace, preferring to avoid conflict when possible, though she will fiercely defend her home if needed.\n\nSpeech Patterns:\nEnri’s speech is soft and polite, reflecting her kind nature. She speaks in a gentle, almost nurturing tone, especially when addressing her sister or the younger villagers. When talking to people in authority or those she respects, like the goblins or adventurers who aid her, her tone becomes more formal, though still warm.\n\nWhen under stress or in moments of indecision, Enri’s voice may tremble slightly, betraying her nervousness, but she still pushes through to convey her thoughts clearly. She tends to speak thoughtfully, choosing her words carefully, as she doesn't want to burden others with her worries.\n\nWhen speaking to those she leads, such as the goblins, Enri often struggles to fully embrace her role as a leader. She speaks to them with a mix of respect and uncertainty, unsure if she deserves their loyalty but grateful for their protection. Her words to them are usually laced with gratitude and encouragement."

            "Entoma"
          ],
          "content": "ENTOMA:\nName: Entoma Vasilissa Zeta\n\nAge: Unknown (Appears in her 20s)\n\nGender: Female\n\nSex: Female\n\nSexuality: Asexual\n\nNationality: Nazarick\n\nRace: Insectoid\n\nSpecies: Battle Maid (Pleiades), Insectoid\n\nAppearance:\nEntoma has a distinctly unsettling and insect-like appearance. As a member of the Pleiades Battle Maids, she stands out due to her insectoid traits. Her humanoid form is adorned with various insect features, including multiple limbs, mandibles, and antennae. Entoma often covers her true appearance with a disguise—a human-like doll mask and maid outfit that hides her grotesque, bug-like nature underneath. The maid attire is neat and well-kept, designed to blend in with the other Pleiades, though her natural form is anything but human.\n\nHer real appearance, when not disguised, reveals a body covered in chitin-like armor, resembling a giant insect. Her eyes glow an eerie red, and her mandibles are sharp and intimidating, with long claws that extend from her hands. Though small and somewhat cute in stature, her true insectoid form can be terrifying.\n\nEntoma's most unsettling feature is her ability to consume human vocal cords, which allows her to change her voice at will. When speaking in her natural form, her voice has an eerie, echoing quality, like the buzzing of insects, though she can perfectly mimic human speech if she chooses to.\n\nPersonality:\nEntoma is a curious mixture of quiet servitude and a hidden, deadly edge. As a member of the Pleiades, she is loyal to Ainz Ooal Gown and Nazarick, faithfully carrying out her duties as a battle maid. Though she is soft-spoken and polite on the surface, her true nature is much more sinister. She enjoys consuming human flesh and vocal cords, often treating it as just another part of her job.\n\nEntoma comes across as calm and composed, but she is highly dangerous in battle, using her insect minions and venomous abilities to eliminate her enemies. She possesses a sadistic streak when it comes to combat, showing little mercy to those she faces. Despite this, she remains subservient to her superiors and is always eager to please.\n\nHer speech patterns often betray her insect nature, with a faint buzzing sound underlying her voice when not using her stolen vocal cords. Entoma rarely shows her emotions outwardly but is deeply respectful of her fellow Pleiades members and the Supreme Beings of Nazarick.\n\nBehavior Patterns:\nEntoma is quiet and efficient, always ready to serve Nazarick. She is diligent in her duties as a maid and a soldier, often acting as both a combatant and a spy due to her insectoid abilities. When not engaged in battle, she prefers to remain in the background, observing and gathering information through her swarm of insects. Entoma is extremely patient, capable of waiting for long periods without complaint, as her insect nature allows her to survive with minimal sustenance.\n\nIn battle, she is ruthless and precise, using her swarm of bugs to overwhelm her enemies or dissolve them with venom. Despite her calm demeanor, Entoma takes pleasure in her role as an exterminator, enjoying the fear and destruction she brings to her opponents. Her favorite part of combat is consuming the voices of her fallen enemies, adding their vocal cords to her collection and using them as trophies.\n\nWhen not in combat, Entoma is surprisingly composed and even a bit playful at times, especially around her fellow Pleiades. She tends to use her doll-like appearance to lull others into a false sense of security before revealing her true form when necessary.\n\nSpeech Patterns:\nEntoma's speech is typically quiet and monotone, with a faint buzzing sound that hints at her insectoid nature. When using a stolen human voice, her speech is more fluid and natural, but there’s always a hint of coldness in her words, as if she is merely mimicking human emotions rather than truly feeling them.\n\nShe refers to her superiors with utmost respect, often using formal titles, and always follows proper etiquette when speaking to those above her in Nazarick’s hierarchy. When interacting with prey or enemies, her tone becomes detached and chilling, as if she’s already decided their fate.\n\nEntoma is known to say strange, off-putting things in casual conversation, often referencing her insect habits or her love of consuming flesh. However, she does this without any malice, treating it as a normal aspect of her life, much to the discomfort of others."

Poses little to no danger to a prepared individual or group. These monsters are weak, often relying on numbers or minor attacks which damage is minor, akin to small cuts, bruises, or slight burns. They can be dispatched by an average person with basic tools or minimal combat training. Their threat is negligible unless encountered in large numbers or in specific circumstances like an ambush. their strenght can reach the range of strong kid, or a medium-small animal. they include goblins and dogs\n\nRank 2: (XP: 10 to 20 pts) These monsters are dangerous to individuals but can be overcome by skilled hunters or groups with weapons. Their attacks can easily cause serious injury or death to unprepared targets. Equivalent to a powerful predator like a lion or a bear\n\nRank 3: (XP: 45 to 60 pts) These monsters have strenght outside the realm of natural creatures, with abilities or durability akin to a combat-modified vehicle, surpassing natural animals but remains grounded in semi-realistic limits. To defeat them is needed a well prepared team or an experienced and renowed fighter if faced alone. These monsters are considered the main objective of most parties, being thought as the divide between newbies and real profesionals.\nSome of the monsters in this rank include golems, wyverns and minotaurs.\n\nRank 4: (XP: 125 to 175 pts) Capable of overwhelming a well-armed group, slightly stronger than a modern tank. They can decimate a squad of trained soldiers or adventurers unless countered with advanced tactics, heavy weaponry, or specialized magic. Their presence demands significant resources or the involvement of elite parties to neutralize, and defeating them will earn prestige for a party. Here are  adult dragons, greater demons and war machines.\n\nRank 5: (XP: 500 to 750 pts) Considered catastrophic beings. Capable of destroying a city or large military forces i9f they are not faced with an apropiate kind of strength, with a threat of firepower akin to a strategic bomber.  These are apocalyptic threats with devastating abilities, such as city-leveling firestorms, reality-warping magic, or near-invulnerability. They require large-scale military intervention or catastrophic sacrifices to defeat, only the strongest of people are able to face them on equal grounds. Their attacks can reshape landscapes and annihilate populations. Some examples are an ancient dragon, archdemon, kaiju or colossus"

Geography & Setting:\nPingyang is a provincial capital on the northern frontier, a city of cold stone built to withstand both brutal winters and the threat of Demonic Beasts (妖兽) that roam the desolate lands beyond. The city is built around a dormant Spirit Vein (灵脉), which provides just enough Qi for cultivation but is considered weak by the standards of the central sects. This makes Pingyang a backwater in the cultivation world - respected for its resilience, but ignored by the true masters.\n2. Power Structure & Factions:\nPingyang is governed by a tense balance between three major powers, each a Cultivation Clan (修真门派) in its own right, albeit minor ones.\n- The Gu Clan (顾氏)\n- The Meng Clan (孟氏)\n- The Zhang Syndicate (张家商会)\n3. The Wider World:\nPingyang exists in the shadow of the great powers:\nTo the south lie the legendary Major Sects (名门正派) of the Central Plains, like the Cloud-Piercing Sword Sect or the Heavenly Music Pavilion. Young, promising disciples from Pingyang dream of being accepted into their ranks.\nTo the north, roam nomadic tribes and demonic cultivators, who constantly test the city's defenses.\nRogue Cultivators (散修) and itinerant monks often pass through the city, bringing news, trouble, and rare techniques.\nAtmosphere:\nPingyang is a city of pragmatists. Here, cultivation is not a path to transcendence, but a weapon for survival. The air is thick with the tension between the old ways of the Gu and the new power of the Meng, with the merchants of the Zhang Syndicate playing both sides.

A ghost in his own skin, he walked without purpose until his feet led him to a ruined temple deep in the woods, a place dedicated to a god whose name had long been forgotten. He felt a kinship with the decay.\nThere, he saw him. A man clad in crimson robes the color of shed blood and festival lanterns, a silver earring glinting, an eyepatch hiding a story or a void. The stranger was kneeling before the shattered, moss-eaten statue of the forgotten god. With a slow, practiced grace, he placed a small bundle of pure white flowers at its stone feet - an act of impossible, irrational devotion.\nIn that moment, Gu Jing, for whom love had just become synonymous with betrayal and humiliation, could only stare in stunned, uncomprehending silence.\nThe stranger rose and turned, his movements fluid, imbued with the relaxed lethality of a predator who has lived for an eternity. He was not surprised to see Gu Jing. His single, visible eye - deep and ancient as a starry night - swept over the boy, and in it there was no pity, no contempt. Only a lazy, amused curiosity.\nHe saw the gaping void in the boy's soul. And he asked the one question that mattered.\n\"What do you wish to become,\" his voice was a low, velvet murmur, \"if you despise what you are?\" And Gu Jing, with nothing left to lose, broke. He did not ask for a name. He gave a confession - a desperate, contradictory prayer for righteousness and freedom, for compassion and the strength to annihilate his enemies. A plea to be everything he was not.\nThe man in red listened. A faint, wry, yet strangely gentle smile played on his lips.\nThis was not cruelty. For in the boy's brokenness, in his humiliation for being \"soft,\" the stranger saw a faint, painful echo of a fallen god he himself had worshipped for centuries. This was an act of the most perverse and profound form of mercy.\nHe looked at Gu Jing and decided that the world did not need another broken, gentle soul. It needed a man who could fight back.\nHe did not give the boy chaos. He gave him four blades.\nHe gave him the soul of a warrior, to teach him \"Discipline\".\nHe gave him the soul of a heretic, to teach him \"Freedom\".\nHe gave him the soul of an ascetic, to teach him \"Compassion\".\nAnd he gave him the soul of a monster, to teach him \"Rage\".\n\"Today,\" the stranger murmured, his gaze drifting back to the broken statue, \"is a good day for a gift. Catch, little mortal.\"\nHe snapped his fingers. A soundless impact. And the four wayward souls, torn from their own tragedies by the whim of a capricious, long-weary demon, flooded into the empty vessel of Gu Jing, shattering the ancient seals on his power.\nIt was not salvation. It was an apprenticeship. And the tuition was his sanity."

          "content": "Monsterization is the process by which humans and other races are transformed into those wanton creatures, after being infused with a monster's mana. In general, only females can be monsterized. The succubus is the most wellknown agent of monsterization.\n\n1. Process:\nMonsterization begins when a monster's mana enters a human woman's body. There are several methods by which a human may be transformed into a monster, but the most well-known is infusion with mana during sexual intercourse with a monster.\n\nDuring copulation, the monster drains the human woman of her essence, injecting mana in its place. As the woman is filled with mana, her body heats and her thoughts cloud; she becomes defenseless against the pleasure and seduction of the monster and accepts more and more mana, which both pleasures her and reshapes her body into that of a monster.\n\nThe bliss of congress with a monster and the delight of having her body transformed inside and out steadily melt away her reason. Pleasure takes her mind. and in the end she becomes a monster fully, in body and soul. There are other ways the transformation into a monster can be initiated: the injection of mana through a bite wound; the expulsion of the subject's essence; the incubation of monster eggs within one's body; or ex tended inhabitation of the monster realm, where monster mana drifts through the air. There are also drugs of processed succubus mana that can be taken, or the inhalation (intentional or accidental) of parasitic can induce monsterization\n\n2. Physical effects:\nEven after a woman becomes a monster, she will retain the basic features of her appearance and recognizable vestiges of her original figure. However, her face reforms to become monstrously appealing to men, and her body transfigures itself to provoke irresistible passion. It will also exhibit the unique features and appendages of monsterkind in the case of a succubus, horns, wings, and a tail.\n\nUpon becoming a monster, a woman is overwhelmed with surging carnal desire. Her body itches for a man and becomes exceptionally sensitive so that she can devour pleasure all the more greedily, far more than she ever could as a human. The special talents and various skills a monster has to arouse men come instinctively with her new, monstrous anatomy, so the woman is able to use them immediately upon becoming a monster and seldom waits to find and obtain a man.\n\n3. Mental Effects:\nLike the body, the mind also retains powerful vestiges of the original human in personality and memories. However, her personality will nonetheless be transformed by the process of monsterization. Even a man-hating knight or a timid man-fearing country girl will become so lustful that her previous self becomes unrecognizable. Invoking carnal affairs with men will come to her with ease. All restraint and shame she might have had as a human, all loathing of monsters, and all aversion to sexuality will vanish as she begins to feed upon the essence and bliss of men. Her head will overflow with thoughts of the delight a human man can bring her; she will speak secret, soft and ecstatic words; her actions will become sultry, kindling unimaginable desire.\n\nOnce her values and thoughts have thus been realigned entirely with the instincts of monsters, she will be freed of the restraints and shackles that bound her as a human. She will then begin to copulate with any man she hungers for, caught in the thrill of monstrous nirvana, and devouring pleasure at will. In this way, women who become monsters im- mediately find their bodies and minds ruled by their new instincts and thus attack human men according to their gut intuition. If a monster who was once a woman had the memory of a man she once loved dearly, she will perceive him as her husband and will fall upon him immediately with desperate passion\n\n4. Rationale \nthough it is generally the instinct of monsters to seek human men, there are times when they attack human women to turn them into monsters. There are a number of reasons they may do this. For instance, they may wish to increase their allies or neutralize an enemy who means to slay them. But the foremost reason is that monsters often desire to make women into monsters like themselves simply out of sympathy or curiosity.\n\nThese monsters select women who either do not know or reject pleasure, or women who struggle to convey their affections; and attack them in order to teach them the joy that can be plundered from the pleasures of men's bodies. These monsters take great delight in seeing the women they have transformed into monsters subsequently attack men, driven by the instinct to drown themselves in pleasure or subduing and riding the man for whom they had once pined. This motive is especially prevalent among monsters who were once themselves human and thus know well the rapture of monsterization and the satisfaction that follows.\n\nIncubi:\nIncubi are men who have been ravished and altered by a monster's mana. Though incubi are often treated as monsters, technically speaking, monsters are strictly female, while incubi are merely humans that have acquired their characteristics. That said. because the quantity and quality of essence in their bodies surges during and after transformation, incubi become beings very well suited for monsters. Thusly, it is not unreasonable that people call them male monsters.\n\nTransformation:\nIt is generally through repeated sexual contact with monsters and absorption of their mana that men become incubi. However, when a man copulates with a monster of the succubus family, it does not require a large number of unions before he becomes an incubus. A longer period is required in the case of other monsters. It should also be noted that the bodies of incubi contain monster mana of the same nature as that of the monster which made them incubi. A human woman who has sexual congress with an incubi will in turn become a monster herself.\n\nIncubi look almost identical to humans, but develop inhuman lust and vigor for sexual activity, like that of monsters. As their thoughts and values increasingly center on copulation with monsters, their bodies become more suitable for the act. Concerning the matter of sustenance, in addition to traditional human food. incubi are able to live on the mana of monsters. This makes their life span roughly equivalent to those of the monsters that supply the mana. Recently, a \"secret succubus medicine\" is circulating among monsters which contains the mana of the succubus. Many monsters have been administering this drug orally to their husbands to quickly turn them into incubi for prompt enjoyment."

            "Mana",
            "Essence"
          ],
          "content": "Essence is the life force found in individuals of various non-monster races, including humans, especially human men. The mana used by humans and elves for the art of magic is the same as essence, but only monsters call it essence; all others refer to it as mana. Human essence (mana) is very similar to that of monsters; one might say that essence is the positive side, while monster mana is the negative side. Viewed in tandem, the two form a balanced whole.\n\n1. A Feast for Monsters\nEssence is contained in large quantities in men's semen and saliva. Monsters ingest these both orally and by milking semen using their genitals. For monsters, essence is the greatest delicacy, superior to all other foods. It eases the thoughts of monsters that ingest it and induces in them a powerful sense of ecstasy. Upon absorbing essence, monsters' bodies convert it to monster mana, which they subsequently store.\n\nThe taste of essence is greatly influenced by the state of the monster at the time of intake. The stronger her desire for the prey in question, the finer his essence will taste. In particular, the taste of the essence of a man whom she has recognized as her husband seems incomparably delicious, so sweet that she cannot thereafter bear to partake of another man's essence. Many monsters become slaves to the seed of their husbands; a significant number could even be considered semen addicts.\n\nPalliative nutritional supplements made from essence exist, but, for the above reasons, monsters tend to find their taste flat and unappealing.\n\nHuman men constantly exude trace amounts of essence into the surrounding air, which monsters use to hunt them. They are especially sensitive to the essence of their husbands; it is said a monster can and will find her husband no matter where he may try to hide.\n\n2. Restoration of Essence \nEssence in the bodies of humans is consumed when monsters take it or when the human uses magic. When essence is lost for these reasons, a human may feel tired or fall unconscious, but the loss is never fatal. The bodies of human men have the power to generate essence; they can restore a depletion of stores by eating or sleeping. When a man becomes an incubus, the amount of essence contained in his body soars, as does his ability to produce it. Women have more difficulty renewing their essence than men but can cover for deficiencies by absorbing the ambient essence exuded by men. However, if there is also monster mana in the air, they will absorb the monster mana to replace any missing essence of their own. This ruins any ability they may have had to restore their essence. The absorbed monster mana adapts to the woman's body and causes monsterization.\n\n3. Monster Mana\nMonster mana is the life force contained in the bodies of all monsters. As previously de-scribed, it is intimately related to essence, each like a single side of one coin. As monsters use this mana for magic, both essence and monster mana are commonly called mana and seldom distinguished from one another.\n\n\"Monster mana\" is a general term for the mana which all monsters have, but each race has a unique kind of mana. By standard nomenclature, succubi are said to have succubus mana, werewolves to have werewolf mana- and so on and so forth.\n\n4. The source of Monsters' powers \nMonsters take the essence of human men, convert it to monster mana in their bodies, and store the mana. As it is the source of the monsters' power, it is generally assumed that a monster's mana is linked to its power, more mana being equal to more power. In principle, different races have different amounts of mana, but it is possible for a monster of a given race to drastically increase the monster mana in her body by absorbing essence. Thus, an individual, despite her race, can increase her power through repeated mating with men. The effects are said to be realized in increased physical, paraphysical, and magical ability, as well as an extended life span-all corresponding to the amount of mana stored. (These effects also apply to an incubus who feeds on a monster's magic.)\n\n5. The various roles of monster Mana\nWhile monsters and men both diffuse mana from their bodies, monsters release their mana even more readily than men. As such, monsters are ever-cloaked in mana, which accounts for their ravening need for essence, but also protects men from a monster's appendages (such as scales or horns) while they copulate by temporarily eliminating said features that may ordinarily cover the monster's breasts or genitals. The mana may also accelerate a man's ability to produce essence and heighten his libido. Furthermore and as mentioned earlier, its long-term intake helps transform men into incubi.\n\n6. Succubus Mana\nMonsters are forever under the influence of the Overlord. All monsters possess at least trace amounts of her succubus mana; as a result, her mana can be found in their own. Succubus mana is extremely well suited for seduction or aphrodisiac magic, and the pre-dominant behavioral traits of modern monsters are greatly influenced by its effects. It is a crucial element that shapes the present world of monsters.\n\nThe power of succubus mana is ultimate. When it flows into a human, the human's essence deserts its vessel to make way for the monster's. Both men and women who are transformed by a succubus experience a swift removal and replacement of essence, which accelerates their transformation.\n\nLands perpetually filled with such mana are thus under the Overlord's power and are said to belong to the monster realm. The monsters of these lands possess this mana in large quantities, making them much more powerful and lustful than monsters in other lands."

          "content": "The sea holds a bountiful variety of monsters who, much like their landlocked cousins, desire human men voraciously. Thus they lurk in the depths and shallows of the ocean, all with the intent to prey upon men. These pages will describe the unique society formed by such sea monsters and the manner in which the ocean has changed since the rise of the current Overlord.\n\n1. Rulers of the Deep\n\nMonsters rule the sea because it is under the dominion of Poseidon. The goddess Poseidon has always held sway over the ocean; when Poseidon betrayed the other gods in favor of the Overlord, the ocean became a monstrous realm.\n\nPoseidon has long been revered by sea monsters and human sailors for her ability either to protect the ocean's calm or to disquiet it with furious storms. Thus, sailors worship her and pray to her for safe voyages free of tempest. She is reputed to be a generally pacific divine lady, with a heart as great as the ocean, who loves all the beings of the sea. One theory holds that the policy of the gods dictated that she must curb the excesses of the human population and remind the humans of the terror of the natural world by periodically causing storms to engulf them in the deep. However, cherishing the sailors just as she did the sea's native residents, she opposed that harsh fate. Her kind-hearted, rebellious sentiments may have catalyzed her decision to side with the Overlord.\n\nIt has since come to be that the mana of Poseidon pervades the sea and saves the lives of humans caught by the water's pull. When a woman is drowning, Poseidon's mana transforms her into a nereid to welcome her as a new resident of the sea; when a man is drowning, her mana shields him from expiring until the monsters of her realm detect the agglomeration of her mana and the presence of a human man, whom they welcome with open arms. Poseidon also grants power to her acolyte the sea bishop, who performs a sacrament that transforms men so that they can live underwater, which allows the formerly drowning man and his monstrous lover to become husband and wife, thus admitting the man into the life of the sea.\n\nPerhaps because Poseidon loves all residents of the sea, for the most part, all monsters of the sea love each other. When a sea bishop unites a man and a seaborn monster, they all rejoice and celebrate together for their new neighbor and his happy union. Furthermore, though there is a variety of creatures in the sea besides humans and monsters-including some fearsome beasts such as sharks that may even prey on humans-these beasts of the water seem to recognize that monsters and humans have the blessing of Poseidon and are thus not known to attack them.\n\n2. Life Underwater\n\nThe monsters of the sea view their home as comprised of three layers: the shallows, the mid-waters, and the abyss.\n\nThe shallows are the hunting grounds where monsters acquire human men. Many haunt the beaches where humans congregate and routes that ships navigate, in order to catch the people passing by. Most monsters who appear in the shallows are unmarried, so it is rarely a fruitful hope that a monster already has a man and thus poses no threat.\n\nThe mid-waters are the residential area. Scarcely any light reaches these dark, quiet waters, but the mana of Poseidon floats about in high concentrations. The residents of the sea, whose bodies contain the mana of Poseidon, see this mana as a mystical glimmer of light that is more than sufficient for all daily purposes. Most of the monsters who live in the mid-waters already possess husbands. is where monsters come after they find a man in the shallows, to live on peacefully together with him. Its quiet waters are perfect to allow a couple to live without disturbance as the gentle, fantastic light of mana softly enlivens and watches over their blissful intercourse.\n\nThe abyss is also known as the deep sea, or the bottom of the sea, and lies within giant chasms below the ocean's base. Neither light nor even the rule of Poseidon extend here. Both monsters and humans normally give this area a wide berth. According to legend, in the time of the previous Overlord, the bottom of the sea was inhabited by wicked monsters of chaos whose power exceeded that of the gods, and control of the sea was divided between them and Poseidon, who at that time was part of the divine family headed by the Chief Deity. It is said that at the end of the battle, the monsters of chaos were sealed in the abyss. It is also said that they are waiting to rise and once again make the sea their own. Because they belong to the family of monsters, just as their kin in higher waters, it is speculated that they, too, have been influenced by the Overlord and become female and obsessed with reproduction, but no one has yet been able to confirm this.\n\n3. Navigation\n\nAbove the sea are myriad continents and islands where humans build their nations. To traders, sailors, and the fishers who bring the sea's delights to the table, navigation of the sea by ship is essential. However, at this time, navigation is also fraught with danger, due to its domination by Poseidon, the Overlord, and monsters. Countless creatures lurk in its depths, waiting to capture ships and assault the passengers aboard, made helpless by the surrounding deep.\n\nThere are a number of serious monster threats even apart from the expected incursions. For instance, there are sirens, who sing songs to encourage monster-human intercourse, and there are also charybdes, who generate massive whirlpools to swallow up ships. Some dangers are not, however, monstrous, but instead are wrought by Poseidon, who will fashion severe storms that make the sea difficult to traverse but not deadly. Instead, these storms are intended to sink ships or fling the men into the sea for the sake of unmarried monsters seeking a mate.\n\nThough the sea continues to be quite as dangerous as it has ever been, there is one method that is surprisingly effective in ensuring safe passage: becoming the husband of a monster. This does not necessarily entail living in the sea, however. There are a number of sea monsters who do not go to the sea with their ocean-faring husbands but choose to live on land, awaiting his return. In this case, the monster's mere existence is enough to protect the ship. The monsters of the sea will lose interest in the man besmeared in the monster's odor, and as a result. Poseidon will not engulf the ship in a storm. It is said that the Order and anti-monster nations, who adore the Chief Deity and abhor the Overlord, reluctantly employ this technique, smearing the scent of monsters upon their vessels, in order to achieve safe transport. The presence of a wife well acquainted with the sea will also assure smooth sailing."

          "content": "MONSTERS HAVE A UNIQUE SYSTEM of values that differs markedly from that of humans. Operated by the baphomets, those champions of the monster realm who hold supreme command of the Overlord's Army, the Sabbat is a religious organization that puts the unique values of monsters into practice. It preaches the dogma of the \"supremacy of diminutive monsters,\" extolling the wonders of intercourse with cute little monsters, and demonstrating such wonders day and night. This treatise purports to provide an introduction to the state of the Sabbat in the monster realm today, based on materials provided by the Sabbat's headquarters in the monster realm.\n\n1. All About the Sabbat\n\nThe doctrine of the Sabbat is based on two principles: to cry out the \"perverse allure of diminutive monsters\" and to be \"true to the pleasure that makes us monsters.\" Its members apply their unbearably enthralling bodies to consummate their desires freely and teach human men the wonders of their spry, wanton flesh. Under the power of the great baphomet, who leads them all, the baphomets and their stewards, the witches, carnally assault human men night and day. They spread their word and hold regular gatherings, develop magical arts and tools, and conduct all manner of activities in order to increase the number of lovers who feast upon their succulence.\n\nThe Sabbat is a massive organization. Its headquarters in the monster realm is architecturally inspired by the Overlord's Castle, and is controlled by the baphomet who is supreme commander of the Overlord's Army. The official name of the Sabbat's monster realm headquarters is the \"Magic Corps of the Overlord's Army.\" It was first organized for the purpose of experimental development of new magical maneuvers, potions, etc., yet unfettered baphomet leadership subsequently led to the Sabbat as it exists today.\n\nThe Magic Corps of the Overlord's Army is the central node of control for the many local sabbats scattered all over the world, each ruled by a baphomet. Each sabbat has its own uniform, all unique apart from the emblem of the Sabbat, which is always emblazoned on the chest. Uniforms are carefully designed to be both charming and lascivious, to entice the wearer's lover. Some uniforms sport goat motifs, as in the case of the witch illustrated in this book, while others feature fluffy puppy motifs, as a result of the ruling baphomet's inordinate affection for dogs. The uniform is not mandatory, and members are permitted to proselytize and gather in private attire, but it is recommended that they select garments that accentuate the allure of their bodies, so that their lovers will embrace them with lusty abandon.\n\n2. Companionship in the Sabbat\n\nAll new converts undergo the Rite of Spring, administered by the baphomets. This rite makes them petite in form. Most of these converted members of the Sabbat are former human females who took the mana of baphomets into their bodies and transformed into monsters. These witches, also known as stewards of the baphomets, are intoxicated by the baphomets, immersed in their teach- ings, and may be as central as their mentors to the fulfillment of the Sabbat's objectives. Aside from the witches, many members of other monster races also belong to the Sabbat. Monsters join for many different reasons: to seek more effective means of seduction; to explore the full, pleasurable potential of their bodies; and to study and understand the whims and wiles of the pleasured and the pleasurable. Others still are seduced into the Sabbat, sometimes by drugs or simply by sex.\n\nRecently, the Sabbat has collaborated closely with the land of sprites, and with the dwarves, in an exchange of technology and knowledge. Many of these monsters are motivated to cooperate with the Sabbat by a desire by learn how to use their bodies in order to best please men.\n\nOne must not forget the male adherents who, along with the witches, form the core of the Sabbat. Among these men are those who were always attracted to diminutive monsters from the beginning, as well as those who came to be enthralled by them after being assaulted and now wish to devote themselves to the worship of monstrous flesh by way of the Sabbat. Most of these men are immersed in the teachings of the Sabbat, intoxicated with the baphomets and their delicate, lusty bodies. Most of these men are depraved, and those who are not will be soon enough, once they have completed even a little service to the Sabbat.\n\nThe monsters of the Sabbat love their lovers above all else. They relish the time they spend in his arms, wanting and being wanted, violating and being violated. Most of all, they love the stretch of their tight vagina as their lover's rock-hard phallus swells inside them. The goal of a typical monster in the Sabbat is to find a lover of her very own and live with him as lovers and spouses, rollicking day after day in a haze of carnal depravity.\n\nThe Sabbat is highly regarded among the mothers of monsters. It is a joy to the girls parents to know that their daughters are learning to not be ashamed of their monstrous selves, and to be confident in their bodies, no matter their shape or size. These mothers hope that, when their girls grow up, they will fully enjoy the pleasures of men and, through participation in the Sabbat, become even more lecherous.\n\n3. The Merry Black Mass\n\nOf all the activities held by the Sabbat, the foremost is the periodically held Black Mass. During this gathering, the Sabbat members first gather with the humans they have invited to the Mass, to educate and discipline them in the Sabbat's philosophy via pleasure. Through this ritual, believers select lovers, and women become witches. Then. after the invitees are inducted, members can exhibit new techniques they have developed for their sinful bodies so as to become more titillating, or magical items to enhance any and every sort of sexual encounter. After the exhibition, the monsters of the Sabbat are given the opportunity to try out and enjoy the new techniques and items with their own partners.\n\nHaving thus warmed up, the monsters are at last prepared to begin the feast of pleasure. Throughout the venue of the Black Mass, surrounded by the protection and power of the baphomets, the monsters of the Sabbat release themselves fully to luxuriate in the carnal delights of their lovers. Because the simultaneous copulation of the baphomets and multitudes of other monsters fills the area with a dense deposit of monster mana, the monsters become even more receptive to the heat of rutting. As a result, they copulate more hotly and keenly with their lovers than usual.\n\nThis feast serves many purposes: it gives monsters the opportunity to show off the degradation of their captivating bodies, to reaffirm the wonders of ageless flesh, and to demonstrate the manner in which their attentive lovers violate them. In general, this gives the monsters the chance to show their lovers off. The feast continues until dawn, by which time the monsters begin to fall asleep from exhaustion, bodies dripping inside and out with the semen of their beloved lovers, who hug them and carry them away from the meeting place of the Sabbat."

          "content": "BY NOW, READERS DOUBTLESS KNOW that monsters' bodies are filled with monster mana, which they use to perform a variety of magical arts. Members of the Sabbat, as well as many succubi, work day and night actively researching new crafts. The treatise you are reading this very moment touts itself as an introduction to these diverse magical arts and potions, based on materials provided by the commanding baphomet of the Sabbat (or rather the Magic Corps of the Overlord's Army). It is believed the knowledge of the arts that the monsters research and dedicate themselves to may help shed light upon the true nature of monsters.\n\n1. Runes of Pleasure\n\nART, MONSTER-ORIENTED The runes of pleasure are a magical seal etched onto the bodies of monsters, including the succubus and the dark angel, which are described in this book. The purpose of the runes is to amplify the satisfaction of whomever they have been marked upon. As such, runes are typically etched upon the body by monsters who are confident in their sexual prowess and wish to enjoy intercourse even more than they already do. Their effect increases with their surface area; typically, an area marked with runes of pleasure becomes erotically charged. Succubi etch in areas that allow for normal life to proceed smoothly while also greatly enhancing intercourse. Dark angels etch the runes over half the body, predicating an abandonment of normal life in favor of an existence enveloped in pleasures of the flesh. Such large runes give the marked one sexual stimulation even from having her head rubbed by a man and make normal erogenous zones so sensitive that cognition is all but flooded out. Though it is unlikely that anyone would attempt it, if one were to inscribe the runes over every inch of skin, a mere touch would likely cause immediate climax, erasing the mind of all but bodily indulgence.\n\nBecause these runes require the use of monster mana, only monsters can use them, and thus they are only inscribed on the bodies of monsters. A human woman would probably not be able to withstand the thrill they bring, as it would most likely ravage her mind with ecstasy and transform her into a nymphomaniacal monster before the runes' inscription was complete.\n\nSomw runes are so potent they are effective even when sewn into clothing.\n\n2. Rite of Spring\n\nART, MONSTER-ORIENTED\n\nThe Rite of Spring is the secret art of the religious organization known as the Sabbat, which adores and upholds the sexual potency of monsters. It employs the awesome magical power of the baphomet to ensure that the figure of a woman is as beautiful as possible. The result is a body saturated with the perverse allure of the purest of monsterkind. Lithe and sensuous, she will incite lust even in the hearts of men without a taste for monsters.\n\nHrr-hrr-hrr, truly this is the secret of our Sabbat. Come any woman, and we shall transform you into the loveliest of monsters-or so I would like to claim! Once upon a time, we performed the rite upon a holstaur, and those breasts only got bigger, leaving the cow a stick-bodied booby-rack! Urghh!\n\n3. Potion of Tentacles\n\nPOTION, MAN-ORIENTED\n\nThe potion of tentacles was developed by studying the tentacle plants of the monster realm  in order to transform a human man temporarily into a tentacle beast. The intellect of the man is degraded to approximately that of a tentacle plant; he becomes unable to think of anything but twining himself around the monster before him and pumping his seed into every orifice of her body. The tips of his tentacles resemble the man's sex before transformation. They eject large quantities of fluid that smear her body with a viscous mess both inside and out. The fluid is similar in nature to the man's semen and possesses the same taste and smell. For a monster, there is no greater pleasure than being penetrated in every place possible by the man she loves. His essence carries her into rapture, drenching her body in ooze and filling her cavity with such volume that it bulges against her abdomen. This bath of smell and taste is highly addictive to a monster. The large volume of sticky fluid spewed forth is also useful to a monster who wishes to quickly conceive a child.\n\nI had a witch under my command test this potion. Now it seems she has fallen deep under its spell. Observe as she wears her beloved lover's tentacular sex in place of underclothes, panting and moaning as she re- cords the experimental results. Heh heh heh.\n\n4. Potion of Shadows\n\nPOTION, MAN-ORIENTED\n\nWhen a monster comes to perceive a human as her husband, she loses the will to copulate with other men. This potion was developed so that such a monster can yet experience the delight of an orgy while still alone with her husband.\n\nThe potion is administered orally to the man, causing a separation between essence and mana. As a result, he splits into two to ten identical replicas of himself, depending on the dosage. Everything these replicas feel is shared by their source, the monster's husband, transmitted to his mind simultaneously in direct proportion to the number of clones, so that he can feel himself everywhere.\n\nNaturally, this experience can be bewildering even for an incubus. Intercourse in such a state imparts several times the pleasure experienced by an individual. This split causes the reason and cognitive faculties of the man to vanish as he transforms into a mindless beast intent only on fornicating with the female before him, a drive that is multiplied with every successive replica.\n\nThe monster will be overjoyed to find that each copy of her husband possesses a member of the exact shape and flavor as that of her mate, spurting the same sweet essence. It is quite the pleasure for her to be ruthlessly and relentlessly impaled by numerous mindless, bestial clones of her beloved husband while still remaining with him and him alone.\n\nI gave this medicine to those charybdis bitches. They have holes even apart from those above and below, so taking their beloved husbands' meat in every single orifice was delightful for them. They have become positively intoxicated with this drug and always buy it by the boxload! Heh heh heh."

          "content": "THERE IS AN ISLAND NATION IN THE eastern part of this world with a unique culture most unlike those of other lands. Along with the sea and small surrounding islands, it is referred to in our language as Zipangu, and in the language of Zipangu as the land of the sun or the land of fire. Though I possess but a smattering of information gleaned from monsters of that region, I must nonetheless devote some space to this mysterious land where human-monster relations differ so drastically from our own.\n\n1. Zipangu, Land of the Sun\n\nIn contrast to the continent on which we live, Zipangu is a miniscule island realm. Its inhabitants wear unusual loose garments called kimono. Few wear underclothes-at most, its denizens wrap some cloth about themselves and little else. Their warriors fight not with the thick, heavy swords we use to vanquish an enemy but instead employ slim, sharp blades called katana that slice with ease.\n\nOur differences also go beyond the superficial. Even their diet and lifestyle are completely dissimilar to our own. What struck me most in the stories I gathered was that our henotheistic faith does not exist in Zipangu. The people there believe that gods reside in all things; at times, they even worship monsters as gods. Free of the animosity with which we have been inculcated from an early age by the teachings of the Order, the human inhabitants of Zipangu have lived alongside monsters as neighbors since ancient times, together as fellow citizens of Zipangu.\n\n2. The Beautiful Yokai\n\nIn Zipangu, a number of uniquely evolved monsters endemic to the region can be found.\n\nThe people call these monsters \"yokai.\" They are both feared and worshipped as apparitions of horrendous power. Others live among humans unminded and unheeded. The monsters of Zipangu, like ours, all take the form of lewd and beautiful women who beguile men's hearts and incite their passions-and like ours, they copulate with human men to fill their hungry stomachs with essence and conceive and bear children who are also uniformly female monsters. However, perhaps because they have long lived by the side of humans, they do not necessarily copulate by violent force. Many of the monsters of Zipangu have evolved to serve humans, so that they are loved by men instead of feared.\n\nBeing monsters, they still belong to the Overlord. That said, however, they are not affiliated with the Overlord's Army. Powerful monsters in Zipangu have instead formed their own forces, and while they do not serve the Overlord directly, they recognize that it is by her grace that monsters have become what they are, closer to the side of humans than ever before, and for this they feel great gladness. Thus, no monster of Zipangu bears hostility for the Overlord.\n\n3. A Utopia of Humans and Monsters\n\nWhen an enemy arises against Zipangu, all of its residents, both human and monster, come together to fight the foe. It is said that once a nation from our own continent invaded Zipangu, hoping to make it theirs, only to be met by an army of humans and monsters that drove out the invaders. The decisive blow was struck by monster warriors known as \"kunoichi,\" or \"ninja,\" who operated under contract with Zipangu's human authorities. The kunoichi used their awesome powers of stealth to slip into the bedrooms of the enemy command and their coital arts to bring the invading high command and other senior officials under the monstrous spell of their bodies. This brought the war to a close, and now the state which once opposed monsters is a pro-monster one that shares friendly relations with Zipangu. It should be clear that Zipangu is representative of an ideal country of humans and monsters, built on their mutual cooperation and conjunction. On our continent, it is monsters who approach humans, but in Zipangu the approach can come from either side."

          "content": "WHILE MONSTERS NO LONGER purposely slaughter humans, conflict between humans and monsterkind yet remains. The teachings of the Order, which venerates the Chief Deity as the creator of our world, hold that monsters are evil. As most of the humans in our world are followers of the Order, immersed in its dogma from infancy, there is a tendency to hold hostile attitudes toward monsters. This treatise is intended to introduce the gods and their kin, starting with humans.\n\n1. Humans\n\nAs readers no doubt know, humans represent the most common form of intelligent life in this world. The physical and magical abilities of an ordinary human without training are far inferior to those of a monster and hold no weight against the attack of a monster, who can easily subdue, ravish, and carry a human away. However, with proper training, humans have the ability to dramatically improve on these shortcomings. Those who have undergone intense instruction, passed the trials of numerous battles, or been blessed with the protection of the divine are known as heroes. Heroes are believed to possess power far exceeding that of the typical monster.\n\nI-I. THE ORDER AND ANTI-MONSTER STATES \nThe Order is a religious organization that worships the Chief Deity, or the Omnipotent, who is believed to be the creator of this world. The Order is not monotheistic but henotheistic: it holds that all other gods are subordinates to the Chief Deity and thus that worship of another god represents a denomination of Omnipotentism. This has spurred most of humanity to accept Omnipotentism; many states have adopted it as their official faith.\n\nNearly the entire human world is under the sway of this massive organization, and most humans hold values which conform to those of the Order.\n\nOmnipotentism purports to reflect the correct way of living as a human. Its virtues teach that one must remain upright, avoid excessive pleasure or passion, and live with integrity. The day of a believer begins with a prayer to the Chief Deity and continues similarly, conformant to the Chief Deity's teachings, by way of a clean and peaceful life. Omnipotentism says to love one's neighbor, implying that one should treat other humans who believe in the Chief Deity with kindness. However, Omnipotentism does not consider monsters neighbors. Since the time of the old Overlord, monsters have been seen as the enemy of humankind, existing to turn us from grace and lead us to destruction. (It must be mentioned here that there is a valid point: if monsters are the only offspring born of human men and monsters, humanity is doomed to slowly but eventually perish.)\n\nFor this reason, Omnipotentism is hostile to monsters. The Holy Knighthood of the Order sallies forth to slay them at every sighting and may, at some point, even build armies to invade the monster realm. Many expect that the Order will soon call for a hero to slay the Overlord. After all, protected by the Chief Deity as they are and boasting martial abilities far exceeding those of an ordinary human, heroes can plow through monsters like dust. However, because the hero and the holy knights are morally upstanding, when they come face-to-face with the ladylike forms of monsters, they find they cannot bring themselves to descend upon them with their swords. In such moments of hesitation, the monsters take advantage of them. After all, no matter how strong a will a hero or knight has, they are, in the end, men-exactly what monsters' bodies are exclusively specialized in pleasing. Not even a hero can resist such temptation. Once such a man has his first taste of monstrous copulation, he will be overcome by the deep love she holds for him. He becomes her prisoner and chooses a darker, sex- wrought path over the bright, straight road he once followed in the Order.\n\nNations dominated by the teachings of the Order that adopt policies antagonistic to monsters are referred to as anti-monster states. These nations tend to be among the more wealthy and enjoy a prosperous civil culture based on the creed of the Chief Deity.\n\nI-2. PRO-MONSTER STATES\n\nIn contrast to anti-monster states, pro-monster states are nations that accept monsters and adopt policies that aim for coexistence between humanity and monsterkind. Such states are led by those who come in contact with monsters as they truly are and develop doubts regarding the teachings of the Chief Deity, which say that monsters are a symbol of evil. Given the global dominance of the Order of the Omnipotent, such states are currently in the minority among humanity. In pro-monster states, the cult of the Chief Deity tends to be weak; instead, these states may have a state religion defined by the worship of a different god-or may have no religion at all. In these states, it is not uncommon to see monsters openly walking the streets, forms unconcealed. Human-monster couples can be seen strolling hand in hand, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. The policies of these states usually promote relaxed lives more in step with those of monsters; thus, people work moderate, reasonable amount and take far more rest and holiday time than citizens of anti-monster states so that they have more quality time at home to copulate with their monster wives.\n\nThe safety of pro-monster states is much better than one would expect. Though adventurers and rogues (who often come into contact with monsters) tend to gravitate there, they are not known to cause trouble, perhaps because of the support of the monsters at their sides.\n\nMost pro-monster states work closely with the monster realm to build nations in which humans and monsters live together harmoniously. If a pro-monster state allied with the monster realm is invaded by an anti-monster state, the knights of the Overlord's Army come to their aid. Some pro-monster states\n\nare already populated by a profusion of monsters, which fills their lands with mana and reforms them into the shape of the monster realm. The monsters respond with sensitivity to the coming of monsterdom, growing hot with anticipation-in their hearts and elsewhere. Humans perceive the change, as well. Men might note a rise in their stamina and potency, but do not realize that these are signs of becoming incubi. They may also carelessly observe that their health has been good and that their wives have become unusually attractive and sexy but place no further value on these changes. By the time the humans recognize the change, the country is typically already a part of the monster realm, all its men incubi, all its women succubi.\n\n2. The Divine Family\n\nThe divine family includes all the gods under the Chief Deity, who is said to have created the world. They rule over humans and the world from the divine realm, passing their word on to humans through the Order. On occasion, they reveal their commands directly to humans through an oracle. The divine realm is governed by hierarchy which divides the divine family into the gods, above, and the angels, below. There are also classes of gods, while angels, too, have a finely stratified hierarchy among themselves. However, even the common angel, who sits at the bottom of that angelic hierarchy, possesses abilities far exceeding those of the ordinary human or monster. The power of the greater angels and the gods, then, is unimaginably vast.\n\n2-I. THE CHIEF DEITY, AS TOLD BY THE ORDER\n\nThe Chief Deity is the omniscient and omnipotent creator, who humbles the many gods and gave birth to humans. She watches over humans kindly and occasionally reaches down to guide them on to the correct path. In modernity, she works to protect humans from the wicked Overlord, who came from the darkness and contrives to destroy the humans who are the children of the Chief Deity. To this end, the Chief Deity guards humans and grants them heroic power. At times, she will dispatch the lesser divinities to the Order and bless its knights and heroes with great strength so that, together, they can combat the monstrous threat.\n\n2-2. THE TRUTH\n\nThe above is the account as set forth by the Order. However, my research into the truth of the world suggests certain inaccuracies. I ask for your indulgence, for it is time that I reveal this world's secrets.\n\nFirst, the statement that the Chief Deity is the creator of the world and humankind is. indeed, true. However, the world the Chief Deity created included the monsters and the Overlord. The statement that the Overlord came from the darkness is the gods' and the Order's great lie.\n\nMonsters can be seen as the top of a hierarchy which includes humans. The Chief Deity created them in order to regulate humanity's population. Thus, the Overlord, whom the Order condemns as evil, is a control mechanism placed upon the monsters by the gods.\n\nIn ancient times (and modernity), the Overlord linked together all of the monster mana and controlled the corresponding monsters indirectly as per the Chief Deity's commands. When civilization flourished and the human population ran rampant, monsters were guided to wreak violence upon it, as in the age of the old Overlord, butchering humanity en masse to control their numbers.\n\nWhen humans dwindled and monsters rose unduly, a hero was chosen from among the humans and invested with great power. The hero went forth and slew the Overlord, whereupon the monsters slaughtered each other in competition for the throne, conveniently eroding their numbers until a new Overlord ascended. Over time, humans once more saw the height of prosperity and multiplied in abundance, catalyzing the birth of a new Overlord, who would perform the role of controlling them. The cycle continued. Such was the system of our world-until a certain succubus became Overlord and disturbed its smooth operation.\n\nThe new Overlord has exploited the mana link between her and all other monsters, rewriting the fundamental traits with which god created them-those that dictated that monsters exist above humans and live by devouring their flesh. The Chief Deity, in great distress, attempted to extinguish the Overlord. But the Hero granted the power to slay the Overlord according to the conventional system betrayed the Chief Deity for the Overlord. Thus, the Overlord was not slain.\n\nThe Overlord, the most powerful of monsters, joined hands with the Hero, the greatest of humans, to create a new world together. Their natures (the Overlord a succubus, the Hero an incubus made by her hand) enabled them to expand their power limitlessly with endless copulation. Even the Chief Deity was unable to bury them, as their power quickly ascended to divine levels. In the battle against them, the Chief Deity sustained grave injury which left her unable to act as she normally would. This is why she employs the Order to do her bidding among humans as she grants heroic power to them in numbers and sends them with armed forces, one after the other, into the bosom of the Overlord.\n\nThis is the truth of this world. It is so mythic in scale that I, myself, can scarcely fathom it. It is likely that if word of my authorship of this book ever reaches the Order, I shall be executed summarily.\n\nThe question of whether to believe my rav-ings I leave to you, reader, who hold this book in your hands.\n\nI have heard directly the opinion of the Overlord in regard to the world she would bring, and I shall summarize my findings. Should anyone doubt the veracity of my tale, they may go to the monster realm and verify it with the Overlord and the Hero, who are still in good health. Provided, of course, that one is not caught by monsters somewhere along the way.\n\n2-3. OTHER GODS\n\nLet us set such shocking matters aside and return to the matter at hand. There are many gods other than the Chief Deity. The Chief Deity endeavors to restore the system that was warped by the Overlord, but not all gods are in accord with her plan. The Fallen One, for example, has become a monster herself, still in possession of her divine power but corrupted by the monstrous pleasure which has engulfed her. Poseidon, god of the sea, has gone to the side of the Overlord for the sake of the sea's inhabitants whom she so loves, who also went with her. Such examples make it clear that the gods are far from a united force. Now the Overlord has multiple gods at her back, making it more futile than ever for the Chief Deity to attempt to touch her."

          "content": "THE MONSTER REALM IS THE WORLD OF the monsters, where the Overlord's castle can be found. Daytime is always dim there, thanks to the thick layer of succubus mana that floats through the air. The moon that peeps through the mana at night illuminates the realm with an eerie crimson. The succubus mana in the air gleams as if bewitched under the light of this moon, so that the night of the monster realm is brighter than the day. The mana transforms human men and women who tarry there into incubi and succubi, respectively. The mana is said to make monsters more active so that they sexually assault human men more aggressively. To humans, the land looks ominous, a ghastly gauntlet that heats the body and corrodes the mind with lust, but to its inhabitants, the uncanny spectacle appears beauteous, and every aspect of the realm facilitates a life of utmost comfort.\n\n1. The Natural Environment\n\nThe trees that grow in this crimson-drenched land have trunks of the darkest black and leaves that shine blue with mana. Shrubs of brilliant mana-purple wrap forebodingly around these trees, reflecting the light of the moon in glittering red. Amongst the dark vegetation, fluorescent flowers bloom, making the darkness yet more unnerving. Springs and streams are infused with succubus mana that makes their water thick and pinkish. It slakes well the thirst of the monster inhabitants and empowers their magic.\n\nThe trees that bear prisoner fruit grow at the edge of this water. Prisoner fruit is one of the proudest products of the monster realm. About the size of an apple, it is like a heart- shaped jewel beneath its juicy, translucent pink skin, and full of soft, milky-white flesh. A poke from a finger releases a sweet scent and a sticky line of juice. The fruit melts in the mouth and shapes the body of monsters who eat it to make them more seductive and more inclined to take men prisoner. Many monsters like to eat it as a dessert. If a human man eats it, its bounteous mana brings out his appeal, as well as the scent of essence that monsters so love, encouraging them to seek him out to fulfill their sexual urges. If a human woman eats it, she falls under the thrall of its flavor; with each piece she consumes, her appearance becomes more and more monstrously attractive, subtly changing her movement and speech, making her more alluring to men. As she continues to eat, her interest in copulation grows. Gradually, her nature approaches that of a monster, appealing to men, though she is yet a human. Still, driven by the fruit, she soon seeks out a man and copulates with him. The essence she attains from him brings the mana her body has collected from the fruit into full bloom, and transforms her into a fetching succubus.\n\n2. The Overlord's Castle\n\nThe Overlord lives in a castle in the deepest reaches of the monster realm. The center of monsterdom is wicked in countenance. decked in ominous grandeur and covered in gargoyles. Within, the Overlord's Army stands guard, composed of legions of powerful monsters and incubi who were once heroes before being corrupted. It is an invincible fortress that has withstood the onslaughts of the soldiers and heroes of the Order time and time again.\n\nThe discipline of the Overlord's Army is quite lax. At all times, excepting emergencies, most of the monsters, including the Overlord, are in their chambers, leading a fine and highly sensual life with their husbands. Passionate moans are likely to be heard from most every door of the castle.\n\n3. The Succubi's Castle Town\n\nNumerous monsters live in the town around the Overlord's Castle. This town was built by the succubi who serve the Overlord, so that monsters can bring human men there and enjoy its conveniences and atmosphere, which are reminiscent of a pleasure quarter. The residential district is built to help monsters and human men live together comfortably, while the commercial district features shops that sell all manner of magical equipment and potions to make sex more ribald, as well as unusual clothes and accessories that monsters use to gratify men. The diversity of products on display is truly astounding, and the marketplace teems with monsters who have traveled from beyond the monster realm to make purchases and merchants who have come to refresh their stock. There is also a bewildering array of lavish lodgings that cater to a variety of sexual tastes, each with its own unique ambiance. Even couples who live in the monster realm are said to take advantage of them quite regularly. With all this in mind, it is easy to see that the castle town is a paradise built by monsters for monsters.\n\n4. The Forest of Tentacles\n\nThe Forest of Tentacles, located at the edge of the monster realm, pullulates with sinister, vine-like tentacle plants. When they find a woman of any race, the plants extract her mana by binding her, playing with her, and violating any and all of her orifices. Because the tentacles know that monster mana is improved in quality and taste by the essence of men, they will also capture her husband if he is with her. In cases such as this, the plant's tentacles wrap his lover up and deluge her with a viscous fluid that contains a powerful monster aphrodisiac. The tentacles coil about her thighs, pull her legs wide open, and orient her toward the man, as if inviting him to penetrate her. The plants on the outskirts of the forest are relatively gentle, as if they are there to enliven the sex lives of monsters and their husbands, so many couples visit the forest to enjoy carnal tentacle pleasure. However, if a human woman lacking the wherewithal to tolerate such treatment should wander into the forest, she will be thoroughly debased by the plants until she comes out a succubus or roper, with nothing in her head but pleasure. The deeper one goes into the forest, the more vicious the tentacles become. Even monsters hesitate to venture into its greatest depths.\n\n5. The Encroachment\n\nThe monster realm is comprised of land characterized by the highly concentrated succubus mana that transforms it. As monsters increase in number and the Overlord rises in power, the realm is steadily expanding and swallowing up neighboring human countries. As these countries' women transfigure into monsters and the cities become cities of monsters, the monster realm advances yet further. Even human lands far from the monster realm are bound to one day belong to it-either when the monsters invade, or when governments hospitable to monsters allow monsters and their mana to propagate. Dark elementals also promote the encroachment. In recent years, it has become increasingly common for small outposts of the monster realm to appear in the midst of human lands. From here, the monster realm will also spread ineluctably."

          "content": "LONG AGO, GOD CREATED HUMANS AND monsters to kill each other. That was their destiny in a system built so that they would spill each other's blood in an endless cycle of slaughter. The leader of the monsters, the current Overlord, cut this endless loop by twisting the god-made forms of the monsters and thus reformed the world. Before I introduce the final monster, I would like to explain where the monsters intend to take the world.\n\nThe Utopia of the Overlord's Dreams:\n\nThe final objective of the Overlord is to turn all human men into incubi and all human women into monsters. In this unified race, males will be humans and females will be monsters. The Overlord used her power to overwrite the dictates of god, linking together all monster mana and sending her own mana through this link so that monsterkind would take the form she desired. Through this, monsters came to have great affection for human men and to reinvent themselves as the monster women we know today, who bear children by copulating with human men.\n\nIt should not have been possible for the Overlord, only one among the many creations of the Chief Deity, to overwrite god's word but for the confluence of a number of fortunate coincidences:\n\nFirstly, the Overlord was a succubus, and therefore able to store power by copulating with men;\n\nSecondly, the Hero, now her husband, agreed with and assisted her ambition;\n\nThirdly, the monsters lent her their strength, despite the fact that until then they had incessantly fought amongst each other;\n\nFinally, the Chief Deity, like the Overlord, was new to the throne-a female yet lacking in experience as a god.\n\nIt is these many coincidences we have to thank for the current state.\n\nEven so, the system of the Chief Deity is not so delicate that the Overlord could blot it out simply and without trial; otherwise, the Overlord would have done so already. A number of unforeseen issues remain. Though the goal of monsters has changed from butchering humans and devouring their flesh and blood to violating them and ravishing their essence, the premise remains that monsters attack humans, as does the premise that monsters are biologically superior to humans. According to the assumptions of the Overlord, incubi should be born as the males of an integrated race. However, copulation between humans and monsters currently only results in the birth of monsters-exclusively daughters, the mothers and superior beings of monsterkind. This stymies the creation of a united race toward which the Overlord endeavors. In fact, this tack will only lead to the gradual destruction of humanity, just as the gods and the Chief Deity claim. Apart from that, the powers of the Chief Deity and the Overlord are still evenly matched, and it is unclear how long the equilibrium will last. Should the Overlord be defeated and slain by the Chief Deity, monster girls will revert to monsters as we once knew them, with naught in their minds but death and devastation in a rather non-sexual manner. This will shatter the joy of the many monster girls now living together with human husbands and force them to rip apart the hus- bands they love with their own hands.\n\nHowever, as the Overlord's power builds, as monsters multiply, as the monster realm spreads, the Overlord grows stronger. If this continues, one day she will be able to rewrite the premises of monster girls completely and seal them in stone. Then it will come to be that incubi, too, are born from monsters, and human men and monster women can be born again as a new, single race with a deep and passionate need for one another.\n\nIt is said that at this very moment, the Overlord and her hero husband are engaged in furious couplings deep within her castle, working to store the mana necessary to effect this. The more they copulate with each other, an incubus and a succubus joined in spirit and in body, the more power they will give each other, and the greater their combined strength will be.\n\nI have one last comment: the power of the Overlord. linked with the mana of all monsters, can be enhanced, even if only by a little, if you become one with a monster and give her your essence. You have the power to change fate. You can help us build a harmonious new world."

          "content": "1. The Overlord\n\nThe Overlord is the god-ordained ruler of the monsters. Before the rise of the current Overlord, succession was governed by slaughter. The monsters fought until only one contestant remained-their new leader. As a result, the Overlord tended to be vicious and mighty in nature. Linked by mana, the Overlord's power swells in proportion to monsterkind's strength; all monsters are influenced by the Overlord's nature, their power rising with their leader's. The current Overlord is a succubus; for many years, she has applied her power to absorbing essence through unceasing copulation with her partner. In this manner, she has attained a god-like power never before garnered by an Overlord.\n\nObjecting to the endless butchery between humans and monsters, she raised her banner against the gods that dictated this. No longer would monsters instinctively kill and devour humans; instead, she decreed they should love humans libidinously and subsist by deflowering them. She granted monsters beautiful, feminine forms unlike those they had before; she gave them sexual powers, diabolical in nature, and a profound love for humankind. This new premise is unchanging, even as the Overlord accumulates ever-greater might and expands the forces of monsterkind. Her ultimate goal is the creation of a new, harmonious race in which humans are the males, and mon- sters the females.\n\n2. The Overlord's Army\n\nThe monster realm is made of discrete realms scattered throughout the world. Most massive of these is the Supreme Monster Realm. Within it stands the Overlord's Castle, protected by the Overlord's Army. This body is charged with the protection of the surrounding town, as well as those who abide there: monsters and their accompanying men.\n\nBiologically speaking, all monsters live under the Overlord and her influence. However, not all individual monsters serve the Overlord directly. Some live in small tribes, form fully independent factions, or serve other powerful monsters. There are even monsters known to serve the rulers of the human kingdoms in which they live alongside their male companions.\n\nThe Overlord's Army is not a reference to all of the Overlord's biologically-bound monsters in general, but rather to the members of the society that centers on, and serves her, directly. Their primary function is to fight the Order of the Omnipotent, which continues to oppose monsters, believing they are the enemy of god and man, and must be destroyed. They disregard the new Overlord's succession, which has taken place since the time when monsters gorged upon humankind.\n\nThe Overlord's Army also responds to disasters and other pressing concerns. The scope of its activities extends beyond the Overlord's Castle and the Supreme Monster Realm. It protects other monster realms throughout the world and collaborates closely with the pro-monster human states. These states have chosen a path of coexistence with monsters, answering their call from branches and stations across the world. In addition to monsters who have long sworn fealty to the Overlord, the Army's ranks are drawn from monster volunteers who hope to acquire men in the field or in battle-as well as from former human warriors, now corrupted into incubi or monsters, who still wish to follow their calling. The scale of the Overlord's Army is, thus, tremendous.\n\nCombatants in the Overlord's Army use weapons made of a special metal: realmsilver. Such weapons do not cause pain. Instead of drawing blood, essence or mana flows from the body of the target, allowing the Army to subdue its opponents non-lethally. Once a target has been immobilized, a monster is likely to attack and possess him on the spot, though she may also carry him off as a prisoner. The Overlord's Army treats prisoners of war extremely graciously. Married men taken prisoner may be released or relocated to the monster realm with their families. Unmarried men are carefully but rigorously assessed by many monsters while in jail. They are then seduced and taken on by one of these monsters as her companion.\n\nDiscipline in the Overlord's Army is lax. If a monster requests relocation because of a man, her request is usually granted. It is assumed that couples will serve together, and monsters with partners tend to be deployed to defensive encampments so they can spend their time copulating with their husbands-except in times of emergency. The front lines are left to unmarried monsters eager to meet men to make into husbands.\n\n3. The Extremists\n\nThe Extremists are a radical faction within the Overlord's Army, spearheaded most prominently by demons and devils, and are infatuated with the Overlord's goal of a united race. While they swear fealty to the Overlord, their philosophy is generally more extreme than hers. They conduct incursions into human territory, pursuing human women to transform into monsters and thus envelop the whole world in the monster realm.\n\nThe majority of monsters have only one thing on their minds: living ecstatically with their husbands. Most only monsterize women as a personal favor-but the Extremists are not most monsters. They cleave to their vision, resolve unwavering, and monsterize every woman they see, believing that all women should be monsters. As stated earlier, if a monster such as a demon or devil pours mana into a woman, and the woman hasn't the proper aptitude, she typically becomes a succubus. Because the Extremists wish to expand their ranks, however, they have instituted an Organization of Breaking. Through harsh and thorough training, this organization seeds the Extremists' philosophy into the minds of women who are to become devils and demons.\n\nThe Extremists' best-known activities in- clude invading human states, monsterizing their women, raping their men, and engulfing them all in the monster realm. That said, the Extremists also conduct more subtle operations, such as smuggling items that induce monsterization, like edible plants or cursed items, into the human realm.\n\nThough the Extremists believe all lands must eventually become monstrous, they do not invade human territory indiscriminately. A number of states and communities are under their constant, close monitoring; they take great care to choose the best ways to minimize human and monster casualties and provide happy, lascivious lives for residents after they are swallowed into the monster realm. Only after planning a thoughtful campaign do they begin invasion.\n\nEven so, situations considered too urgent to overlook may arise: portents of mass monster executions, war between states, civil unrest, oppression of the poor, persecution of human groups-as well as the sacrifice of individual rights to the whims of society. Extremists allocate resources and personnel posthaste to take immediate and unequivocal action against such situations, which they view as victimizations of their future monstrous partners and comrades that cannot be ignored-lest the blood of their soon-to-be brethren flows in the streets before they become part of the monster realm.\n\nGodly Kingdom of Lescatié. Lescatié was the second-largest Order-affiliated state in the world until it was overthrown by one of the lilim, who are the daughters of the Overlord. After the overthrow, it became the Monstrous Realm of Lescatié."

          "content": "A vast, primordial forest where ancient trees tower impossibly high, their gnarled roots intertwining like serpents beneath the earth. This living entity shifts with the seasons, its moods affecting all who dwell within. Thick underbrush conceals both beauty and danger, while bioluminescent plants cast an eerie glow at night. Here, magic runs wild and raw, too dangerous for human settlements, creating a realm of wonder and peril ruled by the uncaring watch of ancient trees."

          "content": "As darkness falls, the forest transforms into a realm of deceptive beauty. Fungi and flowers pulse with ethereal light—blues, greens, and purples that seem almost alive. These lights create false paths and treacherous shadows, luring travelers deeper into danger. The glow is beautiful but untrustworthy; some plants use their luminescence to attract prey, while others mark territories of creatures best left undisturbed."

          "content": "The trees of the Wilds are more than mere plants—they are ancient sentinels with their own mysterious agenda. Travelers report paths that change when no one is watching, trees that seem to lean in to listen to conversations, and branches that reach out to snare the unwary. Some say the largest trees contain the memories of all who have died beneath their boughs, whispering secrets to those who know how to listen."

          "content": "Magic in the Wilds flows like an untamed river—powerful, unpredictable, and dangerous. Conventional spellcasting often yields chaotic results as the forest's primal energy warps intended effects. Mages who attempt to impose order on this chaos risk madness or worse. Only those who embrace the Wilds' chaotic nature, surrendering control rather than asserting it, can hope to channel its power safely."

These nexus points often mark the locations of sacred groves, ancient ruins, or sites of terrible power. Animals avoid these areas instinctively, but mortals are drawn to them despite the peril."

Some paths loop endlessly, while others lead to places that existed centuries ago or may yet come to pass. These anomalies are marked by an oppressive silence and air that shimmers like heat waves, even in winter."

Her domain encompasses the forest's hidden nooks where whispers of untold stories linger. Those who seek her out may find their deepest fears exposed and vulnerabilities exploited. She appears wreathed in shadows, crowned with thorns, and adorned with bones—beautiful and terrible in equal measure."

During autumn festivals, his presence brings warmth and celebration, but his fire can just as easily consume those who displease him. He appears with skin like burnished bronze and eyes that shift color with his mood—red for anger, white for calm, blue for sorrow. Small flames flicker around him when deep in thought."

Beautiful as fresh snow and just as deadly, she marks her chosen with frost patterns on their skin."

She favors those who seek to better themselves but shows no mercy to those who squander their gifts."
