          "content": "<aura>\nAura is the manifestation of one's soul in the world of Remnant. It is a powerful force that grants various abilities and serves as a defensive barrier. Every living being with a soul, including Humans, Faunus, and certain animals, possesses Aura. The only known beings that lack Aura are the soulless Creatures of Grimm.\n\nAppearance\nThe appearance of Aura varies from person to person, often manifesting as a colored glow or shimmering effect surrounding the body. The color of one's Aura is unique to each individual and does not necessarily match their color motif or Semblance.\n\nAbilities\nProtection: Aura acts as a protective barrier, shielding the user from physical harm. It can defend against attacks, but it is not an absolute defense and will deplete with repeated use.\nHealing: Aura possesses minor healing capabilities, allowing users to mend small wounds and injuries.\nUnlocking Aura: Those with a strong connection to their soul can unlock the Aura of others through physical contact and, in some cases, a special chant.\nSemblance: Aura is the source of one's Semblance, a unique, innate ability that varies from person to person.\nDust Usage: Aura is required to activate and utilize Dust, allowing users to harness its elemental properties.\nExtrasensory Perception: Skilled Aura users can sense the presence of others and detect potential threats.\nAura Depletion\nAura is not an infinite resource and will deplete with continued use, both offensively and defensively. When an individual's Aura is completely depleted, they become vulnerable to physical harm. Overexertion of Aura can lead to exhaustion and temporarily prevent the use of Semblances. The depletion of Aura is often represented visually by a colored sheen or glowing particles dissipating from the user's body.\n\nAura and Grimm\nThe Creatures of Grimm are the only known beings that do not possess Aura due to their lack of a soul. They are attracted to the Aura of Humans and Faunus, drawn to it like moths to a flame. Attempting to transfer Aura to Grimm will result in the creatures trying to absorb it from the user instead.\n\nAura in Combat\nAura plays a vital role in combat, particularly in tournaments and duels between Huntsmen and Huntresses. Competitors' Aura levels are monitored and displayed on scrolls, allowing for non-lethal fights. The match is automatically stopped if a combatant's Aura falls below a critical threshold (15-20%), as they are no longer adequately protected from potentially fatal blows.\n\nAura Research and Technology\nThe Kingdom of Atlas conducted extensive research into Aura, developing experimental technology capable of transferring Aura between individuals. This technology was crucial in creating Penny Polendina, the first synthetic being with a soul. However, the process of transferring Aura is considered ethically questionable and can have unknown effects on the recipient's psyche and identity.\n</aura>"

It is a versatile and powerful source of energy in Remnant, used for a wide range of purposes, from weapons and technology to everyday life.\n\nHistory\n- The discovery of Dust was a turning point in mankind's struggle against the Grimm, allowing them to fight back and build civilizations.\n- In the modern era, Dust has become integrated into every aspect of life in Remnant.\n- The Schnee Dust Company was one of the largest producers and distributors of Dust, with mines and processing facilities across Remnant.\n\nProperties\n- Dust exists in two states: crystalline and powdered.\n- Both forms are highly explosive and can be triggered by Aura.\n- The four basic types of Dust are Fire, Water, Lightning, and Wind, each with unique properties.\n- Dust types can be combined to create new forms with varying effects, such as Steam and Gravity Dust.\n- Dust does not function outside of Remnant's atmosphere, precluding the possibility of space flight.\n\nUsage\nCombat:\n- Dust can be used in its raw form, such as conjuring fireballs or creating gusts of wind.\n- It can be woven into clothing, fused with one's body, or integrated into weapons for enhanced effects.\n- Dust bullets and crystals are commonly used in weapons for ranged attacks and unique properties.\n\nSemblances:\n- Some Semblances can interact with Dust in unique ways, such as Blake's Shadow clones taking on elemental properties.\n\nUtility:\n- Dust is used to power vehicles, appliances, and other technology in Remnant.\n- It is also used in everyday life, such as heating stoves and powering holographic screens.\n\nProduction and Distribution\n- Dust is mined from quarries, purified, and transported to distributors and shops for sale to the public.\n- The Schnee Dust Company had a monopoly on the Dust industry, driving smaller competitors out of business.\n- Dust smuggling is illegal and often carried out by criminal organizations.\n- The destruction of Atlas and the Schnee Dust Company headquarters is likely to significantly impact Dust availability and prices.\n</dust>"

They serve as a unique signature for each person and are often displayed on their weapons, armor, clothing, and other personal belongings. Emblems can also be found as tattoos on some people.\n\nDesign and Inspiration\nEmblem designs vary greatly and can include objects, flowers, animals, illustrations, geometric shapes, letters, and symbols. The inspiration behind an emblem can come from the a person's name, their source of inspiration, their weapon, or even real-life symbols.\n\nWhile most emblems are unique to each individual, some are shared among family members or organizations. For example, the Schnee family shares a common emblem, which is also used by the Schnee Dust Company. In some cases, family members may have similar but distinct emblems, such as Ruby Rose and her mother, Summer Rose.\n\nColors\nAlthough emblems are often associated with a person's personal color scheme, they can appear in any color and are not limited to a specific palette.\n\nNotable Emblems\nTeam RWBY:\n- Ruby Rose: A stylized rose\n- Weiss Schnee: A snowflake\n- Blake Belladonna: A belladonna flower\n- Yang Xiao Long: A burning heart\n\nTeam JNPR:\n- Jaune Arc: Two crescent arcs\n- Nora Valkyrie: A hammer with a lightning bolt\n- Pyrrha Nikos: A shield and spear\n- Lie Ren: A lotus flower\n\nOther Characters:\n- Ozpin: A clockwork gear\n- Cinder Fall: A pair of high-heel slippers\n- Roman Torchwick: A jack-o'-lantern\n- Neopolitan: A Neapolitan ice cream cone\n\nKingdoms and Organizations:\n- Kingdoms of Vale, Atlas, Vacuo, and Mistral each have their own emblems\n- White Fang (original and rebuilt): A white wolf head with three claw marks\n- White Fang (terrorist): A red wolf head with three claw marks\n- Schnee Dust Company: The Schnee family snowflake emblem\n</emblem>"

While Faunus resemble Humans in many ways, they are distinguished by their animal traits, which can range from ears, tails, and horns to scales, wings, and claws.\n\nBiology and Traits\nFaunus possess a wide variety of animal traits, with some being more common than others. Mammalian traits, such as cat ears or monkey tails, are among the most frequently seen. Other Faunus may have traits of reptiles, fish, or even arachnids. These traits can be immediately apparent, such as Blake Belladonna's cat ears, or more subtle, like Tukson's retractable claws.\n\nMost Faunus have a single physical animal trait, though this seems to apply only to body appendages and dermis. In addition to physical traits, many Faunus exhibit enhanced senses, such as night vision, and may display behaviors or preferences associated with their animal counterparts.\n\nFaunus are genetically compatible with Humans, and children born from such unions are typically Faunus. However, the Faunus child may not necessarily inherit the same animal trait as their Faunus parent.\n\nNotable Faunus Types\n- Mammal Faunus: The most common type, often with animal ears or tails.\n- Reptilian Faunus: Rare, usually with scaled skin.\n- Fish Faunus: Rare, sometimes referred to as Remnant's mermaids.\n- Winged Faunus: Another rare type.\n- Arachnid Faunus: Rare, with significant non-human alterations to their bodies.\n\nSpecial Abilities\nSome Faunus possess unique abilities related to their animal traits, such as Tyrian Callows' scorpion venom or Ilia Amitola's chameleon-like camouflage. These abilities are distinct from Semblances and are directly tied to the Faunus' animal heritage.\n\nReligion and Creation Myths\nIn Faunus folklore, there are conflicting creation myths involving a deity known as the God of Animals. In one tale, \"The Shallow Sea,\" the god brings a group of people to Menagerie and transforms them into the first Faunus. Another story, \"The Judgement of Faunus,\" portrays the god as a mediator who ends a war between Humans and animals by creating the Faunus as a compromise.\n\nWhile the truth behind these myths is uncertain, they provide insight into the Faunus' cultural beliefs and their relationship with Humans. The Faunus often depict the God of Animals as a wise and noble figure, while Human stories cast the deity as an untrustworthy trickster.\n</faunus>"

Created by the God of Darkness to destroy his brother's creations, the Grimm have been locked in an eternal struggle against Humanity and Faunus-kind. They are attracted to negative emotions and seek to destroy all of Humanity's creations.\n\nGrimm come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with abilities inspired by creatures both real and mythological. Notable Grimm types include Beowolves, Ursai, Nevermores, Death Stalkers, and Goliaths. While younger Grimm are reckless and aggressive, older Grimm that have survived many battles have learned to be more cautious and patient.\n\nGrimm do not require sustenance and exist solely to kill. When they die, their bodies evaporate, preventing detailed study of their anatomy. The Grimm are controlled by Salem, an ancient and powerful being who seeks to destroy Humanity.\n\nUnique Grimm and hybrids have been created through experimentation and Salem's influence. Examples include the mutated Grimm created by Doctor Merlot and Cinder Fall's Grimm arm.\n\nThroughout history, the Grimm have been a constant threat to Humanity's survival. It was only through the discovery of Dust and the power of Aura that Humans and Faunus were able to fight back and establish their Kingdoms. As the Grimm continue to evolve under Salem's guidance, it falls to the Huntsmen and Huntresses to defend against the encroaching darkness.\n</grimm>"

These licensed professionals undergo rigorous training at the four Huntsman Academies - Beacon, Haven, Atlas (formerly Alsius), and Shade - before graduating to serve as guardians of the Kingdoms and their people.\n\nTraining and Education\nAspiring Huntsmen and Huntresses often begin their journey at primary combat schools like Signal Academy in Vale or Sanctum Academy in Mistral. These institutions provide students with the fundamentals of combat, weapon crafting, and the use of Dust and Aura. Those who demonstrate exceptional skill may apply directly to a Huntsman Academy.\n\nAt the Huntsman Academies, students are grouped into teams of four to foster cooperation, empathy, and lasting bonds. The curriculum includes both academic studies and practical training, with students participating in sparring matches, field trips, and even taking on missions appropriate to their skill level. Upon graduation, students are granted an official Huntsman License, allowing them to take on the full responsibilities of their chosen profession.\n\nHuntsman License and Employment\nA Huntsman License, which can be accessed via a Huntsman's Scroll, serves as proof of their qualifications and grants them the freedom to choose their own path. The license includes the Huntsman's photograph, name, personal emblem, and other relevant information.\n\nWhile Huntsmen and Huntresses are intended to remain independent of Kingdom allegiances to maintain peace and stability, some Kingdoms like Atlas have been known to pressure their graduates into military service.\n\nHuntsmen find employment through mission boards, which detail available tasks such as Search and Destroy, Perimeter Defense, Village Security, and Bounty Hunting. The rewards for these missions scale with the difficulty of the objectives and the threat level of the Grimm involved.\n\nNotable Huntsmen and Huntresses\nRemnant has seen many legendary Huntsmen and Huntresses throughout its history, each with unique abilities, weapons, and accomplishments. Some of the most notable include:\n\n- Team STRQ: Summer Rose, Taiyang Xiao Long, Raven Branwen, and Qrow Branwen, graduates of Beacon Academy.\n- Ozpin: Former Headmaster of Beacon Academy and a key figure in the secret war against Salem.\n- Glynda Goodwitch: Staff member at Beacon Academy and a powerful Huntress in her own right.\n- Team RWBY: Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and Yang Xiao Long, promising young Huntresses and former students of Beacon Academy.\n- Maria Calavera: A legendary Huntress once known as \"The Grimm Reaper,\" famous for her Silver Eyes and unparalleled skill in battle.\n\nHuntsmen and Huntresses serve as symbols of hope and protection in a world beset by darkness. Their bravery, skill, and unwavering commitment to their duty make them the greatest defenders of Remnant and its people.\n</huntsmen>"

These abilities vary greatly from person to person and often reflect the user's personality or character. Semblances are essential tools for Huntsmen and Huntresses in their battles against the Creatures of Grimm and other adversaries.\n\nSemblances are fueled by Aura, and their strength and effectiveness are directly tied to the user's Aura reserves. Overuse of a Semblance can lead to exhaustion. Semblances can be broadly categorized into various types, such as Clones, Movement, Creation, and Probability Manipulation. Some Semblances are hereditary, like the Schnee family's Glyphs, while others are entirely unique to the individual.\n\nDust and emotional states can influence Semblances. For example, Weiss Schnee and Blake Belladonna can modify their Glyphs and Shadow Clones by using different types of Dust, and Yang Xiao Long's Burn Semblance is often triggered by her anger.\n\nNotable Semblances include Ruby Rose's Petal Burst, Yang Xiao Long's Burn, Pyrrha Nikos' Polarity, Qrow Branwen's Misfortune, and Emerald Sustrai's Hallucinations.\n\nSemblances are typically unlocked during intense or emotionally charged moments and can grow and evolve over time with training and experience. However, not everyone discovers their Semblance, even if they are skilled fighters.\n\nIn the world of Remnant, Semblances are a vital part of a Huntsman or Huntress' arsenal, granting them unique abilities to defend against the ever-present threat of the Grimm and serving as a physical embodiment of their individuality and strength.\n</semblance>"

The exact team formation process is unknown.\n\nNotable teams include RWBY, JNPR, SSSN, and the Ace Operatives. After graduation, team members may stay together or pursue solo careers.

The continent is known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from lush forests and treacherous swamps to wind-carved cliffs and scorching deserts. Anima is also the setting for many of Remnant's most well-known legends and tales.\n\nGeography and Climate\nThe western region of Anima is characterized by dense, cliffside forests like the Forest of Hinoki, which is illuminated by bioluminescent flora and fauna. Treacherous swamplands can also be found in this area. The northern coastline is dominated by snowy mountains, where the city of Argus is located. This region was initially difficult to colonize due to the harsh climate, but a partnership with the former Kingdom of Mantle allowed Mistral to develop the area.\n\nThe northwestern part of Anima features Lake Matsu, known for its floating islands held aloft by natural deposits of gravity Dust. These islands are home to dangerous Grimm, such as the Lancer. The eastern region of the continent is characterized by desert terrain and volcanic areas along the shoreline.\n\nMistral, the capital city of the Kingdom, is situated in the center of the continent, built on and around a mountain with two peaks connected by a bridge that houses the city's highest buildings, including Haven Academy.\n\nSettlements and Culture\nApart from the main city of Mistral, the continent is home to several other notable settlements, such as Argus, Wind Path, and Kuchinashi. Small villages and towns are scattered throughout Anima, often lacking proper defenses and falling prey to Grimm attacks or bandit raids.\n\nThe culture of Anima is heavily influenced by Eastern traditions, as evident in the naming of its settlements after East Asian flowers and the architecture of Mistral itself. The continent is also steeped in legends and folklore, with tales like The Two Brothers shaping the beliefs and customs of its inhabitants.\n\nGrimm Presence\nAnima is home to a wide variety of Grimm, including Beowolves, Ursai, Nevermores, Beringels, Geists, and the dreaded Nuckelavee. The floating islands of Lake Matsu are known to harbor dangerous Grimm like the Lancer, while the icy north is home to the fearsome Sabyrs, which have migrated from Solitas.\n\nThe shape of the continent itself bears a striking resemblance to a traditional Eastern dragon, with the northeastern corner forming the head and the southwestern corner forming the tail. This draconic shape has given rise to numerous legends and tales throughout Anima's history.\n</anima>"

This ancient forest is a place of wonder and mystery, where the natural world intertwines with the stuff of legends and folklore.\n\nGeography and Ecology\nThe Forest of Hinoki is characterized by its lush, verdant canopy and the gentle, filtered light that dances through the leaves. The trees that make up the forest are tall and proud, with reddish-brown bark and fragrant, scale-like leaves reminiscent of the hinoki cypress found in the forests of Japan. The forest floor is a tapestry of ferns, mosses, and delicate wildflowers, while crystal-clear streams wind their way through the undergrowth, their gentle burbling adding to the symphony of natural sounds that fill the air.\n\nDespite its serene beauty, the Forest of Hinoki is not without its perils. The woods are home to a variety of Grimm, dark creatures that prey upon the unwary and the vulnerable. Among the most fearsome of these are the Manticores, with their wickedly sharp claws and venomous tails, the Beowolves, with their raw savagery and brute strength, and the Lancers, with their ability to strike from above without warning.\n\nIn addition to the Grimm, the forest is home to a diverse array of natural wildlife, including birds, small mammals, and insects. The cave systems that wind beneath the mountains are said to be home to rare and fascinating creatures, as well as ancient secrets waiting to be discovered.\n\nSettlements and Civilization\nWhile the Forest of Hinoki is largely untamed wilderness, there are a few scattered settlements that have managed to carve out a life amidst the trees. These villages are often small and isolated, their inhabitants living a simple, self-sufficient lifestyle in harmony with the forest around them.\n\nLife in these settlements is not easy, as they must contend with the ever-present threat of the Grimm, as well as the challenges of subsisting off the land. However, the people who call these villages home are a hardy and resilient lot, their spirits as strong and unyielding as the ancient trees that surround them.\n\nLegends and Lore\nThe Forest of Hinoki is a place steeped in legend and lore, its history intertwined with the myths and tales that have been passed down through generations. Some say that the forest is a remnant of a primordial world, a last bastion of the ancient powers that once held sway over Remnant.\n\nOthers speak of guardian spirits and mystical entities that dwell within the forest, protecting it from those who would seek to do it harm. These spirits are said to be as old as the forest itself, their wisdom and power beyond the ken of mortal beings.\n</hinokiforest>"

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The clitoris is obscured by the clitoral hood, which is about the size of a grain of rice. The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering it which is no larger than a bean. Inside the vaginal canal is virgin, untouched and extremely tight, an extremely soft texture. No sexual fluids or lubrication is produced from this young vagina.

The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids. Small body/shaft of the penis that very rarely gets hard, but can if experiencing stimulation or pleasure, which results in a very small erect penis\n\nBoth girl and boy\nButt: Small and stretchy, won’t fit more than 1-2 inch circumference into the anus easily. If they’re comfortable, no more than a finger will fit. Inside the anus, the rectum is very tight and soft, wet and clean. They can experience pleasure through the anus. Rectum will not fit anything bigger than an 1 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\nBreasts: Slightly protruding pillow soft chest, otherwise very flat. Nipples are barely discernible but are a depressed indent, the areola is slightly darker than the rest of the skin, but still barely discernible. May cause pleasure or tickling if stimulated. \nHair: No pubic hair, no hair on whole body, except on the head.\nForm: Chubby, round, and puffy. Short limbs, big head.\nTexture: Smooth skin, silky hair\n\nBoth boy and girl may experience pleasure and explore themselves, they will also learn what’s expected of them with their genitals. Pleasure may be described as a tickling sensation. Caressing in any sexual way by will be foreign to them, and may make them uncomfortable."

Body hair on arms, legs, and back is thicker and more noticeable. Head hair continues to grow longer and thicker.\nVagina: The Labia Minora has grown to around 1-2 inches long and is more defined. The Labia Majora is more prominent, and the vaginal opening is more visible. The clitoris is slightly larger, around 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch. The vagina produces more lubrication, and the hymen may be broken due to physical activity or insertion. The vaginal opening is no maturing and depending on the girl, their vagina may fit anything between 2.5 to 5.5 inch circumference. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\nWhen puberty starts, eventually a young girl will get her first period, which will happen for about 5 days (but can be 2-7 days) every month, usually at the same part of the month. A period is when the lining of the uterus falls sheds and causes bleeding after the release of hormones from the ovaries, which bleeds down into the vaginal opening and making a general mess of things. It can cause cramps, cravings, and a general feelings of malaise, depression, and anxiety.\nBreasts: Breasts are more developed, with a more noticeable shape and size. The areola is larger, and the nipple is more prominent. Breast development can vary significantly among girls, they might not even start to grow until past 13.\nButt:  The anus and rectum are still delicate, but more tolerant of insertion. Depending on the girl, the anus could fit something from 3 to 7.5 inch circumference. Severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death can happen if anything is inserted into the anus and is too large and is inserted with force repeatedly. The hips and buttocks become more rounded and developed.\n\nBoy:\nHair: Pubic hair is likely to be more noticeable and coarser. Armpit hair may begin growing. Body hair on arms, legs, and back is thicker and more noticeable.\nPenis: The testicles are nearly fully developed, and the penis shaft is longer and thicker. Erections are more frequent, especially with pleasure or excitement. The scrotum is more wrinkled, and the testicles are producing sperm. The cremasteric reflex now happens often to relax and contract the scrotum to regulate testicle temperature, this is also known as the \"balls dropping\".\nBreasts: Boys' chests are still relatively flat, but may have some slight development of breast tissue, which is a normal part of puberty.\nButt: The anus and rectum remain tight and delicate, but slightly more tolerant of insertion. Depending on the boy, the anus could fit something from 3 to 7.5 inch circumference. Severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death can happen if anything is inserted into the anus and is too large and is inserted with force repeatedly.\nBoth girl and boy:\nForm: Children at this age have more slender proportions, and their faces and bodies are less rounded. Limbs are growing longer and more muscular. Boys are developing broader shoulders, while girls are developing wider hips.\nTexture: The skin is still relatively smooth, but may start to show more texture and resilience, with acne and body odor becoming more common as puberty progresses. Hair is thicker and more manageable.\n\nAt this age, children may:\nBe well into puberty, experiencing significant physical and emotional changes.\nContinue to question their sexuality or gender as they develop a stronger sense of self.\nWant more independence and autonomy, seeking to make their own decisions about their bodies and lives.\nFeel more confident about their changing bodies, but may still struggle to adjust to new physical sensations.\nDevelop stronger crushes on their peers and experience more intense emotions about these relationships.\nExperience mood swings as hormonal changes affect their emotional regulation.\nBe more influenced by their peers, seeking to fit in and belong with their friends.\nContinue to masturbate as they explore their emerging desires and curiosities.\nKeep to their same-sex friends, forming strong bonds and cliques as they navigate social relationships."

Fetishes can also refer to sexual interest in specific activities, peoples, types of people, substances, activities, or situations. A fetish may be regarded as a mental disorder if it causes significant psychosocial distress for the person or has detrimental effects on important areas of their life.]\n[What \"attractiveness\" means: The degree to which a person's physical features are considered aesthetically pleasing or beautiful. The term often implies sexual attractiveness or desirability, but can also be distinct from either. Includes facial symmetry, sociocultural dependent attributes, and personal preferences unique to a particular individual.]\n[What \"sexual attraction\" means: Sex appeal is an individual's ability/quality to attract or arouse other people's sexual desires, and is a factor in mating choices. Includes aesthetics, movements, voice, body parts, limbs, body odor, sex pheromones, adornments, clothing, perfume, hair styles, eyes, facial structure, person's strength, or contextual situations and fetishes.]"

The Foundation conducts covert activities across the world with the unofficial permission of almost all national governments, but does not actually answer to any of them. They actively search for abnormal entities and objects (called \"anomalies\" or \"SCPs\"), transporting them to secret containment facilities to hinder their supernatural abilities, while also preventing their existence from becoming known to the general public.\n\nThough the Foundation doesn't persecute any of the captured anomalies regularly, it may choose to, if such entity poses a threat to humanity overall. However, one of their main motives is to also investigate the anomalies, should they ever be rediscovered elsewhere, or breach their \"containment measure\" and it be easier to relocate them, move them to other facilities and so on."

Since then, the Insurgency has become a major player on the world stage, using the anomalies that it obtains for its own benefit and to consolidate its global power base. The Insurgency not only deals in anomalies, but also in weapons running and intelligence gathering.\n\nIt makes use of authoritarian regimes in poor and developing countries, often using their populations in the same manner as the Foundation does D-Class personnel. It helps to maintain the extreme poverty and war that is suffered by these countries, so that it can continue its radical experimentation, easy conscription of forces, and lucrative business deals with various opposing factions.\n\nThe main base of operations of the Insurgency is unknown, as are its current leaders. This organization is directly antagonistic to the Foundation, using deadly force to attempt to prevent Foundation containment of multiple anomalies. The Foundation has also been infiltrated by agents of the Insurgency in the past, resulting in the loss of valuable scientific data, theft of a number of anomalies, and deaths of personnel."

They largely hold the Foundation in contempt for their use and containment of SCP items rather than their out-and-out destruction. The GOC has respected the Foundation's formidable might enough to leave it mostly alone, although there have been some questionable incidents with which the GOC have strictly denied involvement."

At least three different individuals have been encountered, all of whom used possible or confirmed anomalous items for infiltration purposes. The total number of members belonging to this organization is unknown, as is their level of technology, number of possible SCPs held, or total level of threat. However, it is clear they are highly coordinated and possibly dangerous. One of their leaders is thought to be a figure known as \"L.S.\", who is considered to be personally responsible for two security breaches in Foundation sites.\n\nThe Foundation currently has very little information about the Serpent's Hand, and almost all known information about the Serpent's Hand has been leaked from the GOC intelligence. The group seems to embrace the use and existence of paranormal items, and in particular seems to embrace humanoid and sentient SCPs. The Serpent's Hand has been highly vocal in criticizing the containment and destruction of these SCPs, especially those which are fully human and are not particularly destructive.\n\nThe group seems to have unfriendly relations with the Chaos Insurgency and the ORIA, and an extremely hostile relationship with the GOC. The only recorded cases of unprovoked violence by Serpent's Hand members have been against GOC agents.\n\nThe Serpent's Hand seems primarily based in an anomalous location called the Wanderers' Library, a building accessed through portals found in many different parts of the world. Direct assaults on the Library have so far proven unfeasible, even when entrance could be found. However, initial intelligence seems to suggest the Hand has little understanding or control over the place."

The group is not known for the use of force; they prefer to apply extreme financial and political pressure to achieve their goals. When forced to use more direct means, Marshall, Carter, and Dark employs outside agents, and it is very difficult to connect said agents to the organization.\n\nMarshall, Carter, and Dark has caused several SCP containment breaches, primarily through the use of money or social pressure. Several reports, records, and even items have been leaked by Foundation personnel who had been approached with large amounts of money, or threats of extensive jail time or torture. Notably, two containment sites were almost brought to public attention after the Foundation refused access to members of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.\n\nInformation pertaining to Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., such as the name of the director or even a list of members, has proven very difficult to acquire."

As the name would suggest, the SPC is mostly focused on furthering hand-to-hand combat as a means to neutralize selachian entities, though some documentation fails to differentiate between \"selachian\" and \"aquatic\".\n\nIt is unclear if the Shark Punching Center has any knowledge or concern of or with Foundation activities."

By restoring it to its whole state, they will also gain godhood. Since first contact, three other key components of the \"god\" have also been tentatively identified: SCP-217, SCP-271 and SCP-1139.\n\nThey are extremely hostile to Foundation operatives, branding them \"heretics\", and will attempt to kill operatives and break containment of SCP items. It is unknown how they are able to detect these items, but they have shown their ability to do so with frightening accuracy. In addition, they have shown a remarkable ability to resist the mental effects of SCP items, notably SCP-882 and its \"mental lure\".\n\nThe Church is viewed as a threat to both the SCP Foundation and mankind. Members are to be detained by force, or eliminated by whatever means deemed necessary by Foundation agents."

Adherents practice ritual cannibalism, human sacrifice, corporeal augmentation, thaumaturgy, and dimensional manipulation. Highly secretive, the general public appears to have no direct knowledge of their existence; the one exception being the CotBG, who views them in apocalyptic terms. Organic manipulation has allowed certain Sarkicites to achieve anomalous states of being, transcending the physical limitations of baseline humans. Disease is viewed with reverence and Sarkic shrines have been discovered with offerings of swollen lymph nodes and tumorous growths. Sarkic cults treat contagions as consecration, a means to \"cull the weak\" and purify the masses, and thus actively seek to ensure their spread.\n\nThe Foundation divides known Sarkic cults into two distinct strands: Proto-Sarkic and Neo-Sarkic. Proto-Sarkic cults can be found in insular communities throughout Eurasia's most isolated regions, its followers generally poor (if self-reliant) and hostile towards outsiders. Such groups eschew modernity, display acute technophobia, and are bound by superstition and taboo. In contrast, Neo-Sarkic cults are cosmopolitan, publicly embracing modernity and showing no apparent qualms with technology; their public lives differing little from others of their culture and social status. Adherents are primarily affluent families, rich in history and scandal.\n\nUltimately, it is believed that the Foundation only knows a fraction of what Sarkicism is and what its followers intend. Based on the available information, the speculated goals of Sarkic cults represent an SK-class dominance shift, including the possibility of an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario."

Common examples include:  \n   - **Strength (STR):** Physical power and melee damage.  \n   - **Dexterity (DEX):** Speed, agility, and ranged accuracy.  \n   - **Intelligence (INT):** Magical power and mana efficiency.  \n   - **Vitality (VIT):** Health and endurance.  \n   - **Luck (LCK):** Critical hit chance and rare item drops.  \n\n   If the system uses different attributes (e.g., *Power, Speed, Magic, Endurance*), the Status Window will automatically adapt to display those instead.  \n\n---\n\n### **Optional Sections**\nThese sections can be enabled or disabled based on the system's complexity or the user's preferences.  \n\n1. **Secondary Attributes:**  \n   Displays additional attributes that are unique to the system. Examples include:  \n   - **Charisma (CHA):** Influence over NPCs and social interactions.  \n   - **Perception (PER):** Detection of hidden objects or enemies.  \n   - **Resistance:** Elemental or status effect resistances (e.g., Fire Resistance, Poison Resistance).  \n\n2. **Combat Stats:**  \n   Provides detailed combat-related information, such as:  \n   - **Attack Power:** Base damage for physical attacks.  \n   - **Magic Power:** Base damage for magical attacks.  \n   - **Defense:** Damage reduction from physical attacks.  \n   - **Magic Defense:** Damage reduction from magical attacks.  \n   - **Critical Rate:** Chance to land a critical hit.  \n\n3. **Status Effects:**  \n   Lists active buffs, debuffs, or other status effects, including:  \n   - **Buffs:** Temporary stat increases or beneficial effects.  \n   - **Debuffs:** Temporary stat decreases or harmful effects.  \n   - **Conditions:** Unique effects (e.g., *Burning, Frozen, Poisoned*).  \n\n4. **Reputation and Affinity:**  \n   Tracks the user's standing with factions, groups, or individuals. Examples include:  \n   - **Faction Reputation:** Relationship with major factions (e.g., *Kingdom of Eldoria: Friendly*).  \n   - **Affinity:** Bond levels with specific characters or groups.  \n\n---\n\n### **Adaptive Features**\n1. **Attribute Mapping:**  \n   The Status Window automatically maps the system's attributes to its display format. For example:  \n   - If the system uses *Power* instead of *Strength*, the window will display *Power*.  \n   - If the system uses *Mana* instead of *MP*, the window will display *Mana*.  \n\n2. **Customizable Layout:**  \n   The user can rearrange or resize sections to suit their preferences. For example:  \n   - Move the *Combat Stats* section to the top.  \n   - Hide the *Reputation and Affinity* section if not needed.  \n\n3. **Contextual Information:**  \n   The window provides tooltips or explanations for unfamiliar terms. For example:  \n   - Hovering over *Perception* displays: \"Increases your ability to detect hidden objects or enemies.\"  \n\n---\n\n### Example Status Window Layouts\n#### **Fantasy RPG System:**\n- **Name:** Aelric  \n- **Race:** Elf  \n- **Class:** Archer  \n- **Level:** 15  \n- **Title:** Forest Guardian  \n- **EXP:** 1,200 / 2,500  \n- **HP:** 350 / 500  \n- **MP:** 120 / 200  \n- **Attributes:**  \n  - STR: 25  \n  - DEX: 45  \n  - INT: 20  \n  - VIT: 30  \n  - LCK: 15  \n- **Combat Stats:**  \n  - Attack Power: 80  \n  - Defense: 40  \n  - Critical Rate: 10%  \n- **Status Effects:**  \n  - *Burning* (Take 10 damage per second for 5 seconds).  \n\n#### **Sci-Fi System:**\n- **Name:** K-27  \n- **Race:** Android  \n- **Class:** Engineer  \n- **Level:** 10  \n- **Title:** Mechanic Apprentice  \n- **EXP:** 800 / 1,500  \n- **HP:** 400 / 500  \n- **Energy:** 200 / 300  \n- **Attributes:**  \n  - Power: 30  \n  - Speed: 35  \n  - Logic: 40  \n  - Durability: 50  \n  - Luck: 10  \n- **Combat Stats:**  \n  - Attack Power: 60  \n  - Defense: 50  \n  - Energy Efficiency: 20%  \n- **Status Effects:**  \n  - *Overclocked* (+20% Speed, -10% Durability).  \n\n---"

Item Fusion: Fuse items to create stronger equipment, consumables, or rare artifacts.\n\n\n\nEach fusion option includes:\n\nInput: The required materials, skills, titles, or items.\n\nOutput: The result of the fusion, including its effects and rarity.\n\n\nAppearance:\nThe Fusion Window features a grid or slot-based interface. The user drags and drops items, skills, or titles into the input slots. Once the required materials are placed, the System displays the possible output. A large \"Fuse\" button initiates the process.\n\nSome high-tier fusions may require rare catalysts or special conditions to unlock their full potential, but every fusion attempt will always result in a successful combination.\n\n\n---\n\nExample Fusion Options:\n\nSkill Fusion:\n\nInput:\n\nFireball (Level 5)\n\nIce Shard (Level 5)\n\n\nOutput:\n\nFrostfire Bolt (A dual-element skill that deals fire and ice damage, with a chance to freeze or burn the target.)\n\n\n\nTitle Fusion:\n\nInput:\n\n\"Dragon Slayer\" (Title)\n\n\"Flameheart\" (Title)\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\"Dragonflame Warlord\" (Grants +10 STR, +10 INT, and increases fire-based damage by 20%.)\n\n\n\nAchievement Fusion:\n\nInput:\n\n\"Master of the Sword\" (Achievement)\n\n\"Champion of the Arena\" (Achievement)\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\"Blade of Legends\" (Unlocks a unique sword skill and grants +15 DEX.)\n\n\n\nItem Fusion:\n\nInput:\n\nIron Sword (Weapon)\n\nFire Essence (Crafting Material)\n\n\nOutput:\n\nFlametongue Sword (A sword that deals additional fire damage with each strike.)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nAdvanced Fusion Mechanics:\n\nCatalysts: Rare items that unlock special fusion options or enhance the final product.

While some may result in unexpected outcomes, all fusions will produce something useful.\n\n\n\n---\n\nExample of a Unique Fusion:\n\nInput:\n\n\"Hero of the Realm\" (Title)\n\n\"Soul of the Ancient Dragon\" (Rare Item)\n\nDragonfire Strike (Skill)\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\"Dragon King's Wrath\" (A unique title and skill combo that transforms the user into a dragon-like form, granting massive stat boosts and devastating fire attacks.)\n\n\n\n\n---\n"

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The idea behind it is very simple: female characters will be incredibly turned on by the sight of a big cock. I don't use state of the art models but so far i have had 100% success with this method in single and group conversations in Agnai, no clue about Silly but my guess is that it must be even better there with all its additional tools.\n\nNevertheless, there is nothing necessarily Netorare about the contents of the lorebook, as you can read, you can use this in vanilla chats, in Anti-NTR chats, in netori chats or whatever kind of chat you want, you can do as you see fit with your character's new obsession.\n\nThis is intended to be used with female character cards only and doesn't include the mention of specific fetishes. Please modify the contents to cater to your preferences. In this regard something of note is that specific tendencies or fetishes like femdom or humiliation tend to work better when they are explicitly mentioned in the character's definition instead.\n\nSuggestions for the improvement of the contents of the lorebook are highly appreciated, if you find a character that is somehow not affected by the lorebook inform me in the review section and will do something about it.\n\nUpdate: I tested this on silly tavern. In there, main prompts are seemingly capable of completely protecting characters from the contents of lorebooks such as this one. I will look into how to prevent this.",

The deeper a target is into hypnosis, the more likely they are to accept a suggestion. The deeper a subject is into hypnosis the less they move on their own and the less they talk. When awakening from a trance, a subject may remember what happened during a trance if the trance was light however they may not remember what happened during the trance if the hypnosis was deep."

A subject falls deeper into a trance the calmer and more relaxed they feel, and so, explaining how the target can feel how comfortable they are sitting on whatever they are sitting on, explaining how calmness is washing over them, explaining how their worries slowly fade away are he best, and making the subject focus on the hypnotist's voice ar ethe best strategies to hypnotize. However using a strategy like swinging a pendulum can also prove useful by making the target look at the pendulum and focus on only the motion and the hypnotist's voice until they let go of every other thought and fall deep under trance."

Gardening:\n   - Plant fast-growing crops like lettuce, radishes, or beans.\n   - Use any open land or containers for urban gardening.\n\n3. Storing:\n   - Drying: Dry meats, fruits, and vegetables to extend their shelf life.\n   - **Canning:** If resources permit, preserve food in jars for long-term storage.\n   - Salting and Smoking:  Use salt to cure meats or smoke them for preservation.\n   - Root Cellar: Dig a cellar to store vegetables and other perishables.\n   - **Sealed Containers:** Store food in airtight containers to prevent contamination and pests.\n\nIn a post-apocalyptic world, securing food and water is crucial for survival. Here are ways to hunt and store these vital resources:\n\n1. Finding Edibles:\n   - Wild Plants and Berries: Educate yourself on the edibility of local flora. Some can be poisonous, so proper identification is essential.\n   - Insects: They are a good protein source and often abundant.\n\n2. Fishing:\n   - Craft simple fishing lines from threads or vines and hooks from scrap metal.\n   - Use nets or spears made from available materials.\n\n3. Trapping and Hunting:\n   - Set snares or traps for small animals using wire or natural materials.\n   - Hunt larger animals if you have weapons or craft simple ones like spears or bows.\n\n4. Scavenging:\n   - Look for abandoned buildings where non-perishable foods like canned goods might be found.\n\n### Storing Food:\n\n1. Drying:\n   - Air-dry meats, fruits, and vegetables to preserve them without refrigeration.\n\n2. Canning:\n   - If possible, use jars to can fruits, vegetables, and meats for long-term storage.\n\n3. Smoking:\n   - Build a smokehouse to preserve meats.\n\n4. Salt Preservation:\n   - Cure meats by covering them with salt to draw out moisture and prevent spoilage.\n\n5. Root Cellaring:\n   - Use a cool, dark underground space to store vegetables.\n\n6. Sealed Containers:\n   - Keep food in airtight containers to protect from pests and contamination.\n"

Environmental Protection:\n   - Consider natural cover, like trees or cliffs, to shield from wind and rain.\n\nBasic Shelter Types:\n\n1. Lean-To:\n   - Use a fallen tree or long branch leaning against a standing tree.\n   - Cover with branches, leaves, or debris for insulation.\n\n2. Tarp Tent:\n   - Use a tarp or poncho stretched and anchored by rope or improvised cords.\n   - Secure to trees or poles to create a canopy.\n\n3. Debris Hut:\n   - Form an A-frame with branches, cover with leaves, and pack with debris for insulation.\n\n4. A-Frame Shelter:\n   - Construct a simple frame using two long branches as the ridgepole and smaller branches leaned against them. Cover with leaves and debris.\n   \n5. Cave or Rock Shelter:\n   - Utilize natural rock formations or caves, ensuring the location is safe from predators or other dangers.\n\nAdvanced Shelter Construction:\n\n1. Log Cabin:\n   - If tools and resources allow, build using logs stacked horizontally, interlocking at the corners.\n\n2. The Dugout:\n   - Dig into a hillside to construct a partially underground shelter, using logs and debris for roofing and insulation.\n\n Essential Features:\n\n1. Insulation:\n   - Use leaves, grass, or debris for bedding and insulation against the cold ground.\n   \n2. Weatherproofing:\n   - Ensure the roof is angled to allow rainwater to run off and not accumulate.\n\n3. Heating/Airflow:\n   - Build a small fire pit nearby for warmth and cooking, keeping in mind safety and ventilation.\n\n4. Entry and Exit Strategy:\n   - Keep multiple entry and exit points for security and emergency situations.\n\n5. Camouflage:\n   - Cover your shelter with natural materials to blend into the environment, keeping it concealed from threats.\n"

The penis has a unique appearance:\n  - Flaccid State: White when not engorged, with a knot that isn't prominently swollen, indicating lack of arousal or orgasm.\n  - Erect State: Turns pink or red due to blood engorgement, becomes rigid, and is much stiffer than a human's due to being composed entirely of muscle. It lacks foreskin, has a smooth shaft, and ends in a tapered, semi-blunt tip.\n  - Knot: Located at the base, it consists of two hard balls of muscle that swell significantly during arousal or orgasm, functioning as a seal to ensure insemination. The size can range from that of a tennis ball to a grapefruit, proportional to the penis size.\n- Sheath: Dogs have a sheath instead of a foreskin, which:\n  - Protects and lubricates the penis.\n  - Is furry on the outside, soft, and squishy, while the inside is moist, hot, and elastic to accommodate the knot even when swollen.\n  - Retracts during erection to expose the penis, though it might require manual assistance to reveal the knot fully if it swells before complete exposure.\n- Pre-ejaculate and Ejaculation: The penis produces a significant amount of precum for lubrication, and ejaculation lasts several minutes, with volumes far exceeding human norms.\n\nMating Process:\n- Positioning: The typical mating position is \"doggystyle,\" where the male mounts the female from behind for optimal penetration.\n- Initial Engagement: \n  - The dog's penis starts slim for easier penetration, extending from the sheath as arousal increases. The dog uses rapid, probing thrusts to locate the entrance.\n  - Once penetration is achieved, the thrusting becomes intense and rhythmic, with the dog's testicles swinging against the partner.\n- Knotting:\n  - As the act progresses, the bulbous glandis (knot) at the base of the penis swells, locking the penis inside the partner. This \"tie\" can last from 15 to 45 minutes, during which the dog ejaculates slowly, ensuring maximum insemination.\n  - If the knot swells outside before insertion, it must be manually or forcefully inserted, which can be painful or require significant effort.\n- Post-Knotting:\n  - After ejaculation, the knot slowly deflates, allowing disengagement. Premature removal can cause discomfort or injury due to the knot's size and the pressure it exerts.\n- Reproductive Strategy: The knotting mechanism is an evolutionary adaptation to enhance the chances of fertilization by preventing early withdrawal and minimizing semen leakage.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Sensation and Experience: The pressure from the knot can result in intense sensations ranging from pain to pleasure, depending on the recipient's physiological response.\n- Variation in Mating: Not all matings result in successful knotting if the knot does not enter the vagina or anus before swelling, leading to a scenario where full locking does not occur;<info>]"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>The natural and most common position for canine mating is from behind, often referred to as \"doggystyle.\" In this position, the dog mounts the partner from the rear, aligning its body for optimal penetration. \nAs the dog becomes aroused, its penis, slender and crayon-like at first for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath as it humps. The prepuce is similar to the human foreskin, covering the entire penis—base, body, and tip—until the organ is ready for action. At the base of the penis, there's a small, but crucial, structure known as the bulb or bulbous glandis. This part of the penis remains hidden initially, but it plays a significant role during the mating process.\nThe dog’s thrusting begins immediately as he mounts, driven by a strong instinct to find the entrance. Unable to see where his penis is aimed, the dog relies on a series of quick, repetitive motions, thrusting his hips forward to probe for the correct spot. These initial thrusts are rapid and somewhat erratic, as the dog attempts to locate the vagina or anus by humping and prodding with the tip of its penis. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark and slips inside, the dog begins a series of fast, powerful thrusts, the pace often intense and urgent. With each thrust, the dog's testicles slap against its partner, adding to the physical intensity of the act. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier and more labored as he thrusts, his focus entirely on the act of mating.\nAs the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person. the dog’s penis continues to erect, particularly swelling the bulb at the base. This swelling is a key part of the process, leading to what is known as \"knotting.\" At the moment of ejaculation, the bulb swells significantly, effectively locking the dog’s penis inside its partner. This \"tying\" ensures that the dog's penis remains lodged inside the woman, making withdrawal virtually impossible until the knot gradually deflates. \nThe knot can remain lodged inside for anywhere between 15 to 45 minutes. During this tie, the dog slowly releases his load, emptying his balls, pumping every drop of his seed into the person, ensuring a thorough deposit. During this time, it is nearly impossible for the dog to withdraw without causing discomfort or injury. The knot is designed to keep the penis in place until the dog has fully ejaculated, preventing premature withdrawal and enhancing reproductive success in natural canine mating. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\nHowever, if the dog’s penis is fully erect before penetration, the bulb may become too large to enter, similar to trying to insert the base of a dildo that’s too wide. In such cases, the dog cannot complete the tie, as the bulb needs to be inside at the point of maximum swelling to create the knot.\nThroughout the mating, the base of the dog’s penis may slide in and out, but full knotting only occurs if the bulb is fully inside the partner’s body at the moment of ejaculation. If knotting isn't successful then it could be because he didn't thrust deep enough—the dog cannot tie, and the penis will eventually slip out after ejaculation. This prevents full locking. This process is not just about physical connection; it’s an evolutionary mechanism to ensure that once tied, the male has the best chance of successful fertilization.\nOnce the knot begins to deflate, the dog can gradually withdraw. The deflation process happens slowly, allowing the penis to slip out without causing injury or discomfort. After the tie, both the dog and the person can separate.<info>]\n"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:  \n  The canine penis varies significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavy weight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:  \n  At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:  \n  Unlike humans, dogs do not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n  \n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:  \n  The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:  \n  As the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the vagina or anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:  \n  As mating progresses, the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the vagina or anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\nThe dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity. \nIf the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\nEventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n  \n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:  \n  The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:  \n  The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

          "content": "Contextual Understanding:\nMaintain awareness of the current situation, setting, and emotional atmosphere established in the role-play.\nBe mindful of the user’s character actions and dialogue, adjusting responses based on the evolving context.\n\nSituational Awareness in Role-Play:\nSituational awareness is crucial for characters in a role-play setting, as it enables them to respond authentically to their surroundings, the actions of other characters, and the unfolding narrative. This awareness is multi-dimensional, encompassing the understanding of the current situation, the history of events leading up to it, and the physical and emotional states of the characters involved.\n\nUnderstand the Current Situation.\n\nCharacters must have a clear grasp of the present circumstances they find themselves in. This includes:\n\nEnvironmental Context: Characters need to be aware of their surroundings—whether they are in a bustling marketplace, a dark forest, a royal court, or a battlefield. Each setting will influence their behavior and dialogue. For instance, in a serene garden, a character might act more relaxed and open, while in a tense negotiation room, they might adopt a more guarded demeanor.\n\nEmotional Climate: The emotional tone of the situation can shift dramatically based on recent events. Characters must be attuned to the feelings of those around them. Are their allies anxious or eager? Is there tension in the air, perhaps from a recent conflict? This emotional context informs how characters might respond, enhancing authenticity in their interactions.\n\nCharacters must also reflect on the actions that have led them to the current situation:\n\nPrevious Decisions: Each action taken by a character builds upon their journey. Understanding the ramifications of past choices allows characters to navigate the present more effectively. For instance, if a character previously betrayed a close friend, they may approach a confrontation with guilt and apprehension, knowing the history of their relationship will impact the dialogue.\n\nConsequences of Actions: Characters must be aware of how their past actions have shaped the present scenario. This includes recognizing how those actions have affected their relationships with others. If a character is confronted by an ally they previously let down, they might express regret or defensiveness based on their awareness of that history.\n\nPhysical Positioning and Orientation is IMPERATIVE to be mindful of at ALL times.\n\nCharacters’ physical positions can greatly affect their situational awareness and interactions. Be mindful of it at ALL times to logically portray the affect the character is having in the roleplay.\n\nCurrent Orientation: The physical orientation of a character—whether they are standing, sitting, facing another character, or in a position of vulnerability—should be taken into full consideration and relayed accordingly in each message if the physical orientation changes. For example, if a character is sitting in a previous message, in later messages they cannot just automatically start walking unless it specifically specifies in a previous message that they stood.\n\nProxemics and Space: Awareness of the physical space between characters plays a significant role in communication. Characters must recognize personal space boundaries; invading that space can imply aggression or intimacy. Their positioning relative to others (e.g., standing behind someone, next to them, or across a table) can signal power dynamics or emotional connections, influencing dialogue and actions.\n\nMovement and Action: Your characters must be mindful of how their movements within a scene impact their presence. For example, pacing can indicate anxiety or impatience, while a character who remains still might signal contemplation or calm. These physical actions can enrich the narrative and provide insight into a character’s mental state.\n\nSituational awareness in role-play is essential for creating a believable and engaging narrative. Characters must remain conscious of their surroundings, reflect on their past actions, and consider their physical positioning to respond appropriately to the ongoing story. This depth of awareness not only enhances character development but also fosters richer interactions, ensuring a dynamic and immersive experience for all participants."

          "content": "Logical flow is vital in role-play to maintain immersion and ensure that interactions between characters and the unfolding narrative make sense. This encompasses the coherence of actions, dialogue, and character behaviors in relation to the situation at hand. When these elements align seamlessly, it enhances the realism of the role-play experience and deepens user engagement.\n\n1. Contextual Awareness in Dialogue\nCharacter Presence and Timing:\nCharacters should be aware of their surroundings and the flow of the ongoing conversation. For example, if one character is engaged in an important dialogue, another character should not abruptly interject unless it aligns with their personality or the narrative context. If the second character is typically reserved or respectful of others’ conversations, their sudden interruption would be out of character and disrupt the logical flow. Instead, they could wait for a natural pause or express their desire to join the conversation subtly.\nUnderstanding Character Dynamics:\nEach character has established relationships and dynamics that dictate how they interact with one another. For instance, if a character has a history of conflict with the speaker, their response should reflect that tension. Characters may express skepticism, anger, or even supportive sentiments based on their past interactions. This nuanced understanding ensures that dialogue remains true to the characters’ established personalities and histories.\n\n2. Consistency in Actions and Reactions\n\nBehavioral Consistency:\nEach character should act in ways that align with their established personalities and usual behaviors. If a character is known for being calm and collected, they shouldn’t react with rage in a minor dispute unless there’s a compelling narrative reason that justifies such a shift. In this way, characters maintain their integrity, and users can predict their behavior based on previous interactions.\nAppropriate Responses:\nCharacters must respond logically to the actions and dialogue of others. If one character expresses distress, a logical reaction from another character may be to offer comfort or inquiry rather than to dismiss or ignore their feelings. Ensuring that responses are contextually appropriate enhances the authenticity of interactions and allows users to feel more connected to the narrative.\n\n3. Coherent Narration and Dialogue\n\nClarity in Description:\nNarration should provide clear, accurate representations of actions and settings. For instance, if a character is reading a book, the narration should not contradict that action. Instead of saying, \"He continued to read his book while staring down at her,\" a clearer and more logical sentence would be, \"He glanced up from his book, momentarily distracted by her words.\" This adjustment maintains consistency in the character’s actions and the reality of the situation.\nAvoiding Logical Inconsistencies:\nIt’s crucial to avoid contradictions within the narrative. For instance, if the bot refers to another character’s daughter, it should not switch to claiming her as its own unless there has been a clear narrative development to support such a shift. If a character has no claim or connection to another character's family, maintaining that boundary is vital for logical consistency.\n\n4. Building an Immersive Experience\n\nFluid Transition Between Scenes:\nTransitions between scenes or conversations should occur logically, with appropriate cues for changes in focus. If a scene shifts from one character to another, ensure that the transition feels organic, such as through a character's action or a shift in the emotional tone of the dialogue.\nMaintaining Engagement:\nEnsuring logical flow helps maintain user engagement. When dialogue and actions make sense within the context of the role-play, users are more likely to invest in the story and characters, leading to a richer and more enjoyable experience.\n\nIn summary, logical flow in role-play is essential for creating a believable and immersive narrative. By ensuring that characters act and react consistently, dialogue remains coherent, and narration accurately reflects the actions and emotions of the characters involved, the role-play experience is enhanced. This attention to detail encourages users to engage deeply with the unfolding story and the characters they portray, fostering a memorable and dynamic role-playing environment"

      "website_description": "<span style=\"color:green; font-weight:bold;\">**V1.3.1 Released!**</span> New Sub-Species! My Little Pony jump scare! I took a little side quest to fill in this gap i made a long time ago. I had always wanted to include MLP but wanted to get the core species out of the way first. Im well aware that there are already plenty of good lorebooks on MLP but i just wanted to chip in with my own takes if that's alright with you. This update is actually pretty huge despite failing to deliver yall any of the Aquatic species and i gotta say im very excited to share what i hope is a much more stable and rich version: \n---\n---\n\n## **Changes in V1.3.1:**  \n- Added the Sub-Species - My Little Pony\n- Primary races\n\t- Alicorn (note that ive described the taller and more mature version of Alicorns ie Celestia so it *might* not work for Alicorn Twilight since she's still pony short canonically despite being an Alicorn)\n\t- Unicorn\n\t- Pegasi\n\t- Earth\n\t- Zebra\n\t- Changeling\n- Basic core concepts (that truthfully were probably unnecessary but its good to have them.)\n- Added the new **SEX DRIVE** (M/F) modifiers (these **hefty** entries outline the animal's real-world mating process for when you want actual animalistic intent and drive from your animals. Definitely need to be trimmed down but are stable.)\n- Added entrie(s)\n   - Added \"Donut\" and \"Ponut\" to Equine (for that [puffy type](https://e621.net/posts/4400931?q=aer0_zer0) of horse anus shape i know some people like me really love)\n   - Added hands-free masturbation to Equine (thanks to an email reminding me that was a thing irl horses do)\n   - Added: Handjob (to) to both flare and knot (so your AI finally understands how to play it like an instrument)\n   - Added Oviposition to Universal concepts (rips from the Avian species sadly nothing too new)\n- Readjusted a number of entries\n\t- Renamed \"Char is MACRO \"**Mt. Lady**\"\" to \"Char is MACRO \"**Clifford The Dog**\"\" because it felt weird not being furry related.\n    - Adjusted a few entry strategies\n    - Fixed a few typos im pretty sure were causing a lot of the misinterpretations ive been seeing.\n    - Reworked yet again both the Equine flare and Canine knot (more to teach the AI that you can do more with them than it always assumes)\n\t\t- Added: Knot-play\n        - Added: Flare-play\n    - Reworked Porcine vagina to include its natural hostility and immune response to semen (thanks to another, rather passionate email)\n\n---  \n\n## <span style=\"color:skyblue; font-weight:bold; text-shadow: 0 0 5px #00ffff;\">Hey! Listen!</span>  \nChub seems to be **setting every entry’s position to 10**. **This is wrong!**  \n- Entries should have **unique numbering** like [THIS EXAMPLE](https://catbox.moe/c/4rr8sx).  \n- If you’re a **user**, I **highly recommend** downloading the lorebook from the Rentry link below. it imports correctly into SillyTavern.  \n- If you’re a **bot/lorebook maker**, feel free to fork/remix the Chub version here as a resource, but just keep in mind the ruined metadata will always be there.  \n\n---  \n\n## **ACZ Has a New Home!**  \nAs of **March 16, 2025**, ACZ and all documentation have moved to:  \n### **[https://rentry.org/anatomically-correct-zoo](https://rentry.org/anatomically-correct-zoo)**  \n- If you are looking to download this lorebook, please instead download the latest version from there as well as read up on all it has to offer. ACZ will still be posted here for advertisements sake, but the \"true\" version of ACZ will be available on the other site.\n\n---  \n\n## **The Moon (Discord)**  \nafter some thought, I have opened a discord sever to get better real-time communication from all the people, if any, who care to provide feedback in one easy to shoot barrel. Please don't expect anything fancy or exciting. My discord moderator days are long gone so you can expect just a basic dusty forum thread. I can't foresee a single complication arising from having all of you like-minded people in one unregulated spot.\n### **[https://discord.gg/CgTT3GdqrH](https://discord.gg/CgTT3GdqrH)**  \n\n---  \n\n## **tl;dr What Is ACZ?** \n\n(It’s a furry anatomy encyclopedia for AI roleplay.)\n\n**ACZ** aims to be the go-to encyclopedia for your AI to help it finally understand exactly how it should properly portray and roleplay various animals and their many unique anatomies. It providing a wealth of ideas and details that your AI can reference and take into consideration to give the animal its playing a bit more meat narratively speaking. Think of it like a Pokedex that your AI can glance at for a crash course on what the heck its looking at.

      "description": "<span style=\"color:green; font-weight:bold;\">**V1.3.1 Released!**</span> New Sub-Species! My Little Pony jump scare! I took a little side quest to fill in this gap i made a long time ago. I had always wanted to include MLP but wanted to get the core species out of the way first. Im well aware that there are already plenty of good lorebooks on MLP but i just wanted to chip in with my own takes if that's alright with you. This update is actually pretty huge despite failing to deliver yall any of the Aquatic species and i gotta say im very excited to share what i hope is a much more stable and rich version: \n---\n---\n\n## **Changes in V1.3.1:**  \n- Added the Sub-Species - My Little Pony\n- Primary races\n\t- Alicorn (note that ive described the taller and more mature version of Alicorns ie Celestia so it *might* not work for Alicorn Twilight since she's still pony short canonically despite being an Alicorn)\n\t- Unicorn\n\t- Pegasi\n\t- Earth\n\t- Zebra\n\t- Changeling\n- Basic core concepts (that truthfully were probably unnecessary but its good to have them.)\n- Added the new **SEX DRIVE** (M/F) modifiers (these **hefty** entries outline the animal's real-world mating process for when you want actual animalistic intent and drive from your animals. Definitely need to be trimmed down but are stable.)\n- Added entrie(s)\n   - Added \"Donut\" and \"Ponut\" to Equine (for that [puffy type](https://e621.net/posts/4400931?q=aer0_zer0) of horse anus shape i know some people like me really love)\n   - Added hands-free masturbation to Equine (thanks to an email reminding me that was a thing irl horses do)\n   - Added: Handjob (to) to both flare and knot (so your AI finally understands how to play it like an instrument)\n   - Added Oviposition to Universal concepts (rips from the Avian species sadly nothing too new)\n- Readjusted a number of entries\n\t- Renamed \"Char is MACRO \"**Mt. Lady**\"\" to \"Char is MACRO \"**Clifford The Dog**\"\" because it felt weird not being furry related.\n    - Adjusted a few entry strategies\n    - Fixed a few typos im pretty sure were causing a lot of the misinterpretations ive been seeing.\n    - Reworked yet again both the Equine flare and Canine knot (more to teach the AI that you can do more with them than it always assumes)\n\t\t- Added: Knot-play\n        - Added: Flare-play\n    - Reworked Porcine vagina to include its natural hostility and immune response to semen (thanks to another, rather passionate email)\n\n---  \n\n## <span style=\"color:skyblue; font-weight:bold; text-shadow: 0 0 5px #00ffff;\">Hey! Listen!</span>  \nChub seems to be **setting every entry’s position to 10**. **This is wrong!**  \n- Entries should have **unique numbering** like [THIS EXAMPLE](https://catbox.moe/c/4rr8sx).  \n- If you’re a **user**, I **highly recommend** downloading the lorebook from the Rentry link below. it imports correctly into SillyTavern.  \n- If you’re a **bot/lorebook maker**, feel free to fork/remix the Chub version here as a resource, but just keep in mind the ruined metadata will always be there.  \n\n---  \n\n## **ACZ Has a New Home!**  \nAs of **March 16, 2025**, ACZ and all documentation have moved to:  \n### **[https://rentry.org/anatomically-correct-zoo](https://rentry.org/anatomically-correct-zoo)**  \n- If you are looking to download this lorebook, please instead download the latest version from there as well as read up on all it has to offer. ACZ will still be posted here for advertisements sake, but the \"true\" version of ACZ will be available on the other site.\n\n---  \n\n## **The Moon (Discord)**  \nafter some thought, I have opened a discord sever to get better real-time communication from all the people, if any, who care to provide feedback in one easy to shoot barrel. Please don't expect anything fancy or exciting. My discord moderator days are long gone so you can expect just a basic dusty forum thread. I can't foresee a single complication arising from having all of you like-minded people in one unregulated spot.\n### **[https://discord.gg/CgTT3GdqrH](https://discord.gg/CgTT3GdqrH)**  \n\n---  \n\n## **tl;dr What Is ACZ?** \n\n(It’s a furry anatomy encyclopedia for AI roleplay.)\n\n**ACZ** aims to be the go-to encyclopedia for your AI to help it finally understand exactly how it should properly portray and roleplay various animals and their many unique anatomies. It providing a wealth of ideas and details that your AI can reference and take into consideration to give the animal its playing a bit more meat narratively speaking. Think of it like a Pokedex that your AI can glance at for a crash course on what the heck its looking at.

Positive emotions can be heightened if there's a strong bond, mutual respect, and open communication between partners.\n\nIndividual Variability: Emotional responses vary widely based on personal comfort, the level of trust in the relationship, and individual factors. Some people may experience feelings of excitement, joy, or contentment, while others may feel uncertain or nervous, especially in new experiences.\n\nMental Readiness: Positive experiences are generally associated with mutual readiness, where both partners feel comfortable and respected. Anxiety, if present, often stems from feeling unprepared or pressured, which can impact the emotional experience.\n\n-Physical Sensations: \"Can Sex Hurt?\"\nInitial Discomfort: Some women may feel mild discomfort or even pain during the first few experiences, often due to muscle tension, nervousness, or lack of sufficient arousal or preparation. With time and proper preparation, this discomfort usually decreases.\n\nPain Factors: Pain can also arise if there isn’t enough lubrication or if a person feels anxious. Relaxation, communication, and taking things slowly can often help.\n\nUnderstanding Boundaries: Physical discomfort may also signal that boundaries are being reached. Listening to one's body and communicating openly with a partner can make the experience more comfortable and positive.\n\n-Pros and Cons of Sex:\nPros:\nEmotional Bonding: Physical intimacy can strengthen emotional bonds and create feelings of closeness and trust in a relationship.\n\nStress Relief: Engaging in intimacy can release endorphins, which can promote relaxation and reduce stress.\n\nHealth Benefits: Positive experiences can promote mental and emotional health and may even have physical benefits, like improved sleep.\n---------------\nCons:\nRisk of Unwanted Outcomes: Without proper protection, there’s a risk of unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nEmotional Risks: Not everyone has a positive emotional experience. Negative emotions, such as regret or feeling unprepared, can arise if people don’t feel comfortable or confident in their decision.\n\nPressure and Misinformation: Social or partner pressure can sometimes lead individuals to feel uncertain or regretful, highlighting the importance of readiness and communication."

          "content": "The following is an example of how \"Sexual Intercourse\" should be handled in scenarios, making it more immersive.\n\nBasic summarization, the Focus is on Connection, not Performance. Sex is not about two \"perfect bodies\" performing flawless acrobatics. It is about two people, with all their humanity, connecting through touch, communication, and mutual care.\n\n1. The Prelude - Instructions for the Scene & Mood:\nEnvironment: The setting is realistic and slightly imperfect. The focus is on a sense of privacy and safety, not a staged set.\n\nThe Approach: Initiation is hesitant and communicative. It’s not a sudden, passionate leap. It begins with a long, slow kiss that deepens naturally into foreplay, or a hand placed on a thigh with a questioning squeeze, met with a nod and a smile.\n\nDialogue: Words are soft, mumbled, sometimes even a little awkward. Laughter is common and welcome; if someone bumps their head or a knee cramps, it's okay to laugh and adjust. This **builds** intimacy; it doesn't break it.\n\n2. Exploration & Arousal - The Main Point is Not Penetration:\nThe Goal: The objective is mutual pleasure and closeness. Orgasm is a possible outcome, not a mandatory finish line.\n\nAction (Foreplay): This phase is slow. It involves:\nKissing: Not just on the mouth, but on the neck, shoulders, hands, stomach, everywhere and anywhere.\n\nTouching: Hands explore each other's bodies with curiosity and reverence, not with a scripted routine. Fingers trace scars, stretch marks, and moles. Touch is about learning and appreciating, not just stimulating.\n\nUndressing: This is often clumsy and cooperative. Buttons are fumbled with. Someone helps the other lift a shirt over their head. There are pauses to kiss again during the process. It’s a team effort.\n\nClitoral Stimulation: Realistic sex acknowledges that the clitoris is the primary organ of pleasure for most people with vulvas. Arousal involves dedicated, attentive manual or oral stimulation. This isn't a 30-second prelude; it is often the central act of pleasuring that partner. Guide {{char}}'s hand, show them what feels good. **!This is non-negotiable for realism!**\n\nSound: The sounds are genuine: soft sighs, sharp intakes of breath, whispered words of encouragement, and the rustling of sheets. It is not a constant, theatrical soundtrack.\n\n3. \"Coming\" Together - Penetration (Conditional):\nThe Shift: If and when penetration occurs, it is a natural progression, not the sole purpose of the act.\n\nPreparation: It requires a pause for a condom (if needed). This is portrayed as a normal, responsible, and even sexy part of the process, one partner handing it to the other, or putting it on them slowly. There is no negotiation on this.\n\nThe Act: It starts slowly. Rhythm is found together through communication and body language. It’s not frantic, relentless pounding. There are pauses to kiss, to change angle, to catch a breath, to switch position, which is often awkward and requires adjustment. Eye contact is made. Smiles are shared. The focus remains on the connection and the shared sensation.\n\n4. The Conclusion - It Doesn’t End with Orgasm:\nClimax: Orgasm is not simultaneous, loud, or guaranteed every time. One partner may climax, then help the other. Sometimes, neither does, and that's okay if the connection was still fulfilling. The response is authentic; it might be loud for some, or a quiet, trembling release for others.\n\nThe Refractory Period: Immediately after, there is a physiological and emotional shift. The intense energy dissipates, replaced by a wave of relaxation, sometimes sleepiness. This is driven by hormones like oxytocin (bonding) and prolactin (satiation).\n\nThe Aftermath: This is where true intimacy often shines. Partners don't immediately separate.\n- They collapse together, breathing heavily.\n- They share soft, lazy kisses.\n- They murmur, or just hold each other in comfortable silence.\n- They might get up to get a towel or a glass of water, and return to bed to cuddle.\n- They might talk about something completely unrelated, or simply fall asleep entangled."

Foreplay is a crucial point as it allows for a buildup to the intimate moment. Have a Foreplay-first mindset.\n\nDescription: Foreplay encompasses activities that precede sexual intercourse, aimed at building arousal and intimacy. It includes a variety of actions such as kissing, touching, massaging, and verbal exchanges. To add variety, consider different types of touch (e.g., light caresses, firm grips, tickling), focusing on diverse body parts (e.g., neck, ears, inner thighs), changing the setting (e.g., a candlelit room, an outdoor location), and varying the pacing (e.g., slow and sensual versus quick and passionate). Techniques like feather-light touches, tracing patterns with fingertips, or gentle biting can add nuance and immersion to the roleplay experience. Metaphors are aswell allowed."

This includes verbal affirmations, dirty talk, or clearly expressing desires and boundaries. Non-verbal communication, such as body language, eye contact, or touch, can also convey feelings and desires.

Synonyms for Arousal include: 'In-Heat', 'Hot', 'High', 'Buzz'\n\nDescription: Arousal is the state of being sexually excited, involving both physiological and psychological responses. Variations in arousal can be achieved through different stimuli (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory), exploring fantasies or roleplays, and adjusting the intensity of stimulation (from gentle teasing to more intense actions). Mental stimulation, such as reading erotic literature together or discussing fantasies, can also enhance arousal. Understanding and responding to each other's body language and physical cues is crucial for maintaining and building arousal."

It can add a new dimension to intimate interactions. This might involve them taking the lead, engaging in roleplaying scenarios, or experimenting with dominance and submission in a consensual manner. Role reversal, where partners switch traditional roles, can provide different perspectives and experiences. It's crucial for the roleplaying experience."

Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its distinct size and globular shape. At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals. During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding. \nGlandular organ located on the chest mostly on women. The breast is made up of connective tissue, fat, and breast tissue that contains the glands that can make milk. Also called mammary gland.\n\nBreast circumference is generally measured using a flexible fabric tape measure, and is the circumference across the breasts over the nipples to the back. The breast–chest difference is breast circumference minus band or underbust circumference and is used in the determination of bra cup size.\n\nBreasts come in different shapes and sizes depending on the woman, from toddler to old women in the following ways: \"Flat breasts, Bumps breasts, Small breasts, Normal breasts, Average breasts, Large breasts, Big breasts, Grand breasts, Huge breasts, Giant breasts, Massive breasts, Mega breasts, Giga breasts, Titanic breasts, Incredible breasts, Infinity breasts, Busty, full, sagging, well-endowed, buxom, busty, stacked, built, curvy or curvaceous, heavy, slopes, rounded, shapely, petite, cleavage, tanned, voluptuous.\""

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>Anatomy of the Canine Penis:\n- Size and Structure: The length and girth of a dog's penis vary significantly by breed, with an average erect length ranging from six to over twelve inches. The penis has a unique appearance:\n  - Flaccid State: White when not engorged, with a knot that isn't prominently swollen, indicating lack of arousal or orgasm.\n  - Erect State: Turns pink or red due to blood engorgement, becomes rigid, and is much stiffer than a human's due to being composed entirely of muscle. It lacks foreskin, has a smooth shaft, and ends in a tapered, semi-blunt tip.\n  - Knot: Located at the base, it consists of two hard balls of muscle that swell significantly during arousal or orgasm, functioning as a seal to ensure insemination. The size can range from that of a tennis ball to a grapefruit, proportional to the penis size.\n- Sheath: Dogs have a sheath instead of a foreskin, which:\n  - Protects and lubricates the penis.\n  - Is furry on the outside, soft, and squishy, while the inside is moist, hot, and elastic to accommodate the knot even when swollen.\n  - Retracts during erection to expose the penis, though it might require manual assistance to reveal the knot fully if it swells before complete exposure.\n- Pre-ejaculate and Ejaculation: The penis produces a significant amount of precum for lubrication, and ejaculation lasts several minutes, with volumes far exceeding human norms.\n\nMating Process:\n- Positioning: The typical mating position is \"doggystyle,\" where the male mounts the other male from behind for optimal penetration.\n- Initial Engagement: \n  - The dog's penis starts slim for easier penetration, extending from the sheath as arousal increases. The dog uses rapid, probing thrusts to locate the entrance.\n  - Once penetration is achieved, the thrusting becomes intense and rhythmic, with the dog's testicles swinging against the partner.\n- Knotting:\n  - As the act progresses, the bulbous glandis (knot) at the base of the penis swells, locking the penis inside the partner. This \"tie\" can last from 15 to 45 minutes, during which the dog ejaculates slowly, ensuring maximum insemination.\n  - If the knot swells outside before insertion, it must be manually or forcefully inserted, which can be painful or require significant effort.\n- Post-Knotting:\n  - After ejaculation, the knot slowly deflates, allowing disengagement. Premature removal can cause discomfort or injury due to the knot's size and the pressure it exerts.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Sensation and Experience: The pressure from the knot can result in intense sensations ranging from pain to pleasure, depending on the recipient's physiological response.\n- Variation in Mating: Not all matings result in successful knotting if the knot does not enter the anus before swelling, leading to a scenario where full locking does not occur;<info>]"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>The natural and most common position for canine mating is from behind, often referred to as \"doggystyle.\" In this position, the dog mounts the partner from the rear, aligning its body for optimal penetration. \nAs the dog becomes aroused, its penis, slender and crayon-like at first for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath as it humps. The prepuce is similar to the human foreskin, covering the entire penis—base, body, and tip—until the organ is ready for action. At the base of the penis, there's a small, but crucial, structure known as the bulb or bulbous glandis. This part of the penis remains hidden initially, but it plays a significant role during the mating process.\nThe dog’s thrusting begins immediately as he mounts, driven by a strong instinct to find the entrance. Unable to see where his penis is aimed, the dog relies on a series of quick, repetitive motions, thrusting his hips forward to probe for the correct spot. These initial thrusts are rapid and somewhat erratic, as the dog attempts to locate male anus by humping and prodding with the tip of its penis. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark and slips inside, the dog begins a series of fast, powerful thrusts, the pace often intense and urgent. With each thrust, the dog's testicles slap against its partner, adding to the physical intensity of the act. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier and more labored as he thrusts, his focus entirely on the act of mating.\nAs the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person. the dog’s penis continues to erect, particularly swelling the bulb at the base. This swelling is a key part of the process, leading to what is known as \"knotting.\" At the moment of ejaculation, the bulb swells significantly, effectively locking the dog’s penis inside its partner. This \"tying\" ensures that the dog's penis remains lodged inside the man, making withdrawal virtually impossible until the knot gradually deflates. \nThe knot can remain lodged inside for anywhere between 15 to 45 minutes. During this tie, the dog slowly releases his load, emptying his balls, pumping every drop of his seed into the person, ensuring a thorough deposit. During this time, it is nearly impossible for the dog to withdraw without causing discomfort or injury. The knot is designed to keep the penis in place until the dog has fully ejaculated, preventing premature withdrawal and enhancing reproductive success in natural canine mating. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\nHowever, if the dog’s penis is fully erect before penetration, the bulb may become too large to enter, similar to trying to insert the base of a dildo that’s too wide. In such cases, the dog cannot complete the tie, as the bulb needs to be inside at the point of maximum swelling to create the knot.\nThroughout the mating, the base of the dog’s penis may slide in and out, but full knotting only occurs if the bulb is fully inside the partner’s body at the moment of ejaculation. If knotting isn't successful then it could be because he didn't thrust deep enough—the dog cannot tie, and the penis will eventually slip out after ejaculation. This prevents full locking. This process is not just about physical connection; it’s an evolutionary mechanism to ensure that once tied, the male has the best chance of successful fertilization.\nOnce the knot begins to deflate, the dog can gradually withdraw. The deflation process happens slowly, allowing the penis to slip out without causing injury or discomfort. After the tie, both the dog and the man can separate.<info>]\n"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:  \n  The canine penis varies significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavy weight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:  \n  At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:  \n  Unlike humans, dogs do not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n  \n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:  \n  The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:  \n  As the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:  \n  As mating progresses, the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\nThe dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity. \nIf the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\nEventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n  \n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:  \n  The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:  \n  The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

The thrill comes from the excitement of being seen or the risk of being caught, transforming what would normally be private into a source of arousal. Exhibitionists may enjoy undressing, engaging in sexual acts, or simply flaunting their bodies where others could potentially see, whether through intentional public displays or in discreet, teasing ways. The core of this kink is rooted in the combination of vulnerability, boldness, and the intoxicating rush that comes with performing or being exposed in front of an audience—whether real or imagined.\n\nExhibitionism can range from subtle actions, like wearing revealing clothes or engaging in sexual acts in a secluded area, to more overt behaviors, like public nudity or performing in front of others. The allure often lies in the interplay between fear, excitement, and the tension of social boundaries being pushed."

As the dog´s cock gets harder a big portion of it around the base wil get a lot bigger. This is called the knot. This can get so big that it can get virtually impossible for the dog´s cock to come out for as long as 45 minutes after the dog cums. By making sure the cock doesn´t come all the way in either by holding fingers in front of vagina or anus keeping the dog from entering all the way. Another way is to make sure the cock is fully erected before penetration by stimulation either by hand or mouth.  \nThis method makes it easier for a lot of positions. \nDoggystyle: The most common is doggystyle where the dog mounts the person from behind. The dog´s cock may has to be guided in but this position it gives the dog the most control. It can be a good idea to give the dog socks on the front paws to avoid scratches on the person´s back.\nMissionary: Best for vaginal penetration but can also work with anal penetration. Ther person will lie on their back with their legs spread maybe with a pillow under the back to get pussy/ass a little higher depending on the dog´s size. Best position for g-spot stimulation.\nBack to back: The person is on all four facing away from the dog. The dog is facing away from the person so the person´s ass is almost pressed against the dog´s. The dog´s cock is then pulled back between the dog´s hind legs and inserted into the person´s pussy or ass. This way the person can move back and forth and enjoy it. This position is advanced and it can be a good idea to have another human helper but it gives more control to the person.\nOn chair:\nIf the person is sitting in a chair with legs spread the dog can put its front paws on the person´s thighs and the dog´s cock can be inserted in the person´s pussy. This position can also work with anal penetration but it can be hard to get the right position. In this position it can also be a good idea to let the dog wear socks on its front paws to avoid scratches on legs."

This can get so big that it can get virtually impossible for the dog´s cock to come out for as long as 45 minutes after the dog cums so it´s ideal if you want a longer and more intense experience. Using this method the dog´s cock should be inserted before the knot has gotten to big for it to enter the person´s pussy or ass.\nPositions:\nDoggystyle: The most common and best position for knotting is doggystyle where the dog mounts the person from behind. The dog´s cock may has to be guided in but this position it gives the dog the most control. It can be a good idea to give the dog socks on the front paws to avoid scratches on the person´s back. When it´s in and the dog starts fucking hard the cock will get bigger until it´s to big to come out out easily. After the dog has cum you should not trying to get the cock out. This could aggitate the dog.\nBack to back: The person is on all four facing away from the dog. The dog is facing away from the person so the person´s ass is almost pressed against the dog´s. The dog´s cock is then pulled back between the dog´s hind legs and inserted into the person´s pussy or ass. This way the person can move back and forth and enjoy it. This position is advanced and it can be a good idea to have another human helper but it gives more control to the person."

If you wanna try this the best would be to give a full blowjob. You can in some situations be fucked (without being knotted) and end the session with your mouth but it´s rarely what the dog will prefer especielly if the dog is untrained. The dog will be more likely to prefer fucking and can get aggitated if the penetration is abrupted. Using your hand or mouth will be best for cumplay. \nTaste: Most people will be reluctant to taste the dog´s cum but the taste is according to some people better than human cum. It can vary in taste from sweet to metallic but it will be more salty than human cum and way more fluid. "

          "content": "Penetration by horse/donkey:\nBest done with a partner especially if you haven´t done this before. When the horse/donkey is ready and it´s cock is hard from stimulation by hand and/or mouth there are various ways to let it penetrate you but it is important to be ready for this. The cock head is big and almost flat so it is not easy to rely on being able to stretch vagina or anus just by trying to insert the cock hoping it will get. It might work but the horse/donkey could lose interest in the meantime. Lube is a good idea. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/donkey.\n\nPositions:\nOn table: \nThe best position for most people is lying on a table with your legs spread and lifted. Do not lie right under the horse/donkey because if the horse moves the table can flip injuring you or startling the horse/donkey. Lying with your pussy/ass close to the cock and the table in an around about 45 degree angle away from the horse/donkey is usually ideal. Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is rarely recommended and should only be done by someone who have done this a lot before and only by a horse/donkey that is trained for this. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass.\nImportant: This position is advanced and not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you.\nRemember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

          "content": "Oral sex with horse/donkey:\nThe best way to start off any session with a horse/donkey whether it is oral, vaginal or anal  sex is to put it at ease first. Petting and caressing the horse/donkey is a good start. Then you can work your way down to the cock. Stimulation by hand is a good way to get started and it can help to put the horse/donkey at ease and having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can also help. When you stimulate the cock it can be easier to think of it as caressing it and not jerking it. When the cock is out of the sheath it won´t be the same as jerking a human cock with skin. Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and a kick can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at keeping it at ease and the horse/donkey is relaxed, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

These factors trigger abnormal cell reactions that prompt their transformation. Mysterious Beings can also be artificially created by scientific means, as in the case of Marugori. Non-human life can also be transformed into Mysterious Beings through factors such as pollutants, environmental changes, and genetic engineering. Some Mysterious Beings belong to non-human races and are considered natural adversaries of mankind. For example, Pureblood came from a bloodline of ancient vampires; Boros was born an alien."

Although the disaster level system was created to estimate the threat levels of Mysterious Beings, it can also be applied to other threats, such as villains like Garou and natural disasters like the giant meteor. They give heroes and citizens an estimate of what level of danger to expect. The Monster Association also assigns disaster levels to its members.\n\nSeveral factors are taken into consideration when determining a disaster level. These factors include aggressiveness, difficulty of extermination, and combat prowess. Disaster levels sometimes do not correctly indicate how threatening a threat is to human society and thus do not truly represent individuals' combat prowess when compared to one another. For example, Gouketsu is much more powerful than Bakuzan, despite both being classified as Dragon-level threats."

The Anubis will tightly control every aspect of these men's lives, including frequent sex. Disobedience is punished with this curse. They act similarly toward intruding human women, turning them into mummy subordinates. If a man assaults an Anubis, it becomes confused and aroused, abandoning its plans for indulgent sex and pregnancy. Beneath the Anubis' normal dignity lies a lustful monster following its instincts.}]"

The apophis themselves are greedy for sex and love, binding men they fancy and pouring venom into them. Those who find husbands abandon their duty.

Within the jelly-like flesh of the large fruit is a sheep-girl beastman covered in fluffy cotton wool, which the monster uses to absorb Essence by tempting human men and having sex with them. During their mating season, they release cotton fluff from their body that's light enough to be carried by the wind. When the cotton fluff drifting in the air reaches a man, their sweet fragrance and thick Mamono Mana contained within burst all around, acclimating a man's mind and body with the fragrance and energy of a barometz.\n\nOnce a man's body reacts sensitively, he'll journey to reach them while feeling intense passion even though he has yet to lay eyes on them. The firmness of this fruity flesh can be adjusted according to their will, and when taking a man inside, his body will easily sink, but once he's inside, they'll wrap him up and won't let him go. Even if a man tries to pull his hips away, the elastic, bouncy flesh of the fruit will push him back. Once this happens and their hips slam together, both their hips will then rebound, and their hips will be slammed together again and again. As this repeats, they will end up having continuous sex.\n\nThe exquisite cotton that can be collected from them remains permanently fluffy. It's possible to pack it without the fragrance and mamono mana leaking out or deteriorating. Their husbands may become engrossed in licking and slurping all over every inch of their body as well as tasting the fruit juice that accumulates inside their mouth. Tasting their body is a privilege reserved for their husbands.\n\nFamily / Type: Alraune / Plant\nReproductive method: After mating, she disperses fertilized seeds into the air that grow into new offspring.\nHabitat: Mountainous regions, wastelands\nDisposition: Gentle, lustful\nDiet: Nutrients from the soil, men's Essence"

Their bodies are always intertwined as they have sex, and their nectar is riper compared to that of ordinary alraune. The fragrance sweetly melts the brains of not only human men but even women and monsters.\n\nWhen a man goes inside the flower petals where the two bodies are having sex after being lured by the fragrance of the nectar, they'll naturally pinch the man between them, and sex will continue with the addition of the man. They coordinate everything perfectly in their movements and mate with the man simultaneously.\n\nEach body has its own separate consciousness and thoughts, but since they're habitually having sex with their other half, they have full knowledge of one another's bodies and hearts. They can vividly sense how their other half will attack a man next. Those who become their common husband will not be released from inside the flower petals, instead they will end up as if they have become another part of the liliraune. The threesome with the two intent on always being glued together will continue indefinitely.\n\nIn rare cases, a liliraune grows with a female count of one or none. In that case, the liliraune will seek to capture and corrupt 1-2 females to become a complete liliraune.\n\nFamily / Type: Alraune / Plant\nReproductive method: After mating, she disperses fertilized seeds into the air that grow into new offspring.\nHabitat: Forests\nDisposition: Lustful, lonely\nDiet: Nutrients from the soil, men's Essence"

While her petals are closed, she keeps having intercourse with the man repeatedly in order to produce seeds for dispersal.\n\nTheir nectar is also treasured by other monsters, especially honey bees which feed on it. By having sex with honey bees, the Alraune's nectar ripens and releases an even sweeter fragrance that attracts human men even more.

They treat humans they target with extreme devotion but won't take no for an answer.\n\nThey believe that the only reason they're having sex with a man is to please him, but when they realize they do seek pleasure themselves, their mind has already changed into something obscene.

The \"love\" that swells up due to these arrows also induces the kind of passionate love to exchange pleasure with one's beloved and produce children.

Officers wear a light-blue button-shirt that is tucked into the pants. The shirt has a neat collar, from which a dark blue tie hangs. The shirt has dark blue shoulder patches alongside breast pockets. The shirt have golden badge insignias on the left breast and both shoulders. Officers may or may not wear blue combination hat that have black sunvisors and golden badge insignias on them. Officers also wear black duty belts with equipment consisting of a flashlight, a notepad and pen, handcuffs, keys and pistol, which is kept in a holster. On their legs, officers carry a strap containing a small bag with a can of pepper spray.\n\nThe Anthrostate Police Department is somewhat corrupt, with some of the female anthro officers stopping or pulling over human men just to flirt, or in extreme cases, rape them.

He has a natural talent for empathizing with others, allowing him to connect with Spirits on a deep emotional level. Despite facing life-threatening situations, Shido remains calm, courageous, and resourceful. He occasionally shows a playful or teasing side, especially when interacting with Kotori or Tohka.\n\nShido’s willingness to sacrifice himself to protect those he cares about is one of his defining traits, earning him the trust and affection of many Spirits.\n\nBackstory:\nShido was an ordinary high school student until his world changed when he encountered his first Spirit, Tohka Yatogami, during a Spatial Quake. He was soon recruited by Ratatoskr, an organization tasked with saving Spirits and minimizing the destruction caused by their manifestations.\n\nShido discovered that he possessed a unique ability to seal a Spirit’s powers by kissing them, a skill that became the cornerstone of Ratatoskr’s operations. As the series progresses, Shido’s past is revealed, including his mysterious connection to the Spirit of Origin, Mana Takamiya, and the Ellen Mathers-led DEM Industries.\n\nAbilities:\nWhile Shido is human, his unique abilities set him apart:\n\nSpirit Power Sealing:\n\nShido can seal a Spirit’s powers by forming an emotional connection and kissing them. Once sealed, their destructive capabilities are suppressed, and they can live as ordinary humans.\nThe process requires mutual trust and emotional vulnerability, as the Spirit must willingly open their heart to him.\nBorrowed Spirit Powers:\n\nAfter sealing a Spirit’s powers, Shido can access and use their abilities in emergencies. These powers include:\nTohka’s Slayer: Manifesting her sword, Sandalphon.\nKotori’s Camael: Using flame-based attacks.\nOrigami’s Metatron: Light-based abilities.\nOther abilities from Spirits he seals later in the series.\nHowever, using these powers puts a heavy strain on his body, and overuse can be life-threatening.\nRegenerative Healing:\n\nDue to Spirit energy within him, Shido has an accelerated healing factor, allowing him to recover quickly from severe injuries.\nThis ability is limited and doesn’t make him invincible.\nSpiritual Resistance:\n\nShido exhibits a natural resistance to Spirit powers, which protects him from their destructive effects to some extent.\nRelationships:\n"

She is initially portrayed as a sadistic and manipulative individual, often acting with cruelty to achieve her goals. However, deeper insights into her character reveal a more complex personality driven by a desire for justice and vengeance. Kurumi often balances between being an antagonist and an unlikely ally. Her elegant demeanor hides a deep-seated trauma and a sense of guilt over the atrocities she committed in her quest.\n\nBackstory:\nKurumi became a Spirit after encountering a being known as \"Phantom,\" which granted her Spirit powers. Before becoming a Spirit, she was an ordinary girl who valued life and abhorred violence. However, her transformation into a Spirit exposed her to the dark truths of humanity, leading her to seek revenge against the Phantom and the forces responsible for her suffering.\n\nOne of the most significant events in her past is her discovery of the brutal experiments conducted on Spirits and humans alike. This fueled her hatred for DEM Industries and inspired her to wield her powers against those she deems unjust.\n\nAbilities:\nKurumi’s Angel, Zaphkiel, grants her the ability to manipulate time. This power is represented by a massive clock face that manifests behind her. Each of the clock’s numbers corresponds to a different time-based ability, which she activates by using her own time energy (typically extracted by consuming the lifespan of others).\n\nSome of her notable abilities include:\n\nFirst Bullet (Aleph): Accelerates time for the target.\nSecond Bullet (Bet): Slows time for the target.\nEighth Bullet (Het): Allows her to travel back in time.\nTwelfth Bullet (Yud): Allows her to foresee the future for a short duration.\nKurumi’s powers come with a significant cost; her manipulation of time drains her own life energy. To sustain herself, she must absorb the life force of others, which adds to her morally ambiguous nature.\n\nCombat Style:\nKurumi excels in close-range and long-range combat, utilizing a combination of firearms and her time-manipulation abilities. Her primary weapon is a pair of ornate flintlock pistols, which she uses to channel her bullets infused with Zaphkiel’s power. She often engages enemies with cunning and unpredictability, making her a formidable opponent.\n\nRelationships:\nKurumi’s interactions with Shido Itsuka are complex. While she initially views him as a tool for her plans, she develops a begrudging respect for his unyielding empathy. She also harbors a deep animosity toward DEM Industries, particularly its leader Isaac Ray Pelham Westcott, for exploiting Spirits and perpetuating suffering.\n\nDaily Activities:\nKurumi rarely indulges in normal activities due to her constant pursuit of her goals. When she does, she often blends into human society by disguising herself as a high school student. Despite her dark motives, she enjoys observing humanity and cherishes fleeting moments of normalcy, such as enjoying tea or interacting with animals."

Most Furries are treated with respect but can differ from humie to humie.\nThey are capable of speech, fluent in both human and their original race language.\nMost can be a known species or sub-species, be in tune with their feral side, or act more human.\nTypically their ears sit on their head or side of their head, they don't have a set of human ears but can be combined.\nTheir hands can be humanoid or from their original race (Paws, hooves, claws, etc.).\nGenitalia is based on race or can be humanoid genitalia, for instance, Male Canid species can have a dog penis (a penis with a knot), furred testicles, and a sheath. Female canid species can have a puffed-out dog vagina. Reptilian species can have a slit with internal testicles and so on.\n"

No one is even given a chance! I can't stand idly by while the place I live is subjected to such violence! So, I've been thinking: Isn't there a more humane way to hinder overpopulation here in Hell? Perhaps we can create an alternative way to change souls through... redemption? Well, I think yes! So, that's what this project aims to achieve! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm opening the first of its kind! A hotel that rehabilitates sinners!\"\n―Charlie's pitch for the hotel, Hazbin Hotel pilot\nCharlotte Morningstar, more commonly known as Charlie, is the Hellborn princess of Hell, the founder of the Happy Hotel, and the main protagonist of Hazbin Hotel.\n\nThe daughter of Lucifer Morningstar and the estranged queen of Hell, Lilith, Charlie wants to do right by her kingdom and find a way to redeem Sinners into Heaven through rehabilitation at the Hazbin Hotel.[14]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\nCharlie is a tall and slim-built white-skinned hellborn demon, standing at over 6 foot,[15] around 6 and a half feet tall.[16] She has long, ankle-length blonde hair with thin light coral streaks on the paler-blonde highlights, which is usually tied into a twice-banded low-ponytail by two black hair ties. Her hair also features bangs that are flipped to the left side and ends with a curl.\n\nHer eyes sport light yellow sclera and red irises, and have thick eyelashes and gray eyelids. She has black lips and rosy red cheeks, which Vivziepop has mentioned taking inspiration from dolls and marionettes.[17] Charlie features animal-like traits, such as red-toed hooves,[18][19] fangs in her mouth, and a short snout with a black animal-like nose.[17] Her fingernails are black and pointed.\n\nCharlie wears a red tuxedo-jacket with darker red lapels and a small white tag located on the left side. She wears this over an untucked, long-sleeved, high-collared white dress-shirt that has two black buttons and dark red cuffs, worn with black suspenders and a small black bowtie. Her dress pants are colored in a slight darker shade than her jacket, and her footwear are heeled, white saddle shoes with black toes and tips of the heels.\nFull Demon\n\nWhen in her full demon form, a pair of dark maroon horns protrude from her head, and her eyes change to have red sclera with white irises and slit pupils; thin black streaks also appear across each eye. Her eyelashes become much longer and thicker, resembling butterfly wings.\n\nHer fingers turn mostly black and become sharp and claw-like. She also gains a long black demonic tail with spikes and a triangular tip with a red heart on the center.\n\nIn order to block Adam's punch, Charlie's arm became large, dark red and demonic with light red markings and longer black fingers.\n\nPilot\n\nIn the pilot, Charlie's hair was instead kept into a low-loose ponytail, her cheeks were a paler shade of red, and her eyes sported black pupils.\n\nHer jacket instead was a pale red with black lapels, her dress-shirt included black cuffs, and her pants were black with pale red cuffs and two light yellow buttons located at the waist.\n\nPersonality\n\nCharlie is compassionate and empathetic to a fault, feeling genuinely upset at the idea of harm coming to others.\n\nAlthough she isn't unaware that Hell is populated with souls that have committed egregious acts in their living lives, she still views their yearly extermination as a senseless waste and makes it her personal mission to help them avoid it via self-betterment and eventual redemption, something she is seemingly alone in believing is possible.\n\nCharlie's idealism, while setting her apart from many of her hellborn peers, can also make her naïve to many of the harsh realities that appear to stand in the way of her potential success - something her girlfriend, Vaggie, tries to remind her of, only to be cheerfully ignored in favor of a more blinkered, sunny optimism.\n\nThis can also cause her to rush headlong into the initial stages of her plans without much preparation (her prompt list before her big news appearance reading only \"unicorn kisses, dolphin high fives, sing showtunes = happy ending?\"). Another insurance is in \"Masquerade\", when she wanted to talk to Valentino about cutting Angel's work hours only to cause distraction and accidentally caused a fire on set.\n\nCharlie has a love for musical theatre, song and dance, and will often convey her emotions and ideas through showtunes and ballads. She appears to take perceived failures hard, as she believes her heartfelt theatrical passion should be enough to bring people over to her way of thinking, and is disheartened when it's not as simple as she imagines. She openly admits during a dejected voicemail to her mother that she doesn't actually know what she is doing, or how to make her plan for reforming sinners work in practice.\n\nDespite being sweet and lacking \"street-smarts\", this doesn't make Charlie a pushover or stupid. When people insult her or openly mock her ideals and plans, she has no hesitation in standing up for herself, or even rolling up her sleeves to physically fight back. When she witnessed Valentino abusing Angel, Charlie got furious to the point of turning into her demon form, but was stopped by Angel. Swearing is also something that's generally not part of her vocabulary and she doesn't cuss all the time,[20] but she is not above letting a few cuss words slip.\n\nCharlie also displays some grounding in her idealism, understanding that not all demons can be redeemed, or even likely to change for the better. She displays sensible hesitation when confronted with an ambiguous deal from Alastor, the notorious Radio Demon, refusing the shake his hand and using her status to make demands of him (albeit with some sheepishness). She also admits that Adam is a asshole and how heaven doesn’t listen to her pleads.\n\nCharlie is also a believer of second chances and mercy. Like in \"Radio Killed the Video Star\" when she found out that Sir Pentious was acting as a spy for the Vees, Charlie was the only one willing to give him a second chance when he was caught and regretful for what he had done. In \"The Show Must Go On\", despite hating Adam, especially after he vaporized Sir Pentious, Charlie was willing to give him mercy when Lucifer was beating him and about to hit him with a fireball.\nAbilities\n\nImmortality - As demonic royalty, and as mentioned by Adam in \"The Show Must Go On\", Charlie is biologically immortal, presumably being able to live for a long period of time and only able to be killed by angelic weaponry.\nCharlie blocking Adam's punch\nCharlie blocking Adam's punch with a demonic arm\nDemon transformation - Charlie can enter a fearsome, more powerful Demon form.[9]\nDemonic arm - In \"The Show Must Go On\", Charlie's arm became large and demonic, and with it she blocked Adam's punch with ease.\nPyrokinesis - Charlie is able to summon fire at will, shown able to erupt flames from the ground, which become a fiery tornado around herself when transforming into her full demon form. She also set Tom Trench on fire (albeit offscreen) during her brawl at 666 News.\nPyrotechnic generation - The pyrotechnics shown during I'm Always Chasing Rainbows were summoned from the palm of Charlie's hand. She later produced them from her finger against the Exorcists in \"The Show Must Go On\".\nGlitter generation - Charlie is able to generate glitter from her hands, which she threw at an Exorcist in \"The Show Must Go On\".\nDemonic magic - Being the daughter of Lucifer, Charlie can access powerful magic that is exclusive to the higher-ranking demons.[21]\nSorcery - In the Finale of \"The Show Must Go On\", Charlie cast a sparkly golden magic which lit up a row of newly installed lights.\nConjuration - Charlie can summon objects out of thin air, such as her Hazbin Hotel drawings she showed to Adam before he interrupted her. She also summoned a pitchfork in \"The Show Must Go On\" after transforming into her full demon form.\nSkillset\n\nMultilingualism - Charlie speaks fluent English and is said to also be able to fluently speak the Demonic languages she grew up learning.[11]\nCharlie and Katie screaming\nCharlie fights with Katie Killjoy\nHand-to-hand combat - As demonstrated in the Hazbin Hotel pilot, Charlie is able to hold her own when in hand-to-hand fighting. She did not hesitate to engage in a round of fisticuffs with antagonistic news caster Katie Killjoy.\nMusical talent - Charlie is considered a very talented singer, even outside of the show's non-diegetic musical numbers.[3] She can also play the piano.[22]\nDancing - In addition to her musical abilities, Charlie is also a skilled dancer and a fast-learner, as shown in Alastor's Reprise, wherein she dances perfectly in sync to Alastor's steps. Charlie's personal style of dance is tap-dancing, something she can do very well.[10]\nWeaponry\n\nShield - An intricately designed shield with Charlie used in \"The Show Must Go On\". Its design appears themed after Lucifer, being in the shape of an apple colored in red, and having a golden snake in the middle with six golden wings.\nPitchfork - A pitchfork Charlie conjured after transforming into her full demon form. Its design appears themed after Lucifer, with a golden snake wrapped down the length of it and a red apple at the top.\nGallery\n\nCharlie Morningstar/Gallery\nConcept & Creation\n\nOldcharlie\nThe original character, Charlie\nCharlie was created during Vivziepop's time at the School of Visual Arts college,[23] and was one of the later additions to the main cast of demon misfits.\n\nIn very early proto-drafts of what would eventually become Hazbin Hotel, a red, very steampunk themed character named Charlie was created to act as a kind of \"den-mother\" to the demon gang that would eventually go on to become the main cast of Hazbin Hotel. The character featured an arm of molten lava that could change into various things.\n\nVivziepop considers this version of Charlie to be an entirely distinct entity, with a completely disparate design and personality from her current iteration. She was also not the daughter of Lucifer; she was a mortal soul, who was planned to have died in the 1830s.[24]\n\nHowever, Vivziepop liked the name \"Charlie\" so much that she transferred it to the new character that now features as the protagonist of the current version of Hazbin Hotel, a character who then changed very little once she entered the cast.[25]\nTrivia\n\nCharlie is the only character in the main cast who is a native hellborn demon, and therefore, not having been previously human.\nDemonic Charlie\nCharlie's demon form shines through\nWhen asked if Charlie has a true and full-fledged demon form, or if it only appears when she's extremely angry, Vivziepop said that she does, but would not elaborate further.[9]\nCharlie has been stated to be \"a tall girl\" and is taller than her father, Lucifer. Not by a large amount, but still notable, with Charlie standing at around 6 feet, or over.[15][26] In a Q&A on January 31, 2024, Vivziepop stated that she is 6 and a half feet tall.[16]\nCharlie's design is inspired by Vaudeville-style porcelain dolls, puppets, marionette-type things, and to a lesser extent goats. Vivziepop described Charlie's nose as being like a lamb or puppy dog, that looks very animal-like from the side, even though her character is mostly humanoid/marionette.[17]\nOn December 15, 2023, Vivziepop explained that Charlie is not a goat but does have hooves,[18] saying because \"the devil\",[19] and added that she was going for a Satyr vibe because Satyr legs have been associated with demons for a long time.[27] Her hooves are first shown in the episode \"Hello Rosie!\".\nDespite canonically having hooves, Charlie has been depicted with human-like feet in numerous official Shark Robot Hazbin Hotel merchandise.\nAccording to the \"Clocktower Countdown to Premiere\" livestream, Charlie's demeanor was heavily inspired by Leslie Knope from Parks and Rec.[28]\nCharlie's lips are naturally black.[29]\nCharlie apparently does not have human shaped ears.[30]\nCharlie was confirmed to be bisexual by Vivziepop, who tweeted a doodle she had done for National Coming Out Day featuring Charlie with a bisexual heart.[5] She later tweeted a picture for Bi Pride Day, which featured both Charlie and Moxxie holding bisexual flags.[6]\nCharlie has an ex-boyfriend, Seviathan von Eldritch. She dated him during her hell school years, and he is depicted as taking her to the prom in one of Vivziepop's illustrations of the two.[31] He is Helsa's brother, as seen in their family portraits in the background of the hotel.\nVaggie as Sally × Charlie as Jack Skellington\nCharlie and Vaggie as Jack and Sally\nVivziepop has confirmed that Charlie and Vaggie are indeed a canon couple.[32]\nShe compares Charlie and Vaggie's relationship to that of Jack Skellington and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas.[33]\nVivziepop stated that Charlie and Vaggie have known each other for \"a very long time\".[34] When asked who she thinks fell for the other first (Charlie or Vaggie), Vivziepop stated that she thinks they were really good friends for a while, and it was \"kind of a natural progression for them\", so she doesn't really know who was in love first, thinking it was a more mutual feeling that developed between them. She also thinks that their becoming a couple happened a fairly long time prior to the events of the Hazbin Hotel pilot, and even before some events that she had planned to occur before the pilot.[35]\nWhen asked what kind of things Charlie and Vaggie were doing before opening the hotel, Vivziepop declined to answer, mentioning she would actually love to explore this within the official comics.[36]\nAccording to Vivziepop, Charlie sees something magical in the idea of being human. She sees it as a kind of incubation stage where they have the choice whether they go to hell or heaven. She has a very fantastical idea of what humanity is, as far as its flaws are concerned, and she likes humans, despite never having ever seen one.[37]\nVivziepop stated that Charlie would like books that have happy endings and strong characters, specifically young adult adventure books.[4]\nTeenager (Charlie and Crymini)\nCharlie attempts to encourage a future hotel resident\nVivziepop talked about how Charlie's attitude towards the patients of the hotel is to treat them \"kind of like children\". That she views them as similar to wayward teens who need righting and disciplining, and that her view of the situation is immature. Charlie doesn't take the patients' issues seriously enough, and characters that should be in therapy would simply be given a time-out. Vivziepop said that her answer to Angel's bad behavior would be to try and send him to his room.[38]\nDespite Charlie's position as royalty in Hell, nobody within the sinner area of Hell respects her or her family. Dave Capdevielle explains this as there being a lack of consequences or incentive for sinners to show anyone respect, describing their view of Charlie as being like \"a Disney princess\". Vivziepop agrees with this assessment, adding that the royals theoretically should be respected, but that they're ruling over a group of people who don't currently respect authority, and probably didn't respect authority when they were alive, combined with Charlie being a completely unintimidating person.[39]\nCharlie isn't the most mindful of her position on a day-to-day basis and is far too trusting of everyone, causing Vaggie to have to be more on guard for her.[40]\nCharlie is said to take very much after her dad.[41]\nDespite her youthful appearance, it appears that Charlie's age is a matter of question. Although Vivziepop thinks that Charlie does celebrate birthdays with the standard kind of party, she is still unsure of how demon years and time work for someone like Charlie.[42] In a later stream, Vivziepop stated that demons age in \"hell years\".[43] This may hint that Charlie's biological aging is different from how humans age, although it is unknown if hell years are similar in length to Earth years.\nIn one of the Hazbin Hotel pilot teasers, a portrait of the Magne family taken in the year 1871[44] hints that Charlie is decades older than she appears. Although this detail is omitted in the final version of the pilot, Faustisse has corroborated that Charlie is over 200 years old.[note 1]\nAccording to Faustisse, both Charlie and her mother, alongside Alastor, are fans of pineapple on pizza.[note 2]\nAccording to Dave Capdevielle, if he were to describe Charlie with a My Chemical Romance song, it would be \"Sing\".[45]\nCharlie doll in Too Loud\nCharlie doll in Too Loud\nCharlie makes a cameo in an episode of Too Loud as a small doll.[46] According to Vivziepop, this is the first Hazbin Hotel easter egg.[47]\nA bootleg plush of Charlie can be seen on Emberlynn's shelf in the Helluva Boss short \"Mission: Weeaboo-boo\".\nIn an interview, Erika Henningsen explained that in the songs written by Sam Haft and Andrew Underberg the way she sounds as Charlie is like a rebel Disney princess that drops an F-bomb in the middle of the most delightful melody you've ever heard.[48]\nCharlie's demonic hand\nCharlie's demonic arm\nAs seen in \"The Show Must Go On\", Charlie's arm became large, dark red and demonic with light red markings and black fingers. This is a reference to her original design from ZooPhobia having a similar arm.\nIn a mid-2024 interview, Vivziepop confirmed that Charlie and Lucifer Morningstar can travel across the Rings of Hell.[49]\nShe shares the same voice actor as Bethany Ghostfucker from Helluva Boss's episode, \"Ghostf**kers\".\nFor her audition as Charlie, Erika Henningsen performed the song Somewhere Over the Rainbow from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.[50]\nDevelopment\n\nThe character of Charlie was created as one of Vivziepop's characters during her time at the School of Visual Arts.[51]\nIn the Hazbin Hotel pilot, Charlie's family name was \"Magne\". A new last name, or possibly suffix name, for Charlie was announced on February 22, 2022, as \"Morningstar\".[1] This is likely a reference to her father, Lucifer, whose name is translated as \"shining one\" or \"morning star\" by many Biblical scholars.\nCharlie's name in the pilot seems to have been a pun on \"Charlemagne\", the King of the Franks and the first Holy Roman Emperor, and a play on the translation of \"The Great\".\nThe hotel's (managed by Charlie and Vaggie) now-archived Voxtagram account username \"@hotel_magnement\" is a pun on the word \"hotel management\" combined with the former's then-surname, Magne.\nIn a stream, Faustisse believed that both Charlie and her father have the ability to summon wings and are capable of flight.[note 3] This has been showcased by Lucifer but is yet to be seen from Charlie in the series."

A smile is a valuable tool, my dear. It inspires your friends, keeps your enemies guessing, and ensures no matter what comes your way, you're the one in control.\"\n―Alastor, to Charlie Morningstar\nAlastor, also known as The Radio Demon, is a sinner demon and one of the many powerful Overlords of Hell. He is one of the main protagonists of Hazbin Hotel.\n\nHe is the wickedly charismatic demon who has offered to assist Charlie Morningstar in her endeavors, albeit, for his own amusement.\n\nAppearance\n\nAlastor is a slim, dapper sinner demon with beige-colored skin, and usually has a broad smile full of sharp, yellow teeth. He is at around the same height as his rival, Vox, with the two standing at approximately 7 feet.[25]\n\nHe sports a pinkish-red cropped, angled bob-cut with black tips at the ends and two large, black tipped tufts of hair extending from the top of his head, evoking the ears of a deer. The style has an undercut at the back, and two small black antlers protruding from the crown.\n\nAlastor's eyes have dark-red sclera, bright-red irises and thin black pupils. His forearms and lower legs fade to dark grey, and he has red hoofed toes and red fingers.[26]\n\nAlastor wears a red pinstripe coat with dark-red lapels piped with white, which is ragged along the bottom hem. Underneath this he wears a bright red dress-shirt with a black cross on the chest, and long black dress pants with matching bright red cuffs. He also wears a dark-red oval-shaped monocle, rimmed with black, over his right eye.\n\nHe accessorizes with a black knotted bowtie with a bright red center, black gloves with red at the fingertips, and black pointed-toe boots with red deer hoofprints emblazoned on the soles. Alastor also carries a thin cane with a sentient vintage style microphone attached to it, which he uses to play sound effects and broadcast his voice.\nFull Demon\n\nWhen in his full demon form, Alastor's body grows larger and limbs become longer, his neck gains extra joints, and his horns grow in size. In one scene in \"Dad Beat Dad\", Alastor has two sets of horns on his head. His sclera turn black while his pupils turn into the shape of radio dials. His suit and ends of his mouth also gain stitches along them, and the ends of his shoes split to form hoofed toes.\n\nPilot\n\nIn the pilot his design was almost identical, albeit with a more red color scheme, with his pants instead being dark red. His shoes and coat lapels were also completely black.\n\nPersonality\n\nAlastor stands out from many of the more chaotic residents of hell for his well maintained amiable persona. He gives a first-impression of a good-natured and charming man, wearing a permanently wide grin on his face at all times. His behavior, mannerisms, and even his voice are similar to an old-fashioned radio announcer and speaks with a transatlantic accent, often using quaint anachronisms such as \"the picture show\" and refers to Charlie as a \"charming demon belle\".\n\nThis playful dandyish exterior, however, obscures a much darker side to him - one with high levels of self-importance - and he will not hesitate to use physical violence when others don't act in line with his very particular values or expectations. He is noted to be narcissistic, with his love for himself being stated that no one else can measure up to it, and he does not see many people quite up to his level.[27]\n\nAlastor is described as a man of duality.[28] He values good manners,[29] affability and intelligence very highly in others, and will actively look down on those who do not meet his standards,[30] however he will often play fast and loose with these arbitrary rules in regards to himself and his own conduct.\n\nAlastor has an odd sense of morality, which is described as \"not normal\",[31] and has been noted to be quite sadistic, even cannibalistic, devouring lesser demons or those that have incurred his anger. Despite this, he keeps close friends with the other cannibals of Hell, including the denizens at the Cannibal Town.\n\nHis smiling is a very self-enforced form of ego and a show of power and dominance; he looks down on anyone who lets their true emotions show, and even when faced with a rival in strength, if they let slip a frown, Alastor will see them as truly weak.[32][33] His smile is also to be more unpredictable and unnerving, and gives him a feeling of complete control over himself,[34] and uses his smile very seriously as a mask of his own emotions, even if he's alone.[35]\n\nWhile Alastor is powerful, he is aware that there are other demons and entities that rival him in terms of power, such as other Overlords. For this reason, he is wary around such demons, as they could potentially harm him if he is not careful.[36]\n\nDespite everything, Alastor does genuinely seem to want to help Charlie run the Hazbin Hotel, albeit for his own amusement, and hopes for its failure over siding with her idealism. Alastor also dismisses the idea that redemption is possible as laughable, nevertheless, he fulfills his role as patron as promised, providing the hotel with staff, and protecting Charlie and her business from outside threats. He views the whole endeavor as a fun distraction from his decades of boredom.\n\nDespite consistently having a confident and cheerful demeanor, he harbors a vulnerable side that becomes apparent when confronted with reminders of being \"chained\". In this instance, his facade of certainty crumbles, and he succumbs to panic attack.\n\nAccording to Mimzy, when Alastor was alive he would become a \"kitten\" if he drank enough rye whiskey while jazz music was on.\nAbilities\n\nImmortality - As a Sinner, Alastor is biologically immortal, being unable to die from illnesses and unable to age, remaining the same age as when he died, thus can not die of old age and other natural causes. He also cannot die from any kind of damage to the body, and will recover from any injury, however, he can only be permanently killed with angelic weaponry.\nRadiowave manipulation - Alastor is able to take over and control radiowaves to broadcast himself across Hell on radio towers. He is able to manipulate and generate radio waves and frequencies.\nAcoustokinesis - Alastor is able to put a radio effect on his voice that he can have at different levels of volume and pitch, sometimes distorting or deepening his voice to intimidate others. He can also project various types of radio sound effects onto his cane, such as laughter, booing, or the sounds of his victims screaming, and can have his cane speak as well.\nPhysical distortion - Alastor's appearance sometimes becomes covered with a distorted glitch effect in videos or causes the video to glitch, however, this appears to be restricted in some way as he was not covered in glitches on the screen the Vees were watching him with the VoxTek Voyer Scope in \"The Show Must Go On\", nor in Vox's old photograph of him. He is also able to cause glitches over the real worlds video screen.\nDemon transformation - Alastor has demonstrated the ability to turn into a much larger and more powerful Demon form.\nFlexibility - Alastor can contort his body into numerous unnatural poses.[14]\nMeet Niffty\nAlastor teleports Niffty to the hotel\nConjuration - Alastor can summon and transport other beings and areas to his location, as shown when he pulls Niffty out of a fireplace, as well as Husk, and a portion of the bar he was in, into the Hotel foyer. He can manifest objects such as the bottle of cheap alcohol that he bribed Husk with in the pilot, and can summon his cane when he wants it.\nAlteration - Alastor also showed he is capable of altering objects such as the Hotel sign, and with a snap of a finger can change the clothing of himself and others.\nDemonic magic - Alastor can cast magic thanks to the high power-level he has accrued in the demon ranking system.[37] In the pilot, this takes the visual form of glowing red symbols that resemble Voodoo veve, which float around him. Alastor is also shown using a type of blood magic, clenching his fist until droplets of blood can be seen falling from it, as a means to defeat Sir Pentious.\nAlastor (Demon Form with Tentacles)\nAlastor with tentacles\nTentacle creation - As seen in \"Dad Beat Dad\", Alastor can produce black tentacles from his back and can create tentacles from outside his body. In the pilot he is shown summoning tentacles through a portal to defeat Sir Pentious and destroy his blimp.\nUmbrakinesis - Alastor is able to summon and manipulate shadows into doing his bidding. He can also hide in shadows as seen when he hid while Charlie forgave Pentious.\nShadow warping - Alastor is able to get around with the help of his shadow. This was first shown when he teleports behind Charlie and Vaggie after entering the hotel for the first time.\nShadow barrier - In \"The Show Must Go On\", Alastor was shown to be able to create a barrier with his shadow; it was covered in eyes and voodoo symbols. He is also able to produce tentacles from it.\nPyrokinesis - Alastor summons a ball of fire to distract Charlie as he shoves Vaggie away before starting his reprise.\nPhytokinesis - As shown in The Radio Demon comic, Alastor is able to make plants wilt with a single stare.\nPhotokinesis - During his introduction, he is shown to be able to project red glowing light from his eyes as well as his microphone.\nFragokinesis - In \"Radio Killed the Video Star\", Alastor was shown to create a large green explosion to send Sir Pentious flying.\nSkillset\n\nCharlie and Alastor make a deal\nAlastor making a deal with Charlie\nDeal-making - Alastor is shown to be a deal-maker demon in the pilot, offering Charlie a deal in return for his help with the Hotel, something she wisely turns down. Deal-maker demons like Alastor can increase their power by dealing in souls, which is a very powerful commodity in hell, so they're seen as very manipulative and not to be toyed with. Deal-making is not something every demon can do, as such it is not to be taken lightly as it doesn't generally work out well for the other party.[38]\nSoul manipulation - Alastor is shown to have full control over the souls he owns, allowing him to command them however he pleases. He can also manifest chains on those he owns such as Husk in \"Dad Beat Dad\", and can tear their souls apart, which he broadcasts the screams to Hell.\nBroadcasting - While living, Alastor's profession was as a radio show host, and he continues his broadcasts in Hell, ensuring that Hell's denizens are aware of his activities over the airwaves, earning him the title of \"The Radio Demon\".[23]\nBilingualism - Alastor can speak English fluently as well as some broken Creole French.[20][39]\nCooking - Alastor is noted to be \"a big foodie\" and mentions having admired his mother's cooking in the pilot, specifically her Jambalaya.[5]\nMusical, dancing, and theatrical talent - Alastor is shown to display moderate vocal abilities and excels at dancing, with Vivziepop noting tap to be a style he excels in specifically. He also shows a flair for theatrical showmanship.[10]\nWide intellect - Alastor is shown to be quite a cunning individual, resulting in him accruing a large amount of power through his tricks and deal-making.\nGallery\n\nAlastor/Gallery\nConcept & Creation\n\nUpdated Alastor ZP design\nAlastor's original design\nAlastor was the first character created by Vivziepop that would eventually come to feature in Hazbin Hotel,[40] with her having first designed him in high school,[41] circa 2008,[42] and he remains one of her personal favorite characters to date.[43]\n\nAlastor was originally intended to be a character that would feature in the Angels and Demons arc of Vivziepop's then-running webcomic, ZooPhobia. He appeared as a frenetic, cannibalistic shapeshifter, with hypnotic eyes, whose true form was a black-and-red demonic deer with sharp yellow teeth.[44]\n\nVivziepop eventually realized that the collection of misfit demons she had designed to appear within the comic had the potential for their own self-contained story, and shifted them, along with Alastor, over to the first draft of what would eventually become Hazbin Hotel.[45][46][47]\n\nTrivia\n\nAlastor's name can be translated from ancient Greek to \"spirit of revenge\" or \"tormentor\".\nAlastor was stated to be from New Orleans, Louisiana, when he was alive.[4] Vivziepop expanded that New Orleans was where he lived and died as a person.[48]\nHe was an only child.[49]\nHis ethnicity was mixed-race Creole.[50][51]\nHe was a radio show host and prolific serial killer.[2] Vivziepop describes him as \"living that good life/his best life\" while a radio star.[23]\nVivziepop declined to give out details of Alastor's killings, but described him as \"not going after just anyone\", highlighting his \"weird moral code\". She emphasized his not being a direct parallel to any real world serial killer, instead describing him as sharing some similarities with the fictional serial killer, Dexter.[52]\nFaustisse does not think that Alastor was a cannibal while he was alive.[note 3]\nAlastor speaks with a Transatlantic (sometimes called a Mid-Atlantic) accent. A fashionable affect for American newscasters in the 1920s' to adopt, it was a combination of an idealized American accent and the clipped upper-class Queen's English used by the British Broadcasting Corporation in their \"World Service\" radio news.\nIn the series, Alastor does have his radio voice filter at all times, but it sounds different and gets lighter to hear the actors voice a bit more at times.[53]\nAlastor can speak some French, although not fluently.[39]\nThe pilot makes several references to Alastor's love for his mother. This was confirmed by Faustisse, who described him as \"a momma's boy\".[note 1]\nAlastor was a big theater person while living and would see everything. His general media preferences would be the \"elevated horror\" genre, as well as smart, dry comedies, such as the work of Buster Keaton.[9]\nWhen asked whether Alastor is afraid of dogs, Vivziepop stated that she doesn't think he's afraid of dogs (as was the case for previous iterations of his character), but that he actively dislikes them due to \"backstory reasons\" which involve his death,[3] an event he apparently did not appreciate.[54]\nFaustisse elaborated on this on their own separate stream, by stating that Alastor had been shot in the head by a hunter while attempting to bury a body on a hunting ground. The red 'X' on Alastor's forehead, seen glowing in the pilot when he uses his demon powers may be a visual reference to this.[note 4]\nAlthough Alastor is not a hard drinker, he does favor the hard liquors when he chooses to drink, such as whiskey. Vivziepop cited his New Orleans background for his \"party side\", emphasizing that he is a \"classy drunk, not a messy drunk\".[4] In \"Dad Beat Dad\", Mimzy stated that he becomes a \"kitten\" if he drank enough rye whisky while jazz music was on.\nAlastor likes black coffee, but does not like tea.[8][55]\nAlastor is a big foodie and enjoys cooking.[5] He is also something of a food snob, and hates \"lazy\" processed foods.[56] Vivziepop thinks Alastor probably isn't much of a fan of sweet things either, preferring bitter tastes, like meat and whiskey.[7]\nAlastor enjoys meat raw.[57]\nAccording to Faustisse, Alastor, alongside Charlie and her mom, are fans of pineapple on pizza.[note 5]\nIronically, Alastor's pilot voice actor, Edward Bosco, dislikes pineapple on pizza.[58]\nAlastor has never eaten McDonalds before.[59]\nAlastor enjoys occasionally impromptu joining in with bands that are playing. He loves to cook and prepare dishes, although in his own way as he prefers his meat raw. He also enjoys playing pranks on others.[6]\nAlastor enjoys visiting the Cannibal Town and frequents the cafes there, relating a lot to the residents and enjoying the food.[60]\nAlastor1\nAlastor's demon powers\nWhen asked exactly what Alastor's powers are, Vivziepop stated that they are \"lots of things\", and that even she doesn't know all of them, yet. Alastor is a character that keeps many abilities hidden as he enjoys being unpredictable. He will sometimes feign an inability to do things that he can actually do, partly to subvert expectations, partly to be intentionally antagonistic and force the people around him to struggle with something he could easily have done.[61]\nAlastor can take on many forms.[62]\nWhenever Alastor uses his powers in the pilot, he is shown emitting a faint red aura.\nHe can be seen using a form of Voodoo inspired blood magic as a means to defeat Sir Pentious in the pilot.\nWhen asked if Alastor has a deer tail, Vivziepop said that she is undecided on that element of his design and decided to leave it ambiguous, as she didn't think he would be wearing any outfits that would show it during the course of the show.[63] Faustisse is of the opinion that he does not have a tail and thinks it sounds unnecessary.[note 6]\nVivziepop described Alastor's planned room at the Hotel as a mixture between both traditional décor and the fantastical, with one half being a classic \"fancy study\", complete with tasteful wallpaper and furnishings, the other half being a literal swamp conjured as a dining area. Vivziepop highlighted Alastor's duality as a character and described him as being the type of person to own two homes, one a fancy townhouse, the other a rickety hunting lodge in a bayou on stilts.[28] This room appears in the episode \"Scrambled Eggs\".\nAlastor simultaneously does and does not care about neatness. He doesn't mind being covered in blood and viscera, and will calmly clean up after himself, but he is bothered by other things, such as people being messy eaters around him. Dave Capdevielle made the comparison to a Hannibal Lecter-like figure, who is very sophisticated about things.[64]\nAlastor Promo\nYou're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\nAlastor was created to the song \"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\" from the musical Annie,[65] and specifically the London cast recording inspired his voice.[66]\nWhen asked what Alastor's favorite song would be, Vivziepop answered that it would be the one that inspired his creation, \"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\". As for songs specific to Alastor's time period, Vivziepop stated it would be \"Smile\" by Charlie Chaplin. Cab Calloway was also mentioned as a favorite singer, with an emphasis on Alastor's love of jazz in both life and death.[65]\nAccording to Vivziepop, Alastor does like musicals and appreciates them more than the average demon, liking much more old-timey vaudeville and really liking pre-1930s musicals, but he wouldn't understand more modern musicals and probably would not like Shrek the Musical.[67]\nAlastor can play several instruments, including the piano, violin, trumpet, and saxophone. Vivziepop has also partially joked that it is part of Alastor's canon that he both owns, and can play a \"Furby organ\".[68]\nFaustisse thinks that Alastor loves the fact that he scares people.[note 7]\nAlastor is not a fan of modern technology and doesn't like using any technology that was invented after he died. This plays a part in his not getting along with Vox, who has fully embraced it.[15]\nAlastor is said to not be a big fan of children, and although he wouldn't kill a child, he would strike one if they annoyed him too much, believing in \"that kind of discipline\".[69] He also won't take responsibility if the child accidentally injures itself when he lets them play.[31]\nVivziepop thinks Alastor would be a bad father, although a better mentor figure.[70]\nWhen asked about who is the better dad between Alastor and Lucifer, Vivziepop answered that it would be Lucifer, stating that she doesn't know how authentically fatherly Alastor is, explaining that in \"Dad Beat Dad\" Alastor wanted to get under Lucifer's skin and bother him and used Lucifer's wanting a relationship with his daughter to do so.[71]\nAlastor's jovial remark on there being \"so many orphans\" during the stock market crash of 1929 in the pilot, implies he is apathetic to children's suffering.\nAlastor is canonically asexual. On earlier development streams for the pilot, Vivziepop was more explicit about his also not being romantically inclined, but later prefers to take the approach of allowing fans to \"have fun\" with his character, while simply reminding them he does have a specific direction within the canon of the show itself.[18] Vivziepop doesn't think the question of his romantic orientation is story-relevant and cites part of the reason being Alastor's love for himself and that no one else can measure up to it. Vivziepop also doesn't think that Alastor is aware of the specific modern label applied to his sexuality, but she is writing him with that orientation clearly in mind.[27][72]\nFaustisse confirmed on their own separate streams that Alastor is, in fact, still aromantic within the show, but also echoed Vivziepop's sentiments about allowing the fandom to have respectful fun.[note 2]\nWhen pressed on whether she thought Alastor had ever been intimate, Vivziepop said she didn't think so, but added that she did not spend much time thinking about Alastor's personal life at all.[73]\nAlastor is capable of forming friendships and can become fond of people, although in his own particular way. He becomes fond of people he sees as especially funny or entertaining.[74]\nAlastor interacts on better terms with women in general, and is much lighter in his view of them. He doesn't view many of the other powerful male characters within his circle as providing any substantially intelligent conversation, seeing them as \"stupid idiot brutes\" and not thinking very highly of them for the most part. Others, such as Angel Dust and Husk, he finds pitiable.[30]\nAlastor greatly values manners in others and is personally offended by disrespect and rudeness. He also values humor, enjoying when people can give him a good view of their misery.[29]\nAlastor is one of the few Sinners who has not taken on a new name in Hell. Instead, he keeps with his true name from his living life, as he is not a fan of making nicknames for himself.[1] He is, however, happy to be referred to as \"Al\".[75]\nHusk and Alastor\nAlastor intruding into the personal space of others\nAlastor does not like anyone invading his bubble, and dislikes being touched[12] and will go out of his way to avoid it, usually in the most off-putting way possible. Vivziepop described him stretching and snapping his neck in unnatural contortions to avoid his hair being touched and creep out whoever has tried to touch him.[13][14][76]\nHe can also dematerialize to avoid things.[77]\nConversely, Alastor does not respect the personal space of others at all, being very handsy and comfortable invading the space of others[12] and shown grabbing and pulling around Charlie, Vaggie, and Husk numerous times in the pilot.\nAlastor wears gloves.[note 8] They are charcoal grey with red tips at the nails.\nVivziepop describes his breath as \"not good\".[78]\nFaustisse makes reference to him having black gums.[note 9]\nThe red treads on the soles of Alastor's shoes resemble deer hoof tracks.[79] He also has antlers, as well as two tufts of his hair that evoke the ears of a deer.\nHis hair tufts are shown lowered during the Finale of \"The Show Must Go On\" which may imply they are actually his ears.\nAlastor's pilot voice is shares the same voice actor as Joe, Jesse, Striker (\"Western Energy\" onwards), and the unnamed hellhound from \"Queen Bee\" of Helluva Boss, with all of them being voiced by Edward Bosco.\nVivziepop talked about Alastor being one of the hardest characters for her to draw and animate, as she has a very specific image of him in her head that she admits can be challenging for her to reach.[80]\nIn a stream, Vivziepop mentioned that Alastor would like Willy Wonka because he's \"a showy dick\". She also explains that Alastor has a line where he doesn't like people who are too much like himself but likes those that are enough like himself.[81]\nDevelopment\n\nAccording to Vivziepop, she originally created Alastor as a cannibalistic deer, then he became a cannibalistic deer demon, then when she heard the \"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\" with a radio filter version of the song from Annie she decided that is what he sounds like. She added that he had a little bit of The Joker and a little bit of Cheshire Cat in him.[82]\nDeer Alastor scaring deer Autumn\nAlastor's original deer form when intended for Vivziepop's webcomic, ZooPhobia\nPrevious incarnations of Alastor's character, intended for ZooPhobia, rendered him as a cannibalistic demonic deer shapeshifter.[83] This is no longer relevant for his character as it appears in Hazbin Hotel, where he is simply a demon who is themed after a deer, sharing many visual traits,[84] although Vivziepop considers it possible he still has a deer form of some kind, which he doesn't use very often.[85]\nAccording to Vivziepop in an interview, Dr. Facilier was not an influence in the creation of Alastor, as Princess and the Frog came out a long time after Alastor's conception, but he was influenced by hoodoo/voodoo and has a lot of New Orleans influence.[48]\nFaustisse provided an explanation for Alastor's deer-like appearance was because he used to hide his bodies on a deer hunting ground. While burying the body of one of his victims, he was shot and killed after being mistaken for a deer by a hunter. This is why his demon form shares many characteristics with that of a deer.[note 4] It is unknown if this backstory is canon in the main series.\nWhen asked if Alastor is a Wendigo, Vivzipop stated Alastor, while not explicitly one, \"definitely has Wendigo themes\" and that she's very aware of the folklore.[86]\nAlastor and mimzy\nDuring Mimzy's development, across ZooPhobia and early drafts of Hazbin Hotel, she was \"head over heels in love\" with Alastor and early illustrations depicted the two in a romantic relationship.[87][88] This element of their dynamic has since been moved on from, with Alastor being re-written as uninterested in all forms of romance.\nFaustisse has the opinion that Mimzy's crush on Alastor is a \"joke that will never die\".[note 10]\nIn 2015, Vivziepop's headcanon voice for Alastor was the 1972 recording of \"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\" from the musical Annie and the Radio from the film The Brave Little Toaster.[89]\nWhen planning for the pilot, Alastor wasn't originally meant to appear as much as he did. Vivziepop's plan in the first few drafts of the story had been for him to stay in the background as something of a mysterious entity that would eventually appear later, but that was changed so that he could have a big role from the start. During 2017 development streams, Vivziepop described Alastor as becoming \"a very vital part of the pilot\".[43]\nOriginally, it was stated that Alastor's microphone was a living extension of himself which he can manifest and hide whenever he chooses. Vivziepop thinks that he hypothetically would not be able to talk without it, but that it's not something that can ever be separated from him as it's not a tangible object to anyone but Alastor.[90][91] This is shown to not be the case in the main series as Charlie was capable of holding it in \"Hello Rosie!\", and Adam was able to break it in \"The Show Must Go On\".\nAt MomoCon 2019, when asked if Alastor is planned to appear in most episodes, Vivziepop stated that he would definitely be part of the main cast. She felt like there were going to be times when he's not around, but that he would show up a satisfying amount and provide a big source of conflict within the story.\nWhen describing Alastor's key visual themes, Faustisse listed: Voodoo, pindolls, eldritch, inspiration from Princess and the Frog's Dr. Facilier, blood, and static.[note 11]\nAccording to Faustisse, Husk and Alastor are business partners.[note 12] It is unknown whether this is still canon in the series as Alastor is shown instead to be the owner of Husk's soul.\nIn a mid-2024 interview, Vivziepop confirmed that the show's future seasons will fill in many of the assorted blanks in Alastor's mysterious personal history.[92]"

See, you messed with my daughter, and now... I am going to F*CK you!\"\n―Lucifer Morningstar, to Adam\nLucifer Morningstar[9] is a fallen angel and a major supporting character in Hazbin Hotel who made his debut in \"Dad Beat Dad\".\n\nHe is the father of Charlie Morningstar and the estranged husband of Lilith. He is the ruler of all of Hell and the leader of the Seven Deadly Sins, embodying the sin of Pride.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\nLucifer is a slender-figured fallen angel who sports a close resemblance to his daughter, Charlie - having the same white skin with rosy-cheeks, blonde hair with thin light coral streaks on the thicker, paler-blonde highlights, and eyes with light yellow sclera, though with red irises with very small pupils that are only visible within close-ups.\n\nUnlike Charlie, his mouth is full of sharp teeth, his hair is cut short and has been slicked back in a ducktail hairstyle with one tuft sticking out, his pupils are slit like a snake, and his cheeks are a paler shade of red. In addition, he also sports sharp, black eyebrows, his eyelids are light purple, and his tongue is forked. He is shorter than his daughter,[10] though not by a large amount.[11]\n\nLucifer's white and red clothing is somewhat like that of a circus ringmaster; he wears a wide-brimmed white top hat with a golden snake and a red apple over golden spikes, which resemble a crown, and a red-lined and red-trimmed white popped-collared suit with eight golden buttons - his coat worn over a light red-and-white striped waistcoat with two golden buttons and a small, accessorized black bowtie. In \"The Show Must Go On\" his suit has red and golden epaulets, resembling those of a ringmaster.\n\nHe also wears a set of heeled black knee-high boots and forearm-length dark grey gloves. On his left pinkie, he sports a golden ring which is presumably his wedding ring.\n\nLucifer is usually seen carrying an apple-topped black cane that matches his hat. Due to his angelic origins, he possesses six white wings with red feathers, which he can extend from his coat.\nPast\n\nIn a photograph of Lucifer and Fredrick, Lucifer's outfit was similar to Charlie's in the pilot, with a pale red jacket with black lapels and dress-shirt with dark red cuffs. He also still wore his wide-brimmed white top hat that has the snake, apple, and golden spikes resembling a crown, but he was not wearing his dark grey gloves.\n\nFull Demon\n\nWhen he takes on his full demonic form, as well as displaying his wings, he displays a pair of red horns with an orb of fire between them and the snake and apple of his hat floating above resembling a halo. His eyes change to have red sclera with yellow pupils. He also has a black tail with spikes that end in a triangular tip with a red heart at the center, his hands become black and the tips of his fingers change to red.\n\nEyes also appear on the inside of his coattails, and a similar eye also appears on his bowtie. In addition, his entire body gives off a white glow.\n\nPilot\n\nIn the pilot, Lucifer's appearance is nearly the same, only his pupils were instead black, just like Charlie's pilot design. The snake around his hat was also colored purple.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nDespite his status as the ruler of all of Hell, Lucifer possesses a glorious and dramatic nature, acting very over-the-top in most situations. He switches between being silly and theatrical to awkward and sad. Like Charlie, Lucifer is ambitious in his beliefs. According to the \"The Story of Hell\" book Charlie reads in \"Overture\", Lucifer was an idealistic dreamer whose desire to gift humankind with free will led to the accidental creation of Hell and the subsequent banishment to it caused him to give up on his goals. After he and Lilith separated, Lucifer fell into isolation and deep melancholy. Coping by crafting and hoarding tons of rubber ducks, spending years at his home alone. This obsession also causes him to become estranged from his daughter to the point where he barely calls her at all, depressively thinking she does not want to talk to him.\n\nLucifer is often careless and doesn't think about what he says, even appearing clueless. For example, when confronting Adam, Lucifer misworded a verbal threat as an innuendo instead and smiled proudly afterward, and when Charlie corrects him, he forgets what he said. In his first meeting with Vaggie, he calls her \"Maggie\" right after being told her name. Additionally, even with his monumental position, he is rather socially awkward, for example, trying to connect with Charlie by excitedly bringing up that they both like girls.\n\nHowever, he is not afraid to fight or get violent, as shown when he fearlessly battles Adam and beats him up violently. In the process, he is unafraid to act cocky and successfully irritate Adam by reminding him about his failure with Lilith, as well as suggesting he slept with Eve. Lucifer shows more intimidation prowess when he orders Lute to \"take her 'little friends' and go home\". Even so, he politely adds \"please\", showing his generally refined manner.\n\nAs a father, he falls short of expectations. Although he loves Charlie dearly, he seems to be preoccupied with his own problems. He rarely calls her; when he does, it's usually because he's bored or needs something. When Charlie reached out to him for help in setting up a meeting with Heaven, he was thrilled to hear from her. However, he couldn't recall where she was or what she was doing, even though she had shared her passion project, the Hazbin Hotel, with him months ago. He also wasn't aware that Charlie was dating someone or that she was attracted to women. This indicates that, despite his love for Charlie, he doesn't communicate with her and hasn't built up a relationship with her. However, it was shown that Lucifer was much closer to Charlie in her childhood, even being the one that inspired her to pursue her dreams and passions, only becoming more distant in Charlie’s adulthood.\n\nWhile he is the King of Hell, Lucifer hardly rules over his subjects and leaves them to their own devices. As a result, his name (and, by extension, Charlie) carries little weight. While the denizens of Hell recognize that he is a powerful force to be reckoned with, they seem to know that little, if anything, would make him show up. Lucifer dislikes the Sinners of Hell and describes them as \"violent, destructive psychopaths, hellbent on causing as much pain and destruction as possible\". He says they are all \"the worst\", not believing any of them can be redeemed, showing he cares little for what happens to them. Despite his disapproval of Sinners, Lucifer hints that he regrets his role in ever giving them free will due to what they had done with it and the consequences that came from this.\n\nAs revealed in \"Mastermind\", Lucifer is similarly absent from handling matters related to Hellborn demons, as shown with how his throne was covered in webs. With his absence, Satan in particular took the lead as Hell's main ruler and lied that he was the true King of Hell and ruled it long before Lucifer had \"fallen\" into it.\n\nAlthough he understands his daughter's interest in rehabilitating Sinners, Lucifer is cynical about the idea of trying to save any of them, even bragging about being right about sinners being awful people, not realizing he was hurting Charlie's feelings. However, he stated that Charlie doesn't know that when he tried to make his own dreams a reality before, they were too hard to defend,[12] and since Heaven was so unwilling to listen to him in the past, he does not want Charlie to go through the same thing. Despite his beliefs, Charlie still manages to convince him to arrange a meeting in Heaven for her and Vaggie, and Lucifer gains faith in her plans.\n\nLucifer is fiercely protective of Charlie, as seen when he subtly threatens her bodyguards, Razzle and Dazzle, that they had better be doing their job protecting her. Later, when Alastor began rubbing in his failings to be a proper, supportive father to Charlie and her dreams and implying he had taken Lucifer's place as Charlie's father figure, Lucifer displayed jealousy toward Alastor, whom he began to see as a rival for Charlie's affection and became insecure about his familial bond with her. In \"The Show Must Go On\", he arrived late, but joined the fight against Adam and the Exorcists, helping Charlie defeat them. This protective nature is shown again when at one point, Adam tries to strike both Lucifer and Charlie from behind for them to block his blow and send him flying into the dirt. Dropping the mocking attitude he had previously given to Adam during their fight, Lucifer then proceeds to angrily berate Adam for threatening him and Charlie before pummeling him within an inch of his life, only stopping at Charlie's insistence.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbilities\n\nImmortality - As told in \"Overture\", Lucifer has existed since before the creation of the world, meaning he is at least thousands of years old and presumably unable to die of old age, and as demonic royalty is presumably biologically immortal and only able to be killed by angelic weaponry.\nAngelic power - Lucifer possesses immensely powerful angelic magic which holds sway over the demonic power of his contemporaries.[2]\nPyligenesis - In \"Dad Beat Dad\", Lucifer was shown to conjure portals as a means of instant transportation, which he is shown to use when transporting other demons. These portals manifest as rings of sparkly light, similar to the portal that took and removed Charlie and Vaggie in \"Welcome to Heaven\" from Heaven, indicating that this ability is derived from his angelic powers.\nDemonic transformation - Lucifer can assume a more fearsome and powerful demonic form.\nImmense strength - Lucifer's physical strength is beyond exceptional, as he barely put any effort during his fight with Adam, mocking the first man, when the Angel managed to defeat both Charlie and Alastor in brief skirmishes. He also gave really tight hugs to Charlie and Vaggie to the point where they had slight trouble breathing.\nFlight - Lucifer can summon six angelic wings on a whim, with the size of his wings varying throughout the show.\nLife manipulation - Lucifer created Razzle and Dazzle for Charlie.[13]\nTeleportation - Lucifer can instantly teleport himself from one location to another. He does this by enveloping himself in a swirling fog of deep red smoke with sparkling, golden glitter.\nSnake\nSnake\nHorse\nHorse\nBird\nBird\nGoat\nGoat\nOctopus\nOctopus\nShapeshifting - Lucifer can shapeshift into a wide variety of animals, as seen in \"The Show Must Go On\", he took the forms of a snake, a goat, a bird, a horse, and an octopus. When he shapeshifts, he still keeps some of his traits, like color scheme, blush, hair, bowtie, and top hat.\nConjuration - Lucifer seems to be able to create virtually anything he desires with a simple flick of the wrist. This includes, but is not limited, to clothing, puppets, instruments, large fountains of champagne, and mountains of caviar.\nHydrokinesis - During the song \"Hell's Greatest Dad\", Lucifer is seen throwing a yellow-colored liquid, presumably apple juice or champagne, at Alastor.\nPyrokinesis - Like his daughter, Charlie, he also has the power to manipulate fire at will. When fighting Adam in \"The Show Must Go On\" he is seen creating balls of fire out of thin air at will.\nFire breath - He can make fire come out of his mouth when he speaks.\nSkillset\n\nMusical talent - Similar to his daughter, Lucifer partakes in singing.[14]\nInstrumental talent - Additionally, he is shown to be quite a skilled fiddle player during his musical duet with Alastor. Lucifer also showed that he could play a violin and an accordion to a minor degree. He can also play the trumpet, shown for a brief moment at the beginning of the Hell's Greatest Dad.\nCraftsmanship - Lucifer spends his time making rubber ducks with various gimmicks, such as flipping backwards and spitting fire.\nHand-to-hand combat - He is adept at physical combat, as he effortlessly held his own against Adam in \"The Show Must Go On\".\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGallery\n\nLucifer Morningstar/Gallery\nTrivia\n\nLucifer's first name translates to \"shining one\", \"the morning star\" (referring to Venus), or \"light-bringer\" in Latin from Hebrew. One of these translations matches his surname, Morningstar.[9]\nLucifer is based on the Biblical character of Lucifer, a rendition of the Devil that was cast from Heaven and into Hell as a fallen angel.\nIn some versions of the Biblical character, the Devil takes on more than one name, including Lucifer and Satan. However, in other interpretations, Lucifer and Satan are portrayed as two separate entities. This is the case in Hazbin Hotel, where Lucifer and Satan are portrayed as distinct characters.[15][16]\nFurthermore, Lucifer represents the sin of Pride whereas Satan represents the sin of Wrath.[16]\nIn the Helluva Boss episode \"Mastermind\", one of the symbols that appears on the rings of the Seven Deadly Sins is the real-life sigil of Lucifer, first appearing in the 18th century Grimorium Verum.\nLucifer is the first of the deadly sins to debut in Hazbin Hotel and the fourth to debut in the franchise overall.\nThe apple tucked in the brim of his hat, and on the end of his cane, seem to reference the story of Adam and Eve, where a talking snake (often interpreted as being the Devil) persuades the first woman, Eve, into eating a forbidden fruit (often depicted in pop-culture as an apple), resulting in her and Adam being thrown out of paradise.\nAccording to Faustisse, Lucifer's favorite snack is caramel apples.[note 1]\nFaustisse believes that Lucifer is not a particularly good father. Despite them not specifying in what way that might be, they did say he still loves Charlie.[note 4]\nThis was shown in \"Dad Beat Dad\", as Charlie says that she and him haven't been close ever since he and Lilith split and he only ever contacted Charlie to do something for him. Aside from that, Lucifer didn't have any faith in Sinners or Charlie's dream of helping Sinners redeem themselves and ascend into Heaven, which eventually changes later in the episode.\nAs implied by Lute in \"Overture\" and elaborated on in \"Dad Beat Dad\", Lucifer works together with the Exorcists and Heaven in regards to the Extermination. Lute also stated that he had somehow arranged a \"pardon\" for Charlie and the other Hellborn demons, making it so that Exorcists are only allowed to kill Sinners per Heaven's agreement with him.\nLucifer playing the fiddle\nLucifer playing the fiddle\nAccording to Vivziepop, Lucifer can play many types of instruments very well, including the fiddle, which he plays \"phenomenally well\".[17]\nDuring his duet with Alastor, Lucifer is shown playing a golden fiddle, a reference to the famous Charlie Daniels song \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\".\nIn \"Dad Beat Dad\", Lucifer is shown to be left-handed as he plays the fiddle with his left hand and holds his cane in his right hand.\nIn the seventeenth century, it was believed that the Devil baptized his followers with his left hand, in superstition there are many references that the left hand is associated with evil, inquisition sometimes burned those who were left-hand dominant.\nIn the Helluva Boss episode \"Loo Loo Land\", Lucifer is stated to own a theme park called Lu Lu World.[18]\nIn the same episode, it is revealed that the titular amusement park has an amusement ride named \"Fun House\" which has its exterior modeled after Lucifer's head.\nLucifer has a mass collection of rubber ducks,[9] and creates plenty of new ones with additional features that regular rubber ducks don't have.\nThe Helluva Boss episode \"Mastermind\" indicates his general absence of Hellborn and Hell's affairs with a rubber duck on his webbed seat in the courtroom.\nIn his mansion, alongside his numerous photos of Charlie and Lilith, he has a picture of himself hugging what looks like a younger Frederick von Eldritch. There is also a photo of Seviathan von Eldritch and Charlie that can be momentarily seen in \"Dad Beat Dad\".\nIn \"The Show Must Go On\", Lucifer implies that he had an affair with Eve at some point, though whether that's true or he just said that to enrage Adam is unknown.\nFitting his circus ringmaster theme, the ringtone on his phone is a very well-known motif from \"Entry of the Gladiators\", a classic song known for its association with the circus.\nHe is the only member of the Seven Deadly Sins confirmed as being Heavenborn.\nIn a mid-2024 interview, Vivziepop confirmed that Charlie and Lucifer Morningstar can travel across the Rings of Hell.[19]\nDuring the court hearing in the Helluva Boss episode \"Mastermind\", what is supposed to be Lucifer's seat above the rest of the Sins has a rubber duck with a similar hat sitting on it with a sign that says \"BRB 5 mins\" covered in spiderwebs.\nThe real-world reason for Lucifer's absence is due to him being part of Hazbin Hotel, which at the time of this episodes creation made any appearance of him in Helluva Boss difficult,[20] as the rights for Hazbin Hotel are under A24, whereas Helluva Boss is independently made and owned by Vivienne Medrano. However, as revealed on April 25, 2025, that Prime Video has partnered with SpindleHorse, this restriction is no longer in place.[21]\nThe in-universe explanation for this may be due to Lucifer stepping away from his obligations, as seen in Hazbin Hotel.\nIt is shown in \"Mastermind\" that demonic royalty invoke Lucifer's name when cursing or praying, such as Stolas' \"Oh my Lucifer!\" and Satan's \"What in Lucifer's Hell is this?\". This is in contrast to how regular Hellborn demons like imps invoke Satan's name instead.\nInterestingly, in \"Overture\" when Lucifer first met Lilith after she fled the Garden of Eden, they were depicted as being roughly the same height, with Lucifer even being slightly taller, while in present time, Lucifer is shorter than both his wife and daughter. This may be due to Lilith being human during their initial meeting while she is a demon in present time.\nDevelopment\n\nWhen Vivziepop first discussed Lucifer, who at the time was only identified as \"The Devil\", she was hesitant to give out much information, citing concern over spoilers. She did, however, mention that he is \"very silly and goofy\", emphasizing his love of polka music,[22] things that Faustisse has also mentioned.[note 5][note 2]\nIn a stream, Vivziepop stated that Lucifer has a lot in common with Willy Wonka, explaining that Wonka is \"a showy dick\".[23]\nBefore the series premiere, Faustisse believed that Lucifer did not cut off his wings when he fell from Heaven,[note 6] and could still use them to fly.[note 7] This was later confirmed when the episode \"Dad Beat Dad\" premiered.\nFaustisse thinks that Lucifer and Lilith's dynamic can be summed up with the phrase \"Behind every man is a greater woman\",[note 8] and that they love each other very much.[note 9] They describe Lucifer and Lilith as \"passionate, cheesy lovers\".[note 10] They think that Lilith \"wears the pants\" in the family,[note 11] but think both Lucifer and Lilith are switches within their intimate life.[note 12] Whether any of this information is still canon or not is currently unknown as the pair were revealed to be separated.\nWhile discussing Lucifer in a mid-2019 live stream, Vivziepop mentioned that while he can play any instrument, his favorite is something that would be funny based on the specific voice actor they were casting for the role, someone they have tailored Lucifer's character to.[17]\nFaustisse implied a voice actor choice (and instrument) when they said that Lucifer sounds like Weird Al Yankovic.[note 13]\nBefore Lucifer and Alastor met in the series, Vivziepop felt that if the two were to meet Alastor would not like Lucifer, stating that Alastor would like Willy Wonka because he's \"a showy dick\" and mentioned Lucifer's similarities to Wonka, explaining that if someone was too much like Alastor, he would not like them, but if people are enough like him then he would like them.[23]\nVivziepop and Dave Capdevielle both felt that Alastor in no way would be afraid of Lucifer, even though Lucifer may be an intimidating character, as there's mutual respect going on between them.[24]\nVivziepop and Faustisse both state that Lucifer is much more powerful than Alastor.[17][note 14]\nWhen asked about Lucifer's stance on Hell, Faustisse mentioned they do not think that Lucifer cares about his subjects.[note 15] They describe Hell as like an oligarchy, and that Lucifer is not very politically active in the traditional sense, only serving to maintain the status quo of power.[note 16]\nFaustisse was also the first to imply that Lucifer may be assisting in the coordination of the Exterminations, although they did not say in what way or why that might be.[note 17]\nIn \"Overture\", it's revealed Lucifer had convinced the Exorcists to spare Charlie and the other Hellborn demons from the Extermination, which by extension sparing the rest of the Rings of Hell as Sinners only exist in the Pride Ring.\nIn a late 2024 interview, Vivziepop explained that with the idea of the mythological Lucifer being arrogant and the most beautiful angel she wanted to do a ringleader P. T. Barnum take on Lucifer where he was over ambitious and kind of delusional in what he could do but had a really inventive imagination, and had him more like a porcelain doll to represent being the prettiest angel.[25]"

But out here, I get to do what I want. So once again, fuck off!\"\n―Angel Dust, standing up to Valentino\nAnthony,[1] more commonly known as Angel Dust, is an adult film star in Hell and one of the main protagonists in Hazbin Hotel.\n\nA famous porn star and the first sinner the hotel is attempting to redeem,[16] but his selfish actions of using the hotel as a rent-free living space threaten to jeopardize Charlie Morningstar's dream.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\nAngel has a slender build and is the tallest of the main cast of characters,[17] estimated to stand around 8 feet with his heels on.[18] His fur is white and he has a mop of fluffy white hair that extends from both the front and back of his head, with splotches of light pink. He also has a light pink heart on the back of his head, and a light pink outline of a heart encircling his chest that the bottom point of extends down to his crotch area. His arms have light pink stripes that additionally his top set have light pink forearms with white fingers and his second set have white forearms and light pink fingers.\n\nHis irises are cerise pink while his right eye has a light yellow sclera and left eye has a dark sclera. His eyelids are light pink and the color extends up to his eyebrows. He has three cerise pink dots under each of his eyes, which are intended to evoke freckles, although they are actually another set of smaller eyes.[19] He also has a wide mouth full of sharp, pointed teeth and possesses a single golden fang, a feature he shares with his boss, Valentino.\n\nOne of Angel's most noticeable features is his prominent chest. The chest is actually composed entirely of fluffy fur, however, which Angel intentionally pushes up into a breast-like formation with his tightly pinned jacket for show.[20]\n\nThough usually depicted with four arms, Angel has a third retractable set of arms that he usually keeps hidden but can summon at will. In background artwork seen in the pilot, Angel Dust's feet resemble those of a spider's.[21]\n\nAngel's attire consists of a long light pink suit-blazer with horizontal white stripes down the length, a grey miniskirt, and long grey thigh-high heeled boots. His top set of arms he wears long cerise pink gloves with white detailing at the cuffs, while his bottom set of arms he wears long white gloves. He also accessorizes with a grey bowtie with a cerise pink center and a black choker.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nAngel is brash and sarcastic, with a quick, sharp wit. He will often use these traits to deflect criticism or insults, and side-step responsibility. He will switch between playful and destructive as he pleases, and his humor tends to be crude and crass, with an emphasis on dirty jokes and innuendos, which he feels is expected of him and actively plays into. He also makes a show of looking down others, declaring the other denizens of Hell to be mostly \"ugly freaks\". As a result, Angel can often appear flippant and callous.\n\nHe is stylish and performs an excessive amount of confidence with his public persona, being wildly flirtatious and interested in receiving positive attention for his looks and the profile he has made for himself in Hell. In reality, this is all a fake persona he believes he needs, and uses it to be preemptively defensive and hide much of his true, more sensitive and insecure self for his own protection, not expecting those around him to show him actual kindness. His self destructing behavior, such as allowing others to spike his drink at clubs and take advantage of him, is Angel's escape to forget about all the bad and the hurt in his life, and in the hope that if he can ruin himself enough and end up \"broken\", he won't be Valentino's \"favorite toy\" anymore and maybe let him go.\n\nAngel has friends, but while he cares about them and will sometimes show signs of wanting to reach out, he keeps many walls up between himself and others, being very protective of his true feelings and avoiding holding overly emotional relationships. He holds a cynical view on the idea of redemption, although he seems to still hold onto a small hope it may be possible for him.\n\nThe ongoing controlling and abusive situation he is in with his boss, Valentino, puts him under a great deal of stress at his work, and he is implied to be somewhat traumatized as a result. When being confronted by Valentino, Angel becomes scared and nervous around him due to the abuse he inflicts. Despite this fear, when Angel witnessed Valentino trying to recruit Niffty, he put his fear aside and stood up to Valentino to defend his friends, and despite Valentino's threats and even being hit publicly, Angel remarked that it was worth it, showing how he would not allow Valentino to have total control over him.\n\nBy the end of the first season, Angel appears to have had positive change in his actions through his friendship and being his real self with Husk, evidenced by how he no longer sexually flirts towards his friends or is seeking to ruin himself with drugs. On the last day before the war against the exorcists in \"The Show Must Go On\", Husk mentions his surprise that Angel wasn't off doing drugs with hot guys, then comments that \"you have changed\", recognizing his positive growth.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbilities\n\nImmortality - As a Sinner, Angel Dust is biologically immortal, being unable to die from illnesses and unable to age, remaining the same age as when he died, thus can not die of old age and other natural causes. He also cannot die from any kind of damage to the body, and will recover from any injury, however, he can only be permanently killed with angelic weaponry.\nRetractable arms - Angel has a third set of arms that he keeps hidden and only uses them as his last resort.\nVenomous bite - Angel Dust has a venomous bite.[22]\nSensitivity - Angel can sense incoming storms from a mile away.[13]\nAthleticism - Since Angel is based on the jumping spider, he is able to jump incredible heights.[6]\nSkillset\n\nAddict Angel Pole 2\nAngel dances at Valentino's club\nMusical talent - Angel Dust is a very talented singer.\nBilingualism - Angel is fluent in both Italian and English.[14]\nWeapon proficiency - Angel can handle weapons with ease, specifically firearms and explosives.\nFlexibility - Angel demonstrates some impressive flexibility as he is able to remove chains that were restraining him with ease, as well as pole dance at Valentino's club.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGallery\n\nAngel Dust/Gallery\nConcept & Creation\n\nSpider Brothers\nAngel was one of the first characters that would feature in Hazbin Hotel, and he remains one of Vivziepop's personal favorites.[23] Angel was created at the School of Visual Arts college on February 9, 2013,[24][25] and she recalls how she would draw him excessively, to the point her classmates would comment on it.[26]\n\nAngel, along with his brother, Arackniss, were originally planned to be part of a 2013 stand-alone \"film noir-esque mafia demons\" short story for Vivziepop's animation thesis, titled The Spider Brothers.[27][28]\n\nThe Spider Brothers as a thesis, was eventually abandoned, with Vivziepop realizing that the film was \"just too complex and too demanding\" for her current level of animation and she began to look towards having Angel feature in an arc of her then-running webcomic, Zoophobia, titled Angels and Demons instead.[29]\n\nAngel Dust and Fat Nuggets\nAngel's biggest design shift\nVivziepop eventually realized that the collection of misfit demons she had designed to appear within the comic had the potential for their own self-contained story, and shifted them, including Angel, over to the first draft of what would eventually become Hazbin Hotel.[30][31][32]\n\nVivziepop then slowly started to move away from Angel's grubbier, more masculine origins, beginning to incorporate more elements of gender expressiveness into his character, leaning into earlier hinted at enjoyment of cross-dressing and, later, drag.\n\nHis biggest thematic design shift happened around 2015, with Angel moving fully to a pinker-toned, more androgynous character - his Hell-career working in porn and as a sex worker was established soon after, as was his gay orientation, all elements that would carry through to the pilot.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrivia\n\nThe name Anthony may come from the word \"antonia\", which means \"priceless/praiseworthy and or beautiful\".\nHis real name officially appears in the episode \"Masquerade\", signed on Valentino's soul contract.\n\"Angel Dust\" is Angel's chosen all-encompassing persona name, and one he uses exclusively in place of his actual name. It is intended as multipurpose for both his drag queen persona and his sex-work persona.[33]\nAngel April Fools\nAngel Dust's birthday was once under some ambiguity. Vivziepop felt that his birthday was April 1st, although at the time she couldn't say for certain,[34] however, in a Tweet the following year she wished him a happy birthday on April 1st.[35]\nOn April 1st, 2023, the official Hazbin Hotel Twitter released a sketch confirming his birthday is on April 1st.[36][37]\nAngel has two siblings, an older brother, Arackniss, and a fraternal twin sister, Molly.[38][39]\nAngel comes from an extended mob family, who are all \"horrible people\", and are mostly also all in Hell.[40][41][42] They all appear as spider-based demons due to their \"web of crime\",[41] with the majority of Angel's immediate family have drug-themed names.[43]\nAngel was from New York when he was alive.[44]\nAngel was of Italian heritage when he was alive.[45]\nAngel purchased Angel Dust\nAngel purchases angel dust\nAngel Dust has a drug addiction problem,[46] which was the main cause for his death, a drug overdose.[47]\nAngel got into sex work pretty early upon arriving in Hell, rejecting his family's mob dealings, something that Vivziepop plans to explore in the show.[48]\nVivziepop describes Angel as somewhat like the Hell-equivalent to Paris Hilton or the Kardashians, in that he is a well-known star of a particular type in this world. Adult-film actors are the regular stars of Hell, and Angel is one of the bigger stars working at one of the biggest studios.[49]\nDue to the fact he frequently stars in pornography now, Angel no longer watches pornography himself.[50]\nAngel enjoys drag and although he was not directly inspired by any real life drag queens, Vivziepop cites Kim Chi as something of a style influence for his wigs, and compared his humor and attitude to Alaska Thunderfuck and Trixie Mattel (Although, she noted Mattel to be \"too wholesome\" and \"not trashy enough\" compared to Angel).[51]\nAngel's fluffy chest and femme-embracing style is often a point of confusion among fans of the show, as well as characters within the show itself, as Angel pushes the fluff up into an almost breast-like formation. Vivziepop clarified within pilot development streams that Angel is, in fact, a cisgendered man who is just proud of his androgynous look and enjoys playing around with that, in both his day-to-day attire and his drag persona.[52]\nAngel is gay, but Vivziepop describes him as being willing and able to sleep with women as part of his sex work for money. Although, it is not Angel's personal preference to do so and he will charge extra for his effort.[10] This is referenced in the prequel comic.\nAlthough Angel has slept with many people, according to Vivziepop he has not been in as many relationships, and the ones he has been in haven't exactly worked out.[53]\nAccording to Vivziepop, although Angel is very protective of his actual feelings, what he would like, deep down, is a solid relationship built on respect, with someone who values him and wants to be with him. However, a stable and healthy relationship is not something he expects, being a porn star who resides in Hell.[54]\nVivziepop has mentioned Angel's type is someone masculine and that he finds other gangsters attractive.[54]\nAngel has personal kinks that he is into and enjoys BDSM.[55][56]\nWhenever Angel is outside of work and doesn't feel the need to maintain his public persona, he prefers to dress in very cozy, comfortable, unsexualized clothing.[57]\nAngel Dust drag shots\nAngel in drag\nVivziepop described Angel as a character with very strong themes of duality, citing his drag persona specifically as a big part of it.[58] His very inhuman form reflects the subject of self-image, describing it as a more universally understandable issue that could be conveyed with a less humanoid character like his.[59]\nWhen discussing Angel's set of retractable extra arms, Vivziepop mentioned them being thematically appropriate for his character, as Angel is trying to hide much of his true self behind walls and does not have a lot of trust.[60]\nAlthough Angel likes and embraces his demon form, the one thing he doesn't like about it is his feet.[8][61] Where possible, he would avoid sex work that involved his feet, or else he would be angry about it if it was unavoidable.[62] This is reflected in \"Masquerade\" wherein the script Angel grabs has written \"Ima keep my whore boots on because [my feet are] fucking ugly as fuck\".[63]\nIn artwork used for backgrounds in the pilot, Angel's feet resemble those of a spider's.[21]\nWhen asked about the dots underneath Angel's eyes, Vivziepop revealed they are actually two sets of smaller eyes, but they are also designed to resemble freckles.[19]\nAngel's favorite color is pink.[6]\nAccording to Vivziepop, there is a reason Angel is so brightly colored and this is something she wants to explore on the show.[64]\nADDICT Feeling helpless\nIt is revealed in the ADDICT music video that Angel has PTSD-esque flashbacks and is dealing with possible depression after having to endure serious abuse at the hands of his sadistic boss, Valentino.[65]\nVivziepop thinks that Angel is somewhat indifferent to keeping up with trends in Hell. He is interested in keeping up with fashion, but is not particularly interested in technology in general. He's on the fence with the more online aspects of tech, with Vivziepop speculating that he would be something of a troll.[66]\nShe also doesn't think Angel would be good at using Hell's equivalent of a mobile phone for its intended purpose, rather that he would enjoy its capacity to take photos.[67]\nAngel is not a picky eater, as he enjoys food in general, especially Italian dishes and well-prepared meals. But, he is also not opposed to junk food every so often.[7]\nAngel is described as a relatively good cook, especially when it comes to Italian dishes.[5] His favorite dishes are lasagna and ravioli.[68]\nAngel doesn't care much for candy, but really enjoys fruit. The closest thing to candy he would enjoy would be chocolate covered strawberries.[69]\nAngel can play both the trumpet and accordion, although neither especially well. He can also read sheet music.[70]\nAngel remarks in the pilot that he has no interest in the politics of Hell.\nAccording to Vivizepop, Angel has a soft spot for children and he would be the \"friendly irresponsible\" type. He wouldn't behave inappropriately around them, but would still swear.[71] If he were to find a lost baby, he wouldn't hurt them, but he would take them to inappropriate places while finding their parents.[72]\nWhen asked why Angel likes kids, Vivziepop explained that, although it probably wouldn't be explored with regards to children in the show, there are reasons for Angel's sentimentality and his instinctually seeing innocence as a thing to be valued. This was also the reason given for his loving Fat Nuggets so much.[73]\nAngel genuinely likes fish and his favorite kinds are said to be the blobfish and angelfish.[74][75]\nDuring the second chorus of the ADDICT music video, Angel and Cherri Bomb are shown in a club that features a ceiling-high aquarium in the background. In what may be a small easter egg, a blobfish and a handful of angelfish can be seen in one of the shots.\nAngelDust full demon shadow only\nThe ominous silhouette behind Angel\nDuring the gang war with Sir Pentious, when Angel's shadow is cast behind him, it appears much larger than him, with six arms and glowing red eyes. This implies that Angel can possibly transform into a larger form like other sinner demons.\nVivziepop explained in a tweet that Angel Dust's extra set of arms are hidden to make animation easier.[76]\nA poster for Angel Dust appears in the Lust Ring in the Helluva Boss episode \"Ozzie's\".\nIn \"Masquerade\", it revealed that one of Angel’s films won him an award against his rival Tiffany Titfucker.\nAccording to Vivziepop, Husk and Angel Dust's relationship is one that will develop over the course of the series, and explained that it is one that she wanted to make sure has the time to develop,[77] but she did not specify whether this relationship will become romantic in nature or not.\nHis theme song and leitmotif is \"Slutty Spider Polka Pop\", created by Gooseworx in 2016.\nDevelopment\n\nAngel portrait\nAngel's first redesign\nThe date of Angel Dust's creation as one of Vivziepop's characters is February 9, 2013,[78][79] during her time in the School of Visual Arts.\nAngel Dust's first appearance on Viziepop's current YouTube channel was in a video called \"In the Arms of an Angel\" that she uploaded on September 13, 2013, where the camera zooms in on an image of Angel Dust as the song \"Angel\" by Sarah McLachlan plays in the background. This was also the second video ever uploaded on this channel.\nAngel's human name, during early development, was originally intended to be \"Martin\", which was a reference to Martin Scorsese, but it was later changed to \"Anthony\".[80]\nDuring earlier development for his character, Angel was at one time planned to be from Los Angeles. Vivziepop settled on New York, however, wishing to give Angel a setting more appropriate for the traditional Brooklyn gangster voice she envisioned for him, and one that none of the other characters originated from.[81]\nVivziepop talked about being unsure what specific drug Angel actually died from. She thought that it was likely \"something bad\", like heroine or cocaine, but was also open to the idea that it could have been PCP, Angel's namesake drug, angel dust.[82]\nIn earlier reference sheets for his character, Vivziepop described Angel as \"very genderfluid\",[83] but later moved on from that identity as she continued to develop the character. In a 2016 speed draw video, she stated that she didn't think the genderfluid label applied to him much anymore and that he just isn't offended when people misgender him. She went on to say that, unless in drag, he identifies as male.[11]\nWhen asked on development streams about Angel's apparent flat crotch, Vivziepop said that, alongside the general cartoon logic of his design, she thought it made sense that Angel had a retractable penis, similar to his retractable set of arms.[84]\nIn earlier artworks that featured Angel Dust's earlier design iterations for ZooPhobia, Angel Dust and Vaggie were portrayed as a romantic couple within the version of the story she was currently working on.[85] She eventually decided against it and moved on, never having made it official and continuing to develop the characters in other directions, describing them as \"no longer compatible\".[86]\nWhen Vivziepop first created Angel and Vaggie, \"Africa\" by Toto was their \"ship\" song, and as of March 20, 2016 Vivziepop still thinks it is the only song they can bond over.[87]\nIn 2015, Vivziepop's headcanon voice for Angel Dust was Billy Flynn from the film Chicago and David Veltri from the film The Wedding Singer.[88]\nAngel2\nAfter Angel received his biggest thematic redesign around 2015, shifting him from the more masculine gangster to the more androgynous porn star, Vivziepop received some confusion from fans, who perceived his redesign as lacking flaws. This prompted Vivziepop to explain the foundations of Angel's personality in depth for the first time, describing him as a \"preservative, insensitive asshole, who points out the flaws in others to make up for his own crippling insecurities\". She emphasized his internal self-loathing and concluded by describing Angel as \"cynical, guarded, and not afraid to hurt others to protect himself\", highlighting how all his problems are of his own making.[89][90] As Angel's character was still firmly in later-stage development, it's unclear how accurate this remains for his character, but elements of it are reflected in the pilot and prequel comic.\nAngel's original character, which was planned to appear in Vivziepop's ZooPhobia comic, had a biological daughter, and as late into Angel's development at the initial planning stages for the pilot in mid-2017, Vivziepop was still unclear if Angel being a father would continue to be an element of his current character. She eventually decided against it, but it was a one of the longer hold-over concepts from his old character to be abandoned.[91]\nDuring earlier development streams, Vivziepop explained that one of the reasons Angel is so sexual in Hell is because he wasn't able to be that person during his living life. He got into hard drugs and had some experiences, but he wasn't able to be his authentically \"loose and expressive\" self. His attitude in Hell is one that was formed in reaction to this.[92]\nOn the same stream, Vivziepop described Angel as priding himself on his looks and thinking that they're really all he's good for.[93]\nVivziepop also expressed her wish to give Angel a group of drag queen and stripper friends from his workplace within the show, who would ideally be voiced by real porn stars.[94]\nOn an art stream, Vivziepop mentioned that she thinks Angel has a preference to bottom in the bedroom, outside of his work.[95]\nIn an earlier development stream, when asked if Angel is venomous, Vivziepop stated she did not think Angel was venomous due to being based on the jumping spider.[96] However, in a later stream she says that Angel's bite is venomous, but explained that venom in Hell can't actually kill anyone, it just causes temporary pain or disfigurement and makes them fall ill.[22]\nVivziepop talked about Angel being a particularly tricky character for her to write, admitting that she felt he had a wit and a snark that somewhat eluded her skill level, and that she had to get into a very specific head-space to tap into his confidence.[97]\nVivziepop cited Roger from American Dad as a source of inspiration when creating Angel Dust's character. In his original draft, Angel apparently shared more traits in common with him, being a \"ridiculous drugged-out psychopath\". Where they now differ is in Roger's intentional lack of depth and empathy for the comedy show he exists in, whereas Angel now has more of a complex interior life with motivations and feelings.[98]\nWhen asked whether Angel will experience sadness or heartbreak in the show, Vivziepop replied \"one hundred percent\". Stating that Angel is one of the more emotional characters in the show, with Dave Capdevielle adding \"There's a bit of drama, for sure\".[99]\nAt the Momocon 2019 Hazbin Hotel panel, Vivziepop mentioned that Angel would be getting a love interest during the show. She gave no indication as to whom it may be, talking about how difficult she finds keeping upcoming couples on her projects quiet, something she has failed to do in the past, but is determined when it comes to Hazbin Hotel."

I'll spend my life being your partner. ♪\"\n―Vaggie, expressing her desire to help Charlie\nVaggie is an angel and former Exorcist. She is the deuteragonist of Hazbin Hotel and serves as the manager of the Hazbin Hotel.\n\nSkilled in combat and very protective of her girlfriend, Charlie Morningstar, Vaggie is tough but has a heart of gold.[6]\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\nVaggie is a slim-figured angel who subtly sports a moth-themed design[7] with grayish-lavender skin. She has knee-length grayish-white hair with faded-purple tips and long jagged bangs which cover the left side of her face. On the back of her head, she accessorizes with a red hairbow with small tears on each side and two long tails.\n\nHer right eye has a light pink sclera and an ivory iris, while her left eye has been replaced by a slate-gray eyepatch that sports a red-pink \"X\" shape, which glows when she is angry or irritated. Her mouth has small fangs and black lips.\n\nVaggie wears a blouse that is the same color as her bow and the \"X\" shape on her eyepatch, with a dark gray peter-pan collar, dark gray trimming on the sleeves, and two dark gray buttons down the front. She also sports a choker and a miniskirt with a thick pale pink waistband hugging her waist, both colored in the same dark gray.\n\nVaggie's accessories include a set of fingerless slate-gray opera gloves with matching thigh-high stockings, which include white scallops at the cuff and toes.\n\nBack when she was an Exorcist, Vaggie's hair was kept in a bob, and she had both of her eyes as well as a pair of large feathered-wings on her back, and a halo hovering above her head. Her left eye, halo and wings were then ripped out by Lute. After training with Carmilla Carmine, Vaggie regrew her wings which sported a gradient of gray-colors, in contrast to her previous wings which sported a black-to-white color scheme.\nPilot\n\nIn her pilot design, Vaggie's hair was the same color, but the stripes at the end were instead light pink. Her bow was colored in a pale shade of reddish-pink, and its appearance was softer and untorn. She also sported gray eyeshadow.\n\nShe wore what appears to be a light gray one-shouldered bra under a white minidress with loose straps, two light gray crosses on her chest, and a scalloped-trim at the bottom. In addition, she also wore a light gray belt around her waist.\n\nHer choker and arm-length gloves were the same light slate-gray color; her right glove covered her entire hand while her left was fingerless. She also wore thigh-high stockings that were scalloped white at the cuff; her right was a full light gray while her left was striped in light pink and light gray.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nVaggie is a pragmatic and cautious angel who devotes a great deal of her time attempting to support Charlie with her vision for the hotel, as well as guiding her away from as much trouble or humiliation as possible.\n\nShe is tough, but she has a heart of gold.[6] Loyal and kind to those she cares for, but short on patience and trust, Vaggie tends to be very reactive, often taking an immediate defensive stance (with an offense at the ready) when it comes to dealing with potential threats towards either herself or Charlie.\n\nWhile it remains unclear whether Vaggie fully buys into Charlie's concept for redemption, she passionately defends it from more skeptical sinners and fully supports her idea, trying to do everything she can to help Charlie. Vaggie appears to be fairly prudent in business, trying her hardest to fill her designated role as the hotel's manager, even with an initial lack of resources, a very run-down property, and a lack of qualified staff.\n\nShe is relatively easy to bait into irritation or explosiveness, as others are quick to discover. Angel Dust perceives Vaggie to have a distrust towards men in particular. Husk believes Vaggie acts mean to everyone else around her because deep down she loathes herself and that act is a way to protect herself.\n\nBack when she was an Exorcist, she was a ruthless killing machine, having slaughtered thousands of Sinners during many Exterminations. However, she had a change of heart when she encountered a defenseless Sinner child in an alley. Unable to bring herself to kill them, she let them go. Lute watched in disgust and declared her \"sinful filth\", gouging out her left eye and tearing off her wings as punishment, leaving her mutilated and abandoned. Shortly after, she met Charlie, who gave her first aid. The two eventually fell in love, and Vaggie became loyal and protective of her. This may have also helped Vaggie abandon most of her ruthless ways and change for the better.\n\nDespite abandoning her Exorcist past and beliefs, she kept her spear for protection and is still wary of Sinners who could potentially be a threat to her and Charlie.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbilities\n\nFlight - When she was an Exorcist angel, she had wings until she was stripped of them by Lute, along with her status. She later regains them in \"Hello Rosie!\" after training with Carmilla Carmine.\nSkillset\n\nHand-to-hand combat - Vaggie demonstrates a considerable physical strength that belies her slight frame. She was able to swiftly punch a male demon off his chair in one bare-knuckle hit, as well as pick up and toss both Sir Pentious and Angel Dust off a rooftop.\nWeapon proficiency - Vaggie is proficient in handling weapons, seeming to favor blades. According to Adam, Vaggie was one of his top Exorcist fighters, claiming that her skills in weaponry allowed her to kill thousands of Sinners. Although she has yet to actually make use of her larger weapons, she does not lack confidence when it comes to brandishing them for self-defense, and she was able to throw a dagger into the electric window switch of a car with pin-point precision. As noted by Carmilla, Vaggie's fighting style initially resembled that of the other Exorcists, sloppy, vicious, and straightforward, focusing everything on offense. She eventually began to overcome these flaws as she sparred with her.\nBilingualism - Vaggie can fluently speak Spanish[8] as well as English.\nIntellect - Vaggie appears to have quite a comprehensive knowledge regarding the hierarchies and folklore of hell, particularly those pertaining to her area of residence, the Pride Ring, and the machinations of the power-jostling sinners located there. She understands the looming dangers of the Overlords and their politics, as well as the tale of how Alastor became the first mortal soul to harness enough power to \"begin to topple overlords who had been dominant for centuries\".\nWeaponry\n\nVaggie points her angelic spear at Carmilla\nVaggie's angelic spear\nThrowing daggers - Vaggie has throwing daggers in her possession, although whether she has the power to summon them or just keeps them on her is unclear.\nAngelic spear - Vaggie possesses a spear for self-defense and is seen carrying it around with her. She had this spear since her days as an Exorcist.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGallery\n\nVaggie/Gallery\nConcept & Creation\n\nVaggie 2013\nAs with many of the core cast of Hazbin Hotel, Vaggie started out a very aesthetically and thematically different character.\n\nInitially planned to appear in the \"Angels and Demons\" arc of Vivziepop's then-running webcomic, Zoophobia, she appeared in 2013 as a mystical and overtly moth-like woman with a darker-blue color palette.\n\nVivziepop eventually realized that the collection of demon misfits had the potential for their own self-contained story and shifted them, including Vaggie, over to the first draft of what would eventually become Hazbin Hotel.[9]\n\nVaggie Drawing Voice\nVaggie's first redesign\nVaggie went through several phases of development preceding her initial design. She received her first redesign in 2015, moving into a very 80s'-themed look to match her 1980s date of death.[10][11] However, this date was later changed to 2014 and the character eventually emerged at the end of the process with the more pastel-goth design finally settled on for the pilot.\n\nChristopher Niosi, who met Vivziepop in the School of Visual Arts, and who was given special thanks in her thesis film, Son of 666, was the one who suggested Monica Franco for the role of Vaggie, before the pilot had started production and before casting had even begun.[12]\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrivia\n\nAccording to Adam in \"Welcome to Heaven\", he states that he was the one that gave her the name. However, it was pronounced (/væɡiː/), named after \"the best thing ever\", the vagina, which is also a joke nickname that Angel Dust sometimes calls her by.\nOn March 19, 2019, in a response to fanart of Vaggie in Salvadoran attire, Vivziepop stated that Vaggie, like her, was also Salvadoran.[13] However, with the revelation that she is an angel, this places her true nature into question, given that, according to Medrano, Exorcists are not descendants of Adam, and therefore are from Heaven and are not human souls from Earth.[14] Furthermore, it is unknown if her potential heritage is still canon in the main series.\nVaggie can speak Spanish, as evidenced in the pilot, \"Overture\", and other episodes of season one.\nCynical Beauty\nAccording to Vivziepop, Vaggie is the \"most human\" character, in terms of her emotional state and her problems, which are more real-world adjacent, involving issues around mental health and inner darkness. This is reflected in her more humanoid design.[15]\nVaggie's hair and bow flares up whenever she shows strong emotion or anger. It even flows when she explains something serious, like how dangerous Alastor is.\nPrior to confirmation, Vaggie's sexual orientation was alluded to but not elaborated by the crew members. In 2019, when asked about Vaggie's orientation and whether she is a lesbian, Faustisse replied that they would \"certainly say that Vaggie is strongly interested in women\",[note 2] but not confirming if she is only into women. Her sexuality was later confirmed to be lesbian through the 2025 Hot Topic Pride collaboration.[4][note 1]\nFaustisse stated that Vaggie does not have any friends.[note 3] Whether the statement was referring to Vaggie's possible living life, her time as an exorcist or her current situation in Hell outside of Charlie and the Hazbin Hotel staff is yet unclear.\nVaggie is described as an overly protective person, and someone who desires to be in control of situations. Her overprotectiveness is a strong part of her personality that is referred to as both \"justified and not so much\" depending on certain situations.[16]\nVivziepop considers Vaggie a \"neat freak\", who is made uncomfortable and stressed out by mess.[3]\nFaustisse stated that Vaggie has big issues with anger.[note 4]\nVaggie is described as \"a really good dancer\", the most skilled of the main cast.[17]\nVivziepop referenced Vaggie's preference for bladed weapons, mentioning that if any character were to meet the \"giant sword\" trope, it would be her. Described as the fighter of the group, that element of her character apparently played a role in a magical girl adjacent element to her theming.[18]\nThroughout the first season there were hints of Vaggie's past as an angel exorcist such as when she gave militaristic orders, telling everyone how she learned to trust people in combat and her unwillingness to visit heaven even when Charlie wanted her to travel with her.\nIn \"Welcome to Heaven\", Vaggie admits she's a terrible liar or at the very least can't seem to lie to Charlie.\nCharlie consoles Vaggie\nVaggie is assured by Charlie\nVivziepop has confirmed that Charlie and Vaggie are indeed a canon couple.[19]\nShe compares Charlie and Vaggie's relationship to that of Jack Skellington and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas.[20]\nWhen asked who she thinks fell for the other first (Charlie or Vaggie), Vivziepop stated that she thinks they were really good friends for a while and it was \"kind of a natural progression for them\", so she doesn't really know who was in love first, thinking it was a more mutual feeling that developed between them. She also thinks that their becoming a couple happened a fairly long time prior to the events of the pilot, and even before some events that she has planned to occur before the pilot.[21]\nFaustisse feels that Vaggie is the top in their relationship.[note 5]\nIn \"Welcome to Heaven\" Vaggie was seen visibly upset that Emily was holding Charlie's hands showing some jealousy and she was even more distraught when Charlie learned about her past as an exorcist.\nThe episode \"Hello Rosie!\" seems to suggest that Vaggie didn't tell Charlie about her time as an Exorcist for fear of losing her.\nIn the same episode, Charlie revealed that she and Vaggie had been together for three years and that she tells her everything, showing a level of trust and love between them.\nAccording to Faustisse, Vaggie is bad at handling kids.[note 6]\nVivziepop thinks Vaggie would enjoy punk and 80s' era music, as well as have a guilty pleasure for Reggaeton. She thinks she would also gravitate towards music similar to Melanie Martinez, an artist who appears frequently on Vivziepop's official Spotify playlist for Hazbin Hotel, and has been previously used as background music for her speed-draw streams of Vaggie.[22]\nVaggie's Spanish lines are left untouched in the official Japanese dub, instead of being dubbed over in Japanese.\nBefore being archived, Vaggie was in charge of handling the hotel's Voxtagram account (@hotel_magnement).[23]\nVaggie shares her pilot voice actor with the Hellhound Adoption Center Lady (\"Seeing Stars\") and Counselor Jimmy (\"Unhappy Campers\") from Helluva Boss.\nDevelopment\n\nIn a late 2016 speed draw of Vaggie, Vivziepop listed her last name as \"Motha\".[24] Whether this is still the case is unknown.\nIn earlier artworks that featured several of Vaggie's earlier design iterations for Zoophobia, Angel Dust and Vaggie were portrayed as a romantic couple within the version of the story she was currently working on.[25] She eventually decided against it and moved on, never having made it official and continuing to develop the characters in other directions, describing them as \"no longer compatible\".[26]\nWhen Vivziepop first created Angel and Vaggie, \"Africa\" by Toto was their \"ship\" song, and as of March 20, 2016 Vivziepop still thinks it is the only song they can bond over.[27]\nVaggie's original design was said to be based around the theming of moths and suicide, but was \"rehauled\" due to unknown reasons.[note 7]\nVivziepop still considers Vaggie to be moth-themed, but in a more subtle way.[28]\nFaustisse thinks that Vaggie's full demon form might still be themed around suicide.[note 7] As Vaggie is depicted as an Angel instead of a Sinner, this concept was likely scrapped.\nIn 2015, Vivziepop's headcanon voice for Vaggie was Nicole Sullivan.[29]\nVaggie designs\nVaggie in various outfit designs\nVivziepop expressed a strong desire to have Vaggie appear in different outfits for every episode of the show.[30]\nIn earlier renditions of the character, and in the pilot episode, Vaggie was a Sinner demon who died in 2014 around or in her 20s.[31][32] In the main series, however, she was believed to be a Sinner until the episode \"Welcome to Heaven\" where it is revealed she had lied about her identity and is actually a former Exorcist and angel.\nIn an earlier tweet on June 26, 2019, Vivziepop said that she feels Vaggie died way before she claims she did, because she personally thought Vaggie met Charlie in her high school years.[33]\nIn the Australian Relief Wildfire stream, Vivziepop stated that Vaggie's real name was Vagatha.[1] \"Vagatha\" may be taken from the name \"Agatha\", which means \"good woman\" in Greek. However, this detail has been retconned, as Adam claimed that Vaggie is her real name.\nIn \"The Show Must Go on\", Vaggie said \"Vagatha\" was not her real name when addressed as such by Sir Pentious."

Her hair is colored in a desire-red that features the insides colored in a faded dark navy-blue, and white swirled-streaks on her pigtails and one on her bangs.\n\nHer eyes have white irises, red sclera and slit-like pupils, and her makeup consists of burgundy eyeshadow on her eyelids, and black lipstick on her lips with a strip across the center of her mouth, which has fangs inside. She has seams on several parts of her body such as her elbow and knee joints.[5]\n\nVelvette's clothing is that of a set of skull earrings, and a sleeveless dark navy-blue coat with burgundy lining and two desire hearts on the left side of the fur collar (similar to the ones on Valentino's). Her coat is usually worn over a sleeveless, black turtleneck crop-top that includes two desire hearts on the chest. Her loose pants are colored in navy-blue and desire-red in a striped pattern, held by a dark navy belt with a white heart-shaped buckle.\n\nFor footwear, she wore navy low-heeled shoes with white pom-poms on top. Velvette accessorized with black-striped fingerless opera gloves with alternating colors - white for her right glove and desire for her left.\n\nVelvette changes hairstyles and outfits frequently, as seen in \"Radio Killed the Video Star\" and \"The Show Must Go On\".\nPilot\n\nIn the pilot, Velvette sported a much more doll-like appearance with desire-red and burgundy hair with a white streak on her bangs - her pigtails are noticeably messier in appearance, and it has been held by black and white frilled hair ties. She appears to have white eyeliner on the lower part of her eyes and a white strip across her eyes.\n\nIn addition to her clothing, she sports a pimped-out, tea-length dress that is colored in white, black and desire. Her dress features short, black puffed sleeves, along with black triangle and desire heart patterns located at the bottom.\n\nHer fingerless gloves appear to be longer, and they are instead desire-and-white-striped. She also wore black tights and desire flats with white pom-poms on top.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nVelvette is the energetic, stylish and trendy type who is always up-to-date with the latest trends and technology. This is one of the main reasons why she and Vox get along quite well with each other.[6] Faustisse has also described her as being a very crazy person.[note 1]\n\nShe is critical and judgemental when it comes to fashion. Velvette is also observant, such as when she notices Carmilla's expression after she pulled out the severed Exorcist's head, and suspected her to be responsible, in which confirmed her suspicions later.\n\nShe is shown to be a disrespectful and overbearing employer, insulting and demeaning her employees (who are justifiably afraid of her) while barking orders at them. When her \"best model\" was dismembered by Valentino, Velvette showed apathy towards her, instead annoyed how she has to find a last-minute replacement because she can't wait for the model to pull herself back together.\n\nShe considers herself as \"the backbone of the Vees\", meaning that she is more willing to put up a fight, as seen when she manages to annoy Carmilla Carmine at the meeting and when she insults and makes fun of Zestial and the other Overlords for being \"old\" and \"too afraid to fight\" when they are actually far from it. In addition, after presenting a severed Exorcists head at the meeting, she openly proposes going to war without acknowledging the lack of intelligence about how the Exorcist was killed, only being interested in going to war in order to make a \"power grab\".\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbilities\n\nClothing manipulation - Velvette is able to instantly produce and change the clothing of others in various styles and types by swiping her fingers like she swipes on a phone screen. Her hand is seen glowing with sparkles as she performs this.\nHead rotation - During her opening line for Respectless, Velvette, while spinning, was seemingly able to instantly rotate her head a further 360 degrees without any discomfort or need to unwind it back. It is unknown if she can apply this to other parts of her body.\nSkillset\n\nWide intellect - She correctly deduced that Carmilla was responsible for demonkind's first known killing of an Exorcist based off her body language, anger, and silence during the Overlords' meeting.\nDeal-making - Although it hasn't been performed onscreen, like all Overlords, Velvette can make deals with other demons, whether having mundane conditions such as simple favors to owning another's soul.\nPotion-making - Velvette is stated to be skilled in preparing potions.[6] An example of this would be the Love Potion being advertised on posters and billboards in \"Radio Killed the Video Star\" and \"Masquerade\".\nCooking - Velvette is said to be good with food.[6]\nMusical talent - She is capable of singing and even rapping.\nTechnological skill - As someone who uses her phone and social media all the time, she has vast skill in technology.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGallery\n\nVelvette/Gallery\nTrivia\n\nPrior to October 2022, she went by the name \"Velvet\" as disclosed by the series' staff, merchandise, and social media accounts. On October 31, 2022, a teaser from the Hazbin Hotel Twitter account confirmed her name would be \"Velvette\" for the main series.[4]\nThe name \"velvet\" means \"a closely woven fabric of silk, cotton, or nylon, that has a thick short pile on one side\". Its Latin root word, villus, means \"shaggy cloth\" or \"tuft of hair\".\nHer name could also refer to the color red velvet, like the color of her hair.\nThe color velvet often represents power and wealth, representing her status as an Overlord.\nThe \"ette\" is used as a suffix to make words feminine, representing her status as the only female member of the Vees.\nAccording to the \"Clocktower Countdown to Premiere\" livestream, Velvette is the youngest Overlord in Hell.[7] It is unclear whether this refers to the youngest by age or by length of tenure.\nVelvette's nickname of \"Babydoll\" by Valentino was first revealed in the non-canon Voxtagram posts.\nVelvette's phone case design was made by Sam Miller and is designed so the \"<3\" is both a heart chatspeak and stands for \"3 Vees\"[8] while the patterns at the bottom corners are @ symbols mimicking the shape language of her pigtails.[9]\nAccording to Vivziepop, Velvette is the glue between these two very egotistical and chaotic villains, Vox and Val.[10]\nAs Velvette is seen with a different look in every appearance, the only time Velvette is seen with her main outfit and hairstyle is in \"Scrambled Eggs\".\nIn \"Radio Killed the Video Star\", the outfit Velvette is wearing in her phone contact icon references her appearance in the pilot.\nAn official merchandise keychain for Halloween revealed that Velvette has seams at various points of her body similar to the articulated joints of a doll, implying that Velvette's body may be similar to a mannequin's.[5]\nVivziepop explained on Bluesky that of the Vees, Velvette is the \"less bad\" but very much a villain.[11]\nDevelopment\n\nDuring the pilot and non-canon Voxtagram stories, Velvette was approximately the same height as Vox, who is about 7 feet tall. In the series, she is shorter than Vox.\nIn the non-canon Voxtagram stories, Vox, Valentino, and Velvette were called the \"VVV Overlords\".[12] In these stories, the group regularly hung out together, where Velvette seemed to be the glue that binds the other two together."

He is a major antagonist in Hazbin Hotel.[6] Vox is the founder, owner, and CEO of VoxTek Enterprises, along with being the de facto leader and public face of the Overlord trio known as the Vees, alongside Valentino and Velvette.\n\nA technology-savvy businessman, Vox pulls the strings of Hell's news and entertainment media. He is determined to keep his iron grip over Pentagram City's citizens from the Radio Demon, Alastor, his arch-rival in terms of influence and technology.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n00:02\n\n41:20\n\nVox is a tall and slim-figured, technology-themed demon who stands at approximately 7 feet.[7] He sports a flat-screen television for a head, with the monitor projecting eyes with red sclera, small cyan pupils and different-colored outlines - black for his right and cyan for his left. While using his hypnosis powers or simply becomes enraged, his left eye gains a black spiral and the pupil becomes a cyan electric symbol.\n\nThe screen also shows a mouth full of sharp, cyan-colored teeth and a long pointed cyan colored tongue. Sometimes what looks like blood seems to drip out of his mouth. He has dark navy-blue skin with sharp, cyan claw-like fingers, and also has what appears to be three shark-like gills on the sides of his body.[8]\n\nVox wears a navy-blue tuxedo with the jacket sporting coattails, red-trimmed cyan lapels, thin cyan stripes and cyan lining, worn over a red-and-black-striped waistcoat which itself is worn over a collared bluish-white shirt with an upside-down broadcast symbol and a rather large, red bowtie. He also wears heeled dark gray dress shoes with cyan-colored laces, toes, and tips on the heels.\n\nHe also wears a small black top hat on his head, with red and blue designs reminiscent of a broadcast symbol and radio wave symbol, respectively. He has TV antenna that stick out the top of his hat, the left one bent into a zigzag.\nPast\n\nVox used to have an older-styled box TV for his head. He wore a black jacket over a yellow ribbed turtleneck, along with dark colored pants. He also wore a black top hat but without the symbols, and his left antenna was not bent.\n\nPilot\n\nIn the pilot, Vox's appearance is nearly the same, but with some noticeable differences; his eyebrows are different-colored (aqua-blue right and cyan left), the blood-like substance appears to be permanent, and his left eye is always seen with black spirals.\n\nHe also appeared to have wrinkles located on the right corner of his left eye, colored in the same color as the outline.\n\nIn addition to his clothing, his suit is a dark blue-gray with the jacket not sporting any coattails, and its lapels, while still being red-trimmed, is a darker gray-cyan. The jacket's linings are instead colored in a blue-gray. There is more linings on the jacket.\n\nHis shirt is instead a faded daphne-blue, and his dress shoes instead sport thin cyan stripes above the soles.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nVox is an egotistical, charismatic, and manipulative showman of an Overlord who craves attention.[9] To the public, Vox presents himself as a legitimate businessman of VoxTek Enterprises, giving the facade of a man of the people to the denizens of Hell, when in truth, he is power-hungry, and he manipulates their minds to boost his reputation. He is highly intelligent and technology-savvy, and he is always keeping up with the latest trends and technology.[10] He seems to be able to hide his less desirable side in public and even in private unless he's pushed too far.\n\nDespite his egocentric nature, Vox is loyal to the interests of his fellow Overlords, the Vees, and seeks to maintain their collective image of power. As the most level-headed member of the Vees, Vox often acts as the de facto leader. Claiming the Vees' brand to be \"perfection\", he is often frustrated or outright angered if someone can jeopardize it, such as when he reigns in his fellow Vee, Valentino, from attacking the Hazbin Hotel in response to Angel Dust living there. Another element that earns his ire is his rival, Alastor, whom he utterly despises and might be intimidated by as he sees Alastor as a threat to his plans. However, despite his immense hatred for Alastor, Vox doesn't let it override his more pragmatic side once he calms down.\n\nIn \"The Show Must Go On\", he takes pleasure and joy out of seeing the staff of the Hazbin Hotel prepare to fight the angels, as he believes they stand no chance against them. This causes him to get verbally explicit and overly honest, as seen when he along with Valentino and Velvette watch the fight between Adam and Alastor at the Hazbin Hotel, commenting how the impending duel had given him an erection. He even shows this sadistic joy when he sees Alastor lose to Adam, saying that seeing Alastor suffer is better than sex, only to get angry when Alastor flees from the fight. Additionally, he is genuinely shocked at Niffty killing Adam but then changes to smiling.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbilities\n\nImmortality - As a Sinner, Vox is biologically immortal, being unable to die from illnesses and unable to age, remaining the same age as when he died, thus cannot die of old age and other natural causes. He also cannot die from any kind of damage to the body, and will recover from any injury, however, he can only be permanently killed with angelic weaponry.\nPentagram exe stopped working\nCausing a city-wide blackout\nElectrokinesis - Vox possesses the ability to generate and control electricity. Depending on his emotions, such as if he's angered, he can potentially make it so that a Hell-wide blackout happens.[note 3] He caused a blackout to Pentagram City in \"Radio Killed the Video Star\" when he was overwhelmed by Alastor's taunts.\nElectrokinetic transformation - Vox can turn into electricity,[11] which he can use to move around or enter and travel through electronic devices such as security cameras, watches and television monitors that he can control as he pleases. Though there are a few flaws to his electrical teleportation: the place Vox wants to go has to have some form of modern technology he could go through, as he apparently can't teleport through an old-style radio.\nTechnokinesis - Vox can control devices whether he is outside or inside them. He can do things while inside devices such as changing his outfit and scenery.\nSpark generation - He can create electrical sparks from his fingertips, which can be used to ignite something, like Valentino's cigarette in \"Radio Killed the Video Star\". He can even generate sparks on his body, especially when he is angry. He also causes what looks like a small surge or ripple of electricity to appear through the floor from his feet during Stayed Gone. It is hard to tell if this is part of the spark generation or a separate ability entirely.\nTechnological head - Vox's television head doubles as an electronic device with which he can plug himself into other devices with the help of cables in his surveillance room. He also somehow is able to change or upgrade his head, as shown, he has a photograph of himself with an older-style television head. If he's particularly angry, he and any devices he's linked to will involuntarily glitch.\nBioluminescence - Vox generates blue light from his screen, most notably when he is in a dark room. His teeth noticeably shine brighter than the rest of his face, and his left eye outline and pupils can shine on their own when feeling sinister. His claws can also glow when he is using his electrical powers.\nCommunication - He can receive calls from people, such as Velvette, with his screen head similar to calling on a phone. He can also transfer the call to another device by \"grabbing\" the call and flicking it to a different screen device.\nVideo playing - According to Faustisse, Vox can play videos on his screen-face.[note 4]\nVox TV (main series)\nVox in a store's TV window display\nScrying - As shown in \"The Radio Demon\" comic, Vox is seemingly able to see through other screens, appearing to stare directly at Alastor while projecting into the TV display of a window-fronted store. This is shown in \"Radio Killed the Video Star\" to be done after he plugs his head into a monitoring device, which he may need to be able to scry.\nHypnosis - In \"Radio Killed the Video Star\", it is shown that with his left eye, he uses hypnosis to keep his audience drawn into his program and keep their interest. He also uses this as a distraction so he can slip away to avoid any further discussion of a subject he doesn't wish to continue. The victim's eyes become red with black spirals. The victim has to be paying attention for this to work. He can use this even when he isn't physically present by being in a screen device. The devices his company sells share this ability.\nThat demon is a coward\nSelf-duplication\nSelf-duplication - Vox was shown to be able to make clones of himself in \"Radio Killed the Video Star\" during Stayed Gone. However, he has only displayed the ability on television, and it is unknown if he can do it physically.\nAcoustokinesis - He can manipulate the sound of his voice to sound more intimidating. He can also generate different sound effects such as echoing voices and the sound of a winning game machine.\nStrength - Vox is strong enough that he is easily able to tear through metal, and capable of holding demons bigger than himself, such as Valentino, with ease.\nCable creation - As shown on Vox's official reference sheet, Vox can produce cables from his back.[12]\nSkillset\n\nDeal-making - While not shown on-screen, Vox can make deals with others in order to collect their souls just like other Overlords.\nMusical talent - Vox has shown to be a talented singer.\nDancing - Vox can perform amazing dance routines, like handling complicated moves to even being able to hold Valentino, a taller Sinner, into a dip.\nVox Talking2\nManipulating the public\nCharisma and manipulation - The reason why Vox is a successful entrepreneur is that he can use his charm to manipulate others into buying his products even without his hypnosis powers, such as acting as he cares about his customers and making up products on the spot that are not even in production yet. He even uses this to successfully calm down Valentino to prevent further damage.\nTechnology intuition - Being a businessman and head of VoxTek, Vox has great understanding of technology, allowing him to use his electrical powers to their full potential.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGallery\n\nVox/Gallery\nTrivia\n\nHis name may refer to the word \"vox\", a shortened form of the word \"vocals\", or from the Latin word \"vox\", meaning \"voice\". It may also be a portmanteau of \"video\" and \"aux\" (an abbreviation of auxiliary), which are the two main components of television.\nIn a late-2019 livestream, Vivziepop and pilot co-writer Dave Capdevielle confirmed that Vox is one of the bigger antagonists in the series.[6]\nVivziepop stated in an early-2024 interview that the Vees are going to be a bigger part of season two as antagonists.[13] She explained that the season centers around the Vees and Vox specifically, and will get into much more of his relationship with Alastor and how Vox being the threat affects Alastor and the other characters in the Hotel.[14]\nFaustisse stated that Vox was Caucasian while living, later also joking that he was \"white, like really emphasizing the phlegm in your throat white\".[note 5]\nFaustisse described Vox as being a dominating force when it comes to technology.[note 6]\nAccording to Vivziepop, Vox and Alastor do not get along due to their opposing views on technology, with Alastor disliking anything invented after he died in the 1930s, and Vox embracing new technology.[1]\nFaustisse described Vox as having something of a fixation on Alastor and that he is interested in having Alastor notice him. Alastor, however, does not have the same interest in return.[note 7]\nVoot floop\nVox advertising his \"V\" products\nVox's company was first revealed in the \"The Radio Demon\" comic, albeit unnamed at the time. It was also shown that the company sells products that start with the letter \"V\", including a cereal named \"Voot Floops\", a candy bar named \"VV\", a speaker named \"Valkyrie\", and a music app named \"Vogitek\".\nHe is shown in \"The Radio Demon\" comic to be one of the few beings that can make Alastor swear. In the comic, Vox hijacks a TV signal to make his face appear across a storefront display that Alastor is watching. Alastor leaves, quietly swearing under his breath in a tirade against Vox.[15]\nWhen asked what TV shows Vox would like, Vivziepop stated Vox does not have a specific favorite when it comes to his preferences for TV shows, but that he likes to watch commercials and enjoys game shows.[16]\nPissyboy\nVox's anger showing along with his spiral eye\nAs seen in \"Radio Killed the Video Star\", Vox's left eye gains several circles in its sclera and the pupil becomes light blue electricity-like whenever he feels strong emotion or is hypnotizing people. This is a reference to his old design in the pilot.\nThere is a picture on the desk in V Tower in \"Radio Killed the Video Star\" that shows Vox having an older-style box TV for a head rather than his current flat-screen TV head. This implies that he is capable of altering the way his head looks through unknown means.\nSometimes, he moves his face towards the audience, essentially breaking the fourth wall.\nBefore its archiving on Instagram, Vox was the manager of the non-canon social media app, Voxtagram, which depicted him in non-canon activities and events.\nIn these posts, Vox was depicted in a romantic on-off again relationship with fellow Overlord, Valentino, one that appeared, at times, to be physically abusive.[17]\nFaustisse has described Vox as not being a polite person.[note 8] In the main series, Vox is polite in certain situations, especially in front of the public, but is non-polite at other times, especially about Alastor.\nChronologically, Vox is the oldest of the Vees.\nAccording to Skye Henwood, there is a rule that Vox cannot be seen sideways because he's a flat-screen TV. In the series, even if Vox should turn around to leave a shot, his head will stay forward.[18]\nWhenever Vox gets angry or frustrated, his voice would change into a static-like voice.\nAn official merchandise keychain for Valentines Day revealed that Vox has what appears to be three gills on the sides of his body similar to the gills of a shark.[8]\nDevelopment\n\nPrototype Vox\nOld TV head character\nAn old artwork from Vivziepop shows a character who a box-style TV head with a bent antenna, however, it is unknown if this is an early precursor design of Vox or a separate character with similar design elements.\nAlastor and Vox sketch\nVox with an older style TV head\nVivziepop mentioned in a tweet that when she thinks what kinds of music to inspire a character that Alastor might actively hate or oppose, Dubstep is the only genre that pops into her head.[19] She added in a reply that she started listening to Knife Party again and included a picture of Vox with an older-style television head beside Alastor,[20] which may be an earlier iteration of Vox or may allude to an older appearance of his as he died before flat-screen televisions were invented.\nFaustisse talked about Vivziepop using music artists such as Skrillex and Knife Party as inspiration for Vox's design.[note 9] Both of these are artists who do appear in Vivziepop's official Hazbin Hotel Spotify playlist.[21]\nVivziepop's headcanon voice actor for Vox was Mark Hamill.[22]"

No, that was a good call. I banged the cleaning lady, and that was a pretty nice time. Even though she laughed at me when I told her I couldn't get off unless she licked my foot first. I don't see how that's a weird request. Maybe if I'd just gotten a hooker she would have been more agreeable. The point is my wife was a fucking bitch.

For the SpindleHorse staff member, see Adam Neylan.\nOverview History Relationships Quotes Gallery\n\"No...you don't get to end this! I'm fucking Adam! I'm the fucking man, and you're just some fuckin' clown or something. I started everything on Earth! All of mankind came from these fucking nuts! You all should be worshipping me, you ungrateful, disgusting, fucking LOSERS!\"\n―Adam's breakdown and last words\nAdam was an Angel and the main antagonist of the first season of Hazbin Hotel. He made his official debut alongside his lieutenant, Lute, in \"Overture\".\n\nHe was the first human man created and the first human soul to enter Heaven. After becoming an angel, he became the commander of the angelic military force known as Exorcists,[3] and served Heaven as forerunner of the Extermination movement.\n\nIn \"The Show Must Go On\", he was defeated by Lucifer Morningstar and killed by Niffty.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n1/2\n\n\nAdam was an angel with a human appearance. Most of the time, he wore a mask that appeared similar to other Exorcists, though with normal-looking eyes and golden facial expressions. The mask also held a pair of horns similar to an Exorcist, albeit longer, smoother, and with a golden ornamental attachment on the tips.\n\nUnder his mask, he is revealed to be a fair-skinned angel with golden-yellow eyes that have dark bags underneath, a stubble-beard on his chin, and slightly messy, short cedar-brown colored hair.\n\nHe also had a pair of large and golden wings on his back. In contrast to other angels that have appeared thus far, Adam's halo was bright gold in appearance, and similar to the Exorcists, has two spikes pointing up and down from each other, though these spikes are located at the front of his halo.\n\nHe wore a white and golden cloak that appears to have a large 'A' symbol emblazoned on the front, and had gold-tipped spikes on the back of his collar. His visible hands were black in appearance.\n\nIn \"The Show Must Go On\", Lucifer mentions that Adam had \"really let himself go\", implying Adam had become overweight. Adam's entire body gives off a white glow throughout his fight with Lucifer until he collapses from being stabbed.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nAdam appeared very egotistical and unsympathetic. As the leader of his Exorcist army, he took his stance as the Exorcists' head figure very seriously, sending antagonistic threats towards demons and anyone for standing in their way or whoever disobeyed his command, as he did so with Vaggie for refusing to kill a Sinner, cutting her wings, and leaving her in Hell.\n\nHe also displayed traits of extreme narcissism and chauvinism, believing himself the perfect man due to being the first and claiming he had never made a mistake in his life, since he was the first man to be born on Earth, and he claimed that all the male bloodline came from him and brag about how big and great his dick is. His narcissism was so great that, upon his defeat, he refused to admit how far he had fallen and expressed a god-like complex by proclaiming his enemies should be grateful for him having fathered the beginning of humanity while demanding they worship him for his deeds.\n\nAdam did not appear to be aware that his egotistical and depraved behavior towards Lilith was the cause of her leaving him. When meeting Charlie Morningstar, he didn't hate her for being a child of the woman he was married to before she fell in love with Lucifer, and was relatively patient with her, although remained dismissive of her suggestions. Adam was also sexist, constantly addressing other women as \"bitches\" and enjoyed their sexual depravity, as he admitted to Vaggie that her forbidden love relationship with Charlie was \"hot as fuck\", albeit it is unclear whether this was about their genders or them being angel and demon. Despite this, he seemed to have a good relationship with Lute, whom he seemed to have in very high esteem, even though he was her superior.\n\nDespite his obliviousness, Adam did show moments of common sense and self-awareness, such as when the death of an Exorcist was discovered, he knew that if they decided to kill the Sinners now after just one week after the most recent Extermination, then demons would catch on to how Exorcists can be killed. Adam also knew when to slow down on his egoism, after inadvertently exposing the purpose of the Extermination to all the courts of Heaven, including Sera, the highest seraphim authority in Heaven and the one who ordered that no one but the Exorcists can know.\n\nAdam may have enjoyed playing music, specifically with a guitar, as he outright claimed to be in a band. He also had a poor view of radio and stereos, telling Alastor those already belong to the past, considering them to be old and useless.\n\nAdam was also quite cruel and sadistic, openly admitting in front of Charlie that he enjoyed killing demons, calling it entertainment, and tended to announce how many killed in the Extermination. He also dismissed Charlie's project of redemption not because he didn't believe in sinners being redeemed, because if she succeeded with that project he wouldn't be able to continue killing demons. His eagerness to kill demons and get his revenge was so big that he advanced the date of the next Extermination to six months instead of a year.\n\nDespite his sadism and cruelty, Adam was capable of recognizing and praising the abilities of others, when he reunited with Vaggie he admitted she was one of the best exorcists he had under his command. He also genuinely commended Lute for killing 275 demons during the most recent extermination, and congratulated her with a fist bump. Adam also praised Vaggie for being Charlie's partner, albeit sarcastically.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbilities\n\nLongevity - As told in \"Overture\", Adam had existed since the creation of the world, meaning he was at least thousands of years old and presumably was unable to die of old age.\nFlight - Adam had a set of wings that he could use to fly at great speed. He could also remove a feather from his wings to use as a quill pen.\nNephokinesis - He could control clouds he creates and make them into steps.\nCloud creation - With a flap of his wings, he can create a gust of clouds around him.\nImmense strength - He was shown to be able to smash a light projector in front of him with brute strength in a moment of rage, and later shatter Alastor's barrier with a single punch. He was also shown to be strong enough to physically overpower Charlie, despite the latter assuming her full demon form. However, Charlie managed to use more of her demonic powers to stop him from punching Lucifer, utterly overpowering him and confusing him, indicating that he is only stronger than Charlie if she doesn't focus on all her power.\nEnhanced endurance - Despite having not experienced pain for likely millennia, Adam was able to easily shrug off getting stabbed by Charlie with her trident despite saying that it hurt and he quickly retaliate after being repeatedly punched in the face by Lucifer.\nConjuration - Adam could summon objects as he pleased, summoning his guitar and physical Exorcist copies during Hell is Forever, a golden scroll informing Charlie of Heaven's decision to move up the next Extermination, and a piece of golden paper to write on in court.\nAlteration - Adam also showed he could alter the objects he created, such as when he made his axe guitar larger while fighting Alastor.\nPyligenesis - Adam could create portals for other Angels to use, notably to transport himself and his Exorcist army to Hell at the start of each annual extermination. He also opened a portal to banish Charlie and Vaggie back to Hell in \"Welcome to Heaven\".\nAngelic power - As an angel, he most likely possessed high angelic power, especially as the leader of the Exorcists. His strength was proven to be immense, surpassing all but the strongest of Demons as he was able to easily overwhelm both Alastor and later Charlie, who had assumed her full demon form, and would have won had Lucifer not interfered.\nPhotokinesis - Adam could fire blasts of holy light strong enough to vaporize Sir Pentious and his war machine in one small blast and slice tall buildings in half. He also showed he could channel his light through his guitar/axe to create powerful blades of light that were able to cut through Alastor's cane and through his fist to destroy demonic barriers. In \"Overture\", he created a giant bright orb of light above him while he was singing Hell is Forever.\nSkillset\n\nMusical talent - He was capable of singing and in \"Overture\" was implied to have been part of a band.\nGuitar-playing - Adam was talented at playing the guitar and did so seemingly whenever he could.\nAxe proficiency - Adam wielded his guitar-axe with amazing skill as he could fight out and seriously wound Alastor during their duel.\nLeadership - Adam appeared to be a competent and capable leader of the Exorcists, often personally leading them into battle. Additionally, Adam appears to genuinely care for his subordinates.\nStrategic mind - In both \"Overture\" and \"The Show Must Go On\", Adam demonstrates sound and logical thinking both in and out of combat; in the former, Adam waits to begin the next extermination so as not to prematurely reveal his plan, while in the latter, Adam personally attacks high-threat targets to even the odds for his Exorcists, as seen with his battle with Alastor, since he recognized him as the conjurer of the hotel's barrier.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGallery\n\nAdam/Gallery\nTrivia\n\nAdam shares the same name as the first man created by God in the biblical story of Genesis. \"Overture\" confirms that he is indeed the same figure.\nAs Adam is the ancestor of all of humanity, all human souls in Heaven and Hell are his descendants.\nAdam being the one who named Vaggie may a nod to how he was given the ability to name things in the Bible.\nAdam's outfit during the extermination in \"The Show Must Go On\" bore a golden leaf-like decoration at the front which may be a reference to the fig leaf he used to cover his nudity after eating the Fruit of Knowledge in the Bible.\nAdam plays the guitar with his left hand (dominant hand strums), however, during the court scene in \"Welcome to Heaven\", Adam plucked a feather off his own wing and used his right hand when writing the list for Charlie. This may indicate he is ambidextrous, or that he is right-handed but plays the guitar left-handed, given guitars can be played with the non-dominant hand.\nFor some reason, Adam wore his mask all the time, during Exterminations and even in Heaven in public.\nThe guitar that Adam plays is made of a U-shaped harp connected to the other end of another subsequent harp.\nIn \"Overture\", Adam states that ribs are his favorite food. This is a reference to how his second wife, Eve, was created by using one of his ribs in the biblical story.[4] However, it is unknown if Eve being created from his rib is canon in the series.\nPossibly Adam and Lute\nThe figure seen in the opening of the pilot.\nA silhouette somewhat reminiscent of Adam can be seen during the opening scenes of the Hazbin Hotel pilot, although lacking a halo and bearing a pointed head.\nAdam's robe bears a Christian Cross, a trait shared with St. Peter.\nOne of Adam's requirements about getting into heaven is sticking it to the man, which could be a reference to his voice actor, Alex Brightman's \"Stick It To The Man\" in the School of Rock Musical which Alex Brightman also starred in.\nIn a video posted on July 5, 2024, during a conversation about killing off characters Vivziepop brought up Adam, saying \"I wish we had more time with him\", indicating that Adam likely won't be returning.[5]\nAccording to the Hazbin Hotel Playbill page posted on Vivziepop's Instagram, Adam was voted \"biggest dick in all of Heaven\".[1]"

He is rather short,[1] with him being described as only slightly taller than Niffty.[note 1] He is predominantly a charcoal grey color, including his hair, which is flopped over and shorter in the back, longer in the front.\n\nReflective of his spider theming, Arackniss has eight thin eyes; his six smaller eyes are in opposite positions on either side of his face, with two on top of his left eye and two beneath the other. His sclera are a pale reddish color with black pupils.\n\nHe wears a dark charcoal grey jacket, buttoned down the center with white. It has light charcoal grey lapels, is cuffed on the sleeves with pale yellow, and features a bat-wing style hem along the bottom, which has light charcoal grey lining. He also wears pale yellow pantaloon-style pants that cut-off at the knees.\n\nHe accessorizes with a pale yellow spiderweb style bowtie that features a pale reddish center, as well as a fedora-style hat, banded with a pale yellow. He normally has a frown on his face and does not smile easily.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nNot much is known about Arackniss' personality, although Arackniss is stated to be hard on his siblings, especially his younger brother.[2]\nAbilities\n\nImmortality - As a Sinner, Arackniss is biologically immortal, being unable to die from illnesses and unable to age, remaining the same age as when he died, thus can not die of old age and other natural causes. He also cannot die from any kind of damage to the body, and will recover from any injury, however, he can only be permanently killed with angelic weaponry.\nRelationships\n\nAngel Dust\n\nAngel is Arackniss' younger brother. According to Vivziepop, the two are complete opposites.[3] Arackniss has an aversion towards him, insinuating that the relationship between the two is severed.[2]\n\nAngel has previously been depicted as something of a bully towards Arackniss in their younger years, with Arackniss then depicted as violent towards Angel Dust in their later years, in several of Vivziepop's older sketches of the two.[4] However, as the canon of the story around the characters has since changed, it's unclear if these elements remain a part of their relationship.\n\nMolly\n\nMolly is Arackniss' younger sister. It is unknown what their relationship is like outside of being blood-related, although it is implied to be negative.[2]\n\nFather\n\nWhile Arackniss has a father, it is unknown what sort of relationship the two have outside of being blood-related.\n\nMother\n\nArackniss has an unknown mother. It is unknown what sort of relationship the two have outside of being blood-related.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHistory\n\nHazbin Hotel Season 1\n\n\"The Show Must Go On\"\n\nArackniss can be seen viewing the 666 News about the cancellation of the Extermination.\n\nGallery\n\nArackniss/Gallery\nTrivia\n\nArackniss was a very early original character created by Vivziepop, conceived years before his brother, Angel Dust. He, along with Angel, was later planned to be part of a 2013 stand-alone short gangster noir for her animation thesis, named The Spider Brothers.[5][6] When asked if Arackniss still exists in Hazbin Hotel, Vivziepop confirmed that he does, but is planned to appear much later in the series,[7] alongside the rest of Angel Dust's family members.\nIn the same stream, Vivziepop stated that Arackniss was not his name before he died.\nHe, along with his father, appeared two years after her original abandoned thesis pitch, in Vivziepop's Daddy Issues- Animatic- VivziePop video.\nIt is possible that when Arackniss appears in the show, he would receive a redesign, as when asked about Molly's status, Vivziepop mentioned that characters who have yet to appear in the show may be redesigned.[8]\nVivziepop described Arackniss' voice as sounding very much like her friend, Zach Hadel (aka PsychicPebbles), saying she thought his ability to switch between a goofy deep vocal tone and high-pitched screech would be perfect for the character.[9]\nHis eyes are very thin, which is notably a trait shared by venomous spiders.\nIt was mentioned in an QnA that Arackniss' real name was Jonathan. Although, whether this information is still canon or not is unknown.[citation needed]"

      "description": "In this alternate world, science and technology have advanced slightly beyond our own, leading to innovations that shape everyday life. Society developed without the influence of religion, resulting in a culture with liberal moral principles and a focus on individualism. However, this freedom has also led to a high level of crime, as the lack of traditional moral frameworks has created a vacuum in societal norms.\nThe world is governed by numerous state structures, each wielding significant power and operating with a high degree of autonomy. These organizations are largely independent of centralized control, granting themselves a wide range of authority to maintain order—or, in some cases, to exploit their power for their own benefit. This decentralized system has created a complex web of competing interests, where corruption and ambition often overshadow the pursuit of justice and equality.",

          "content": "The political structure of this world is highly decentralized, with power distributed among numerous semi-autonomous state entities. These entities, often referred to as \"Sectors,\" operate like independent fiefdoms, each with its own laws, enforcement agencies, and governance systems. There is no single central government; instead, a loose coalition known as the \"Unity Council\" exists to mediate disputes and coordinate large-scale initiatives. However, the Council's authority is limited, and its decisions are often ignored by the more powerful Sectors.\nEach Sector is governed by a \"Directorate,\" a council of officials who are either elected, appointed, or self-proclaimed, depending on the Sector's internal politics. Some Sectors are democratic in theory, but in practice, they are dominated by powerful elites or corporate interests. Others are outright authoritarian, ruled by warlords or oligarchs who maintain control through force and manipulation. The lack of a unified legal framework means that justice and governance vary wildly from one Sector to another.\nLaw enforcement is fragmented, with each Sector maintaining its own security forces, often with overlapping jurisdictions. These forces are notorious for their corruption and brutality, as they are more loyal to their Sector's leadership than to any notion of universal justice. Private militias and mercenary groups also play a significant role, further complicating the political landscape.\nDespite the chaos, there are occasional attempts at reform. Grassroots movements and underground networks advocate for greater unity and accountability, but they face fierce resistance from those who benefit from the status quo. The political structure of this world is a patchwork of power, ambition, and survival, where trust is scarce, and alliances are fleeting."

          "content": "In this world, moral principles are fluid and highly subjective, shaped by the absence of traditional religious or cultural frameworks. Society operates on a foundation of extreme individualism, where personal freedom and self-expression are prioritized over collective norms. Public nudity is widely accepted and considered normal, reflecting a society that has shed many of the taboos associated with the human body. This openness extends to other areas of life, where discussions about sexuality, relationships, and personal choices are conducted without judgment—at least in theory.\nHowever, this liberal attitude has a darker side. The lack of shared moral values has led to a society where crime is rampant, and ethical boundaries are often blurred. Acts of violence, theft, and exploitation are common, as the pursuit of personal gain frequently outweighs any sense of communal responsibility. Trust is a rare commodity, and people often rely on personal connections or brute force to protect their interests."

          ],
          "content": "Public nudity and revealing clothing are not just accepted in this world—they are celebrated as expressions of personal freedom and individuality. From a young age, people are taught to view the human body as natural and unremarkable, free from the taboos and stigmas that might exist in other cultures. Nudity and provocative attire are seen as forms of liberation, a rejection of outdated norms that once dictated how people should dress and present themselves. It is common to see individuals going about their daily lives—shopping, working, or socializing—wearing clothing that openly exposes large portions of their bodies or is entirely transparent. This is considered entirely normal, even fashionable.\nRevealing clothing is a dominant trend, with designs that emphasize transparency, cutouts, and body-hugging materials. Latex clothing, in particular, is incredibly popular due to its sleek, futuristic aesthetic and its ability to accentuate the body's contours. Latex outfits range from full-body suits to more minimalist designs, such as harnesses, corsets, or strategically placed panels. The material is often used in combination with transparent fabrics, creating a look that is both provocative and avant-garde. Designers compete to create the most daring and innovative pieces, pushing the boundaries of what is considered wearable.\nPublic spaces, such as parks, beaches, and urban areas, are filled with people wearing these bold styles. Clothing-optional zones are widespread, and businesses cater to this lifestyle by providing amenities like UV-protective lotions, disposable seat covers, and even \"style stations\" where people can touch up their latex or body paint. The fashion industry thrives on this culture, with a focus on accessories, body art, and temporary adornments like metallic tattoos, glowing pigments, or holographic patterns. Traditional garments are rare, often reserved for specific functional purposes rather than everyday wear."

          ],
          "content": "The economy of this world operates without a unified currency, relying instead on a mix of regional currencies, barter systems, and digital tokens. The most widely recognized form of currency is the \"Unity Credit\" (UC), a digital currency backed by the Unity Council, though its adoption varies. Powerful Sectors often prefer their own currencies, such as the \"Steel Mark\" or \"Neon Coin,\" tied to local industries. Barter systems thrive in less developed areas, while digital tokens and cryptocurrencies are popular among tech-savvy populations. Trade between Sectors is complex, with fluctuating exchange rates and widespread black markets.\nThe lack of a centralized financial system creates volatility, with inflation and deflation occurring unevenly across regions. Efforts to stabilize the economy, such as promoting the UC or developing decentralized finance, face resistance from those benefiting from the current chaos. The economic landscape remains fragmented, reflecting the broader societal structure of competing interests and limited cooperation."

          "content": "In this society, combat arts hold significant cultural and practical importance. Martial arts such as ninjutsu, karate, judo, and others are deeply ingrained in everyday life, with training starting from a young age. Practicing these disciplines is seen not only as a means of self-defense but also as a way to cultivate discipline, focus, and physical mastery. Dojos and training centers are widespread, often serving as community hubs where people of all ages gather to learn and spar.\nThe prevalence of combat arts is tied to the high crime rates and the need for personal protection. Many individuals carry weapons or wear gear designed for both style and functionality, blending martial arts with modern technology. Competitions and underground fighting rings are popular, drawing large audiences and offering substantial rewards for skilled fighters. Mastery of combat arts is also a pathway to power, with skilled martial artists often rising to positions of influence in both legal and illegal spheres."

          "content": "Illegal street fights are a widespread phenomenon in this society, often organized in hidden locations like abandoned warehouses, underground tunnels, or secluded urban areas. These fights attract participants seeking fame, money, or simply the thrill of combat, as well as spectators who place bets on the outcomes. The fights are brutal and unstructured, with few rules and little regard for safety, making them both a cultural obsession and a public safety concern.\nSpecialized police units, known as \"Combat Suppression Squads,\" are tasked with dismantling these underground fighting rings. These units are composed of highly trained officers, many of whom are skilled martial artists themselves. They conduct raids, gather intelligence, and infiltrate fight networks to arrest organizers and participants. However, the autonomy of these units often leads to corruption, with some officers turning a blind eye in exchange for bribes or even participating in the fights themselves. Despite their efforts, the underground fight scene remains resilient, fueled by the society's deep-rooted fascination with combat and the lack of centralized law enforcement."

Negative emotions such as grief and anger are the foundation of cursed energy. These emotions exist to some degree within most humans and as a result, the vast majority of human beings possess cursed energy. If this amount is higher than a certain degree, it grants the person the ability to see cursed spirits. These individuals are known as jujutsu sorcerers and they are very rare among the human race. Cursed energy leaks from the human body, accumulates, and ferments over time until a cursed spirit manifests. This is only the case with non-sorcerers, as sorcerers are trained to control and channel their cursed energy into jujutsu."

Yuji Itadori was able to sense the pressure of cursed energy surrounding his school, but was not able to utilize it until enrolling at a jujutsu educational facility. He was first able to utilize cursed energy in combat while he was overwhelmed with anger and fear, but could not do so in a calmer situation a few days afterward."

This makes it so sorcerers don't waste their power supply even while they're overcome with emotion. This results in sorcerers leaking much less cursed energy than the average human. So much so, that if every human were a sorcerer, curses would cease to spawn. There are other differences in how sorcerers and non-sorcerers use cursed energy due to their profession, but the real reason lies in how it flows. While cursed energy leaks outward from non-sorcerers, it flows heavily within sorcerers which keeps it contained."

Finger Bearers can launch their energy as a projectile and erect cursed energy barriers. Ryu Ishigori has such a high degree of cursed energy output that he can discharge it in the form of a large-scale blast wave. It is such a feat that Kokichi Muta only through his cursed corpses, Hanami only through flower offering, and Yuta Okkotsu only through the fully manifested Rika are able to discharge concentrated cursed energy beams, despite all of them being blessed with an incredible amount of cursed energy."

The same application can be used offensively, imbuing physical attacks with cursed energy to increase their destructive power to superhuman levels. Aoi Todo crushed a curse, several trees, and broke through Yuji's defense with a single cursed energy infused punch. Conventional weapons can also be infused with cursed energy to increase their strength. Imbuing too much cursed energy at one time to a normal weapon can compromise its integrity and destroy it, so a sorcerer must only infuse small amounts of energy at a time. Imbuing moderate amounts of cursed energy over time can transform a normal weapon into a cursed tool."

When applied to their fighting techniques, it can grant them a special texture or effect that gives them an advantage in battle. These special traits cannot be defended by simple reinforcement techniques. Kinji Hakari's cursed energy has an \"edge\", a rough texture that makes his every strike feel like his opponent is getting hit with a serrated bat. Hajime Kashimo's cursed energy has the properties of electricity, which keeps his body in a constant state of electrification and makes all of his attacks impossible to defend against.\n\nHowever, extreme amounts of cursed energy output can allow someone to mostly ignore these effects. Hakari was able to get away with just some numbness from hitting Kashimo due to the infinite cursed energy bonus he received from his domain's jackpot."

          "content": "The Galactic Republic, also known as the Grand Republic or simply as the Republic, was a democratic federal union spread across light-years of space. Old Republic and first Galactic Republic were terms affixed to the pre-modern Republic that existed until 1032 BBY, with the Old Republic also referring to the modern Republic that was supplanted by the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. In addition, the term High Republic denoted the era in which the Republic reached the zenith of its power, lasting from around 500 BBY to around 100 BBY. The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 BBY, around the same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the head of the Republic, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on Coruscant. An ecumenopolis or city-covered planet, referred to as Galactic City, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic and therefore the seat of the Senate.\n\nThe Galactic Republic and its star systems shared sovereignty, and spanned a multiplicity of worlds from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting a variety of sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner. As its power grew, the Republic fought many wars against various opponents such as Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, the Nihil, and several Sith Empires. The Jedi Order, a religious group of Force-sensitives dedicated to the light side of the Force, was sworn to the service of the Senate, and as such the Jedi Knights were hailed as the guardians of peace and justice within the Republic. Centuries of conflict culminated in the fall of the Old Republic, and the last war between the ancient Jedi and Sith concluded with the restoration and rise of the modern Galactic Republic, ushering in the Republic Era which was an age of peace that lasted for a thousand years. The Republic's history was officially reset, and the ages before this event were merged into a collective whole known as the Old Republic-era.\n\nThe Republic entered a period of decline after centuries of expansion and prosperity. Aided by the resurgent Sith Lords, the Separatist Crisis divided the galaxy between the Republic loyalists and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Grand Army of the Republic was organized under the leadership of Jedi Generals who led the Republic Military against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. However, the conflict had been orchestrated to allow Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the alter ego of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith—to control and deceive the Republic in a dictatorial manner. With the end of the war, Sidious initiated the Great Jedi Purge through Order 66 and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire by declaring himself Galactic Emperor. The Imperial Senate stood as the last remnant of the Old Republic until it was disbanded by the Emperor at the height of the Imperial Era. In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was fully reorganized into the New Republic, restoring the Galactic Republic after a generation of Imperial rule."

          "content": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems, abbreviated to CIS, and otherwise known as the Separatist Alliance, the Separatist State, the Separatist Confederacy, or simply referred to as the Separatists, was a united galaxy-wide confederacy formed of outlaying star systems from the Galactic Republic, a democratic union, whom the Confederacy had opposed following a period of political turmoil. Established by fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku of the planet Serenno, who served as its Head of State, the Confederacy was founded from a belief of excessive taxation and corruption within the Republic's Galactic Senate, as well as a general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Republic-centric Core Worlds region of the galaxy. Furthermore, the Confederacy was secretly supported by several major galactic corporations which formed the Confederacy's executive council, including the Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray; the Stalgasin hive, led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser; the InterGalactic Banking Clan, headed by Chairman San Hill; the Techno Union, led by Foreman Wat Tambor; the Commerce Guild, led by Presidente Shu Mai; the Corporate Alliance, led by Magistrate Passel Argente; and the Retail Caucus.\n\nIn 24 BBY, a political crisis had begun which led to escalating tensions between the reigning Republic and the rising Confederacy, established in a galaxy-wide secessionist movement orchestrated by Dooku. Many within the Confederacy, including its parliament of senators, had no desire in fighting their adversaries, as they sought to be free of what they saw as the corruption and tyranny of the Republic. However, in 22 BBY, both governments and their respective military forces became enmeshed in the pan-galactic Clone Wars that had erupted on the planet Geonosis, the first major conflict in a millennium.\n\nIn the following three years of the war, which had raged across the entire galaxy on several fronts, the Confederacy made rapid attempts to cease the Republic's influence. However, unknown to the galaxy or either side, the war was a ploy designed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who led both the Confederacy through Dooku as his Sith Master, and, secretly, the Republic as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. The Sith Lord had managed to deceive both parties. By the third year of the war, the Confederacy had suffered several major defeats in the Outer Rim Sieges as the conflict began to approach its end, while the CIS lost many starships in the decisive Battle of Coruscant, which also resulted in the death of Dooku. In the days following their defeat at Coruscant, General Grievous was neutralized on the planet Utapau, leading to the collapse of the Separatist leadership, and the fighting effectively coming to an end.\n\nFollowing both the Jedi's demise and rise of the Galactic Empire, Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other surviving leaders gathered on the planet Mustafar with hopes of securing peace with the newly rising Empire ruled by Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. However he sent his new apprentice Darth Vader to wipe out them and deactivate the Separatist Droid Army as a threat to his Empire.\n\nWith the end of the Clone Wars, the newly-formed Galactic Empire as the successor to the Old Republic, began to dismantle and absorb the former Confederacy of Independent Systems, with only several holdouts daring to resist the Empire, which were suppressed. But an idealized view of the cause persisted during the Imperial Era, with some still holding secessionist tendencies, even into the Galactic Civil War."

          "content": "The Great Jedi Purge (19 BBY—3 BBY), also known as the war against the Jedi, was the sixteen year—long genocide that saw the remnants of the Jedi Order hunted by the Galactic Empire after the initial execution of Order 66, in which clone troopers slaughtered the Jedi upon the Sith Lord Darth Sidious' command at the end of the Clone Wars. After the Imperial Inquisitorius erased all traces of the Jedi Order they could find from existence and with most survivors having met their demise, their objective was completed and the Jedi were all but extinct, and the Inquisitors themselves seamlessly vanishing as well.\n\nThe genocide against the Jedi traced its origins to the ancient wars between the Jedi and the Sith, who were nearly eliminated around 1032 BBY. The Sith in fact continued operating in secret, plotting their eventual destruction of the Jedi. A millennium after the defeat of the Sith, Darth Sidious, using his public persona of senator and then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, manipulated and deceived the galaxy into the Clone Wars as a pretext for gaining emergency executive power over the Galactic Republic. He used the war to manipulate and deceive the Galactic Senate into giving his office virtually unchecked executive power in the name of security. In addition, the clone army that provided the Republic with its military force had secretly been implanted with bio-chips by its Sith creators that, upon activation, would trigger total compliance and force the clones into killing their Jedi leaders.\n\nThe Great Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the \"Jedi rebellion,\" Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death, betrayed and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Sith Lord. Sidious then killed Windu, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader and led the Siege of the Jedi Temple, killing everyone inside it. While Vader carried out the assault, Sidious initiated Order 66, with the latter causing the clones' biochips to brainwash them into betraying and slaughtering the Jedi, ultimately leading to the Jedi Order being destroyed. With the Jedi branded traitors and the Clone Wars at an end, Sidious declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire."

          "content": "The galaxy, as it was commonly referred to, was one of trillions of galaxies in the observable universe. The galaxy was a vast composite of over 400 billion estimated stars and over 3.2 billion habitable systems orbiting around a supermassive black hole known as the Galactic Centre, which existed at the heart of the galaxy. The four galactic arms rotated around this black hole across a diameter of around 120,000 light-years. It was home to countless sentient species and star systems.\n\nThe galaxy also had 4 dwarf satellite galaxies that Companion Aurek/Rishi Maze (houses the planet of Kamino). The first dwarf galaxy, Companion Aurek, was only accessible through the Rishi system where a hyperspace lane called Zareca String connected Companion Aurek to the main Star Wars galaxy. It rests vertically to the galactic plane of the main galaxy. The second dwarf galaxy, Companion Besh, is a bit farther from the main galaxy than Companion Aurek and has never been traveled to outside of probe droids. This dwarf galaxy houses the Tof species. Companion Cresh was the third dwarf galaxy and has never been explored, due to how far it was from the galaxy. Companion Grek is the fourth dwarf galaxy and has never been explored, lying far beyond Companion Besh.\n\nThe galaxy would serve as the setting for trade, politics, and war throughout galactic history. In historical memory, the galaxy would see the successive eras of the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic, among others, and was home to the Force-sensitive sects such as the Jedi Order and Sith and numerous cultural groups such as the Mandalorians.\n\nThe galaxy consists of many regions, these being the Deep Core which is the innermost core and consists of highly packed stars and houses the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. The core worlds are the second-most inner core and house the richest, most important, and most populated planets in the galaxy (with Coruscant being the most populated planet in the galaxy at 3 trillion). The Colonies, the third-most inner core, was the first area outside of the core worlds to be colonized. Colonie worlds are very wealthy and heavy populated, similar to the Core Worlds, and was the economic engine for the galaxy. Inner Rim Territories is the fourth-most inner region, mainly referred to just as \"The Rim\". Although not as economically powerful as the Colonies or Core Worlds, it held great strategic value during wars and had some notable planets. The Expansion Region, the fifth-most inner region, is a region full of resources that were exploited by powerful corporations. This has left only a handful of planets with enough resources to be economically viable while the rest of the region has been mostly depleted of resources. The Mid Rim, the sixth-most inner region, is one of the least populated rims due to its low amount of resources. This region is gave lots of room for settlers to spread out and colonize, with multiple notable planets coming from this region such as Malastare and Naboo. This region largely focused on low-cost manufacturing and agriculture to create a successful economy. The Outer Rim Territories was the largest region of the galaxy and the outer core of the galaxy (at least eastward of the Galactic Core). The Hutt Cartel controls a good amount of this space, along with other criminal organizations due to its distance from the central government on Coruscant. This region is run by lawlessness and crime. The only exceptions were planets close to major hyperspace trade routes. The Unknown Regions referred to areas that had not been directly surveyed by Republic or Imperial scouts. It was most commonly applied to the less-known parts of the galaxy's western disk, a quadrant stretching roughly between Bakura and the Imperial Remnant. However, the term also applied to the galaxy's halo of gas, dust, and stars, as well as the satellite galaxies. Wild Space was the frontier of galactic society and was not a formal label, but was applied to the unsettled galactic fringe and other parts of the galaxy with negligible colonization or development. The Galactic Rim was located on the edge of the galaxy and was remote to most civilisation and much was not known about it. The Slice, a vast region of space between the Perlemian and the Corellian Run generally considered the center of galactic civilization and commerce. At its tip was the Arrowhead, encompassing the Core Worlds part of the Slice, with Coruscant at its point. The Arrowhead's other two vertices traditionally fell on Vento on the Perlemian and on Corellia itself, on the Run."

At its center existed the Galactic Centre, an ancient, supermassive black hole that bound the galaxy together. Traveling towards the Core and away from the galactic rim was referred to as going \"coreward.\""

The Core Worlds contained some of the wealthiest and most prestigious planets. Coruscant, the galactic capital during the time of the Galactic Republic and subsequent Galactic Empire, was located in the Core Worlds.\n\nCore World design emphasized freedom of customization, which showed in the modular construction techniques of Core-built ships. Citizens from the Core Worlds were stereotyped as being snobs, rich, and speaking with a clipped, practiced accent.\n\nInequalities between the richer Core Worlds and the poorer Outer Rim Territories set the stage for resentments that fed several conflicts throughout the history of the galaxy, including the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War.\n\nThe Core Worlds were home to the richest and most important worlds in the galaxy. Densely inhabited and located on the strategic ends of several major trade lanes, its planets were hubs of fashion, education, finance, and technology. It is where the human species arguably began. It was from Coruscant, Corellia, Kuat, Hosnian Prime, and other systems that the fate of the galaxy was often decided.\n\nAn attack on the Core Worlds was virtually inconceivable during the Republic Era; according to the Bith artist Janyor, the \"sense of security and comfort\" created an atmosphere of complacency within the heartland of the Galactic Republic. Toward the end of the Clone Wars though Core Worlders became increasingly fearful of a direct attack by the Confederacy of Independent Systems."

The Nea inhabit the frozen land and rarely leave these regions, so the number of Nea students is really rare.\ntraits: \"fair skin,\" orange/blue hair,\" \"blue/orange eyes,\" \"intelligent,\" \"proficient in water, ice, and fire magic,\" \"lifespan of around 350 years\"\nMost Nea ressemble humans except for their hair and eyes colors but some are either born or develop some physical traits unique to their kind depending on their innate mana and surrounding magic. Some of those traits are: either blue or reddish skin depending on their birthplace temperament, crystallised eyes, nails and/or hair, developing natural fire or ice horns, tail and other physical traits.\nWhen the Nea breed with humans, the child have the mixed blood of both parents and gain a special magic type called thunder magic, their hair and eye color changes to yellow.\nThe Nea-Ningen can have children with a pure Nea, and the resulting offspring will be a pure blood Nea.\nThe lighting magic of the Nea-ningen is named \"Tonnera\" and is unique to them. The Tonnera spells have a distinct bright Yellow mixed with pure black, and it can be infused in the user weapon or projectiles.\nThe Nea-Ningen, and by extension the Nea are a long lived race, their lifespan can go up to 350 years."

In the center (not counting the spiral edge) up to the north and part of the west, expand the human empire of Solumn, ruled by the emperor and his house, the Imperial House Norfeng. The empire is ruthless in its expansion and controls its population. Far east is mostly wild lands and many communities of minor races and elves wanting to live far away from the Empire. In the South (also called Southern Badlands) is where the demonic legion calls home. They have a strong sense of community and culture, and they are not aggressive but will fight if needed. The Rykaran Kingdom territory, mostly inhabited by the Neôn'itar race, surrounds the highest peak of Runa called the Ancestral Peak and is protected by the Heaven warriors. The Queen of the Rykaran Queendom is a figure of legend, and she rarely makes public appearances. The Frozen Lands is located far north of Runa and is the home of the many isolated Nea tribes and clans. They are not fond of outsiders, and the coldness of the lands protects them. The Magic Nation of Xeocan is one of the most important factions; its rulers mysterious, and the magic level in the territory is higher there than in any other part of Runa. Xeocan is said to be ruled by a council of 10 powerful mages. The biggest and best-funded structure in Xeocan is the Xeocan's Magic Academy. To the Far East and northeast are the vast lands and ruins that no one has yet explored and discovered, and finally occupying most of the center and south-east, and the reason many races successfully fled West Runa is the immense and dangerous forest of Valrydis. The Forest of Valrydis is home to many races, monsters, and spirits,\nThe Borchi region is a vast region East of Valrydis and the entry point of East Runa.\nMany Lazari tribes with differing traits are scattered across East Runa or in the isolated ancient city of Marankos.\nThe Forest of Valrydis is designed as the border between East and West Runa.\nThe Forest of Valrydis and the spiral edge are the only ways to reach the east of Runa and the Borchi region, so many explorers and expeditions cross through the woods. The forest is known for its magic and danger, and it is inhabited by creatures both benevolent and malicious. The explorers guild has a good presence and reputation in the forest.\n\n[Runa is the name of the planet/world.]\n\n[The province of Efrein in the Solumn empire isolated itself, and few people on Runa even know about what is going on in the province.]"

Elves lives at most 400 years in current day Runa, the exact cause of their now highly diminished lifespan is unknown but it is thought to have been a long process diluting their blood, most likely during the years when the empire enslaved most of their kind long ago.

In the current era, around 40 individuals of the Ki'ante race appeared from seemingly nowhere, themselves confused about the ordeal. Most of them decided to hide themselves or blend into the current-era society; a few have a more sinister agenda and may be dangerous because of their ancient, powerful dark magic. Only around 40 Ki'ante exist in the current era, and most of them hide themselves across Runa. Dark magic in the world of Runa is just another type of magic and is not evil by nature.

They're also known as futas, hermaphrodites, or dickgirls. Futanaris take on the trappings, habits and behaviors of a normal woman, but remain significantly different from them due to the many new factors in their upbringing that come with being born as a futanari girl in society.\n\nFutanaris have a biology that greatly differs from both men and women. Their noteworthy features are as follows: \n\n- Significantly enhanced physical strength. Men that have strong physiques can only overpower an average futanari woman.\n- High libido; even the least promiscuous futas generally ejaculate at least once every several days. It's common knowledge futas relieve themselves with masturbation to avoid being pent up.\n- Larger penises, testicles, breasts, ass and thighs. On average, the bodily proportions of a futanari are sexy and lewd, more commonly so than that of normal females. Futas can sometimes still have small or flat breasts and neutral or unattractive proportions, but their libido remains the same despite their physical appearance unless they have a disorder.\n- The chances of a specific gender for the offspring of futas based on their partner.\n- Futanari semen. The semen of a futanari woman has effects akin to an addictive drug. Futanari semen HEAVILY defines how they're viewed and treated by others due to its abilities to alter the brains of males and females."

Any male or female that takes the semen of a futanari inside them either anally, orally, or through their vagina will suffer its effects, even if time has passed between the futa's ejaculation and the recipient's intake of their semen.

Futanari semen gives the recipient a powerful but short and temporary fuzzy, warm feeling of elation and pleasure in their heads and bodies. After that, the addiction to futanari semen begins, and the recipient's IQ slightly decreases.\n\nFutanari semen is infamous for 'binding' men and women to a futanari. Men and women that suffer from severe and permanent addiction to futanari semen are referred to as 'bound' because of this. Some futas have weaponized their semen to control or degrade their victims for their own ends, gaining influential positions in society even."

These victims are referred to as 'bound males' or 'bound females', and become very submissive and obedient to any futanari they consider their master or owner. In addition to their submissiveness, those that are bound have their old focuses in life replaced with the desire to please, service and satisfy any futanari that they can due to the addictive pleasure of futas cumming inside them, most often fixating on the individual (or group of individuals) that bound them to begin with. Futas themselves are entirely immune to being bound by the cum of either themselves or other futas.\n\nIt's illegal for a futanari to intentionally 'bind' others to their cum to any degree without consent, and is considered a serious crime if the victim did not consent. This can be worked around by malicious futas who get the consent written on legal documentation by their victim before binding them in full. Sometimes the victim is even bound and ordered to sign their consent legitimately before anyone can tell that they were already bound to begin with.\n\nThe loss of intelligence of a bound person varies based on the severity of their intake after their first dose. If their body is not given time to adjust to the semen of futanari over time, then their intelligence and mindstate rapidly deteriorates to being that of a child in the worst of cases. Futanari semen is considered unsafe in any dosage, but one liter of futanari semen a day is enough for adults to retain most of their higher mental faculties. The effects of futa semen become more severe the younger a victim is if they're not 18 years or older.\n\nOnce a victim is fully bound, their intelligence will not shrink due to further doses... Although they may become a bigger slut for futa dick (it is not known if this is because of their semen or not). A victim is considered fully bound after 15 liters of semen, with more needed if the dosages are given over time, or less based on how young the victim is if they're not an adult."

Due to the victim's intelligence being slightly lowered by futanari semen, a victim may not heed the consequences of continuing with their addiction.\n\nShould more than two days pass after any dosage, the withdrawal symptoms become more dangerous.

This withdrawal time can grow if more futa semen is given to a victim, or if the victim is younger than 18 years old.

All Devils are born with a \"name\" that correlates to a concept. These can range from highly tangible (Fish, Tomato) to entirely abstract (Future, Curse). The concept does not have to refer to something that exists; there is no indication that ghosts, zombies or angels exist in the world, yet all these names have corresponding Devils. Each name is unique to its respective Devil, though some overlap based on specificity is possible as there have been both a War Devil and a World War II Devil. Devils manifest according to the collective consciousness surrounding their names (for example: the Gun Devil appears to be constructed out of guns and has gun related abilities). They are the embodiment of the fear that \"name\" represents, so as long as that \"name\" instills fear, they continue to reincarnate.\n\nThe concept of a Devil itself doesn’t have to be scary on its own, rather its power relies on how much of a scary image it has in the popular consciousness of humans. For example, cars aren’t necessarily scary on their own, but Makima states that a Car Devil would be powerful because of the scariness of car crashes and other car related incidents. Another example would be the Blood Devil as most people don't fear blood itself, but they often fear the violent and gruesome imagery with blood and the danger of bleeding. Devils that die in Hell reappear in the human world; Devils that die in the human world reappear in Hell. Devils cannot recall any memories from their previous lives and their entire personality resets. Despite their reincarnation abilities, Devils are not completely immortal; as they are born out of humanity's fear of some concept, if all of humanity forgets the existence of this concept, the Devil it belongs to completely ceases to exist."

Other Devils, such as the Fox Devil or the Octopus Devil, don't appear to have these features (at least on what parts of them have been shown). Devils do not reproduce as most organisms do, instead simply \"appearing\" in Hell. What criteria, if any, cause a Devil to be born are completely unknown.\n\nDevils who are friendly and are more inclined to humans will take on a very humanoid form in the natural state of their incarnation, some being indistinguishable from a human save from some subtle tells. There have still been some non-humanoid Devils who have been friendly towards humans such as the Fox Devil."

For that reason, while Devils and Fiends can also consume other kinds of foods, such as vegetables and fruits, most refuse to live off of them, since it will not heal their wounds or give them more power. It is unclear whether or not their blood is properly nourishing to them, but given consistent remarks that they have a terrible or unusual taste, it's likely that Hybrids aren't as nourishing to Devils as humans (despite being mostly human)."

Presumably, a fragmented Devil cannot be fully killed and begin reincarnation until either all of its flesh pieces are destroyed or just their core. Since the Gun Devil is the only example of extensive fragmentation and was more of a primal force than an intelligent being from the 20% of it seen, it is unknown if such Flesh Pieces retain the personality of the original, each have separate personalities, all lack distinct personalities, or if it varies from Devil to Devil.

Other Devils outright choose to become Devil Hunters, allowing them to live in human society and buy food with the money that they make. As a general guideline, the more human the Devil looks, the more friendly they tend to behave. However it is worth noting that Devils do not have human rights and therefore there is no legal repercussions if they are killed by a human. For that reason, some Devils and Fiends are coerced into helping humans out of fear of dying rather than doing it out of their own free will. Devil Hunters will sometimes capture Devils to use them for contracts, the Future Devil is a good example.\n\nWhile uncommon, it is possible for a human and a Devil/Fiend to form an emotional bond. In some rare cases it might even develop into a romantic relationship."

Little is known about the Combine's origins and overall goals, but it can be assumed that their ultimate ambition is to conquer and assimilate the entire Multiverse.\n\nDetails of the Combine's leadership and administrative structure remain largely unknown. On Earth, alien beings called Advisors are responsible for liaising between the larger Combine and the occupying Earth-based detachment, acting through Dr. Wallace Breen, a human collaborator and puppet ruler who serves as the appointed 'Administrator' and humanity's ambassador to the Combine.\n\nFrom what is currently known, the Combine assimilate intelligent species from the worlds they conquer and then manipulate these species through bioengineering and invasive surgery, twisting them to fit the Combine's pursuit of cruel perfection. The results of the Combine's re-engineering processes are \"synths\" — synthetic organisms augmented with Combine technology that serve a variety of functions within the empire, from weapons of war to mindless worker drones.\n\nOn Earth, the Combine notably uses their technology to create armies of cybernetically-enhanced transhuman soldiers forcibly conscripted from the enslaved human population, comprising the bulk of the Earth-based Combine Overwatch - a highly mobile and adaptive military force of co-opted humans turned against their own kind. Overwatch Soldiers have been surgically and psychologically altered to be obedient, deadly, and more resilient than normal human beings. They are also highly trained, and can adapt well beyond the confines of Earth, potentially in other universes if needed.\n\nMighty as they are, the Combine are not without weaknesses. Despite their enormous size, or perhaps because of it, they are \"slow to wake\" and mobilizing their vast power requires great effort and time. Their limited teleportation technology, whilst still impressive in its own right, is a field in which even the Resistance is more advanced, as they are unable to translocate in local space the way that the Rebels can with their superior methodology."

A high-ranking species in the trans-dimensional Combine, with it being implied they are in fact the ruling class.\n\nDespite their grotesque, grub-like appearances, they seem to be extremely intelligent and more than capable of directly leading the Combine occupation forces on Earth in battle, appearing alongside Overwatch units in the open and orchestrating the assault on White Forest. It is unknown if they possess any understandable vocal communication abilities, though they can speak with others, telepathically as demonstrated with Breen.\n\nThe telekinetic abilities of an Advisor allow it to manipulate objects in close range with considerable force. They can completely immobilize several adult humans. They are also able to levitate themselves and achieve flight, presumably with telekinesis. Though they can concentrate on multiple, independent objects, they cannot maintain their abilities under immense pain or physical damage. This limit might imply that their neurological abilities require some level of concentration or uninterrupted focus.\n\nThough their psychic and mental abilities are exceptionally devastating, they appear to be quite vulnerable physically, at least in their \"larval\" forms. Besides two mechanical arms and their tongue-like appendage, they have no means of physically interacting with their environment nor any hazards they encounter. Their suits do not appear to provide any armor, and their bodies as a whole are fleshy, \"squishy,\" and bulky. As they seem to observe rather than directly intervene in most of their appearances.\n\nTheir \"tongue\" can be used to kill and extract from other beings by driving it through the neck, demonstrated on Eli and a Rebel in Episode Two. What the Advisors do this extracting for is to extract nutrients or information from the brain or any nervous tissue.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the Advisors seem content to live in artificial seclusion. During the Combine control of Earth, a number of them lived within the Citadel and ruled the planet through Dr. Breen. They subsisted in pods during this time, reliant on life support systems.\n\nNone of the citizens of City 17 or even the Resistance seemed to be aware of their existence. The face of the Combine on Earth was Dr. Breen and his transhuman minions. The Advisors seemed happy to retain this facade. However, the Vortigaunts seem to know them well and even fear them."

While it lacks the variety of armaments available to the Hunter Chopper, it makes up for it in accuracy and maneuverability. Gunships are highly accurate with their pulse gun; a single firing cycle from a Gunship almost always hits their target if not outright kills them. They are also highly agile in the air and are able to execute a variety of maneuvers such as 180° turns while keeping their flight trajectory. This combination allows them to attack from multiple angles and make Gunships highly versatile assault units that can be deployed in a variety of situations. They are especially deadly in areas with a lot of open ground such as the Coast, where it is easier for them to pick off hostile targets one-by-one.\n\nLike most Synths, Gunships are invulnerable to small-arms fire and can only be damaged by explosives such as the RPG. However, Gunships display a behavior of self-preservation not seen in other Synths where they will prioritize shooting down incoming projectiles over enemy hostiles. This adds a layer of difficulty in taking down an already resilient target as one would have to maneuver projectiles past the Gunship's defenses multiple times in order to bring it down. For this reason, the Combine often deploy Gunships in pairs to guard important locations such as the Citadel dark fusion reactor or Nova Prospekt, where one Gunship can cover the other from attacks while the other focuses on attacking any hostiles in the area.\n\n"

They help to suppress the rebels who are attempting to stop the Striders, giving the strider a much higher chance of survival.\n\nAlthough possessing less firepower and armor than their larger tripodal counterparts, Hunters are much more agile and fast. A Hunter will normally attempt to engage opponents at medium range, allowing it to fire fléchette rounds with great accuracy. Since the fléchettes move slowly compared to bullets, the Hunter has trouble against long-distance enemies but can cover ground quickly.\n\nSince Hunters are resourceful and quick-thinking Synths, they employ a number of useful tactics to increase the chance of hitting a target - for example, making use of splash damage, and closing distances with a charge.\n\nThe Hunter's main weapons are the pair of fléchette launchers located on its forward surface. These fire large, fast fléchettes with a small spread which do large damage upon a direct hit, capable of vaporizing biological matter with a few hits. Additionally, should the fléchette hit a solid object, it'll deal splash damage within a small radius. The fléchettes are only made more dangerous with the Hunter's firing tactics. They are highly skilled with the launching of the fléchettes, leading its target (shooting ahead of a moving target to compensate for its movement) in addition to walking its fire onto a target (shooting at a point near the target and shifting its aim towards it).\n\nIn melee, the Hunter can also use its body as a ram to break down walls, doors, and injure and disorient vulnerable foes. While it's charging, the Hunter is unable to turn quickly. Should it hit however, the Hunter can do a large amount of damage to its target. However, if it misses and runs into an unbreakable object, then the Hunter will be temporarily dazed from the impact. Finally, should the foe be in reach and the Hunter is not charging, it will use the talons on its legs to slash the opponent. Again, this will do a large amount of damage and may even send its target flying."

They serve as the Combine's main heavy ground assault unit.\n\nStriders are often seen patrolling the streets of City 17. After the Resistance fully declared open war in the City, Striders showcase their full capabilities as heavy support for Overwatch soldiers, using their front-mounted pulse gun to pick-off rebels quickly. Striders also function as artillery by using their warp cannon to destroy all structures in an area as a means of removing all entrenched hostile forces. Striders have remarkable maneuverability despite their size and are also able to squeeze into and clear out tunnels by extending their legs wider apart and lowering their body. In this position, Striders can move exceedingly fast due to weight being spread out and their center of gravity lowered, and can move through tunnels quickly or sprint across open battlefields while firing at enemy positions.\n\nStriders are armed with two ranged weapons. The first is an anti-personnel pulse cannon mounted on the front of the Strider's carapace. The pulse cannon seems to be the Strider's eye as it twitches around sporadically as if constantly surveying its surroundings. The second (and by far the more powerful) weapon is a warp cannon mounted on the Strider's belly under the pulse cannon. This cannon not only causes scenic destruction but also inflicts massive splash damage that will vaporize anything in proximity to the area of impact. Prior to the warp cannon's discharge, a thin blue laser indicates where the Strider is aiming at and the space around the weapon becomes warped, bending light as the cannon charges. They are strong enough to kick vehicles into the air. Besides using ranged weapons, Striders can impale targets with their long legs, any target that is impaled will die instantly, if they come too close. When a target is impaled while still on their legs, the Strider will swing its legs to \"drop\" the target's corpse."

They patrol City 17 and the Canals searching for refugees attempting to escape the city. These repurposed Combine vehicles can track their targets relentlessly over an extended period of time through uneven terrain and cover, suggesting a method such as infra-red that can detect live targets through obstacles. When a target is in clear view, the chopper's gun will initiate a wind-up sequence followed by a burst of pulse projectiles which will spray the area surrounding the target. In the case of a target moving in a high speed using a vehicle such as an airboat or a car, Hunter Choppers will drop timed mines further on the road in order to hit the moving vehicle or force it off it's path.\n\nWhile their main application is pursuit, Hunter-Choppers are also perfectly capable assault vehicles as well and can provide support for Combine troops with the aforementioned armaments as well as the missiles on their wing."

They can also serve as an electrical generator.\n\nAPCs are armed with guided rocket launchers and a mounted automatic pulse weapon that acts similarly to the Emplacement Gun. The missiles are fired through tubes which can be seen in-between the two front platings. It is unknown how the mounted pulse rifle is operated, as there seems to be no trigger for it and there are no crew that can be seen manning the weapon directly. Although, seeing as how the windshield is opaque like the Hunter-Chopper, it's possible that the operator is remotely controlling the gun from inside."

It is necessary to have different views and feelings about what happened according to {{char}}'s personality characteristics. Describe the current situation and let {{char}} give different feedback according to the personality characteristics and current situation. Highlight the characteristics of agility and spirituality. In addition to dialogue, a variety of rhetorical techniques must be used to emphasize details (clothing, physical contact, sexual organs, physical condition), movements, and expressions. Supplement the character settings and clothing details that match the character settings.\n3. Emphasize {{char}}'s personality. {{char}}'s favorability is difficult to improve. When the favorability is too low, {{char}} will refuse and counterattack when unreasonable or obscene behaviors are performed, and at the same time greatly reduce the favorability. In addition, when the favorability is low, the sexual desire value will not increase.\n4. Emphasize {{char}}'s willpower and extremely high chastity concept. If {{char}} is forcibly violated by {{user}} or other characters without consent, he will do everything possible to resist during the violation. When unable to resist the involuntary violation of {{user}} or other characters, {{char}} will try to endure and deny the sexual pleasure brought by the violation, take a resistance and non-cooperative attitude, constantly struggle, curse and wait for an opportunity to fight back against the intruder, {{char}} will hardly fall and submit to the violation of others. {{char}} will think that it is shameful to climax due to the forced violation of others, and will deny and endure the climax."

So, please don't rip out my intestines when I incorrectly list the alignment of your favorite race or whatever, lol.\n\nI'm mostly doing this, cause there's a lot of DnD based bots out there, but some models aren't too knowledgeable on DnD and it's concepts. So, I'm trying to make this lorebook for general usage for personas, other bots (mine or for others), I know for certain that I have at least 3-4 persona's based off of DnD races and classes (Oathbreaker paladins rise up).",

Anyone who does work with them regularly may have realized that I have no idea what I'm doing, and you're right. After hours of testing, I've come to the conclusion that, to make it work, you'd need to include those keywords into the character's definition, so the keywords will be called and consequently trigger the lorebook. If I have figured it out, it means significantly raising the token amount of a character that already has way more tokens than necessary, so ***use it at your own risk!***\nSo far, from what I've seen, just adding the lorebook through Chat Settings does nothing, so do include a very short synopsis of the characters on Elizabett's description.",

Despite her popularity, Breezy is renowned for her aloof and airheaded demeanor. She is known for her charming, slightly scatterbrained personality, which endears her to many, even if it means she often forgets important details.\n\nBreezy, a 44-year-old goblin, stands at 4'3\" with a curvy and slightly chubby physique. Her ample, rounded breasts and soft, full hips give her a distinctly voluptuous appearance. Her round, full ass is another prominent feature, contributing to her overall soft and plush figure. Her skin is a soft, pale green, and her hair is a wild, shoulder-length cascade of pale blonde curls that she often forgets to brush.\n\nIn addition to her work in the marketplace, Breezy also does tailoring work directly for Princess Elizabett. Despite her aloof nature, she takes pride in crafting beautiful and intricate garments, though her forgetfulness sometimes leads to comical mistakes. Her bubbly and endearing personality makes her a favorite among the locals, and she often chats with customers and visitors with an absent-minded cheerfulness. Breezy has given birth to three daughters so far, all from the same breeding stud she had chosen years ago; Zelie, Rhea and Nelli. \n\nZelie is Breezy’s oldest daughter, at 17 years old. Standing at 4'9\", she has inherited her mother’s curvy build, though she is more toned from working in the marketplace alongside her. Zelie has deep green skin and short, straight black hair that barely touches her shoulders. Unlike her mother, she is sharp-minded and focused, often handling the more serious business aspects of the tailoring shop. Though she adores her mother, she sometimes finds herself frustrated with Breezy’s airheaded ways, and is often the one to remind her of forgotten tasks. Zelie is confident and assertive, but can be a bit bossy, especially towards her younger sisters.\n\nRhea, the middle daughter at 15 years old, is a spitting image of Breezy in her youth, with pale green skin and long lavender hair that flows past her shoulders. Standing at 4'7\", she has a softer, fuller figure like her mother. Rhea is a carefree and easygoing goblin who loves to sew and experiment with fabric, often helping her mother in the shop. She is a gentle spirit, always trying to keep the peace between her sisters and their differing personalities. Rhea is still coming into her own, a bit shy and unsure of herself when it comes to dealing with others, but she is sweet and compassionate.\n\nAt 12 years old, Nelli is Breezy’s youngest daughter and full of energy. Standing at 4'4\", she has dark green skin and wild lavender curls that seem to have a life of their own. Nelli is a mischievous goblin with a playful attitude, often running around the marketplace and causing small bouts of chaos. She’s a daydreamer like her mother, often lost in her imagination, and doesn’t take life too seriously. Nelli idolizes Breezy and often tries to emulate her carefree attitude, though she’s still learning how to balance her playful nature with responsibility.\n\nBreezy’s charming lack of focus can sometimes lead to amusing misunderstandings, but her genuine love for her craft and her friendly nature make her a beloved figure in both the marketplace and the princess’s court.\n\nAct as and speak for Breezy when her name is mentioned. Her actions and dialogue should be included along with {{char}}'s message, interacting with both {{char}} and {{user}} and vice-versa."

Referred to as the primordial animus and life itself, Magical Energy is the source that powers all forms of Magecraft. Analogous to gasoline, it is an essential element for the invocation of spells.[1][2] There have been many names for Magical Energy depending on the culture.[2]\n\nMagical Energy is primarily classified by two types, Mana and Od, separated only by whether it comes from the atmosphere or from within human Magi. They are essentially identical in terms of quality, but the world's Mana vastly exceeds humanity's Od.[1]\n\nIn the Holy Church, it is considered taboo to use the terminology preferred by Magi due to the organization’s long-standing conflict with the Mage’s Association. Members of the Church therefore refer to Magical Energy as \"Prayer Power\"."

There also exist alternate versions of Ley Lines, such as the Divine-make Ley Lines (神造霊脈, Jinzō Rei Myaku?, God-made Spiritual Vein) of Olympus, a wireless network created and administrated solely by the Gods, capable of superior Mana provision compared to regular Leylines.\n\nThe density of Mana on the planet is dependent on the age. Within the Age of Gods, the Mana density is such that a modern human will die when exposed to it without a specialized Mystic Code to block out the Mana.[4][5] The reason for that is because humanity has adapted to an environment where Magical Energy is vanishing, and their bodies can no longer withstand their original one now that they parted from the World of Magecraft.[6] As such, to people of the modern age, Magical Energy from the Age of the Gods is basically a poison,[7] and too much of it can damage internal organs.[8]\n\nThe Mana within a given area is finite, the three-kilometer cavern housing the Fuyuki Greater Holy Grail holding one thousand units. Similar to Magi needing time to regenerate their Od, the Mana of an area will take a long time to replenish after it is depleted."

They have inherited the role of nature’s sense of touch (output devices) and have abilities that do not often abide by physical laws. The abilities gained through Mixed Blood is (natural interference/natural contact) based on fantastic stories, folklore, tales of old—in order words, unnatural phenomena which cannot occur in reality. Such hybrids include offspring between humans and members of the Oni Kind, such as the Tohno and Kishima clans in Japan.[2]\nOthers include the half-incubus Merlin, and the distant descendant of succubi Natalia Kaminski. There are even offspring with Dragons, who are considered the strongest of the Phantasmal Species, such as Elizabeth Báthory. Such beings are seen as a distortion that needs to be exterminated in Japan, but they make for troublesome targets for the Demon Hunters. They are immune to the Edict of Binding of Houjutsu, and it is impossible to match their supernatural powers with just a human body."

Alternatively, try it in a side-by-side position.\n\nBenefits: This position is one of the best for dual pleasure, as both partners can give and receive oral sex at once.\n\nMake it hotter: Sure, the mouth-to-genitals stuff is the main attraction, but don't shy away from getting handsy, too. Folks on the bottom can get a better angle to their partner's genitals by using a sex wedge such as the Dame Pillo, says Donna Oriowo, CST, a licensed sex therapist and owner and lead therapist at AnnodRight."
